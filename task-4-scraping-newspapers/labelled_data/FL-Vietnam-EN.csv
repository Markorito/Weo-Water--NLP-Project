The death toll from weeks of flooding and landslides in central Vietnam has risen to 111, with 22 people still missing, Reuters reported Wednesday.

""These devastating floods are some of the worst we have seen in decades,"" Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, the president of Vietnam's Red Cross Society, said in a statement Tuesday.

More than 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and more than 691,000 cattle and poultry have been killed or swept away in flood water, according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA). Sixteen national highways and 161,880 meters of local roads in four provinces have also been damaged.

The country is now bracing for another onslaught from tropical storm Saudel which is heading toward Vietnam after lashing the Philippines, where it caused flooding and forced thousands of residents to evacuate.

The country’s benchmark VN Index soared 17% in the three months ended April 30, beating every major market in the region and almost doubling gains from the S&P 500 Index.

While foreign investors pulled about US$842mil (RM3.46bil) from the country’s shares so far this year, the tide could be turning.

Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR Global. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has raised more than US$350mil.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that – like in many others around the world – has attracted retail punters in droves.

Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

Two storms that hit central Vietnam in the first two weeks of October, Storm Linfa and Storm Nangka, brought six times higher than average rainfall, flooding 136,000 houses and forcing 90,000 people to evacuate their homes. A third cyclone is expected to hit the coast in the coming days.

Worst hit is Hue province, some 700km (434 miles) away from the capital, Hanoi. Police and soldiers have been using canoes and boats in Ha Tinh city to reach the most flooded areas to evacuate people and move property to safety. In this city alone, more than 20,700 people were reported to have been evacuated.

In Quang Binh province, 130km away, flood water continues to rise, swallowing up entire houses or burying them beneath landslides. On Sunday 13 households , about 60 people in total, were relocated, as an estimated 3,000 tonnes of rock and soil came crashing down on homes and roads.

Bulking Up

Vietnam is an “investable market,” according to HSBC Holdings Plc. The flood of local cash has seen trading volumes more than quadruple since the end of 2019, based on 50-day moving averages. The benchmark index now includes 11 stocks exceeding $5 billion in market value, up from just two in 2015. Vingroup JSC has been leading the charge, and the conglomerate is now launching an ambitious plan to sell electric vehicles to the U.S. Vingroup was founded by the country’s richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine. The company started out focusing on property development but it now also makes cars and smartphones.

The stock exchange’s other heavy hitters include a smattering of state-backed behemoths -- Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, PetroVietnam Gas JSC -- as well as steelmaker Hoa Phat Group JSC and Vietnam Dairy Products JSC.

Vietnam’s stocks have been climbing amid optimism its export-oriented economy can maintain momentum after being one of the few in Asia to expand last year. Manufacturing activity jumped in April to the strongest since November 2018, according to a PMI report Tuesday. Equities retreated today, sending the VN Index down 1.1% as of 9:38 a.m. local time, after Vietnam’s capital city instructed school pupils to stay home in order to help contain an increase in local Covid-19 cases.

The country is well positioned as the U.S. and Chinese economies lead a global rebound from the pandemic. That’s because Vietnam benefited when U.S.-China trade tensions spurred companies to diversify supply chains out of its larger Asian neighbor.

“We’ve been positive on Vietnam for a number of years. They are a clear beneficiary of China-U.S. trade tensions and their handling of the pandemic has been among the best examples globally,” said Jeff Gill, who helped manage about $10.9 billion of assets at City of London Investment Management as of Dec. 31.

Waiting Room

Part of the problem may be that international investors overstretched when they splurged. Foreigners sold a net $876 million of Vietnamese stocks last year, similar to what’s been already sold so far this year. That’s in line with a wave of selling across Asian emerging markets. Those moves look to have simply swelled foreigners’ cash positions inside Vietnam, which are already substantially higher now than they were at the end of 2020, according to Vu Bang, former chairman of the State Securities Commission.

Vietnam’s stocks also faced a setback in March when FTSE Russell decided to maintain the country as a frontier market, instead of upgrading it to a secondary emerging market, citing settlement methodology issues. The State Securities Commission expects to resolve the issue later this year. Investors have also cited foreign ownership limits as a concern that could hamstring the market’s capacity to grow further.

Money managers from Sempione Sim SpA, to Asia Frontier Capital and City of London Investment Management Co. say they are busy looking for entry points. They cite solid economic prospects, relatively attractive valuations, rising foreign-direct investment flows and healthy earnings growth as reasons to be optimistic, while also showing faith in the government’s ability to contain the pandemic.

“I see Vietnam as a very nice compelling growth and stable story for the short, mid and long term,” said Federico Parenti, a fund manager at Sempione Sim in Milan.

Since the beginning of October, central Vietnam has been pounded by consecutive tropical storms and typhoons, which have brought widespread flooding and landslides to the region.

At least 1.5 million people have been affected by flooding and 235 people have died or are missing, according to the Vietnamese government.

On October 15, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink declared a national disaster for the Central Vietnam region as a result of the widespread devastation caused by flooding and landslides. This flooding has disrupted electricity and telecommunication networks, as well as destroying infrastructure, houses, livestock, and crops.

On October 28, Typhoon Molave made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Vietnam. It was the worst typhoon to hit the country in the last two decades.

Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are the two of the five central provinces that have been hardest hit by the recent flooding and landslides. The other three provinces that have been severely affected are Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, and Hue.

To make matters worse, the monsoon season is still ongoing and another powerful storm, Typhoon Vamco, made landfall last Sunday morning in central Vietnam, causing even greater damage. This is the third storm system to pummel Vietnam in November and the 13th to hit the country this year. The economic damage is now estimated to be close to $1 billion, according to the Vietnamese government.

International donations are starting to come in from various countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Japan. To date, the U.S. has donated $2.1 million toward the humanitarian relief effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Vietnam Red Cross Society to assist during the ongoing recovery period.

The financial backing also focuses on USAID’s longstanding investments in Vietnam to help minimize loss and destruction caused by natural disasters. Although the Vietnamese government has been quick to allocate disaster relief funds, its efforts and capacities have been strained also by the coronavirus pandemic. Donations from the outside world will be certainly needed and appreciated.

Local NGOs have been working tirelessly alongside the government to deliver aid to those who have been most affected by the catastrophic storms and their results. Pacific Links Foundation is an NGO that currently supports disadvantaged families in central Vietnam and it has been vigorously fundraising to support families in flood-affected Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Hue provinces.

“Our volunteers on the ground have delivered emergency packages, which included rice, food, life jackets, and flashlights, to students and their families,” said Hong Nguyen, the deputy director for SEEDS, a Pacific Links Foundation scholarship program which currently supports over 2,500 students.

SEEDS and the Pacific Links Foundation are now working on another round of support that will focus specifically on long-term recovery, allowing school children in all eight central Provinces to return to school and provide support for the families that suffered the most during the recent typhoons and floods.

“We will provide packages which will include books and school supplies, as well as computer tablets for students to continue learning through our online learning platform, especially when schooling is being disrupted,” said Nguyen.

Another non-profit charitable organization focused on philanthropic activities to benefit Vietnamese people in need throughout the Central Vietnam region is Da Nang Go. The organization uses fundraising events and direct donations to address the specific needs of Vietnamese people affected by natural disasters, poverty, and hunger.

Presently, the group consists of about 20 local and international volunteers who have been doing regular relief trips to some of the harder hit flood and landslide zones across the region. The NGO recently took a convoy of trucks and cars to Tay Giang district in Quang Nam province to provide much-needed supplies.

Tay Giang experienced heavy flooding and deadly landslides in October and November and is generally considered to be one of the more economically disadvantaged areas of Central Vietnam. The majority of the people who live there are from the Co Tu ethnic minority, a patriarchal rural society whose men raise livestock and whose women are well known for making high-quality traditional handicrafts.

The Co Tu live in small stilt huts which can be easily damaged by storms and landslides. At least 30 families had previously been evacuated from one village in Tay Giang due to the recent landslides.

“Before the last storm came, the government wanted to move them to a safer place but the problem is they don’t want to move anywhere because they are scared and if they die then they want to die in their hometown. They are used to yearly storms but they didn’t know this year’s storms would be so bad,” said Hannah Bui, one of the main directors of Da Nang Go and owner of Hannah’s Restaurant in Da Nang.

“I wish I had more money so I could do more to help these people,” she said.

Recently, the Da Nang Go team assembled 250 aid packages for children and 750 for adults in Tay Giang, as well as presenting some cash donations in envelopes at Hannah’s Restaurant.

The aid packages consisted of water, milk, noodles, dry food, oil, fish sauce, salt, blankets, and notebooks. The money was raised through a recent fundraising event and from various donations by local and expat members of the Da Nang community.

The aid was greeted with smiles by the local villagers and government officials. The team also delivered supplies to two elementary schools and to adults in the neediest villages of Tay Giang. In one of the poorest schools, students are so impoverished that they can’t afford basic school uniforms and some students walk up to four kilometers per day to attend classes.

“When I do charity and I do small things like give candy to poor kids they are happy and smile, and when I give old people clothes and they say ‘thank you,’ it warms my heart and makes me feel good knowing I’ve brightened their day,” said Bui.

Da Nang Go will continue its ongoing fundraising and aid missions to help people around central Vietnam affected by these historically devastating storms and typhoons. Both Pacific Links Foundation and Da Nang Go are continuing to deliver aid packages and funds in the aftermath of Typhoon Vamco.

As much as these local charities and NGOs have brought much-needed relief for affected communities, in terms of food, clothing, school supplies, and direct funding, what is really needed now in terms of the recovery effort is the rebuilding of infrastructure, houses, and technological networks, and a re-supply of livestock to get things back to normal.

6,6,FL-2017-000155-VNM,We must not repeat the Vietnam refugee tragedy in Afghanistan - Military Times,https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2021/05/18/we-must-not-repeat-the-vietnam-refugee-tragedy-in-afghanistan/,"The parallel between the Vietnam War and Afghan War is troubling. In both cases, the U.S. became involved in a foreign war without having a clear picture of what our ultimate objective was. We largely took over the direction of each war from a corrupt host government. Many citizens of our host country placed reliance on the U.S. to provide for their safety, come what may. The war became unwinnable because of a series of unfortunate decisions. Losing interest in the endeavor, we shaped settlement terms the host government was required to accept, intimating we would be there to help if worse came to worst. Here, the similarity ends, for now.

In the case of Vietnam, even though we knew weeks beforehand that the fall of South Vietnam was imminent, we made no concerted effort to extract the Vietnamese who had steadfastly supported the U.S. When their government fell, many thousands who had helped, trusted and relied upon us were murdered or incarcerated to the great dishonor of our nation. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the south and, although we gave many of them sanctuary, our help was slow in coming. The final chapter in Afghanistan has yet to be written, but it must not end up with a betrayal of our friends.

During the long and tortured course of America’s war in Afghanistan, many Afghans stepped forward at their great peril to serve and help protect our military personnel. As we withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban have stepped up their violent attacks and the danger to our friends has dramatically increased. We are morally obligated to provide them sanctuary within our borders.

There are two special immigrant visa (SIV) programs in place to bring our Afghan friends to the U.S., but they are mired in red tape — it takes up to three years to process an application. There is a backlog of nearly 19,000 SIV applicants, with about 50,000 family members. They are waiting in line, living in fear of death. There are not enough slots to take care of the backlog. The vetting process is understaffed, underfunded and overly burdensome.

In this crisis situation, there are two feasible alternatives — either review existing documentation in the files and grant visas to those who U.S. personnel have credibly vouched for in the files, or extract the SIVs and families from Afghanistan and complete any necessary vetting in a safe location. We processed South Vietnamese refugees at U.S. military bases in the late 1980s.

We need, also, to consider the plight of Afghans who don’t qualify for SIV status. A Taliban take-over, which appears increasingly likely, will create a flood of refugees, fleeing for their very lives. Being partially responsible for their plight, we are honor bound to provide sanctuary for many of them, just as we eventually did for those fleeing Vietnam. We should plan to evacuate Afghans who will be targets of Taliban reprisal — uncorrupted government and military officials, women’s rights advocates, educators, democracy advocates and the like.

Like many troops who served in America’s wars, this issue is very personal for me. I lived and worked with South Vietnamese soldiers in 1968-1969. I trusted them with my life, while they relied on the U.S. government as a friend and ally. Most of my Vietnamese friends were Catholics who moved from North Vietnam to Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam in 1954 to escape persecution. They were fiercely anti-communist and pro-American. It broke my heart when the communists took over in April 1975, knowing that my friends would be killed or imprisoned, as were many thousands of their countrymen. We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate. We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us.

7,7,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes.

Today, while in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced the United States is providing an additional $2 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to Typhoon Molave and the ongoing severe flooding that has affected Central Vietnam since early October. This amount brings the total humanitarian assistance from the U.S. Government for people touched by the floods to $2.1 million.

With this new funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is ramping up efforts to meet emergency needs in communities affected by Vietnam’s historic typhoon season. Typhoon Molave, which made landfall in Central Vietnam on October 28, 2020, is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. Typhoon Molave follows weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1.5 million people and killed more than 130.

In response, USAID’s partners, including the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC), are addressing the immediate needs of the affected families for food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Because the floods have washed away livestock, farms, and infrastructure, USAID’s partners also will provide assistance to these families as they begin to restore their livelihoods.

This assistance builds on USAID’s long-term investments in Vietnam to reduce the risk and impact of disasters. With funding from USAID, for example, the VNRC has been on the front lines in responding to the impact of severe weather throughout this typhoon season.

The United States stands with the people of Vietnam during this difficult time.

Vietnam’s flood death toll rose to at least 23 and authorities said the incoming storm Nangka would dump more heavy rain on the country in the coming days.

The floods also left at least 14 people missing in Vietnam’s central provinces, the government said in a statement on Monday.

Most of the victims were washed away by floodwaters, the national disaster management authority said, adding local authorities evacuated nearly 46,000 people from affected areas.

The floods have inundated more than 109,000 homes and 1,443 acres (584 hectares) of crops and damaged roads and bridges, the agency added.

A military helicopter rescues sailors from a submerged ship at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri province [Ho Cau/Reuters] Separately, a landslide on Monday reportedly buried 13 construction workers at a hydropower dam in the central province of Thua Thien Hue.

According to weather forecasters, water levels will keep rising, swelling rivers and submerging more communities in the region, the state-owned Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.

The situation worsened over the weekend when Tropical Storm Linfa, which weakened to a depression when it hit the country, brought more rain to the region.

Torrential rains have flooded central Vietnam and killed dozens since last week [Ho Cau/Reuters] “We received a report saying that between 10 and 13 workers have been buried in a landslide and we don’t know if they are still alive,” a disaster management official in Thua Thien Hue province told Reuters news agency by telephone.

Soldiers were deployed to the area to rescue the workers, said the official, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

“We are concerned that the incoming storm will worsen the flood situation,” the official said.

Storm Nangka, which is forecast to make landfall in northern Vietnam on Wednesday, will trigger heavy rain of up to 400 millimetres (16 inches) in parts of northern and central Vietnam from Wednesday through Friday, the national weather agency said.

Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding because of its long coastline. Natural disasters – predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms – killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.","Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-11T143755Z_682429121_RC2EGJ9EKRCW_RTRMADP_3_VIETNAM-FLOODS.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'rises', 'official', 'death', 'flood', 'nangka', 'dumps', 'workers', 'province', 'rain', 'central', 'floods', 'agency', 'country', 'toll']", ,flood

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Vietnam and local people’s generosity. Luu Thi Phuong , 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.“Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children,” she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.“I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDP’s 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet. UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.“Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam,” she said.“However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.”Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last year’s floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.”Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.“It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life,” he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: “I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).“In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households,” said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing. At least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or collapsed./.","Tue, 04 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://en.vietnamplus.vn/favicon.ico,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'receive', 'storms', 'nam', 'quang', 'residents', 'undp', 'nams', 'central', 'support', 'house', 'houses', 'safe']", ,flood
11,11,FL-2017-000155-VNM,How flood protection can paradoxically put people at risk - Horizon,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/how-flood-protection-can-paradoxically-put-people-risk.html,"Professor Jeroen Aerts, a hydrologist at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in The Netherlands, says that when a city builds a defensive wall or dyke, it can make its citizens feel so secure that they actually flock to live or to develop businesses in the protected area. What’s more, they don’t bother to install their own flood protection.

This means that when rare – but inevitable – extreme flooding occurs the damage can be colossal.

It is just one way in which flood protection modellers may be underestimating – and sometimes overestimating – the true consequences of sea level rise, says Prof. Aerts. And it is happening because physical scientists are failing to integrate human behaviour into their models.

Prof. Aerts leads a team that is trying to change this using the technique of agent-based modelling which attempts to reproduce complex phenomena like human behaviour. They use software that creates autonomous decision-making entities called agents, each of which assesses its situation and makes a decision based on a set of rules that have been drawn from survey data and decision theory.

Last year, they published a paper that underlined the problem of the safe development paradox. By modelling what is known about how humans behave when governments install flood protection where they live and work, the team demonstrated that ‘the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas.’

But the study went on to show that governments could ‘largely counteract’ this effect if they simultaneously promoted policies that encourage people to flood-proof their buildings.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’ Prof. Jeroen Aerts, Vrije University, The Netherlands

Migration

Prof. Aerts believes that the failure of physical scientists to take human behaviour into account may also have led them to misjudge the degree to which flooding will drive migration. What’s more, it means they are not identifying precisely where it would be best to target help, because the models don’t distinguish adequately between those who will manage to look after themselves and those who won’t.

Sea level rise will, it is commonly predicted, displace 187 million people by 2100. But the figure, which comes from a 2011 study, is controversial.

‘Most modelling studies that deal with flooding risk or sea level rise use a top-down approach,’ said Prof. Aerts. ‘You have long-term scenarios – like how many centimetres is sea level going to rise, and what will the exposed population be … and you try to estimate the impact.’ Then, he said, the models are rerun to include the effects of various adaptation measures, such as dykes or managed retreat, after which researchers do a cost-benefit analysis.

But, Prof. Aerts said, ‘they forget about (asking) what is the probability that this dyke will be built? Or what is the probability that people will retreat? So they do not take into account the human behavioural factor which determines whether or not this measure will be implemented.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’

Factors that get ignored include evidence that people’s decisions to migrate, or to stay and defend their land, vary with their wealth, age, risk perception, trust of government and attitudes to individual freedom.

Social scientists

Prof. Aerts says that his team is now turning the models on their head, in a new project known as COASTMOVE. They are integrating a global coastal flood risk model with an agent-based model to simulate how governments, private sector actors such as insurance companies, and individuals act and influence each other.

Another difference is that social scientists are feeding data into the project.

‘They provide me with the information about under what conditions are people going to implement a certain measure, from the individual level to the higher aggregate government level,’ said Prof. Aerts.

Some of this information is from pre-existing surveys on what drives people to migrate or otherwise respond to floods. The rest will be gathered from new surveys in six coastal areas in France, Ghana, the Marshall Islands, the United States, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Other, less traditional sources of information will come from data already collected via mobile phones, Twitter posts and even tax returns.

They will use data from Bangladesh, for example, where other researchers have been able to discover, from anonymised mobile phone data, how many people have fled from floods, where they travelled, and how soon they returned. They will also use data that Prof. Aerts has gathered over the last six years using algorithms to monitor tweets that mention the word ‘flood’, in 20 different languages. This provides daily flood maps that give ‘a pretty good idea of where we can expect most of the problems’, he said.

More data is coming from the United States where it has been possible to draw conclusions about migration after flooding from the location from which people have filed their annual tax returns.

Vulnerabilities

By simulating adaptive behaviour, the team hopes to provide more refined predictions about the degree to which sea level rise will cause migration – in the form of 1x1km2 global migration maps.

Dr Bina Desai, head of policy and research at the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, says that sea level rise will bring a variety of direct and indirect impacts, which will affect people differently depending on factors such as inequality and poverty, that are not adequately reflected in models.

‘What’s needed, if we think about risk of migration and displacement, is modelling with a less strong focus on the hazard and a stronger focus on underlying vulnerabilities and what exacerbates them,’ she said.

‘In principle, it’s the only way to do it,’ Dr Desai said of COASTMOVE’s approach. Even as a conceptual model, she adds, it will help to work out how the many factors interrelate.

‘The downside is to move beyond the conceptual model,’ she added. ‘If you want to translate that into numbers then (when we have tried it) we found we failed because all the inputs could not be populated with data.

‘But if they can find a way of doing it by (collecting enough data), using proxies and making assumptions and somehow modelling it out then I think that’s great.’

Just how are our seas changing and rising with climate change and the melting of Earth’s ice caps? This is the final story in a three-part series looking at the past, present and future of extreme sea level rise. In part one, we looked at what the last interglacial can tell us about extreme sea level rise and in part two we looked at rise of atmospheric ‘meteotsunamis’.

i. Deliver immediate, life-saving assistance to those in the most urgent need, in support of the Government response and in line with Government requests for assistance.

ii. Ensure the most vulnerable people, including women and children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and LGBTIQ persons, are protected against violence and have equal access to humanitarian assistance and services without discrimination.

iii. Prevent the outbreak of communicable diseases and effectively monitor risks to the health of the affected population, including the nutrition status of vulnerable people such as pregnant and lactating women and children under five years of age. Deliver assistance in a manner that minimises the risk of COVID-19 for disaster-affected people.

iv. Ensure access to multi sectoral assistance and re-establish critical services. Promote the repair of key public service infrastructure in affected provinces, ensure food security, by restoring lost food stock, livestock and livelihoods, ensure access to sustainable drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene supplies, housing, replacement of productive assets and household items, and access to basic medical, social and public services to support the affected population transition to recovery and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

On 13 October, the Government of Viet Nam released a call for emergency relief and support following four tropical cyclones and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which combined have caused severe and widespread flooding, landslides, storm surge and strong winds since 6 October. As of 28 October, 214 people have reportedly been killed or are missing, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). An estimated 7.7 million people live in areas affected by flooding caused by the multiple storms, with some 1.5 million people in nine provinces directly affected and approximately 380,000 houses flooded, damaged or destroyed. Of those people directly affected by the current disaster, some 753,000 are women and girls, 134,000 are children under five, and 143,000 are over 65 years old.

On the morning of 11 October, Tropical Storm Linfa (Storm No. 6) made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Viet Nam, resulting in 150 to 300 mm of rain. This was followed on 14 October by Tropical Storm Nangka (Storm No. 7) which made landfall in northern Viet Nam, but also brought a further 150 mm of rain to the still flooded provinces of central Viet Nam. On 16 October, tropical depression INVEST 94W in the East Sea weakened into a low-pressure area and made landfall in the central provinces, and was subsequently followed by Tropical Storm Saudel (Storm No. 8) which made landfall in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces on 25 October. On 28 October, Tropical Cyclone Molave (Storm No. 9) made landfall in approximately the same area as Tropical Storm Linfa, with up to 700 mm of rain reported in Nghe An and Ha Thinh provinces and up to 400 mm of rain in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces.

In Quang Ngai province, some 17,000 people were evacuated because of the strong winds and rain. Between 5 and 20 October, VNDMA reported that many areas in central Viet Nam recorded a total rainfall of more than 2,400 mm, and in some locations, flood waters exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1979 and 1999.

As of 29 October, nine provinces have been affected by the cumulative impacts of the multiple storms including Tropical Cyclone Molave. These are, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Nghe An, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum provinces, with Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces most severely affected.

Following Tropical Cyclone Molave, more than 88,000 houses and 50 schools had their roofs blown off, the majority in Quang Ngai province, and some 375,000 people were evacuated to evacuation centres. Those in the evacuation centres are amongst the most vulnerable having had their houses damaged or destroyed and having lost key household items in the floods. Many of the evacuation centres are overcrowded, do not have access to sufficient basic facilities such as water and sanitation, and health care, and lack appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children.

As well as damage to houses, some 30,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged (including rice, other crops, and aquatic products) and more than 2 million cattle and poultry have been killed. This is likely to have severe impacts on food security and livelihoods, especially for those people who were already experiencing adverse economic impacts due to COVID19. Further, more than 360 schools have been flooded and damaged, with detrimental impacts on children’s ability to continue accessing education. In addition, more than 78 health centres and hospitals have also been damaged or flooded.

To date, the delivery of assistance has been hampered by extensive damage to public transportation infrastructure. VNDMA reports that more than 165 km of national highway, 140 km of local roads and three bridges have been heavily damaged. Rescue teams are accessing affected areas by boat to deliver relief items and to evacuate vulnerable people, prioritizing children, people with disabilities and elderly people. Communication has also been hampered by the loss of electricity in many affected areas.

The areas most severely affected by flooding are also those same provinces which experienced a second wave of COVID19 cases in July and August. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, a further thirty days of lockdown measures were implemented from 28 July to 5 September, with adverse socio-economic impacts for the region which already records higher than national average multidimensional poverty rates. As a consequence of COVID-19 related measures, the most vulnerable people had already had their coping capacities eroded prior to this current disaster and are thus in more acute need of immediate assistance to help them manage the current, compound crisis.

From 20 and 23 October, joint GovernmentUN-NGO assessments were undertaken in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai provinces. Key findings from the assessments include the need for emergency food assistance for 177,000 of the most vulnerable people, restoration of agricultural land, safe access to clean water and sanitation facilities including in health centres and schools, the provision of dignity kits for women and girls, provision of education supplies and alternative learning solutions to ensure continuity of learning, support for those people evacuated from their homes, repairs for damaged houses, replacement of basic household items, health support especially maternal and child health, risk communication activities, provision of micro nutrients and continuation of nutrition activities to prevent an increase in rates of malnutrition.

Protection has been identified as a key need in this response, including the immediate need to ensure protection and safeguards for women and children currently living in evacuation centres. Partners involved in the development of this plan have also highlighted the need to provide assistance in a gender-responsive manner that addresses the specific needs of women and girls. The Government has requested that all relief activities target the most vulnerable people, including poor, near poor, people living with disabilities, children, femaleheaded households and elderly people, which are the target populations for this response plan.","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/VNM-ResponsePlan-201031-051%20%281%29.jpg?itok=QHnLLURt,"['plan', 'response', 'nam', 'quang', 'provinces', '2020', 'viet', 'tropical', 'floods', 'affected', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'assistance', 'storm', 'including']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The lower Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam) experienced prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020 until early December 2020. This was due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka as well as tropical depression INVEST 94W. The three wind systems made landfall in Vietnam but brought along heavy rain to the rest of the lower Mekong region. Tropical storm Linfa made landfall on 11 October 2020, tropical storm Nangka made landfall on 14 October 2020 whilst tropical depression INVEST 94W made landfall on 16 October 2020.

The rainfall brought by the wind systems resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in southern Lao PDR. As of 20 October 2020, nine districts in three provinces of Salawan, Savannaket and Sekong were affected by the floods. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Based on an initial assessment on 20 October 2020, conducted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) with participation of Lao Red Cross, it was highlighted that 163 villages in the three provinces, with an estimated 15,305 households (97,514 people) were affected. Savannaket was the worst affected province with more than 10,000 households from 137 villages were reportedly affected in the province and two people had lost their lives. In Sekong province, around 3,000 people were affected, and two people had lost their lives. Salawan province reported more than 600 people affected with five deaths.

Cyclone Molave – the fourth tropical cyclone to threaten Vietnam this month – is barrelling towards the country’s central coast, worsening severe floods and landslides that have inundated parts of the region for weeks.

Vietnamese authorities are rushing to evacuate half a million people before Molave makes a projected 28 October landfall, packing wind speeds topping 110 kilometres per hour. The country is already struggling with intense floods and landslides that have killed at least 130 people and damaged a quarter of a million homes.

The Vietnamese Red Cross has already warned that 160,000 people may need food aid over the next six months, but that figure could rise after Molave makes landfall and its impact becomes more clear.

Aid groups say parts of Vietnam are seeing their worst floods and landslides in two decades. Disasters are common during Asia’s various monsoon seasons, but this month’s flurry of storms has aggravated conditions, with weeks of extended heavy rainfall.

Parts of Laos and Cambodia are also submerged. And Thailand is projecting that Molave's rains will hit the country’s north and northeast.

Before threatening Southeast Asia’s Mekong region, Cyclone Molave uprooted some 25,000 people in the Philippines earlier this week.

Hue, Vietnam – Before floodwater inundated half their living room one night during the storm season this year, the Trans put their most valuable possessions – their TV and refrigerator – in the attic and told their two daughters to take refuge there.

Tran Nhu Hong, 23, and her 18-year-old sister, who do not know how to swim, survived the storms – the worst her generation had ever experienced and the worst her parents had seen in decades.

A neighbour was not so fortunate. The 19-year-old student was swept away in the floods after the vehicle she was travelling in was tipped over by the force of the water – on the same route the two young women usually take.

“Shortly after the water retreated, I went on that route and the vehicle was still there and had not yet been pulled out (of the mud),” Hong said. “I don’t dare to go on that route late at night any more.”

Across central Vietnam, cascading floods from October onward inundated the living and the dead, as record rainfall submerged towns and cemeteries. Authorities said earlier this month that the typhoons, which they referred to as “abnormal”, cost the Southeast Asian country 30 trillion dong ($1.3bn) in damage and killed at least 192 people – a death toll more than five times higher than the 35 COVID-19 deaths Vietnam recorded this year.

Crops destroyed

With 70 percent of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas, Vietnam is highly exposed to riverine and coastal flooding and is also one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.

“There is even more damage after the floods,” Hong said, driving by rice fields made inlets because of the storms and floods in her hometown in Thua Thien Hue Province.

When the water retreated, it took crops with it, leaving behind scarred earth. Many farming families in central Vietnam count on rice, various other crops and cattle for income, especially as the Lunar New Year celebration, known as Tet, nears.

Tet is usually when Vietnamese shop for new clothes, gifts and appliances to welcome a new, fulfilling beginning; but with their homes and means of living ravaged by violent storms, severe floods and devastating landslides, Tet, which will take place in February, is likely to be tinged with sadness.

Hong’s parents are still recovering from the wounds and infections they got from wading through hip-high flood water for extended periods, and have yet to find jobs as construction workers due to the double burden of COVID-19 and the recent natural disasters.

Ichiro Sato, senior associate with the Climate Program and Sustainable Finance Center at US-based think tank World Resources Institute, says central Vietnam was battling extreme weather events long before climate change started to take effect.

“If governments have not been well-prepared even for the conventional risk of weather-related disasters that existed before climate change – and I am afraid that is the case for Central Vietnam – then there are so many things they have to work on before worrying about the additional risk of climate change,” Sato said, adding that unregulated urbanisation and economic growth may increase vulnerability to weather-related disasters in places like Vietnam.

The country typically endures between five and six storms and about three tropical depressions a year, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, but in 2020 a total of at least 14 ravaged the country. Seven consecutive tropical storms and cyclones hit the central region between October and mid-November.

Children at risk

According to the UN, an estimated 7.7 million people in nine provinces, including 2.5 million children, were affected – with hundreds of thousands of houses flooded, damaged or destroyed.

“There is no doubt that children are those most affected by natural disasters,” Rana Flowers, UNICEF representative in Vietnam, told Al Jazeera, adding that families’ ability to secure nutritious food for their children had already suffered as a result of the pandemic.

An estimated 375,000 people were sent to evacuation centres during the storms and floods, including about 90,000 children, according to Flowers.

“Many of the evacuation sites were overcrowded, did not have access to sufficient water and sanitation and healthcare, and lacked appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children,’’ Flowers said, adding that the situation severely affected the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children.

A study brief published in August by the US-based Society for Research in Child Development showed that children may suffer longer-term physical and psychological deficits than adults, including difficulty sleeping or concentrating and losing interest in their usual activities – chronic mental health symptoms have been observed among children as long as four years after a disaster.

Deforestation, which affects the ability of the land to retain water, also contributed to the flooding and a series of severe landslides during the stormy season, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said at a legislative National Assembly meeting last month.

Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam lost 657,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of primary forest – 23 percent of its total tree-cover loss according to data from international monitoring service Global Forest Watch. About 50 percent of all tree-cover loss between 2001 and 2019 took place in 11 of the country’s 63 provinces – eight of them in central Vietnam, it said.

The devastating landslides and flooding have prompted concerns about deforestation caused by the construction of hydropower plants in forests.

As of 2018, there were 385 dams in operation, with an additional 143 under construction, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Earlier this month, the minister acknowledged the increased evidence of the loss of watershed forests and vegetation, as well as a loss of soil adhesion, as a result of the developments.

The government has also announced sustainable and long-term missions to cope with storms in central Vietnam, including upgrading climate-change adaptation scenarios and relocating people in areas at risk of landslide and flooding.

No place like home

For those who have been living in the area for generations, like the parents of 21-year-old university student Le Thi Thuyen, leaving their storm-battered homes seems unfathomable.

“We can be accustomed to annual storms but whenever they come, we are still worried,” said Thuyen, a native of Quang Binh, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the central region.

Thuyen, who left for Ho Chi Minh City to study and is currently an intern at a non-governmental organisation in Vietnam’s biggest city, called her parents and siblings back home every day when the storms were pounding their commune, flooding and isolating homes in low-lying areas.

Tears welled up in her eyes when she thought of her 12-year-old brother who does not know how to swim.

Cemeteries were inundated as floodwaters rose in central Vietnam [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “I read news about kids who got swept away by the flood and I was really worried about my brother,” the 21-year-old said.

Thuyen’s parents, who make a living from agriculture and working on other people’s farms, have already been struggling this year because of the pandemic – and the storm season has created more problems, destroying their crops, and fish. It also meant weeks when there were no jobs to be found.

“Tet this year won’t be as fulfilling as others for us,” Thuyen said. “This time, it won’t be my parents supporting me, but I will be supporting them with what I can.”","Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/000_8V93XX-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'children', 'storms', 'water', 'change', 'pieces', 'central', 'relentless', 'floods', 'parents', 'living', 'pick', 'vietnamese', '2020s', 'climate']", ,flood

By Vatican News staff writer

Volunteers and workers of Caritas Vietnam are visiting and assisting people in the central provinces who have to face the brunt of 13 storms this year with some severe flooding.

The umpteenth storm

In just over a month, Vietnam's central region has seen 7 tropical storms and typhoons, causing floods and landslides that killed 235 people and caused an estimated $740,000 in damage in several provinces. The rain from the storms has caused the worst flooding in the region in more than 30 years.

The latest of these typhoons, Vamco, made landfall in Vietnam on Sunday with winds of up to 150 kph, after leaving 67 dead in the Philippines. The storm has damaged more than 400,000 homes, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. At least 150,000 people are at risk of going hungry.

According to Caritas, the social arm of the Catholic Church, rebuilding homes and recovering their livelihood are extremely important apart from immediate help and survival. Farming, such as growing vegetables, rice, raising livestock and poultry, which is the mainstay in the central provinces, has been devastated. Many families have lost everything in the floods and landslides.



Local Caritas in action

The new director of Caritas Vietnam, Father Joseph Ngo Si Dinh, led a delegation to the central provinces, Nov. 9-11, to survey the flooded areas. They first visited the Diocese of Hu? and its two adjoining provinces, talking to families and providing them material and spiritual support.

Father John Nguyen Huy Tuan, director of Caritas Ha Tinh, said priests were actively involved in bringing food and relief to the affected people and moving them to safer places.

Temporary shelters have been built to accommodate 25 families. A parish mobilised its young people to rescue families trapped in flooded homes.

No one excluded

Caritas Vietnam, in collaboration with dioceses and parishes, has been engaged in social outreach and charity works to help people after natural disasters.

The social arm of the Catholic Church assists people to rebuild their lives, repair damaged houses and build new homes for families who have lost theirs. It also provides people and families with seeds, livestock, water filtering systems, and finance for school children.

Caritas discussed ways to come up with concrete plans or projects to rebuild the lives of people regardless of their religion. Father Dinh has urged Catholics to help every person in need. “We hope that the people most affected by these storms, be they Catholic or not, will get some relief,” the Caritas director said.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/reuters/2020/10/13/14/1602592734645.JPG/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'storms', 'provinces', 'flood', 'caritas', 'social', 'homes', 'central', 'region', 'families', 'typhoons', 'storm', 'victims', 'assisting']", ,flood

On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.

The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.

The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.

On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh 400-500 mm, Quang Tri 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City 1,100 mm, Quang Nam 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai 600-800 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In this period, more than 130,000 houses, mostly in Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue provinces had been flooded, with some submerged by four meters.

Streak of tragedies

Around 3 a.m. on October 8, cargo vessel Vietship 01 of a Hanoi-based logistics firm was swept away by floods and rough seas as it docked at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri.

The ship had 12 male crew members on board when swept off. Four crew members who had fallen from the vessel made it safely to shore on October 9 and 10. One member, aged 45, had also jumped into the water but went missing before his body was retrieved on October 11.

Heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas derailed rescue efforts and the vessel sank to the bottom in shallow waters, leaving the rest of the crew and one fisherman, part of a rescue squad, stranded at sea.

It took rescue teams three days to reach the stranded vessel.

""It was difficult for modern vessels to reach the stranded ship so we had to rely on rudimentary boats and experienced fishermen for the mission,"" explained Colonel Le Van Phuong, head of Quang Tri Border Guard.

On the morning of October 11, the fisherman and a crew member jumped into the water and battled their way back through the rough seas and strong waves. Two teams of rescuers rushed to deliver them safely to shore.

Within the same day, a military helicopter was sent to the scene to rescue the remaining six crew members stuck on the vessel. Two days after he was rescued, however, ship captain Nguyen Van Bao, 51, passed away due to multiple organ failure and sepsis.

At midnight on October 12, a hill collapsed onto an operation center of Rao Trang 3 Hydropower Plant, located deep in a jungle of Phong Xuan Commune, Phong Dien District in Thua Thien-Hue.

The landslide buried 17 workers after 40 others escape to a nearby plant, called Rao Trang 4.

The story of the 17 workers is even more tragic since a 21-member rescue team that had set out to verify reports of their predicament got struck by the same calamity.

At midnight the next day, a landslide had buried the ranger station housing the entire rescue team. Only eight members managed to escape, with the remaining 13 confirmed dead, including Major General Nguyen Van Man, deputy commander of the 4th Military Region of Vietnam People's Army. The bodies of the 13 victims have all been found and identified, though only five of the 17 workers' bodies have been retrieved.

During funeral procedures for the 12 soldiers and their deputy commander, another landslide struck a barracks housing 27 personnel of Defense Economics Division 337, also managed by the 4th Military Region.

The division had been assigned to assist five remote communes in Huong Hoa District of Quang Tri, which borders Laos, in mitigating the impacts of prolonged flooding and landslides triggered by abnormally heavy downpours across the central region.

As the mountain collapsed onto their barracks in the first hours of October 19, the 27 division members were all sleeping, with only five managing to escape. Three more landslides buried the remaining 22.

By the afternoon of that day, all 22 bodies had been retrieved.

Luong Thi Ly, who lost her son Le The Linh to the landslide, said she could not believe he and his comrades had lost their lives during peace time.

New flood waves

And as mountainous areas reeled under repeated landslides, urban and coastal areas were hit by a new wave of flooding on October 18 and 20 due to the impact of tropical storms, the intertropical convergence zone and east winds in tandem with water discharged from dam projects.

On October 18, flood peaks recorded on the Hieu River of Quang Tri hit 5.36 m, passing the record level of 1983 by 0.78 m, while the peak on the Thach Han River rose to 7.4 m, 0.11 m higher than the 1999 record. In Quang Binh, floodwaters were measured at 4.88 m on October 19, or 0.97 m higher than the record in 1999.

For the second flood wave, more than 177,000 households in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri were inundated by floodwaters 1-4 m deep.

Many elderly people in Ha Tinh said for the past 40 years, they had never seen such severe flooding causing such serious damage.

In Quang Binh's Le Thuy District, a family who lost their 75-year-old grandmother, on October 17, had to hang her coffin from the roof of their house for nearly a week to avoid floodwaters.

More storms, floods and landslides

With heavy rains yet to show any signs of receding, Storm Saudel developed in the East Sea on October 20, though it had weakened and turned into a tropical depression as it reached the central coast on October 25.

Two days later, Molave entered the East Sea and headed straight to central Vietnam. It landed over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28 as the most powerful storm to have hit Vietnam in 20 years.

The storm had inflicted economic damage worth around VND10 trillion ($430.16 million), according to statistics from affected provinces. The loss was nearly 1.5 times higher than 2019’s total natural disaster-induced damage of VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), mostly ascribed to flooding, storms and landslides.

Subsequently, the storm triggered heavy rains that had led to more floods and landslides.

On October 28 alone, two different landslides struck Tra Leng and Tra Van communes in Quang Nam’s Nam Tra My District.

The Tra Van landslide buried 20, killing eight and injuring 12 while in Tra Leng, a mountain collapsed on 53 villagers, with 33 managing to escape, eight confirmed dead, and 12 still missing.

One day later in Phuoc Loc Commune, Phuoc Son District of Quang Nam, another landslide buried 11 victims. Seven have since been confirmed dead and four are still missing.

A survivor of the Tra Leng landslide, Nguyen Thanh Son, 56, had lost his wife to the accident. The bereaved husband cannot believe he has lost his family, house and entire village in the mere blink of an eye.

""Altogether, tumbling soil, mud, rocks, water and trees smashed in the roofs of our houses, sweeping everything away until hitting the foot of another mountain,"" Son recalled.

By the night of October 28, more than 4,000 families in Nghe An and Ha Tinh had been evacuated to safety after their neighborhoods had been submerged by up to two meters of water.

The third flood lasted until October 30 and by November 1, had receded.

While central Vietnam residents recuperate from Storm Molave and prior flooding, Storm Goni entered the East Sea on Monday morning, forecast to strike central areas from Da Nang to Phu Yen in the next few days.","Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/02/huu-khoa-tang-le-1-1603267441-7792-8579-1604304150_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'quang', 'central', 'landslide', 'month', 'tragedies', 'mm', 'crew', 'storm', 'rescue', 'day', 'm']", ,flood

A search operation has been launched for a missing rescue team as severe flooding and landslides battered central Vietnam, authorities said on Wednesday, as the country braced for further heavy rain.

Close to a million people have been impacted by heavy downpours and rising waters since mid last week, with more than 200,000 homes flooded, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Thirty-six people are now dead, Vietnam's disaster management authority said, while rescue workers have launched a search for around 30 people missing at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue province following landslides.

The missing include a team of soldiers and officials who had tried to find plant workers who disappeared days ago.

Images on state media showed helicopters and hundreds of soldiers struggling to access the site through thick mud and fallen trees.

Elsewhere across the central region, villages and rice fields were submerged, with relief workers resorting to makeshift boats and canoes to deliver food and bottled water to those stuck in flooded homes.

North central Vietnam was also hit by severe weather on Wednesday as Storm Nangka made landfall.

Forecasters said it could bring further rain in the coming days, while warning another storm was expected to form and make impact this weekend.

The IFRC said it had ""grave fears"" that the deadly floods would worsen as more rain was dumped on hard hit communities.

""These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods,"" said IFRC's Hung Ha Nguyen.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and is often affected by more than a dozen storms each year, regularly bringing flooding and landslides.

More then 130 people were reported dead or missing due to natural disasters in the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. “I wasn’t sad,” Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017’s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tay’s land. “That’s what I had to do.” He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldn’t be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasn’t wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. “Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them,” landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a “soft” levee girding the riverbank. She doesn’t view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. “The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and you’ve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made.” Dao’s mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, “a very sensitive and fragile area where ‘hard’ solutions [to erosion] won’t work”, said Dao, who has studied the region’s ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The “common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land”, Dao says. “Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down.” As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Dao’s words, “by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous”. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tay’s riverbank is like a pillow that doesn’t stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Dao’s green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses — a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, “people aren’t afraid of flooding”, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. “We have learnt to live with the floods,” he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. “Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive,” he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yen’s fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the island’s west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals’ trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the city’s famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes aren’t simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi An’s recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground. Dr Dao Ngo bought her own land in Triem Tay village to do her conservation work. Credit:Yen Duong “Now the ecological component is extremely important. In the past it was culture, now it’s ecology,” Hoi An’s vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local government’s development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. “Of course, it is difficult and it will take time,” says Hung. “Perhaps we won’t succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation.” As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemic’s wake, Hung doesn’t want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the city’s revenue. “We’ve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, there’ll be less to worry about.“

Ecology-based development, in Hung’s words, also means preserving the city’s forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. “If we achieve that, we’ll be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals’ life will definitely be improved.” Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. “You don’t see erosion here, but build-up [of land],” said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. “I’ve never seen these trees die because of flooding,” said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the river’s mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huong’s family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as “a fortune” on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river.

Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. “The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; that’s why they protect it,” Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tay’s sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi An’s toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

Molave hit as the equivalent of a Category 2 Atlantic hurricane, packing sustained winds of 165 kilometers per hour (103 miles per hour). The storm is expected to bring rains and dangerous winds as it pushes over the mountains of Southeast Asia, causing potential flash floods and landslides.

""This is a very strong typhoon that will impact a large area,"" Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said before the storm made landfall

Some 310,000 homes were already damaged from last week's deadly flooding, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), with the organization warning that close to 1.2 million people were ""in severe danger and in need of relief.""

""It is estimated that at least 150,000 people are at immediate risk of food shortages and hunger after thousands of hectares of crops have been destroyed,"" the IFRC said last week.

The death toll from flooding and landslides in Vietnam continued to rise Tuesday, while those hit by the disasters triggered by tropical storms in the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos criticized government inaction and made urgent appeals for assistance.

In Vietnam, at least 104 people are dead in the country’s central region, with 49, 27, and 11 deaths reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam alone, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Control. Twenty-seven people are missing, including 15 workers from a hydropower plant in Quang Tri that was hit by a landslide on Oct. 12.

The committee said that some 90,000 residents of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Tri provinces have been evacuated to higher ground. Nearly 7,000 hectares of rice paddy and crop fields have been submerged, while more than 5,800 head of cattle and 685,000 poultry birds have been killed or carried away in floods.

Vietnamese state media on Tuesday reported that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved the allocation of 100 billion Vietnamese dong (U.S. $4.3 million) and 1,000 tons of rice to the five worst flood-hit provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Ha Tinh.

Meanwhile, the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre said a tropical depression in the Philippines has strengthened into what is being called Storm Saudel. Over the next 24 hours, Saudel is expected to enter the South China Sea—called the East Sea in Vietnam—and become the eighth storm to batter Vietnam’s central provinces since the start of the rainy season.

Tran Quang Nang, head of the weather forecasting department under the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre, rejected reports circulating on Facebook, allegedly citing Japanese forecasters, that Saudel is a super typhoon.

“All of these predictions about Typhoon Saudel are baseless and fake,” Nang said. “The Japanese weather forecasting center and other countries have said no such thing.”

Nang called on the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to “punish” those responsible for spreading inaccurate information on social networks, causing public confusion.

“This issue should be handled promptly to ensure people only access accurate information released by the authorities so they can respond to natural disasters, helping to mitigate the damage they cause,” he said.

In Cambodia, the death toll remained at 25 from a day earlier, with some 40,000 evacuated to temporary shelters, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha told RFA’s Khmer Service. More than 200,000 hectares of paddy field and nearly 80,000 farms have also been destroyed, with more than 500 school buildings and 79 garment factories damaged.

Roads, hospitals, and dams have also been affected, authorities said.

In a notice issued on Tuesday, the Poipet Administration of Banteay Meanchey province, along Cambodia’s border with Thailand, temporarily closed portions of National Road 5. Downtown Poipet saw flooding of homes and roads, which the notice attributed to rains in Thailand.

Sann Ratha, a resident of Kaun Damrei village, in Poipet’s Sangkat Nimith district, told RFA that water levels increased so rapidly that several hundred families were forced to leave their homes.

He said people are stranded and in desperate need of food and other supplies.

“We are under the attack from the flood—our village looks like a river now with water everywhere and houses submerged,” he said.

“The current situation is worse than during the [1967-1975] civil war. We need the authorities to help us immediately.”

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen traveled to affected areas visiting with victims and handing out food. He said in a post to his Facebook page that he plans to spend two days in hard-hit Banteay Meanchey province, where 13 of the country’s 25 deaths have occurred and an estimated 20,000 families have been affected.

Opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha is also traveling to Banteay Meanchey to provide assistance.

Din Puthy, head of the Poipet-based Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association, expressed skepticism over the government’s handling of the flooding Tuesday.

He voiced concerns that authorities appear to prefer taking selfies with small numbers of villagers and posting them on social media to pretend they are helping the victims.

“The victims are not receiving equal treatment,” he said. “Only a few people have received some assistance while many others have been left behind.”

More aid needed

In Laos, where storms have ravaged Savannakhet province in the country’s center, authorities remained unable to access many areas due to damaged roads and a lack of boats to transport aid and other supplies, Lao sources said.

More than 125 villages in eight districts have now been flooded, with many houses and over 10,000 hectares of paddy fields submerged, official sources in the province say. Nearly 30,000 people have been impacted in Savannakhet, according to official count.

An official from Savannakhet’s inundated Phin district told RFA Tuesday that people are in need of dry goods, drinking water, medicine, and other necessities. The official said that while most aid had been distributed it still is not enough.

“In Phin district, 45 villages are heavily flooded, but they have received some help already—they mostly need sticky rice and consumer goods,” he said.

He said villagers with boats had been using them to help one another and that there have been no accidents during rescue and supply operations.

A villager in Phin told RFA that the water level is so high that the local river had flooded homes along its banks and urged authorities to provide more assistance.

“They have helped a little, but it’s very difficult for us,” he said. “Higher-level authorities should take care of this. We’re asking for more rice—all houses need rice to eat.”

Authorities in Savannakhet’s Xonbury district said waters remain high and will rise in days to come, forcing villagers to stay in clubs, schools, and other places set up by the local government as temporary shelters until flooding recedes.

According to the Meteorology Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Laos will continue to endure heavy rains and strong winds throughout the country in coming days. It urged villagers to remain vigilant for flash floods and landslides.

Storm Molave, which made landfall at around 11 am local time on Wednesday, is one of the strongest storms to hit the southeast Asian nation in 20 years.

The resulting “extreme rainfall” could continue over the coming days, worsening the already precarious situation faced by many families, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a statement.

“For the affected populations, their homes remain severely damaged, their food stocks have been lost, they have no access to clean water for drinking, washing and cooking; and water and sanitation systems have been damaged,” said the agency.

Evacuation centres flooded

Thousands have been moved to evacuation centres, which are themselves flooded, resulting in difficult health and hygiene conditions for the displaced people, primarily women, children and elderly. Health centres have also been damaged, leaving without to access basic health care services.

“Added to this is the trauma of the violent storms and rushing waters, that for a population where many cannot swim, creates fear and impacts mental wellbeing,” UNICEF added.

The storm has also damaged vital infrastructure, including electricity and roads, leaving many communities cut off from assistance and protection.

Affected populations

An estimated 7.7 million people live in the affected areas, including as many as 1.5 million who have been “directly affected”, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam said in a humanitarian update late Wednesday.

Of these, some 177,000 people considered vulnerable (poor or near-poor), should be prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance, it added.

Response

According to the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UN agencies and partners are developing and will release a multi-sector response plan, within the coming days, to support emergency relief efforts.

In the immediate term, UNICEF has mobilized to provide emergency water, nutrition, sanitation, education and protection support, it said in the statement. It is also coordinating with Government agencies and humanitarian actors to reach the most vulnerable and those most affected.

Description of the disaster

The central region of Viet Nam was experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimetres of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 150 millimetres of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. Additionally, Tropical Storm Saudel hit Viet Nam on 25 October closely followed by Typhoon Molave on 28 October. Typhoon Molave was one of the most devastating typhoons making landfall in Vietnam in decades. The typhoon made landfall after a series of tropical storms hitting Viet Nam and had caused severe flooding and at least three landslides which tragically resulted in the loss of 40 lives. 44 people are still missing, and six people are severely injured. On 5 November, Typhoon Goni made landfall in Viet Nam and Tropical Storm Atsani made landfall on 7 November. Tropical storm Vamco, was the latest to hit central Viet Nam as it made landfall on 15 November 2020.

The recurrent storms bringing heavy rainfall have caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. The Viet Nam National Disaster Management Agency (VNDMA) has reported that many areas in central Vietnam recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 1,600 millimeters between 5 to 20 October 2020, with peaks of 2,400 millimeters in some locations over the same period. The Hieu River (Quang Tri), Bo River (Hue), Gianh River and Kien Giang River (Quang Binh) have reached historically high levels, and in some locations flood waters have exceeded the previous historical highs recorded in 1979 and 1999. In addition, hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs to prevent them from bursting.

Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Authorities estimate that a nearly eight million people have been exposed to the storms, and some 1.5 million people have been directly affected by the storms and floods. On 4 November, ahead of typhoon Goni’s landfall, 98,819 households (372,631 people) in six provinces (Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen) were evacuated to safe shelters. Similarly, evacuations took place on 7 November in anticipation of typhoon Atsani, and on the 15th November ahead of typhoon Vamco’s landfall additional evacuations have been carried out in seven provinces of central Viet Nam with a total of 93,795 households (324,780 people) evacuated to safer places (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai).

Most of the people who had been evacuated have now returned home after their local authorities’ approval. They are actively repairing their homes with the help of their relatives. However, according to the VNDMA 31,637 households must be urgently relocated because they lost their shelter or their houses which have collapsed or been too heavily damaged, and they are now living with host families. After the latest typhoon (Vamco), according to the VNDMA, at least 243 are reported to have been killed or are missing and over two million livestock have been killed or swept away. The floods have caused significant damage to infrastructure including roads, schools, health centres and community facilities. It is reported that 1,569 schools have been affected included 360 schools flooded or damaged, while 46,916 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people are now in desperate needs of emergency relief, such as safe shelter, safe drinking water, food and livelihood income support.","Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1546577-MDRVN020eu1.png?itok=7nf8va0m,"['vietnam', 'n', 'nam', 'update', 'mdrvn020', 'quang', 'provinces', 'viet', 'storms', 'emergency', 'tropical', 'typhoon', 'n1', 'floods', 'central', 'storm', 'operation', 'landfall']", ,flood

The event also marked the retirement of Emeritus Bishop Paul Nguyen Thai Hop, who reached the age of 76 in February.

Bishop Tuan, who was born in Da Nang and grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, said his late father came from An Hoa Parish in Ha Tinh province.

His father left home in 1943 to study and got married to his mother in 1949 in Da Nang. His mother, who married when she was 16, is 93 years old and attended his installation. She has nine children including him.

I plan to connect family ministry to other pastoral activities to unite local people

Bishop Tuan said strengthening family ties and developing basic ecclesial communities will be his priority as families are the foundation and future of humankind and the Christian church. The solid foundations of family life are undermined by divorce, separation and family members living far away due to financial problems.

""I plan to connect family ministry to other pastoral activities to unite local people, develop the local Church and foster evangelization work,"" the 58-year-old bishop said.

The prelate said he will continue the pastoral services his predecessor provided and “is ready to listen to sound advice from him, local priests and other people to build the diocese and promote evangelization.”

Bishop Hop built firm foundations for the diocese, which was established separately from Vinh Diocese in 2019.

Bishop Hop said during the past two years, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and severe floods, the local Church had repaired a building as the temporary bishop’s house, built the St. Pope John Paul seminary and two centers to hold religious and cultural activities and to provide safe places for local people in annual floods. Other such facilities and three new resettlement areas for flood victims in Quang Binh province will be built soon.

The Dominican prelate, who also led the neighboring diocese of Vinh, said many churches and church facilities in Ha Tinh and Quang Binh provinces had also been erected in the past decade. Local people had suffered war damages, poverty, natural disasters and religious persecution from the government. A lot of churches, parish houses and schools were ruined and devastated.

The diocese’s first bishop said the local Church’s development marks the restoration of local Catholics’ faith life.

He will be committed to cultural, educational, health care and charitable activities

Bishop Hop, who dedicates himself to religious freedom, human rights, victims of natural disasters and human activities, and environmental protection, said the diocese should focus on bringing Good News to other people, offering faith education to the faithful, cementing family relationships and giving opportunities to youths to study further, work for the common good and crave for prosperity and human dignity.

The former head of the Episcopal Commission for Justice and Peace of the Vietnamese bishops said it is painful seeing many youths who have not yet finished high school seek jobs abroad. “What will such people do for the country and Church?” he asked.

Bishop Hop said he had completed his episcopal mission but is still involved in evangelization. He will be committed to cultural, educational, health care and charitable activities and hopes to work with others to serve the needy and disabled people and foster human rights and the truth, good and beauty.

Ha Tinh Diocese covering Ha Tinh and Quang Binh provinces has 145 priests serving 250,000 Catholics, accounting for 13 percent of the diocese’s population.

These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.

Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.

The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.

As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing.

In addition, 150,000 people have been evacuated and significant impacts on transportation networks and agricultural livelihoods have been reported.

USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance partner VNRC is on the frontline of the response and has mobilized rapid disaster response teams established and trained through ongoing USAID disaster risk reduction programs to support evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency response operations, said the ambassador.

""We stand together with the government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones, address the damage caused by this terrible flood, and move forward, as the people of Vietnam have always done. We pledge to assist you in your work to rebuild,"" he said.

""I would also like to express my concern for persons with disabilities in the provinces affected by the typhoon as they are amongst the most vulnerable populations in this disaster. They are often home-bound, have less access to information and cannot take full advantage of preparedness activities and evacuation protocols,"" he added.

It is estimated that the provinces impacted by storm Linfa are home to over 200,000 persons with disabilities, of whom 61,000 are directly affected by this disaster.

Since 2000, USAID, through the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, has provided over $26 million in disaster response, preparedness, and risk reduction assistance in Vietnam.

Through the Department of Defense, the U.S. government has also provided more than $28 million since 1998 to train military and civilian emergency responders and develop and equip disaster management centers, maritime response centers, and disaster shelters at community level.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/17/anh124581602340198-1602931391-3782-3057-1602931440_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'response', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'central', 'aids', 'floods', 'landslide', 'usaid', 'affected', 'linfa', '100000', 'cope', 'provided']", ,flood

The campaign was organized by Ron Haeberle, the American photographer best known for capturing the My Lai Massacre in 1968, with assistance from Chuck Searcy, co-founder of Project RENEW, an organization that deals with unexploded ordnance left from the Vietnam War, according to a Thursday press release.

The funds would be distributed in Quang Tri Province by Project RENEW staff and in Quang Ngai Province by Quang Ngai Red Cross, it was added. Distribution in Quang Tri would begin on Jan. 25, while a check would be delivered by Project RENEW to Quang Ngai on Jan. 15, it said.

""We were moved by the images of mud slides, and water trapping villagers on the roofs of their homes and water roaring through village streets carrying away trees, furniture, animals and villagers themselves,"" Haeberle said. ""I have been committed to doing all I can to help the people of Vietnam ever since I personally witnessed American war crimes at My Lai.""

Last year, central Vietnam, particularly the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Quang Ngai and Quang Nam, were wrecked by a series of storms and tropical depressions.

The resulting floods and landslides killed at least 192 people and caused property losses of around VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion). More than 1,500 houses were destroyed and 240,000 others damaged. The daily lives of around 5.5 million people were severely disrupted.

The Vietnamese government has provided around VND770 billion to the region as emergency relief.

The fully probabilistic model provides countrywide coverage and enables insurers to assess their exposure to floods, which affect 70 percent of the country’s population.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue simulating both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding. The fluvial component of the hazard was developed using state-of-the-art hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate rainfall and river discharges across the river network in the country. Pluvial flooding is simulated using a proprietary, in-house methodology accounting for local climate conditions, soil type, land use and topography.

Offering enhanced flexibility, the model can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves, and average annual losses at virtually any level of aggregation. The model outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk® platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region. “The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon. These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.

Many parts of Hoi An, a famous tourist destination, are submerged.

Nguyen The Hung, vice chairman of the town, said the water level reached 1.3 meters on Thursday morning, 0.3 meters above flood danger level 1, prompting authorities to suspend all tourism-related activities.

Quang Tri, which has the historic Hien Luong Bridge and beautiful beaches, was hit by up to 409 mm of rain in the last two days.

Some residential areas in Lao Bao Town are under three meters of water.

Nguyen Khiem, a resident of Lao Bao, said: ""The floodwaters started to rise from Wednesday night. The water level is 0.5 m higher than during the historic floods of 2019.""

In Huong Hoa District 1,100 families have been evacuated to safer areas, but local authorities said four people were swept away and remain missing as of Thursday.

Many roads in Quang Tri have been blocked by severe landslides.

Quang Binh, home to Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and the world's largest cave Son Doong, received rainfall of up to 338 mm in a day. Many places are inundated and students have been told to stay at home to ensure their safety.

The national park in Bo Trach District has closed itself off to tourists since Wednesday due to rising water levels in some rivers.

Thua Thien-Hue Province, which boasts the popular tourist town Hue, got up to 500 mm of rainfall in the past day.

Prolonged downpours and heavy discharge by dams flooded thousands of homes in the province’s downstream areas.

Many streets in Da Nang, a popular tourist city, were under 40 cm of water on Wednesday.

Central localities from Ha Tinh to Quang Ngai provinces should expect heavy rains of 330-400 mm a day until Sunday, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

The storm also set off landslides and knocked out power lines, leaving 1.7 million people in the dark.



Storm Molave, the ninth storm this year in the South China Sea and the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years, struck coastal provinces on Oct. 28 with heavy rainfall and winds as high as 115-135 km per hour, according to data provided by Vietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting on Wednesday.



Landslides in central provinces have killed at least 19 people and buried more than 40 others, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, adding that the bodies of 12 fishermen missing since the storm hit on Wednesday were recovered on Thursday, leaving another 14 still unaccounted for.



Around 56,000 houses were stripped of their roofs in Quang Ngai, where a massive blackout from downed power lines left more than a million people trapped in darkness as high winds tore through the province, according to state-controlled Vietnam News, AP said.



Wednesday’s storm hit central regions already devastated by weeks of heavy rains, floods, and landslides beginning Oct. 6 that left at least 130 dead and thousands displaced. The floods and landslides also wrecked highways and roads, blocking efforts to rescue and bring supplies to many cut off from help in remote areas.



Speaking to RFA on Thursday, residents in storm-hit provinces described fast-rising waters and devastated fields, with one saying that floodwaters had risen more quickly now than they had during the storms that battered the area earlier this month.



“During previous storms and floods, the water rose only to the height of my hand. But now the water rose so high that my house was submerged,” Hien Thao, a resident of Quang Tri province, speaking to RFA on Oct. 29.



“I lost 500 kg of paddy rice, and many of my household belongings were washed away,” he said.



“Yesterday, the water rose up to the yard of my house,” added 40-year-old Phan Quoc Vu of Truong Xa commune in Cam Lo district’s Cam Hieu village in Quang Tri. “But luckily it began to recede today,” he said.



“In the opinion of my 80-year-old father, this was the worst storm flooding that he can remember,” Vu said.



Calls for help



At the height of the flood, Vu called unsuccessfully to local authorities for help, and even posted calls for help on social media, but finally had to hire canoes to help evacuate elderly people and young children to safer ground, he said.



In Ninh Thuan province, villagers had made their living mainly through farming and raising shrimp, said Tran Thanh Truc, a resident of the province’s Hien Luong commune.



“But the floodwaters washed everything away—pigs, chickens, and shrimp,” she said. “We are glad to receive whatever help others can give us, but it will be difficult to make up for everything that was lost.”



In Quang Tri, supplies including large quantities of rice have been received so far only from volunteers, Hien Thao said, adding that the local People’s Committee has promised to bring relief goods soon.



“I also learned that the government will provide us with seeds for farming our next crop in the winter and spring.”



“We would like them to also give us boats and other equipment we need, along with rice that will help us while we wait for our next crop to be ready for harvest,” he said.



In Truong Xa commune, officials have cared so far only for their own relatives, though, Pham Quoc Vu said.



“They are not impartial, which is causing much suspicion,” he said.



Heavy rains, flooding in Laos



In Laos, heavy rains and flooding from Wednesday’s storm damaged or destroyed around 51,000 hectares of agricultural production, including more than 23,000 hectares of rice fields, across 13 districts of Savannakhet province, state media sources said on Friday.



Total losses in farm production and livestock from flooding in the storm are now estimated at 283 billion kip (U.S. $6,257,968.), Keoodom Souliya—an official from the province’s Agriculture and Forestry Department—said on Thursday.



In the southern province of Champassak, strong winds toppled power lines, while in Borikhamxay province, Khamkeut district’s Napae village was completely destroyed by floods, a video obtained by RFA showed on Friday, with a narrator on the video saying Napae had now become “a sea of water.”



The video also showed floods and landslides blocking the road leading from Napae to the Naphao International Border Checkpoint with Vietnam.



A rice paddy being harvested was also under water, Phetsamai Xayaathichak told local media. “We will announce the exact amount of local damage later, once we know what it is,” he said.



A total number of deaths in Laos resulting from the storm was not immediately available.

The government decided to grant VND500 billion ($21.52 million) to five central provinces worst hit by historic flooding for rescue and social welfare support.

The five provinces, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Nam, would receive VND100 billion each as part of the government’s efforts to help local communities overcome the consequences of devastating floods, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh sait at a meeting in Quang Tri on Thursday morning.

The government also provided each of the five provinces with 1,000 tons of rice alongside medicine and antiseptic chemicals.

Senior Lieutenant General Le Chiem, Deputy Minister of National Defense, said the ministry has provided 22 tons of dried food to flooded provinces. For Quang Tri, military forces also provided seven motorboats, 36 generators and three water pumps for after-flood clean-up work along with 1,000 life jackets.

Chiem suggested local authorities distribute dried food to victims in flood-prone areas immediately and properly.

In the past, the defense ministry found ""some local leaders had given dried food to officials as gifts because it was delicious,"" Chiem said. ""The dried food is meant for flood victims. They are in need.""

Binh said damage caused by floods in Quang Tri was ""very huge,"" especially in the two mountainous districts of Huong Hoa and Dak Rong where infrastructure has been heavily affected.

Therefore, the government has granted an additional VND40 billion for these two districts to cope with the flood impacts.

Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said floodwater started receding gradually, so it is necessary to focus on relief for flood victims, from Quang Nam to Ha Tinh.

Many international organizations have pledged donations of cash and disaster relief to help central Vietnam.

For more than two weeks, the central region has been swept by historic flooding and deadly landslides that caused damage described by government officials as worst in five years.

At least 114 people in central Vietnam were killed by severe flooding and landslides and more than 170,000 houses in flood-prone Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces have been submerged, with many areas currently isolated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/huukhoatangle21603267443-16033-3261-6190-1603358848_1200x0.jpg,"['floodhit', 'dried', 'vietnam', 'binh', 'mln', 'quang', 'aid', 'provinces', '21', 'disaster', 'minister', 'central', 'grants', 'food', 'victims', 'support', 'tri', 'provided']", ,flood

She said the UNDP plans to build an additional 4,000 houses next year, helping 20,000 people gain access to information on climate change and natural disasters, she said, adding that her agency would continue to support Vietnam in natural disaster management over the next decade.

Tran Quang Hoai, head of the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority, said the houses built by the UNDP in central Vietnam were still standing after the region’s historic storms and floods in October and November, which had demolished over 1,500 houses and damaged 240,000 others.

La Thi Kim Ngan, deputy head of the National Institute of Architecture, said that authorities and investors need to create a comprehensive model for housing complexes, complete with infrastructure like electricity, clean water and waste management systems.

Flood resilient houses can become homestay accommodations and help the region develop economically, she added.

Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said his ministry was cooperating with the architecture institute and the Ministry of Construction to develop appropriate and safe housing models to withstand natural disasters.

Another powerful storm is testing Southeast Asian disaster responders after Typhoon Goni crashed into the Philippines on 1 November, before veering towards flood-hit central Vietnam.

Goni, known as Rolly in the Philippines, made landfall on Sunday on Catanduanes Island in the country’s east, bringing violent winds and extensive flooding. The Red Cross says there’s “massive devastation” in some areas, including 90 percent of the homes in villages in one part of Catanduanes.

Philippine authorities are still assessing the total damage, but the government said 11 people had died as of 2 November, with numbers still rising.

The evacuation of at least 450,000 people and early response planning helped avoid a worse outcome, but aid groups warn that the combined hit from a barrage of recent storms and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will test communities for months to come.

The Philippines has been locked in disaster response mode for weeks after previous storms caused extensive flooding in parts of Luzon, the country’s main island. Typhoon Molave, known as Quinta in the Philippines, killed at least 23 people in October; Typhoon Saudel, known as Pepito, struck days earlier.

Attention now turns to Vietnam, which is preparing for a weakened Goni to strike its flood-hit central region around 5 November – the country’s fifth major storm since mid-October.

Typhoon Goni’s wind speeds slowed to around 90 kilometres per hour by 2 November, but successive storms over the past month have driven severe floods and landslides across central Vietnam.

Vietnam’s government says roughly 160 people have died, with dozens more missing in the worst flooding to hit the country in 20 years. The disasters have inundated more than a quarter of a million homes, and prompted a $40 million humanitarian appeal targeting 177,000 people.

The Philippines isn’t in the clear, either. Another storm, Atsani or Siony, could careen toward northern Luzon in the coming days, though forecasters say its current path is extremely erratic.

Floods are common during Asia’s various monsoon and cyclone seasons, but aid groups say the damage has been particularly severe this year.

Typhoon Goni was the strongest storm to hit the country since 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,300 people and led to a massive humanitarian response.

Climate change is fuelling more volatile extreme weather across the globe. The Philippines’ first typhoon of the season, Vongfong or Ambo, arrived relatively early in May; the storm season typically hits its peak in July.

Posting on Twitter, Yeb Saño, who was the Philippines’ climate negotiator when Haiyan struck in 2013, said Typhoon Goni and the burst of recent extreme weather is further proof of a crisis.

“The climate emergency persists and is wreaking havoc,” he said.

Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam.

The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.

The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.

The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.

As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.

Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light.""

Australia is already making ongoing efforts to support Vietnam’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $10.5 million assistance package in June.

Heavy rain has pounded over central Vietnam for more than a week, resulting in floods and landslides that have killed at least 64 people, according to the country's disaster management authority.

""From 2 a.m. until now, there have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,"" local official Ha Ngoc Duong said, as reported by Vietnamese newspaper VnExpress, warning that the situation could worsen.

The bodies of some 22 soldiers from the army camp were recovered early on Sunday morning, according to local media reports. Ongoing rain has hampered rescue efforts. Days before, 13 rescue team members died trying to reach a group of 30 employees of a hydropower plant that had been buried by the landslides.

The rains have flooded nearly 200,000 houses in the region.

Widespread damage

Authorities also warned that river levels in the country had reached their highest in two decades, state media said.

The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides. Torrential downpours have flooded nearly 200,000 houses and 300 schools in the region.

Since storms began on October 6, some 72 people have died and a further 19 are still missing, Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said in a report.

Though Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, which often bring flooding and landslides, this month's disaster has been the worst the country has faced in years.

Neighboring Cambodia has also been affected by heavy flooding in the region. The death toll there jumped to 20 on Saturday, according to disaster management authorities.

Several areas of Vietnam hit by the worst floods in decades. In the last month, torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing, and created hardship for 240 thousand families. Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs mobilized. The strengthening of relations between the two countries can be linked to the US's anti-Beijing strategies.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) - Taiwan has donated 400,000 US dollars in aid to Vietnam to support the local population, hit by the worst floods and landslides in decades. In the past two weeks, storms no. 6 and 7 have caused serious damage in the central-northern provinces of Hà Tinh, Qu?ng Bình, Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên-Hu? and in the central-southern ones Ðà N?ng, Qu?ng Nam, Qu?ng Ngãi, Bình Ð?nh and Phú Yên.

The Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention reports that torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing since late September. River levels have risen rapidly in central areas of Vietnam, flooding 212 municipalities inhabited by 240 thousand families.

Many communities are isolated; at the moment in the devastated areas it is possible to move mostly with small boats. Victims are in immediate need of food, bottled water, medicine, clothing, blankets and books.

At the end of the emergency, money will be needed for reconstruction, especially seeds and agricultural machinery. Many Vietnamese have mobilized to support the flood victims. Groups of young people, including Catholics, brought rice, spaghetti (noodles) and drinking water to the most remote flooded areas.

Richard Shih, Taiwanese representative in Hanoi, said that Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs operating in Vietnam have mobilized and sent aid to disaster areas. He hopes the victims can rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon.

The aid delivery ceremony took place on 23 October in the presence of Tr?n Quang Hoài, director of the Vietnamese agency for the management of natural disasters. The Hanoi representative thanked the generosity of the government and the people of Taiwan, stressing that the distribution of aid will start as soon as possible.

The Taiwanese authorities highlighted the strong ties that unite their country to Vietnam. More than 320,000 Vietnamese migrants live and work in Taiwan; Taipei is Hanoi's seventh trading partner, with a turnover of 13.5 billion euros in 2019. The two nations also share fears about the growth of Chinese power, an aspect that links the strengthening of their relations with the United States anti-Beijing strategy in the region.","Mon, 26 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM-TAIWAN_-_1026_-_Aiuti_ter.jpg,"['areas', 'donates', 'vietnam', 'dollars', 'aid', 'flood', 'taiwan', 'qu?ng', 'mobilized', 'vietnamese', 'caused', '400000', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

Over 11,000 people have been evacuated to safety in central Vietnam which has been hit by severe flooding following prolonged rains.

The entire region has been battered by torrential downpours for the last three days.

Some areas in Quang Tri Province and neighboring Thua Thien-Hue Province have received 980 mm of rain. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

At least five people have been killed, two in Quang Tri and the others in Dak Lak, Gia Lai and Quang Ngai provinces. Seven others were missing as of Thursday night.

In Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, and Da Nang, 37 communes have been cut off as some areas are under one meter of water and traffic has been blocked due to landslides.

In popular tourist town Hue in Thua Thien-Hue, many roads are inundated.

Nguyen Van Khoa, a local official, said around 200 houses are under 30 cm of water and people living in low-lying areas have been forced to move to safety.

Hoi An, a tourist hotspot and UNESCO heritage site, is like a massive lake following prolonged downpours with many streets under 0.5 meter of water.

Nguyen The Hung, the town’s vice chairman, said plans are underway to evacuate people living in low-lying areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Thursday ordered provinces from Ha Tinh to Phu Yen to deal with the heavy flooding and take urgent measures including evacuation to ensure people’s safety.

Huynh Kim Luong was standing in a corner of his home, struggling to find a spot for guests to sit. The pots, pans and clothes scattered around the house were illuminated by the light of flickering candles.

""It has been 21 years since I saw such a flood,"" he said.

For the past 10 days the 60-year-old farmer and his family of three have barely stepped outside. In their Huong Toan Commune in Thua Thien-Hue, floods triggered by heavy rains have inundated over 2,000 homes. The only sounds they hear these days are the thump of rain falling on the roof, the clattering of windows in the wind, and distant hums of motorboats moving through the sea of water.

Like many people in central Vietnam, Luong and his wife Hoa were proud of their ability to live with floods. Since the beginning of this month, Hoa has been stocking up rice, dry fish and peanut on warnings of coming storms and rains. They knew not to stock up on meat since electricity is always cut when a storm hits. They were right.

On the morning of October 9 Luong opened his front door only to see the water almost reaching the threshold following heavy rain the previous night. As the hours passed and the rain showed no signs of relenting, the water started to come inside the house. Everywhere in the neighborhood, people were yelling that the floods had come.

Their eldest daughter, who is in her final year of high school, began to put all her books into plastic bags. Her parents waded around the house to salvage the family’s most valuable belongings like the refrigerator, TV and stove, and put them on a table that is reinforced with four blocks of wood.

Within a span of not even a day, Huong Toan turned from green paddy fields to muddy sea in the afternoon. With the electricity duly cut and dusk falling, the area, now flooded for dozens of kilometers along National Highway 1, slowly sank into darkness.

Huynh Kim Luong (R) and his wife Hoa have not left their home in Thua Thien-Hue Province for the last 10 days amid the heavy flooding. Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Tao.

Also on October 9, in Huong Van Commune, about six kilometers away, Le Thi Thuc spent a sleepless night watching the water rise.

""I say ‘keeping watch,’ but the water will rise anyway even if I’m asleep. But my mind can be a little bit at rest if I watch it,"" she said.

The 54-year-old too has been confined at home for several days.

That night the entire family took refuge in the bedroom of her 85-year-old mother, whose room is situated farthest from the water. Thuc told her three children to go to sleep early, reminding them to turn off their phones to save the battery for the coming days without electricity.

Dung, her husband, shone the flashlight at the floor, sighing. The water was closing in. That night none of the three adults in the household slept a wink.

The local rice milling shop closed as soon as it started raining, catching Thuc off guard, leaving her no time to prepare enough food for the family.

Luckily her sister, who lives on higher ground, helped out, rowing a boat to Thuc’s house to deliver much-needed rice, bamboo shoot broth and boiled duck.

Seeing the family of six enjoying a meal sitting on a bed, surrounded by floodwater, Thuc could not help but weep.

For the next eight days the water ebbed and flowed. The children kept asking when the rain would stop, but the weather forecast kept getting gloomier.

The whole family had to shovel and sweep the mud and sludge entering the house. ""It was like walking in a swamp,"" they said.

Last Friday the water started to recede a little, going down to waist level, and Thuc took the opportunity to go out and buy some fish and vegetables. Looking around the neighborhood after being trapped inside the house for a week, she failed to recognize the place.

In Huong Toan, the situation has been grim. With the water showing no signs of receding, Hoang Trong Hieu, the commune chairman, other officials and police officers have not gone home for the last 10 days.

The group, which consists of over 20 people, has divided itself to take 24-hour shifts at the People’s Committee office to distribute supplies and respond to emergencies like transporting the injured and evacuating people.

Since the entire commune is under a meter of water, all travel is done by boat.

""It has been a long time since we saw our feet,"" a member of the group joked, carrying bags of rice on his shoulder in chest-deep water. The man had given Luong’s family two cartons of instant noodles the other day.

The day before electricity was cut, Luong’s had some vegetables, eggs and fish in the refrigerator, but only enough for two days for the family of three. So for the next eight days they had nothing to eat but rice and dry fish.

""I was given instant noodles but did not dare eat them because I did not want to urinate too much,"" he explained.

Luong’s wife, who had surgery just a month ago, stumbled in the dark and fell one night as she sought to go to the bathroom amid the sea of water. Since then he has been placing pots by the bed and replaces the candles twice every night.

""There are a lot of mosquitoes due to all the water.""

In Huong Van Commune, Nguyen Van Lieu, 63, has taken over the most dangerous task from his wife since the floods came: cooking. He dons his conical hat and raincoat every day to light the stove, standing in chest-deep water.

""If my wife gets into the water to cook, it will come up to her neck,"" he joked, patting his wife’s back with a smile.

Their house was almost completed earlier this year but the roof has not been finished. The family is among the luckier ones in the neighborhood since the water only comes up to the thighs even during the heaviest rains.

But the kitchen is a different story. There had been over 20 bags of rice, weighing over a ton, but everything was soaked the very first night. Vy, Lieu’s wife, had no choice but to give them away to her neighbors to feed their ducks and chickens. She has been borrowing rice from others.

They have not told their two eldest children, who are workers in the south, about their situation, not wanting to worry them.

Like many others, the couple have been trapped inside their home, situated just 100 m from the national highway, for more than a week. Every day Vy would cast her gaze on the other side of the highway to look at the paddy fields longingly despite realizing they must be submerged under water.

A few days before the rains came she had sold her first few gourds of the season. ""They sell well this year at VND10,000 (43 cents) per kilogram,"" she said. She was hoping to earn around VND10 million from selling them all over two months.

But that was before the storm came. She was only able to sell for two days, earning VND240,000, before she was forced to remain at home.

She and her husband have been reminiscing about the historic flood in Thua Thien Hue 21 years ago. The deluge in November 1999 had submerged thousands of houses and paralyzed all traffic and electrical and communication systems in the province. There had been rainfall of up to 2,300 mm in just the first three days. Several people had been swept away and killed during that disaster.

At that time the couple and their children stacked two beds on top of each other and waited for the floods to recede, the anguished voices of people who lost loved ones in the background.

Their son, seeing how his parents had to face flooding year after year, wanted to help them find a safer place to live in, but they cannot countenance moving out of their hometown.

More heavy rains are expected in central Vietnam regions at least until Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Rivers are expected to rise further, as is the risk of floods and landslides. Vehicles continue to line up along National Highway 1 and other roads on higher ground as people park their cars and motorbikes there to avoid the water.

But the people cannot do the same, they cannot just leave their houses. The only thing that Luong, Thuc and Lieu can do is to barricade themselves inside their homes and pray for the water to go away","Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/19/fbbdc0d9e2fe1ca045ef7172160297-3133-2038-1603105515_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'misery', 'rice', 'water', 'province', 'rain', 'thuc', 'floods', 'house', 'amid', 'days', 'wife', 'drowns', 'thua', 'night', 'family', 'continuing']", ,flood

Australia, Switzerland and Thailand have offered aid to victims of multiple storms and floods in central Vietnam last month.

The Australian embassy in Hanoi said on Friday its government will provide an additional AUD2 million ($1.45 million) to help Vietnam respond to the impacts of prolonged floods and landslides in the central region. The country had earlier provided AUD100,000 ($71,300).

The aid money will be used to meet urgent needs like providing clean water and sanitation and hygiene and dignity kits to affected people, and support the restoration of clean water supply to schools.

The Swiss embassy also announced grant of urgent aid worth CHF300,000 ($333,000) to help address the immediate needs of 160,000 people focusing on housing, livelihoods, healthcare, water, and hygiene.

In a phone call to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-o-cha, offered $30,000 toward relief efforts.

The central region was repeatedly hit by torrential rains, widespread flooding and landslides triggered by four storms in October.

So far 235 people have been killed or are missing, almost 390,000 houses were flooded and more than 300,000 families have been evacuated, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority.

Many people have lost almost all their household possessions or had their homes, food stocks, livestock, and crops badly damaged.

According to Tran Phuoc Anh, acting director of the city’s Foreign Department, the sustainable flood prevention project for Thu Duc City would have a total investment of more than $1bn, and would be implemented as a public–private project with the participation of the Dutch government.

Le Hoa Binh, deputy chair of HCMC, said he hoped the Netherlands would help create a city that was “sustainable and well adapted to climate change”.

Elizabeth Akkerman, the Dutch ambassador to Vietnam, said her government would help HCMC and Thu Duc City with advanced construction technologies.

Thu Duc will be based on advanced industries such as autonomous manufacturing, and will include the university precinct in Thu Duc as well as a new-build urban area and financial centre on the Thu Thiem Peninsula.

Thu Duc is the most elevated area in HCMC, but still suffers from seasonal flooding, and its residents suffer from inundation of streets and even houses every time there is heavy rain or a high tide.

In May 2019, HCMC sent a delegation to the Netherlands to study its urban development and flood management methods, and a number of memorandums of understanding were subsequently signed, including a $1bn anti-flooding project in Thu Duc City.

A tropical depression is projected to hit central Vietnam on Friday night, bringing heavy rains as the area struggles to recover from more than a week of flooding.

As of 10 a.m. Friday, the tropical depression was about 290 km to the east of Da Nang and Binh Dinh Province, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Its maximum wind speed was 50 kph.

Within the next 12 hours, the tropical depression would move west at about 30 kph, before making landfall in central Vietnam, then devolving into a low-pressure area over southern Laos.

By 10 p.m. Friday, the low-pressure area would be above the mountainous area of central Vietnam, with a maximum wind speed of 40 kph.

Rough seas and strong winds should be expected in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, within the next 24 hours.

Central Vietnam should expect particularly heavy rain from now until Wednesday next week, according to the center. Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and southern Nghe An should expect a total rainfall of up to 900 mm during the period, while Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and northern Nghe An should expect up to 500 mm.

Da Nang and its neighbor Quang Nam Province, home to popular ancient town Hoi An, should expect rainfall of up to 500 mm, while regions between Quang Ngai and Phu Yen should expect levels of up to 350 mm.

The Central Highlands should also expect heavy rain until Sunday, with rainfall of up to 250 mm.

Rains are expected to persist in central Vietnam even after Wednesday, the center noted.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Since last week, central Vietnam has been hit by torrential rains, floods and landslides after a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

On Sunday, Storm Linfa intensified from the turbulence and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. The next day, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

At least 56 people have been killed, including two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while coming to rescue the workers.

Thousands of homes in the region have been flooded.

Torrential downpours and discharge of water from hydropower dams have caused rivers in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces to swell and threaten severe flooding.

Storm Molave, said to be the strongest to hit Vietnam in the last two decades, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Wednesday morning before weakening into a tropical depression by 4 p.m.

The provinces have been hit by rains of up to 500 mm between Tuesday night and Wednesday night. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In Quang Ngai, the Tra Bong River was flowing above flood warning danger level 2 at Chau O station while the Tra Khuc, Ve and Tra Cau rivers had crossed the highest danger level of 3 by 4 p.m. Wednesday, according to the province's Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

They are forecast to continue rising quickly on Thursday, possibly triggering severe flooding in large parts of Quang Ngai Town, the capital, and several districts.

The release of water by local hydropower dams is worsening the situation.

Dak Drinh hydropower plant discharged up to 1,680 cubic meters of water a second on Wednesday and Nuoc Trong, the largest irrigation and hydroelectricity project in the central region, discharged 1,100 cubic meters.

Authorities hurriedly evacuated people living in low-lying areas and made emergency announcements about the water discharge via loudspeakers to warn local residents.

In Quang Nam Province, home to ancient town Hoi An, the water level in the Vu Gia River reached 9.41 meters by early morning Thursday, 0.41 meters above danger level 3, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, which warned rivers in the province would rise quickly in the next few hours.

Dak Mi 4 hydropower plant plans to discharge up to 11,400 cubic meters a second and the Vu Gia River is expected to rise to 11.2 meters, surpassing the historic flood level in 2009.

Nguyen Huu Vu, a local official, said authorities have evacuated over 4,000 families living along the river.

If the hydropower plant discharges over 5,000 cubic meters per second, 120,000 houses would be submerged under 0.5-1.5 meters of water, Vu said.

The National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said on Wednesday that Quang Nam could face severe flooding in the next one or two days.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung instructed provincial authorities to evacuate people from areas threatened by landslides and ensure the safety of reservoirs and hydropower plants.

The central region, including Quang Nam, was hit by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that caused at least 130 deaths.

The flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated, killed livestock and caused damage the government said was ""the worst in the last five years.""","Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/29/042266ddd73b2965702aQuangNgaib-7340-7528-1603941528_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'nam', 'dam', 'quang', 'rains', 'water', 'hydropower', 'trigger', 'flooding', 'heavy', 'central', 'fresh', 'discharge', 'level', 'ngai', 'meters', 'vu', 'plant']", ,flood

Phnom Penh (AFP)

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to get them to safety from rising floodwater on Saturday in Cambodia's western province of Battambang.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces -- Pursat, Battambang and Pailin -- have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall ahead of the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

""A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,"" Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told AFP on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to worsen on Sunday.

In central Vietnam almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking north Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to sandbag and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

In Laos, rising floodwater has damaged villages and rice fields along the Xepon and Xebanghieng rivers in Savannakhet province with more rain on the way.

60,60,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Guy Carpenter launches new Vietnam flood model - Reinsurance News,https://www.reinsurancene.ws/guy-carpenter-launches-new-vietnam-flood-model/,"Guy Carpenter, the reinsurance arm of global brokerage Marsh, has announced the launch of its new flood model for Vietnam.

The probabilistic model will provide full national coverage and help re/insurers to assess their exposure to floods – a peril that affects 70% of the population in Vietnam.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue that simulates both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding.

It can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves and average annual losses at any level of aggregation.

Outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region.

“The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon,” Gallagher explained.

“These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flooded.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'model', 'reinsurance', 'population', 'flood', 'guy', 'help', 'launches', 'carpenter', 'vietnamthe', 'includes']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

When a northern cold spell entered the intertropical convergence zone over central Vietnam, it caused abnormally heavy rains and flooding in the region.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh got 400-500 mm, Quang Tri got 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue got 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City got 1,100 mm, Quang Nam got 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai got 600-800 mm.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

The entire central region suffered from severe flooding for days, more than 135,000 houses were submerged under 0.3-4 meters of water, and nearly 46,000 people had to be evacuated.

At least 36 people have died due to flooding and 12 are missing.

Nguyen Van Huong, head of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting’s Climate Forecast Office, said intertropical convergence zone stretches from the Bay of Bengal and across the center of Vietnam to the Philippines.

In these areas clouds and thunderstorms often develop, and when winds from the east meet them, there is an increase in moisture content, which means more thunderstorms, he said.

When the zone has favorable conditions such as the convergence of strong winds that moved over warm seawater, a tropical depression forms and then grows into a storm in the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea, he said.

Since October 6 two storms and a tropical depression have formed in this area.

On Sunday Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.

A day later Storm Nangka formed and hit the coast between the northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa Provinces on Wednesday.

""Storms and tropical depression already cause heavy rains. For instance, Storm Linfa caused rainfall of 500-700 mm,"" Huong said.

On Thursday morning another tropical depression formed over the sea and is heading straight for the central region also with a lot of moisture.

According to the center, more rains are expected in the region until Tuesday or later.

A cold spell coming down from the north and meeting winds from the east also caused heavy rains, Huong said.

The center said the root cause of all these phenomena was La Nina, which appeared in July and is expected to last until early next year. During this period, more storms would form over the East Sea and the rains would last longer than usual, it added.

Four to six more storms and tropical depressions are expected to brew this year with at least two making landfall over the central coast.

La Nina is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years as a result of variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It occurs as strong winds blow warm water on the ocean's surface from South America across the Pacific Ocean toward Indonesia.

The French government has granted 1.5 million euros ($1.82 million) to the Mekong River Commission (MRC) to improve and expand its river monitoring program.

The program is to better serve river monitoring and management of water infrastructure project operations along the mainstream and key tributaries of the Mekong.

The Mekong River, which flows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, is the lifeblood of millions of people who depend on the river for their livelihoods. But as development accelerates and climate change intensifies, insufficient data and information on water infrastructure in the basin and the way this infrastructure is operated have made it difficult to forecast the impacts.

The funding, made available through the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), will span four years from 2021 to 2025, the MRC said in a statement.

It aims at increasing the ability of the MRC and its member countries, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, to monitor rainfall and river flow in order to better understand flow changes and corresponding impacts of development projects and climate change on riverine communities and the environment, especially water quality, sediment, and fisheries.

""We hope to strengthen the current river monitoring system, making it more efficient, reliable and capable of collecting and transmitting real-time rainfall, water level, and other environmental data to aid responsible development and management of the river,"" said An Pich Hatda, MRC secretariat CEO.

The new funding is a follow-up to two other grants of 4 million euros from France for the first two phases of the hydro-meteorological network project.

During the first phase from 2007 to 2012, the MRC established a network of 49 hydro-meteorological stations along the Mekong and its tributaries to collect near real-time data of water level and rainfall every 15 minutes for flood forecasting and river monitoring.

For the second phase from 2016 to 2022, the MRC has expanded the network with 11 additional stations along the mainstream and improved the understanding of river dynamics and the application of data for other areas of water resources management.

Since 2006, France has granted the MRC over 10 million euros to support river monitoring, flood and drought management, climate change, and environmental management.","Mon, 17 May 2021 09:28:52 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2021/05/17/mekongriver-1621241607-1621241-2570-5590-1621242044_1200x0.jpg,"['water', 'france', 'program', 'management', 'aids', 'thailand', 'river', 'rainfall', 'monitoring', 'mekong', 'mrc', 'million', 'data']", ,flood_and_drought

The number of patients with melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, has increased sharply at a major hospital in the central region following the prolonged flooding.

Since early October Hue Central Hospital in Thua Thien-Hue Province has admitted 28 people with the disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia Pseudomallei, which infects both humans and animals.

Around half the patients are from Thua Thien-Hue and the rest are from other central provinces like Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri, the province's news website reported.

The hospital is one of three biggest and most advanced general hospitals in Vietnam along with others in Hanoi and HCMC.

It said many of the patients came for treatment only after the disease had become serious, causing sepsis and multi-organ failure and threatening their life.

On November 14 a Quang Binh Province official died of the disease at the hospital.

Phan Thanh Mien, people’s committee chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trach District, had spent days in floodwaters in October managing relief efforts. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee, but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items in inundated areas.

The hospital had treated 83 people with the disease between 2014 and 2019 and 11 in the first nine months of this year.

It said the rise in the number of infections since early October is closely related to the floods that ravaged the central region throughout October and in November.

Various studies around the world have found that melioidosis occurs only in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, with outbreaks occurring after floods and typhoons.

In October central Vietnam was hit by floods thrice.

Melioidosis patients have symptoms like fever, pneumonia and abscesses in and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate is around 40 percent.

The disease was first diagnosed in Vietnam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country.

There are around 10,000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, around half of which prove fatal.

After devastating storms and floods, the airline worked to transport thousands of aid packages to help areas in central Vietnam.

Aid transportation

Vietnam Airlines flew over 24 tons of goods and more than 2,000 packages from organizations like the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee, the Red Cross, and individual donations, among others, to support operations in central Vietnam in cities like Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi.

This is just part of Vietnam Airlines’ aid operations. The airline is expecting to fly more than 100 tons of cargo to support relief operations.

Vietnam Airlines, along with its affiliates, is receiving and transporting goods to Central Vietnam free of charge.

For passengers, Vietnam Airlines is also giving people to Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi one extra free bag in addition to their class of service baggage allowance. This will allow passengers to also fly with additional relief items or essential items.

Vietnam Airlines is expecting to fly over 10,000 pieces of luggage free of charge. This will help those who are bringing relief items to the region.

Central Vietnam is facing awful flooding

Devastating floods, some of the most severe in decades, according to CNN, have claimed over 100 lives and led to immense destruction. Over 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and over 691,000 cattle and poultry have either been killed or swept away. Hundreds of thousands of meters of roadways have also been damaged.

In addition to the flooding, landslides have also caused deaths and damage. However, Vietnam, which is no stranger to rain and typhoons, became overwhelmed after facing a particularly fierce set of storms.

Relief agencies rely on airlines to help transport goods and people. Another set of storms is, including a tropical storm, made its way to Vietnam this last weekend as well.

For the flag carrier of Vietnam, it was now time to step up and fly relief. After facing some operational disruptions due to the storm, the carrier became one lifeline to bring much-needed supplies to the region.

Airlines and aid flights

Over the last few months, aid flights have become common when it came to transporting medical supplies. However, airlines are no strangers when it comes to running aid and relief flights.

Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines partnered to send 20,000 pounds of aid on a brand new Boeing 787. Emirates has flown tens of thousands of kilograms of aid to Lebanon since a blast rocked Beirut.

Flag carriers, in particular, tend to step up when the country needs airlines to fly in (or fly out) people and supplies. Vietnam Airlines has used aircraft, like the ATR 72, to fly in aid.

Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri.

At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnam’s Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.

A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.

They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.

For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.

At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday.

Saudel is the eighth storm in the East Sea this year, and follows Linfa and Nangka earlier this month.

Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline. Last year they killed 132 people and injured 207 others.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/23/duchunghatinhsaulu61603356166-7507-9789-1603420036_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'flooded', 'weaken', 'quang', 'provinces', 'tinh', 'tri', 'central', 'sea', 'saudel', 'storm', 'bears', 'winds', 'kph', 'ha']", ,flood

Over 3,700 UNFPA Dignity Kits worth $180,000 would be provided to the elderly in central Vietnam following a series of storms and tropical depressions that hit the region last year.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) representative in Vietnam, handed over 3,704 kits containing essential items to Bui Quang Huy, standing secretary of the HCMC Communist Youth Union, to support the elderly in three central Vietnam provinces afflicted by floods last year: Ha Tinh, Quang Tri and Quang Ngai at a Wednesday ceremony.

Dignity Kits are a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, mitigate the risk of gender-based violence, and respond to and protect the dignity of women and girls adversely affected by a crisis. Kits meant for the elderly contain items like hand towels, sweaters, socks, wet tissues, toothbrushes, soap, underwear, blankets, flashlights and whistles.

The handover was made possible via financial contributions from U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), according to a UNFPA press release.

The elderly are among the most vulnerable when natural disasters strike, according to UNFPA. During floods and landslides in central Vietnam last year, health facilities were hard hit, causing routine public health programs to be disrupted, it added. The elderly are at risk since they do not always get the care they need, and their vulnerabilities can become a serious challenge to survival and wellbeing, it stated.

Last year, central Vietnam was struck by a series of storms and tropical depressions, triggering heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Over 200 people were killed and property losses amounted to around VND30 trillion ($1.3 trillion). Hundreds of thousands of homes were either destroyed or damaged, affecting the lives of at least 7.7 million residents.

The Vietnamese government has provided around VND770 billion to the region as emergency relief. Many international organizations and countries like the U.S., U.K. and Australia also provided aid to assist the resumption of normal life.","Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2021/01/27/camxuyen091603187211-161173697-2443-3410-1611741529_1200x0.jpg,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'quang', 'flood', 'health', 'relief', 'elderly', 'tropical', 'central', 'unfpa', '180000', 'women', 'vietnamese', 'provided', 'kits']", ,flood

With Storm Molave set to make landfall in central Vietnam in the next few days, Vietnamese authorities are preparing to evacuate 1.2 million coast residents to safety.

At 1 p.m. Monday, the storm lay centered around 560 km east-northeast of Southwest Cay islet, with winds of 135 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

Over the next 24 hours, it will move west at 20-25 kph and gradually intensify. At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, it will be 280 km to the north of Southwest Cay with winds of up to 150 kph.

Mai Van Khiem, director of the national forecast center, said at a meeting Monday both the agency and its Japanese counterpart predict the rapidly moving storm would make landfall in central Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces.

The agencies forecast the storm would reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning, before making landfall in the coming hours.

On Wednesday morning, the storm's center would be around 200 km from the coast of Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh with a maximum wind speed of 135 kph, causing waves of up to 10 m.

Storm circulation combined with a cold spell would cause heavy rains on a large scale, and localities stretching over 1,000 km from Nghe An to Phu Yen will be battered by torrential downpours and strong winds from Tuesday until Thursday, with rainfall of between 200-400 mm.

Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh are told to brace for prolonged downpours until Saturday with total rainfall of up to 700 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Mountainous areas will be at high risk of landslides.

Mass evacuation

Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, said with Molave’s strength level, the committee is ready to evacuate over 1.2 million residents in seven central provinces Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

The region, home to popular ancient towns, beautiful beaches and world famous caves, has been bombarded by historic flooding and deadly landslides for the past three weeks, suffering damage government officials described as ""the worst in five years."" At least 130 people have been killed by floods and landslides between October 6 and 25.

Hoai urged provincial leaders to stay in contact with fishing boats, evacuate residents to safety, and make plans to limit storm damage.

There are still 65,000 fishing boats operating along the central coast, of which 45,000 have received official warnings.

""The storm is too strong,"" Hoai said, ordering localities to order boats to take shelter, ban residents from fishing activities, and close all public beaches by Tuesday night.

Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defense has called for the mobilization of more than 368,000 people - soldiers, members of the police force, and civilian volunteers, to assist residents in at-risk areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the meeting that localities must be on high alert and prepare their best flood prevention measures.

""If the storm comes as strong as forecast, damage from rains and floods will be extremely huge,"" Phuc said.

According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Storm Molave's strength is equivalent to Storm Damrey, which hit south central Vietnam in November 2017 and killed 106 people.

Hoang Tan Trong, watching over the family farm in Dong Hoi Town with his father and pregnant wife, witnessed floods tear through his home on the night of October 19. Dao, Trong’s wife, was sitting on their bed, suspended in the air thanks to four ropes connecting it to the roof. But with the walls damaged, the bed wobbled about two meters above ground, leaning to the side.

Seeing what happened, Trong's father, 64-year-old Hoang Tan Truong, immediately jumped into the water and tried securing the ropes, lest Dao fell into the water below.

""We can't just stay here and suffer like this. We need to find a safer house,"" Dao said. That night, Trong rented a motorboat and brought the whole family to the town center, about 2 km away.

Trong later returned to his old home to herd his 30 remaining chickens out of 200 into tree branches to avoid the flood. His three dogs were given to a relative the next day for safe keeping.

""This is the most severe flood since my birth,"" Trong, 44, remarked.

In Dong Hoi, Pham Thanh Hien, 66, frantically relocated his belongings as half-a-meter-deep floodwater swept through his home. A long time resident, Hien said the fact water could invade the house when hydropower plants have yet to discharge water was ""unprecedented.""

Since October 6, heavy rains have inundated the lowlands of Quang Binh. While not suffering fatal landslides like Thua Thien-Hue or Quang Tri provinces, Quang Binh has been the most severely flooded.

The October 19 flood managed to submerge thousands of houses, making even the most hardy residents shudder in fear.

From 1 a.m. on October 16 to 5 p.m. October 20, Quang Binh recorded rainfall of up to 1,380 mm in certain areas. The most heavily flooded was in Le Thuy District, with over 32,000 houses swamped. Throughout the entire province, around 105,000 homes have been similarly affected.

Tran Cong Thuat, chairman of Quang Binh, said: ""Floods this year have eclipsed the record peak in 1979 by up to 0.98 m."" The historic flood peak was recorded on Kien Giang River at 3.91 m. This year, however, the peak remained at 4.89 m for several consecutive days.

""The flood came at night so it was very powerful. The peak was too high, catching certain areas off guard,"" Thuat added. On the night of October 19 alone, thousands of people throughout Quang Binh have called out for help via their phones or social media.

""We still lack boats, but we are doing our best to help alleviate the suffering,"" he said.

Floods in Quang Binh this year not only set new records, but also receded very slowly. By the morning of October 21, traffic across the province remained crippled due to several flooded locations. Over the last fews days, people have confined themselves to their homes, with many of their pets, livestock and vegetables perishing in the water.

It would take a long time for Quang Binh to recover following this historic flood, according to Thuat. As Storm Saudel approaches Vietnamese shores, the province has prepared plans to support people with necessities and food for the coming days.

""During the first days when flood levels rose quickly, we were met with many challenges. But now that the water’s receding, we’ve been surveying heavily flooded and isolated houses so we could perform rescue operations and provide supplies more easily. We would not allow any family to be abandoned amid the flooding,"" said Thuat.

As of Thursday afternoon, at least 10 people have died in Quang Binh due to floods. Over 7,500 tons of food were soaked in water, while several roads and other infrastructure in the province have either been flooded or damaged. Around 30,000 families have had to be evacuated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/a1-1826-1603269458-3402-160334-4400-1598-1603352403_1200x0.jpg,"['flooded', 'binh', 'quang', 'water', 'flood', 'peak', 'province', 'worst', 'flooding', '41', 'trongs', 'night', 'suffers', 'family']", ,flood

Ho Van Rao's lush green fields in Quang Tri were buried under more than two feet of boulders, sand and other debris.

The field was the primary source of income to feed his family of three.

As he inspected the damage done by the prolonged flooding central Vietnam has had to suffer, he noted that some paddy sections had been swept away by floodwaters, while his tapioca field, cultivated over the past 10 months, was buried in rubble.

""We don’t know what to plant to make a living,"" said Rao, a 46-year-old resident of Huong Son Commune in Quang Tri’s Huong Hoa District. Two wet bags of grains they have are all that’s left for the next six months, he said, adding that on sunny days, he would put them out to dry.

The Huong Son Commune has over 192 ha of paddy fields, but around 90 ha were buried under rocks and wood rotting deposited by the floods, rendering them unusable and irrecoverable. Le Trong Tuong, chairman of the Huong Son People’s Committee, said residents were facing food shortages in the future for people.

In Quang Binh Province’s Bo Trach District, Le Xuan Uyen, 56, sees his field buried under mud and soil a meter deep, meaning he cannot plant new saplings for the winter-spring season without putting in significant time and efforts to clean the place up.

Worse still, the soil the fields are buried under has toxic properties that would kill paddy if they’re planted, he said. ""We are worried because we have missed the season for planting, and we don’t know what to plant anyway.""

The Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences said the top soil layer that covers several areas in Bo Trach District is actually heavy clay layers, which would make it difficult for cultivation if left as it is. Farmers should switch to different plants to adapt to the new layers, the academy has suggested.

Around 1,650 ha of fields in Quang Tri were inundated in the past month. Provincial authorities are now cooperating with the people to salvage the buried fields to prepare for the winter-spring planting season in just a month, said Ha Si Dong, deputy chairman of Quang Tri. But as the fields are large, ample time, it would take a lot of people and equipment to complete the job, he added.

Recovery efforts should be completed by mid-December so new saplings can be planted for the winter-spring season on time, Quang Tri authorities have said.

The chance of such events could increase five to 10 times by 2050, resulting in economic and infrastructural damage that could cost billions of dollars, according to a McKinsey report, dated April. The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.

Ho Chi Minh City, a historic flood area located some 1,000 miles south of the capital Hanoi, contributes about a quarter of the Vietnam’s gross domestic product. While the metropolis can cope with flood risks today that could hit 23% of its area, further urbanization is raising the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels. Those could cause about $8.4 billion of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact, McKinsey said.

The city still has time to adapt to avoid such risks by having better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas, McKinsey said. Investments and fund-raising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.

Airports have been shut, beaches closed, and a fishing ban put in place as the country braces for winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour (60 miles per hour) when the typhoon makes landfall on Sunday, likely close to Hue.

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in four central provinces, according to the disaster management authority, while state media said hundreds of thousands more may have to flee.

“This is a very strong typhoon,” Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said, warning provinces in Vamco’s projected path to prepare for its impact.

The severe weather has also damaged or destroyed more than 400,000 homes, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Roads and bridges have been washed away, power supplies disrupted, and crucial food crops destroyed, leaving at least 150,000 people at immediate risk of food shortages, it added.

“There has been no respite for more than eight million people living in central Vietnam,” said Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, Vietnam Red Cross Society president.

As of Monday morning, the death toll had reached 130 with 18 people missing, according to government figures. This was up from 119 fatalities on Saturday, with most occurring in the central provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam.

Close to a million people have been severely affected, with many in desperate need of shelter, food, clean drinking water and income support. According to the UN, as of last Thursday, at least 178,000 homes were currently under water.

Flood levels eclipsed the 1979 record by 0.98 metres, hovering at 4.89 metres for several consecutive days in the province of Quang Binh. The amount of rain that fell between October 6 and 13 was two to six times higher than normal in some regions.

Most of the hardest hit have been poor farmers. Agricultural damage has been extensive, with 1,500 hectares of rice fields and 7,800 hectares of other crops being either flooded or damaged. Close to a million head of cattle and poultry have also been killed or swept away.

The government has stated that the damage caused has been “the worst in five years”. Several highways and local roads are blocked with rocks the size of cars, hampering rescue efforts.

About a third of deaths have been of military personnel.

In one instance, a team of 21 rescuers, most of them military officers, was sent to verify reports of 17 workers buried by a landslide at the Rao Trang 3 hydroelectric plant deep in the jungle. The workers were reportedly asleep when they were buried on October 12.

The rescue team stopped at a ranger station for the night and were buried in a rocky landslide. Of the 13 deaths, 11 were from the military. Only four of the 17 workers at the dam have been recovered thus far and authorities have deployed more rescue forces to the scene.

Days later, a barracks in Quang Tri was consumed by a mudslide in the early hours of the morning, killing 20 military personnel, likely the largest number of military casualties suffered in a period of peace, according to officials.

Scientists believe flooding in central Vietnam is the result of a “new normal” of weather patterns driven by complex processes.

On an international scale, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDDR) reported recently a 75 percent increase in natural disasters in the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, there were 4,212 major natural disasters. Between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded costing 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy USD$2.97 trillion.

The increase is largely attributed to climate related events such as floods, droughts and storms.

Speaking at a virtual conference, UNDDR chief Mami Mizutori accused governments of abandoning effective measures to deal with climate change, “It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction,” he said, “despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.”

In the Asia Pacific, the cyclical la Nina phenomenon is intensifying storms in the region, and is expected to continue until early next year. Cambodia has reported 39 deaths from flooding, with hundreds of thousands affected and 46,216 people evacuated to safer ground.

Vietnam has been hit by three tropical storms and a depression in the month of October. Typhoon Mojave, at present travelling westwards over the Philippines, is also likely to impact in the weeks ahead. It is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds of 130 kilometres per hour. About 9,000 people in the Philippines have fled their homes.

Professor of human ecology at Rutgers University, Pamela McElwee, told the New York Times that the sheer volume of rainfall in Vietnam was, “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it shattered the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in its central regions by the end of the century.

She also stated that the construction of hydroelectric dams and poor mountain roads had weakened the soil. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go.”

Christopher Rassi, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross, warned of the economic fallout: “We are seeing a deadly double disaster unfold before our eyes as these floods compound the difficulties caused by COVID-19. These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.”

The Vietnamese economy relies heavily on its tourism industry which has been drastically cut back during the pandemic. Borders were virtually closed in late March. Apart from an outbreak in Da Nang Hospital in late July, total cases have been kept low and contained at under 1,500, with 40 deaths.

The Asian Development Bank assessed in September that Vietnam’s economy would grow at around 1.8 percent in 2020, its slowest rate in 35 years and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.

The Stalinist regime in Vietnam has ruthlessly pursued a policy of capitalist restoration for decades. According to its own estimates, economic inequality is worsening. Between 2014 and 2018 the GINI index of Vietnam, a standard measure of income inequality, was 0.4 [where 0 represents absolute equality and 1 absolute inequality]. The figure is regarded as a tipping point with higher numbers frequently associated with social unrest and political instability.

Out of fear of social unrest, the regime has sought to suppress criticism from workers and the peasantry. According to the UN, hundreds of people have been interrogated so far over COVID-19 related Facebook posts. In the lead up to the congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in January 2021, the government has begun a campaign of censoring dissident and left-wing publications.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wsws.org/asset/64544160-f1d1-4d85-aecd-24bd939be1eb?rendition=image1280,"['vietnam', 'normal', 'storms', 'quang', 'according', 'extreme', 'workers', 'central', 'events', 'military', 'million', 'rescue', 'suffers', 'weather']", ,flood
76,76,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Flood relief necessary but post-disaster reconstruction vital - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/perspectives/flood-relief-necessary-but-post-disaster-reconstruction-vital-4182755.html,"Nguyen Thi Vung had to keep an eye on her sow for five days straight during the flooding in Thua Thien-Hue Province and lost three kilograms consequently.

Phan Duong

She was worried the 80-kilogram beast might be swept away or escape.

The resident of a village in Quang Dien District explains: ""Pigs can be really destructive if they escape. I did not dare sleep at night.""

Central Vietnam has been hit hard by tropical storms, torrential downpours, floods, and landslides for three weeks now.

The woman, who is in her 50s, took the sow and its litter of four to her brother’s house since it is on higher ground than hers, and never left them alone for a moment.

With a stick in one hand, she made sure the sow behaved. But the animal was spooked and attacked her more than once. Vung has a wound on her right thigh from a bite.

But importantly she has been able to safeguard the family’s most valuable asset.

She had spent a year raising the pig and saw it give birth to four piglets. If she manages to keep all of them safe, and the animal continues to have more litters, she can solve the problem she has been facing: that of paying her daughter’s tuition.

Her daughter is a freshman at a college in Da Nang City, and Vung has to send her VND1.5 million ($65) every month for living expenses besides paying VND6 million a year tuition for the two-year course.

Since her daughter was in 10th grade Vung had been telling her, ""I think you should drop out of school and work; I am not able to afford your schooling.""

But the girl would plead: ""Please let me stay in school so that I can have a proper career in future and build us a better life.""

Vung relented.

Their family consists of just the two of them. Vung does the best she can, growing rice on a 750-square-meter farm and doing agricultural labor and menial jobs for others.

Every year in October she travels to the Central Highlands to harvest coffee and cassava for farmers there. But this year she has been stuck in floods described as the worst in decades.

Earlier this year, along with many other localities across Vietnam, Thua Thien-Hue was also hit by the African swine fever, an incurable and fatal disease in pigs.

Vung worked for other farmers, burying pigs killed by the disease.

""God blessed me and kept my sow healthy.""

Now she has once again kept the sow safe through the floods.

But she has not been able to save a small flock of chickens and a cassava crop that had almost been ready for harvest.

All hopes for the mother and daughter’s future now rest on that one sow.

When meeting us in the courtyard of a government office to receive a donation of essential items from readers of VnExpress through FPT’s Hope Foundation, Vung cannot hold back her tears, and tells us all about her pigs and chickens.

The floodwaters have now started receding in several parts of the central region, including her Quang Dien District, and people are trying to pick up the pieces again after two weeks of living with the floods.

Vung is still at her brother’s house with her pigs since it is still not safe to return home.

Her 20-year-old single-storied house has deteriorated and its walls are cracked, and now after the floods Vung is afraid they could collapse at any time.

""More storms are coming, so I’d better stay here.""

Storm Molave is expected to reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning.

In Phong Dien, another district in Thua Thien Hue, we met Le Thi Sinh, 51.

Three years ago her son passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children. Her daughter-in-law works elsewhere and sends home money for Sinh and her husband to raise the two kids, one of whom is learning to talk while the other is in kindergarten. Sinh’s husband has a number of health problems and so she is the family’s breadwinner.

No one had foreseen such severe flooding. Like many other locals, Sinh and her husband did not have enough time to prepare for the disaster.

When the waters came, they packed off the children, belongings and grain to the first floor. They hung their six piglets, each weighing around 15 kg, from the ceiling, but one was swept away and another was killed.

The floods also swept away their flock of 200 chickens and destroyed their cassava and sweet potato crops.

Her grandchildren cried and asked for their mother. Then they asked for their father after seeing a man next door casting a net to catch fish. There was nothing Sinh could do except shed tears of grief.

Sinh still has a litany of problems to worry about like a loan she took to buy supplements for the pigs and chickens and buying formula and other essential items for the children.

She hopes to get relief from the authorities and plant a new crops and resume her livestock and poultry farming.

In the district’s Phong Xuan Commune, locals grow trees and paddy. In May Storm Noul destroyed grown paperbark and acacia trees, and now the floods have destroyed all the young ones.

In Phong Hien Commune 2,000 families have been living in the floodwaters. They have lost 250 hectares (620 acres) of cassava, 27 hectares of glittering chive, 25 hectares of sugarcane, and 15 hectares of other crops.

""There is nothing left,"" Nguyen Si Hiep, chairman of the commune Fatherland Front Committee, said. The front, an overarching public organization, is tasked with ""promoting national solidarity and unity of mind in political and spiritual matters,"" and conducting many of the government's social programs, especially those to mitigate poverty.

Hiep said the commune administration is advising farmers to switch to short-term crops after the floods recede so that they could earn some income before the new year arrives.

There is way too much attention on flood relief though it is just one part of the big picture when a natural disaster strikes. Reconstructing the livelihoods and rebuilding the lives of millions of people in the central region is now a serious challenge in what has already been a disastrous year.

A World Bank report released last week estimated that 12 million people living in coastal provinces face the threat of severe flooding and over 35 percent of people live on eroding coastlines.

Each year an average of $852 million and 316,000 jobs in key economic sectors are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding.

In this context, I reviewed the concept of social capital. Economists treat social capital as an important resource of the nation. It is understood as the two-way and multidimensional cooperation between members of the society, the power of connection between people in a community, a country, and transactions based on mutual trust that bring mutual benefit.

The fact that Vietnamese everywhere are pitching in to provide succor to people in the central region these days is an expression of social capital in Vietnam.

The World Bank believes that social capital helps the community coordinate voluntarily and effectively because it is based on a common goal to help solve collective problems. The natural disasters in the central region are a collective problem. To address this problem, the government can collaborate with the community and make use of the social capital that has been on display in recent days.

Dealing with the aftermath of the floods gives the government an opportunity to tweak its policies. Authorities should make appropriate decisions to remove unnecessary barriers, paving the way for an increase in tolerance and trust, which would help heal the wounds caused by natural disasters.

A timely and substantial reconstruction plan for people like Vung and Sinh will help soothe the gaping economic wounds suffered by the central region, sustain growth and lead to a sustainable development vision for the country.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

VnExpress’s Hope Foundation is soliciting emergency support for people in central Vietnam, whose lives have been impacted by severe floods and landslides since earlier this month.

When the floodwaters rose on October 12 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Hoang Thi Phuong, a textile worker in Phong Dien District, went into labor.

Her husband tried to take her to hospital, but their motorbike could not cross a flooded section of National Highway 1A. In desperation, he asked a person with a boat to take his wife to the other side.

But the boat capsized just 20 meters from safety. Both Phuong and her unborn baby died.

""I killed you,"" her husband sobbed inconsolably, down on his knees in front of the raging floods that had snatched away his loved ones.

They are not the only victims of the tragedy that has befallen central Vietnam in the last two weeks. Dozens of others, including at least two hydropower plant workers and 13 members of a rescue team, lost their lives to landslides in Thua Thien-Hue.

In the last 10 days nonstop rain and floods have submerged entire regions under a sea of water and triggered massive landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of thousands of houses have been engulfed, and the death toll has been rising relentlessly.

Thousands of families face food and water shortages, and the floods do not seem likely to recede any time soon.

As fighters on the frontlines in a battle against nature, soldiers, doctors, rescuers, and thousands of others have had to take on the harsh and unrelenting elements.

What they need right now are boats, medicines, food, clothes, rescue equipment, and other supplies.

The Hope Foundation by VnExpress and FPT is calling for emergency support for millions of people in central Vietnam. We are soliciting help from every person and every section of the community, and trying to find the quickest way to help those in need right now.

The next update will be issued once new information becomes available.

Highlights

From October 6th, the Central region observed prolonged heavy rains that caused severe and widespread flooding and landslides. Water levels have risen rapidly flooding large areas in the provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh. Hieu river (Quang Tri) and Bo river (Hue) reached historical high flood levels.

As of 15 October, VNDMA recorded 55 casualties, 7 people missing, 135,731 flooded houses (of which 649 collapsed), 66,500 evacuated, 362 affected schools, 10,392 ha of damaged agriculture land (including rice, other crops and aquatic products) and 332,350 cattle and poultry killed.

In response, the Government of Viet Nam: i) Conducted daily meetings of the Central Steering Committee of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (CCNDPC); ii) Sent missions to the affected provinces to provide concrete guidance, support and coordination; iii) Released a call for emergency relief and support, sent to international organizations; iv) Is planning to hold a meeting convening the Disaster Risk Reduction Partnership, on Monday 19th to discuss and coordinate international support.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539933-Flash%20Update%20No.%201%20-%20Viet%20Nam%20Floods.png?itok=aGT5G35x,"['storms', 'update', 'nam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'quang', 'viet', 'coordinator', 'provinces', 'issued', 'office', 'floods', 'river', 'sent', 'resident', 'support', 'tri']", ,flood
80,80,FL-2017-000155-VNM,One million swamped by deadly floods as Viet Nam faces another major storm - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/one-million-swamped-deadly-floods-viet-nam-faces-another-major-storm,"Kuala Lumpur/Hanoi/Geneva, October 14, 2020 – Close to a million people have been severely affected by prolonged flooding in central Viet Nam as the country faces another major tropical storm and further dangerous floods.

Red Cross holds grave fears that deadly floods, which have submerged the country’s central provinces over recent days, will worsen as tropical storm Nangka makes landfall today, bringing destructive winds and dumping more rain on hard hit communities.

Since the floods began in early October, at least 28 people have been killed, more than 200,000 homes flooded and an estimated 84,000 hectares of crops damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people – many cut off by the floodwater – are now in desperate need of emergency relief.

As part of a coordinated relief effort, Viet Nam Red Cross staff and volunteers have been accessing isolated communities by boat to provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and other much needed supplies. More relief supplies are urgently being brought in from other parts of the country.

Mr Hoa Nguyen, Deputy Director of External Relations and Development, Viet Nam Red Cross, said: “Our volunteers and staff have been working in the affected areas since the floods began, providing relief supplies to thousands of people, but we need to reach many more as the rain continues and floods worsen. Every day we hear of more families who have lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods.”

Hung Ha Nguyen, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator said: “These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods.”

“Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities, especially on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need to help ensure families receive the relief they need in the coming days and weeks,” Mr Hung Ha said.

So far, at least 235 people have died or been listed missing after the floods and landslides triggered by storms and heavy rains in central Vietnam last month, the government informed the National Assembly Tuesday.

Among the casualties were 35 military officers and soldiers of two different military teams sent on search and rescue missions after landslides hit several districts in the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri.

The region suffered historic flooding, with the peak time falling between October 12 and 19. Floodwaters inundated the homes of 317,000 families with 1.2 million members from Nghe An to Quang Nam, with many areas being flooded for nearly two weeks.

Over 200,000 houses were seriously damaged. Many public construction projects also suffered heavy damage and roads were heavily eroded.

Of the total damage of VND17 trillion, VND10 trillion ($430.16 million) was caused by Molave, one of the most powerful storms to hit Vietnam, the government said.

The storm made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28, causing heavy rains and deadly landslides in the central region.

Earlier, the government granted over VND1 trillion, over 11,500 tons of rice and other essential items in relief support for the worst-hit central provinces.

Not over

The government said it would continue to mobilize all forces to search for the victims buried in several landslides and fishermen missing at sea. Among the missing are 12 hydropower plant workers in Thua Thien-Hue Province who were hit by a landslide on October 12, 19 residents in Quang Nam Province hit by two landslides as an impact of Storm Molave last week, and 23 fishermen from Binh Dinh Province whose boats sank in rough sea as the storm was near.

Priority in relief support will be given to those in worst-hit localities and isolated areas and to quickly repairing infrastructure and public construction works damaged by storms and floods, the parliament was told.

The government is also joining forces with local authorities to evacuate residents from high risk areas as storm Goni, the 10th storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, heads towards south-central Vietnam.

International forecasting agencies expect the storm to directly affect the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.

Natural disasters, predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

82,82,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Anguish as Mekong Delta’s annual floods continue to dry up - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/anguish-as-mekong-delta-s-annual-floods-continue-to-dry-up-4171382.html,"It is time for the annual floods in the Mekong Delta, but the flooding season these days is more a cherished memory than a practical phenomenon.

One day in mid-September Cao Van Bi, 50, was rowing a boat with his wife across a paddy field that had been partially flooded.

All over the field, in Phu Hoi, a rural commune in An Giang Province’s An Phu District, traps had been set up to catch fish.

That morning the catch was 2.5 kilograms of carp and five kilograms of other fish and shrimp.

In previous years, during the flooding season, Bi would have got dozens of kilograms worth of fish every day, but these days it never exceeds 10 kg.

Cao Van Bi and his wife collect the fish they catch in one morning in mid September, 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Nam.

The reason is that the annual flooding of Vietnam's Mekong Delta from the upstream Mekong before reaching the sea no longer occurs.

Not far away, in Vinh Hoi Dong Commune in An Phu, Phan Van Lang, 54, was standing in front of his house.

Since they live in an area hit by annual flooding, Lang and his neighbors have their houses built well above the ground. His house is nearly three meters in the air with a flight of the stairs leading up from the road. In 2000, for instance, the floodwater almost reached the house. But ever since the flooding levels have kept decreasing.

Pointing at the road in front of his house, he says the entire road would have been under one meter of water at this time of the year but this year, the water has not even reached the road.

Hung Dien Commune in Long An Province's Tan Hung District, 80 km (50 miles) away, has been witnessing the clearest change.

In the past its paddy fields would have waters reaching waist high and be filled with water lilies and boats would be the only means of getting around.

That scene now exists only in the memories of seniors.

Bay De, 53, who has been fishing for more than 30 years, recalls floods when catching up to 200 kg of various kinds of fish every day and earning a million dong ($40) was a ""piece of cake.""

For several weeks now he has not caught any fish. He spends almost every day drinking tea and chatting with neighbors in his thatched house.

Fifty kilometers away, Tran Van Thanh, 58, of Tan Lap Commune in Moc Hoa District is fixing traps for catching crabs.

He has been doing this for dozens of years, a job that has ensured a decent livelihood, but that has changed.

""I used to set up more than 600 traps during the flood season, but only a few tens of them these days because the flood waters are way too low and there are no crabs to catch.""

In the neighboring province of Dong Thap, Nguyen Van Phuong, 42, of Tan Thanh A Commune in Tan Hong District is watching the news on TV for possible information about the floods, something he has been looking forward to for several weeks now.

He has an eight-hectare rice field and has been waiting for the floods to come so that he could start sowing the winter-spring crop.

There was heavy rain a few weeks ago, and water had filled up canals and then reached the fields. Phuong, thinking the floods had finally arrived, hired people to till the soil.

But soon a scorching sun replaced the rains and water dropped, leaving the field dry and cracked once again.

He says: ""I had spent VND750,000 ($32.44) per hectare, but that has been a wasted effort. Now I have to wait for the floodwaters to come and do that all over again.""

In his neighborhood, farmers are now worried that if the floods do not come or are low, they would have to shell out money to pump water from canals into their fields.

Rice farmers in the delta have for generations depended on the floodwaters to come and inundate their fields before sow seeds directly.

The Plain of Reeds, a wetland straddling Long An and Dong Thap provinces, produces more than two million tons of rice a year.

The floods usually start coming in late July or early August and remain until November or even later to bless the region with extraordinary fertility as they typically deposit silt from upstream areas.

When they do not come or arrive late, cropping and fishing activities are disrupted.

For several years now they have been late or deficient, and experts have been blaming this on climate change and the construction of a series of dams in the upstream area.

According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, this year’s floodwater level in the delta will be only 55 percent of the long-term average, which translates into a shortfall of 130 billion cubic meters.

It will be 15 percent lower than last year’s level and the lowest in a decade, it has warned.

Late last year the highest water levels in the upstream areas of the delta were 1.12-2 meters lower than the long-term average and 1-1.65 meters lower than in the previous year.

The delta suffered the worst salinity levels and resultant freshwater shortage in 100 years but meteorologists warn things could get worse.

Tran Tan Tai, deputy head of the agriculture department of Long An’s Tan Hung District, says the water level in his hometown is currently 1.4 meters, or 80 centimeters lower than a year ago.

""If there are no floods, the fields will lack silt, and pathogens and wild grass seeds will not be washed away, and farmers will have to spend more on pesticide and fertilizers.""

Meteorologists expect the floods to come around the middle of this month, stay low and ebb away quickly.

Those were the days

Early one morning in late September, Muoi, 64, of Tan Lap rides a motorbike to a wet market two kilometers away from home. He returned after a while with a bag of barb.

""All my life I have seen fish all over the place every time it is the flooding season, but now I have to go buy them... Isn’t it weird?""

Not far from his home a neighbor had set up a lift net the previous night, but until around noon the next day, when Muoi returned from the market, it had only around two kilograms of fish.

Muoi can never forget what it was like one or two decades ago: Every year when the flood season arrived, water would be everywhere, covering the fields and even the streets. People would be rowing boats, picking water lilies and river hemp, both used to make specialty dishes of the region.

In the water, there would be so much fish that anyone could become a fisherman without having to learn any skills.

""Back then people did not weigh fish in kilograms but in a unit of around 20 kilograms. Normally, in one night a family could catch at least five to seven of that unit. Some would even feed the fish to their pigs.""

In years of heavy flooding fish moving down stream into the delta would breed along the way, and it would be extremely rare to see a field or waterway without fish in it.

Fishermen would enlarge the holes in their net to only catch adult fish, leaving the young ones untouched.

When the floods retreated, mud, algae and water lilies would be left in the paddy fields. The fields mud would be silt while the algae and flowers served as organic fertilizers, leaving the fields with all the nutrition they needed.

Besides, the floods would wash away the pathogens and wild grass seeds, and it was not common for farmers to use fertilizers or pesticides.

A kilometer away from Muoi’s place, Danh Van Minh, 62, asks his son to take him by motorbike to a house nearby. The house stands along a canal and in front is a concrete road around three meters wide.

""This used to be a small dirt road, and every year during this season it would be two or three meters under water,"" Minh says.

""The house used to be just a hut beside which I would anchor my boat after fishing.""

Minh’s life has been filled with tragedy. He lost his first wife and two of his children during two different flood seasons.

In the middle of the 1991 season his wife had twins, but both died at birth due to lack of medical care in that rural area.

Worse still the floods covered every inch of land that they could not find a place to bury the children. All he could do was put their bodies in a coffin, stick a bamboo pole in the water and hang the coffin up that.

Only a month after they passed away could he give them a proper burial.

Five years after they lost the twins, Minh’s wife suddenly fell sick and died. Once again he could not bury her immediately, and had to leave her body inside a coffin on the family boat and leave it anchored next to the hut.

In the past 20 years the delta has witnessed several floods that left a significant impact on its residents, especially in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2011.

The 2000 floods were the most severe in 70 years, with the water rising to 4.78 meters. They claimed 481 lives and caused losses of nearly VND4 trillion.

As told by Le Thanh Tam, party chief of Long An Province in 1999-2005, 20 years ago and further, the Plain of Reeds had heavy floods almost every year.

The region had not yet got an embankment system, and every time it flooded there was no way to tell where the road was and where the canal was. The only way people could move around was by boat.

""Back then we always had fish, shrimps and crabs in abundance, but we would lose lives every year, and of children in most cases.

""When the floods retreated, we had to expend a lot of effort to rebuild houses and roads.""

But a 2017 study by the Mekong River Commission estimated that the flooding provides $8-10 billion in annual economic benefits while causing losses of just $60-70 million.

The Mekong River flows through six countries, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before reaching the sea.

Many parts of the Mekong Delta were formed by sedimentation over eons.

When the Vietnamese expanded their nation to the south, they began to conquer the delta in the 18th century. For generations, no other place in the nation could compare with it as a agriculture and aquaculture hub.

In his book ‘Last days of the Mighty Mekong’ published in February last year, Brian Eyler, director of the Asia Program at U.S. think tank Stimson Center, writes: ""For the past 3,000 years, the Mekong carried about 150 million tons of sediment in its system to the delta each year.""

Without the sedimentation, the delta’s land would fall apart under natural conditions, which are worsened by intense groundwater extraction and sea level rise, he says.

He strongly condemns China’s dam building in the upstream areas of the Mekong for holding back floodwaters and, along with them, sediments.

Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent researcher into the ecology of the Mekong Delta, says the main cause of the low floods this year is the El Nino phenomenon that lasted from the year’s beginning to the end of August, resulting in scanty rain fall in the region.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the rainy season arrived late last year and was shorter than usual, with the result that rainfall was 8 percent below normal at 1,240 mm.

Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of Can Tho University’s Research Institute of Climate Change, says the calamity faced by the delta cannot be blamed just on nature or Chinese dams.

""Sea levels rise and the Earth gets warmer. Yes. But that happens just a little each year and it needs a long period for dramatic changes. It is humans who have accelerated that process.""

He cites one example of human action that changed the delta’s hydrological profile. Ever since the delta was formed, it has had several low-lying areas like the Long Xuyen quadrilateral in Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and Can Tho City and the Plain of Reeds that worked as natural reservoirs to store the seasonal floodwaters, he explains.

For generations farmers did not use them for cultivation, but due to the wars, the nation had to consider food security, and built embankments to keep the seasonal floodwaters from flowing into them and directed the water toward the sea, he says.

""Now in peace time, we still have the mindset of growing as much rice as we can, and many have treated the seasonal floods as a disaster for their paddy fields while in fact it is a blessing.

""With that thinking, many have continued to keep out the floods, going against nature, thus intensifying the lack of water once it took hold in the region.""

Minh, who has been a poor farmer his entire life and is haunted by a tragic past related to the floods, does not care much for the explanations experts like Tuan have to offer.

After his wife’s death, he took his son to another village, remarried and built a new life.

He now owns a 6,000 sq.m rice field and both his home and field are surrounded by embankments, allowing him and others in his neighborhood to go against nature and cultivate three instead of just two rice crops as in the past.

The field does not have any time to recover, and instead of getting floodwaters that wash it clean and deposit sediments, it has to do with plant protection chemicals instead.

With this method of growing rice, farmers remain mired in poverty since they have to spend money on fertilizers and pesticides for every crop and also lose out on an abundant source of fish, shrimp and crab and the plants that always grow in the flood season.

""My children and grandchildren have all taken turns to leave,"" Minh says, reflecting the trend of delta dwellers abandoning their hometown for Ho Chi Minh City and other industrial areas, where they work in factories or the service sector.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/05/lu-dong-thap-muoi-2300-1601345-2309-7479-1601885014_1200x0.jpg,"['continue', 'annual', 'field', 'water', 'dry', 'flooding', 'floods', 'delta', 'anguish', 'mekong', 'fields', 'season', 'away', 'fish', 'deltas']", ,flood

Highways in the provinces have also been severely damaged, with the total cost of repairs estimated at around VND 355 billion, state media said, citing figures provided by the Directorate of Roads of Vietnam on Oct. 21.

Also on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung and deputies of Vietnam’s National Assembly welcomed efforts by Vietnamese pop star Thuy Tien to collect more than VND 100 billion (U.S. $15,316,811) for relief work in flood-hit Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue.

Large-scale fundraising is normally restricted by law to state organizations or social associations to reduce the risk of personal gain, with penalties prescribed for violations. But National Assembly deputy Le Thanh Vanh voiced confidence in the work of Thuy Tien and her staff.

“They are ready to take responsibility before the sponsors who donated the funds,” Vanh said, quoted on Oct. 21 in state media reports. “I am sure they will be completely transparent,” he said.

Relief teams have poured for the last few days into central regions hit by floods and landslides that have destroyed roads and buried workers at a hydropower plant and soldiers at a military barracks, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told state media on Wednesday.

Many areas have already received help, while others remain cut off because of damaged roads, Dung said, calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to send more teams to reach remote areas and give further support to those already helped.

34 now killed in Cambodia

Relief work meanwhile continues in Cambodia, where 34 people have now been killed by floods to date, with Prime Minister Hun Sen urging local authorities to guard damaged homes to prevent looting and calling on banks and other lending institutions to delay or reduce payments owed to them by villagers impoverished by the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 has hit us hard for the last 10 months, and now we are facing floods that are destroying us,” Hun Sen said.

“We have not concluded our damage assessments yet. For now, we are just working to rescue people and take them to safer areas,” he said.

Around 10,000 families have already been safely evacuated from flood-hit areas, Cambodian media sources say.

Speaking to RFA, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha said that flood waters are now receding in several provinces, including Oddor Meanchey, Pursat, Takeo, Pailin, Kampong Speu, Stung Treng, and the two hardest-hit provinces of Banteay Meahchey and Battambang.

The 34 flood deaths reported so far reflect the inability of central government and local authorities to deal effectively with the disaster, said Kean Ponlok, secretary general of the Cambodia Intellectual Students Alliance.

“The authorities must look into the causes of these deaths and hold themselves responsible,” he said, adding that because of corruption in Cambodia, he is not convinced that all donations handed over to the government will be spent on victims of the floods.

Banteay Meanchey villager Nay Thoeun said she has now lost her home and job because of the floods and is debt after borrowing money from a bank to buy medicine to treat the tuberculosis to which she was exposed in her family.

“I am very worried. I’m living now under a shelter on a hill, but the water is still rising here, and I’m afraid of [venomous insects].”

“I’m urgently calling for aid to be delivered to this hill. There are many poor families here,” she said.

Flood begins to recede in Laos

In Laos, flood waters have begun to recede from eight districts in Savannakhet province, where 125 villages containing 5,134 families, or nearly 30,000 people, have been affected, Lao media sources say.

In the province’s Sepon district alone, 40 villages containing nearly a thousand households have been flooded, with many houses completely destroyed, sources said.

Sepon’s La Or and Vang Khot villages were hardest hit, with 44 houses swept away, and another 90 dwellings hit by fast-running floods and partly damaged, a district official said on Oct. 21.

“The district is still asking for help, but we will set up temporary refuges in the villages for people to live in,” the official said, adding that funds are being sought for building materials such as roofs and nails for the construction of temporary shelters.

Fast-rising water hit one village on Oct. 18 and swept away 28 or 29 houses, leaving nothing to come back to when villagers returned two days later, one villager said. “Now we have no place to stay in but the schools, and no one has any clothing. We are waiting to see how the authorities plan to handle this.”

“We are all in a very poor condition. We have no rice to eat, and all our rice fields are flooded. We will have to buy all the rice that we eat next year,” he said.

“The water is receding now, but the villagers’ houses are damaged beyond repair, and nothing can be restored. There is no thought of fixing them now,” a rescue team member said, adding that many residents of Sepon and other districts are still cut off because of damage to the roads.

Though Lao authorities had moved quickly to help victims of the floods, more help is needed, an NGO official said, asking that neither he nor his organization be named. “For a start, we urgently need dry food and drinking water, clothes, rice, and many other things, as so many houses have been swept away.”

“The authorities did go down to do everything they could, but there are just too many villagers to help,” he said.

Many residents in areas of Sepon and Phin districts are still out of reach, a Sepon district official said. “We are still unable to get to almost half of the areas affected by the floods because the roads have been cut off by landslides,” he said.

Losses in Savannakhet including houses damaged, livestock drowned, and paddy fields destroyed are still being calculated, the official Vientiane Times said on Oct. 21.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguy?n Thái H?p celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vu?t Lu C?ng Ð?ng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p, the bishop of Hà Tinh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghia, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Ngu?n N?y River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tinh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghia, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Ð?n.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_festaOK.JPG,"['tinh', 'h?p', 'centre', 'build', 'bishop', 'thái', 'hà', 'catholics', 'flood', 'work', 'nguy?n', 'local', 'community', 'paul', 'house', 'tiên', 'victims']", ,flood

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan donated US$400,000 on Friday (Oct. 23) to Vietnam in aid after the country suffered the severest floods and landslides in decades.

Richard Shih (???), Taiwan’s representative in Vietnam, said the Taiwanese business community in Vietnam, as well as non-governmental organizations from Taiwan, have mobilized themselves to send relief to the stricken areas in the country's central region. He said he hoped the victims will be able to reconstruct their homes and return to a normal life as soon as possible.

As of Friday, the series of floods and landslides have killed at least 114 people, and 20 people remain missing. Among those who lost their lives are dozens of military personnel who were deployed to search for those who had gone missing in previous disasters.

The Vietnamese military said it has suffered the most serious casualties in peacetime. In addition to the loss of lives, hundreds and thousands of houses were wiped out in central Vietnam, including Quang Tri and Thua Thien Huei provinces, and schools and other facilities have been forced to close.

Tran Quang Hoai, an official responsible for coordinating Vietnam’s rescue missions, accepted Taiwan's donation on behalf of the Vietnamese government at a ceremony on Friday. He remarked that the government is grateful for the generosity of the Taiwanese authorities and people, and that it will make the most appropriate arrangement for the donation so that relief and aid can be distributed to those in need soon, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

MOFA said via a statement that more than 320,000 Vietnamese migrant workers and new immigrants are living in Taiwan, and that the people of the two countries have been more than good partners. Taiwan looks forward to further strengthening bilateral collaboration to combat natural disasters in the future, it added.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/2020/AP/20201016/be8fe4b916764366af4b4d65ce1e386f.jpg,"['us400000', 'vietnam', 'donates', 'aid', 'taiwans', 'flood', 'suffered', 'oct', 'workers', 'central', 'taiwan', 'rescue', 'vietnamese', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

87,87,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hardest', 'flooded', 'water', 'change', 'infrastructure', 'flood', 'flooding', 'region', 'floods', 'global', 'risk', 'river', 'hits', 'asia', 'climate']", ,flood

The recent, devastating floods highlight the fragility of the country's natural environment. Deforestation, expanded farming, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric dams are the main culprits. In four years, 7,300 hectares of forest have been lost. So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built with another 450 on their way.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) – Recent floods in Vietnam caused by typhoons and tropical storms have had a devastating impact in terms of lost human lives, environmental damage, and economic dislocations, highlighting the fragility of the Asian country's environment.

Frequent and violent weather events worry both environmentalists and the affected communities more and more.

According to Vietnam’s Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, the main factor is deforestation and the conversion of entire forests to farmland, timber harvesting, and the large dam and hydroelectric plant construction.

Among the most affected areas are the central coastal region and the central Highlands, scene of the recent devastations.

The General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control estimates that some 7,300 hectares of forest land were lost between 2016 and 2019, with an annual average of 1,800.

At the current rate of deforestation, if nothing is done to slow this down, the risk of floods and landslides will increase considerably, along with periods of drought and loss of mangroves.

Environmentalists and experts note that the life and survival of Highland communities are closely linked to local forests.

From the central part of the country to the Mekong River Delta in the south, forests play a leading role in regulating local ecosystems, biodiversity, water resources, and the climate of much of the country.

For Prof Nguy?n Ng?c Lung, forests are key to blocking winds, limiting soil erosion and containing the devastating force of storms. In addition, tree roots absorb excess water.

Deforestation contributes to climate change, global warming, drought, rising water levels, pollution, and famine.

In view of the situation, the General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, noting that the country has recently had to face between 10 and 15 floods.

The blame goes to extensive “legal and illegal” deforestation to expand farmland, harvest timber or build crucial hydro-electric plants to meet the country’s energy needs.

So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built and another 450 are in the planning phase with further devastating impact on the environment.

Some see these plants as ""water bombs"" ready to strike at the population. Their effects are visible in many parts of the country, including Da Lat, a city that is located about 1,500 metres above sea level and a major tourist destination, with its almost year-round cool and temperate climate.

Since 2012, the city has been hit by flooding with increasing frequency, to the extent that today, when rain is intense, many parts of the city and Lam Dong province ""end up submerged by water"".

A Da Lat resident bitterly comments that floods do not spare even the rich, so that ""even residential and posh areas where the Golf Club is located are flooded"".","Mon, 23 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_deforestazioneok.jpg,"['vietnam', 'water', 'lost', 'greater', 'plants', 'flooding', 'alarms', 'natural', 'floods', 'timber', 'risk', 'recent', 'deforestation', 'city', 'environmental', 'set', 'devastating']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc Thanh.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Vietnam has given $540,000 in immediate support to women and girls in six central provinces affected by flooding.

UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of hygiene items and maternal health equipment. It is also supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services.

The central region has suffered unprecedented flooding from prolonged downpours and successive typhoons since October 6, resulting in at least 230 people dead or missing. Storm Molave hit the region on October 28, reportedly one of the strongest in 20 years.

At least 5.5 million people in the region have been affected, including more than 1.3 million women of reproductive age, over 92,000 of them pregnant mothers, who need uninterrupted services for pregnancy and menstruation, UNFPA said.

According to joint rapid assessment led by UNFPA last week, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programs such as antenatal, delivery, post-natal care and family planning services have been disrupted.

As a result, local women are unable to manage their hygiene properly and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear needed to manage menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and places to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged, the organization explained.

On October 12, a 35-year-old pregnant mother living in Phong Dien District of Thua Thien-Hue Province died on her way to give birth.

She entered labor in the morning, with her husband hiring a boat to take her to a local medical center for delivery. However, the boat was upturned and she was swept away by floodwater.

Her husband and local residents tried to look for her, but failed because of the fast-flowing current. Her body was found in the afternoon.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA representative in Vietnam, said: ""When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousands of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable. Women do not need to die giving birth, and this must hold true even in emergencies.

The National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on Monday afternoon that the low pressure out in the north of the South China Sea (known in Vietnam as the East Sea) had strengthened into a typhoon internationally known as Nangka.

Nangka is forecast to make landfall in the north-central part of Vietnam on Wednesday, while the accompanying rains could cover the central region already battered by torrential downpours over the last few days.

The centre forecast that central provinces would face heavy rains ranging from 150 to 300mm on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control issued an urgent letter on Monday asking the bureau to closely supervise the development of the low pressure system and issue warnings to localities and ships.

Authorities also instructed boats and ships to find safe habour and to take measures to ensure the safety of local people and tourists on islands and in coastal areas.

The Foreign Ministry was also asked to contact countries and territories to ask for shelter for Vietnamese fishermen.

The ongoing downpour, exacerbated by Typhoon Linfa which hit the central region on Sunday morning before weakening to a low pressure area, destroyed a total of 382 houses and flooded 109,034 others, and damaged 108 sections of national highways and 8.6km of provincial highways.

The disaster caused big losses to agricultural production by destroying 584ha of rice, 3,879ha of vegetable, 2,141ha of aquaculture, whilst killing about 150,700 cattle and poultry.

In Danang, many communes were submerged by rising floods worsened by water discharged from hydropower reservoirs.

As of 7am on Monday morning, the communes of Hòa Phong, Hòa Nhon, Hòa Liên, Hòa Khuong, Hòa Châu and Hòa Ti?n were badly submerged, affecting the lives of 3,000 local households in 38 hamlets.

In the mountainous districts of Hoà Vang, Liên Chi?u and C?m L?, there was high risk of flash floods and landslides.

At present, 882 households in typhoon-affected areas have been moved to safer areas.

Local people have been suffering from food shortages due to disrupted transport.

Hoàng Sinh, a resident of Phong Hi?n Commune, told Vietnam News Agency that his family’s food reserves were running due to the prolonged rain and flooding, and they were down to a few packs of instant noodles and rice.

Tr?n Ð?c Thi?n, chairman of Phong Hi?n Commune, said the local government was trying to reach local households to supply food, drink and medicine.

“The floods surged rapidly and people in low-lying areas could not keep up. Water spilled into their houses submerging them up to one metre,” said Tr?n Van Hoàn from Huong Trà Township.

“The whole family had to move to a neighbour's house. For several days, we only had instant noodles to survive,” said Hoàn.

“This is the worst flood since 2006. It has badly affected 70 per cent of local people,” said Ph?m Công Phu?c, vice chairman of Qu?ng Thái Commune.

The provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Rescue reported that as of 6pm on Sunday, three people had died, while seven were injured and another was missing.

Nineteen houses had, and 53,385 houses and 360ha of crops had been flooded.

More than 100km of coastline from Huong River across Huong Th? Commune and Huong Trà Township was severely damaged by erosion. About 300m of the dyke in Qu?ng Phú Commune, Qu?ng Ði?n District was also hit.

In Hu?, more than 50 per cent of roads in 27 wards and 2,560 houses were flooded as of Monday morning.

In Qu?ng Tr? Province, the flooding dramatically increased on Monday morning.

The downpour made the water in the Th?ch Hãn and Ô Lâu rivers reach alert levels.

The river water levels were forecast to continue rising today and next days.

To cope with the situation, Qu?ng Tr? authorities have asked the central Government to supply materials and rescue equipment, including two amphibious vehicles, 27 boats, rescue equipment and chemicals for disinfection.

The week-long rain killed six and injured two in the province, with a further six reported missing in the province.

Hue, Vietnam — Every day for the last four months, Duong Thi Mong has carried food, pots, dishes and other utensils on her shoulders to walk nearly 5 kilometers daily from her house to a nearby village, where she serves com hen (rice mixed with mussel, a popular traditional dish) to local people on streets of Thua Thien Hue province. Mong, a Buddhist from Hue's Vi Da ward in central Vietnam, which is famous for its mussels, said she usually takes her boat to carry food over the Huong River then walks only 600 meters to her destination. However, her boat was wiped out in severe flooding after six tropical storms hit the central provinces in October and November. The 56-year-old mother of two said she earns 80,000 to 100,000 dong ($3.50 to $4.30) per day to support her family, not enough money to buy a new boat. She said she had to work harder and sell food at night to get money to prepare food for the celebration of Tet, or Lunar New Year. Local markets closed for the weeklong traditional festival Feb. 10 ahead of the New Year, which starts Feb. 12. Thankfully, sisters across Vietnam have stepped in to help Mong and others like her.

""I am excited for the nuns who offered me 10 million dong [$435] on Jan. 28. I will use the money to buy a new boat for my work soon,"" Mong said cheerfully, adding that the boat is really a lifeboat that will help save her energy so she can work longer and earn more money to put food on the table. Sr. Maria Truong Thi Minh Yen of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate said her community provided boats for 12 people who lost their boats during the severe floods that left many people nothing in their wake. Yen, who serves Tan Thuy Parish, said she called on benefactors for donations. ""We do want to provide local flood victims with longer-term help so that they can stand on their own feet and return to normal life soon,"" she said. Many victims do not have enough money to be able to purchase basic means of doing their jobs. The 69-year-old nun said her convent gives clothes, blankets, rice and medicine to more than 100 street people, migrants, boat people and slum dwellers on a regular basis. Many live in makeshift shelters while others stay in low-rent, stuffy lodgings as their properties were washed away by flooding. ""They have suffered much from the last natural disasters and the chilly weather this year,"" Yen said. The temperature fell to 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January in the tropical area.

""We plan to offer them necessary finance to do small business, buy tricycles, and raise cattle and poultry for a living,"" she said, adding that students will be given school things while those with health problems will be provided with free treatment. Yen, member of the Hue Archdiocese's committee representing local women religious orders, said some local congregations have built and repaired 40 victims' homes at a total cost of 1 billion dong ($43,000). Luong The Thien from Phu Hiep ward said he built a new house in January after he received 65 million dong from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. His old 40-square-meter house was damaged in the floods. Thien, a 54-year-old Buddhist, said he could not afford to rebuild his house as he works as a motorbike taxi driver to support his wife, who has lung cancer, and three children. ""We are happy to celebrate the Tet festival in the dream house. We are extremely grateful for the nuns' generous help that benefits our life long-term,"" he said, adding that according to tradition, people cannot be well-established in their careers until they have stable homes.

Thien said he has had a good relationship with the nuns since he took a nun from a local hospital to her convent in 2008. The nuns regularly visit his family, and his children receive a monthly scholarship from them. Nguyen The Thieu, a Buddhist from Cau Nhi village, said he is among seven local families who received money to repair their storm-damaged houses. His Catholic son-in-law introduced him to the nuns. ""We have received humanitarian aid seven times from sisters and Catholic benefactors, and we gradually overcame the hard times,"" the 78-year-old father of four said. Sr. Maria Nguyen Thi Hong of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Visitation, who serves Nam Dong Parish, said the nuns offer 60 local ethnic Co Tu and Kinh families money to buy pigs and chicken to raise and fertilizers to cultivate their crops. Local people lost all their crops, poultry and cattle during the floods and now have to collect firewood and bamboo shoots for a living. On Jan. 23, the nuns provided bicycles for 23 students in Nam Dong Parish who walk 5 kilometers to school.

As of Wednesday morning, northern Vinh Phuc Province had reported two fatalities while Lao Cai, Son La, Lai Chau and Thai Nguyen claimed one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.

The committee said at least four others were injured.

Since last Sunday, northern provinces have been battered by torrential downpours due to the influence of a tropical convergence zone and effects from tropical storm Higos, which made landfall on China’s southern coast Wednesday morning.

Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Ha Giang and Tuyen Giang experienced heavy rainfall of up to 300 mm each downpour while Quang Ninh, home to world famous Ha Long Bay, and Hai Phong City received rainfall of between 200 and 350 mm each time. Levels of 180 mm a day are considered heavy.

At least 334 houses in the localities were damaged. Over 550 ha of rice and other crops were inundated while landslides blocked many roads leading to northern mountainous provinces like Lai Chau and Lao Cai, home to popular Sa Pa Town.

Weather forecasters warned northern provinces should expect heavy downpours with rainfall of between 100 and 250 mm from Thursday to Saturday due to the impacts of Higos.

Tran Quang Hoai, vice head of the committee, asked northern authorities to deploy rescue teams and evacuate residents in flood-prone areas.

Higos is the fourth storm formed in the East Sea this year.

The waters, known internationally as the South China Sea, could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, half of them directly affecting the country, meteorologists said.

Natural disasters, including drought, floods and landslides, killed 133 Vietnamese last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The United Nations Population Fund in Vietnam will provide an additional $800,000 to support women and girls affected by flooding in eight central provinces and cities.

It brings the UNFPA's total support to $1.34 million. In October it had given $540,000.

The support includes setting up mobile and outreach health care clinics and the distribution of dignity kits with essential hygiene items and vital maternal health equipment and supplies.

Between early October and mid-November the central region and parts of the Central Highlands were hit by a succession of storms that brought torrential rains, resulting in severe flooding and landslides.

At least 192 people were killed and 57 others are still listed missing, and losses amounted to VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), the government said.

Around 5.5 million people have been affected, including over 1.3 million women of reproductive age and more than 92,000 pregnant women, the UNFPA said.

The disaster forced women and girls into shelters without having the time to pack essential supplies, and many lack basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear that are needed to manage their menstrual periods, it said, adding that access to water and places to wash, dry reusable pads and clothes and dispose of used materials are lacking.

Routine public health programs such as antenatal, child birth, post-natal care, and family planning services have been disrupted.

On the night of October 11, Le Trung Lam, a resident of the central town, braved the floods to go and pick up some migrant students who had been marooned in their inundated home for days. He took them to his company on Ngu Binh Street, An Tay Ward, where 30 people were already sheltering.

They cook in the kitchen and eat three meals a day, and also have blankets, mattresses and electricity.

Three days earlier, many students from other places now studying in Hue, had no idea where to shelter as the floodwaters rose relentlessly and inundated their homes. Then Lam's message arrived out of the blue.

He said: ""The company's headquarters, a five-floor building, is situated on Ngu Binh Mountain, and so the water has not reached it yet. Its two top floors have 10 rooms each that can accommodate 20-30 people.""

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential downpours in central Vietnam for a week now have killed 29 as of Tuesday morning. Among the deaths, six are from Thua Thien-Hue Province, home to Hue.

Lam, 33, decided to turn his company into a shelter on October 8 as the waters reached some major roads and were expected to rise further. Driving around the town to check on the flood situation and how people were coping, he passed by the studio apartment where he himself had lived 15 years ago as a migrant student from central Nghe An Province. He too had suffered during flooding.

Fearing for students who were possibly cut off, he posted an announcement that he was willing to shelter people.

In the last few days he has received hundreds of calls from people seeking help. Since the neighborhood still has access to electricity and the market remains open, Lam's employees have been able to buy food and cook meals.

Lam said he would take care of the students until the floods receded.

If the water level keeps rising, he plans to also use the main hall which can hold 500 people.

Le Thi Anh Ngoc, 19, from the central Quang Binh Province, said she walked on flooded streets for more than an hour to reach Lam's place on the morning of October 11.

""I arrived in Hue four days ago. I did not know who would help us before I learned about Lam.""

Loan, who regularly does charity, always has instant noodles at home. Three days ago, seeing the rising water levels, she gave away 100 boxes of them to households in her neighborhood facing difficulties.

On October 12 she cooked 40 kilograms of rice for people living in areas where power has been turned off due to the floods.

The owner of a noodles restaurant also posted on her Facebook page that families with children or old people could command shelter at her home.

In the evening, when Loan sent 300 banh mi to households on Hen, Le Quoc Phong, Loan's neighbor, 40, was eating dinner under an oil lamp. The island in the middle of the Huong River was cut off by the rising waters.

Phong volunteered to help distribute food to those in need. Finishing his meal, he quickly got on a boat to take the banh mi to people before dinner time was over.

Distributing food and offering accommodation are Hue people’s way of supporting people affected by the floods.

Dozens of families living in higher places said they are ready to take in people whose houses are flooded and provide instant noodles to those who need them.

Free food distribution centers have been set up in downtown areas in the last few days, but are accessible only to people living nearby because of the situation.

People are also helping their fellows facing a threat of losing their livelihoods.

Over several days, strong winds and torrential rains caused huge damage, submerging homes, wiping out farmland, killing and sweeping away cattle. The Diocese of Hà Tinh, along with Caritas and the Catholic Business Association brought donations.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) - Strong winds and torrential rain over several days have caused flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 37 so far. Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên Hu? and Qu?ng Nam are the most affected provinces.

Heavy rains from 10 to 13 October inundated residential areas, farmland and roads, causing huge damages to people and property.

The General Department of Disaster Prevention reported that, in addition to the 37 deaths, at least 50,000 houses were flooded or wrecked whilst 250 hectares of rice fields and 2,500 hectares planted with vegetables were wiped out. Some 900 hectares dedicated to aquaculture were also damaged; at least 60,000 animals, mainly cows and poultry, were killed or swept away by the raging waters.

Bishop Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p of Hà Tinh (about 340 km south of the capital, near the coast), decided to visit the flooded areas to bring some help. On Saturday, he led a delegation from his diocese to Trung Quán parish.

The prelate tried to visit every family, one by one, to encourage them and leave them with some small gifts. For those who met him, “He is a true pastor. He did not just give us some gifts; he brought us God.”

Trung Quán parish, one of the hardest hit, saw homes submerged and streets turned into rivers.

Thanks Caritas and the Hà Tinh Catholic Business Association, the bishop was able to leave a package containing instant noodles, a bottle of oil and two packs of condiments for each family he visited.

He also brought more than 200 million dong (about US$ 8,600). The diocese donated 100 million; Caritas 50 million and the Catholic Business Association, another 50 million. Although not huge, the money will help with the emergency.

Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p encouraged the faithful to recite the rosary and pray for all the people living in the flooded area.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VN-_Evacuation.jpg,"['tinh', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'business', 'bishop', 'diocese', 'hà', 'left', 'hectares', 'catholic', 'caritas', 'central', 'floods', '37', 'huge', 'million', 'visits', 'dead']", ,flood

""These devastating floods are some of the worst we have seen in decades,"" Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, the president of Vietnam's Red Cross Society, said in a statement Tuesday.

More than 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and more than 691,000 cattle and poultry have been killed or swept away in flood water, according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA).

While foreign investors pulled about US$842mil (RM3.46bil) from the country’s shares so far this year, the tide could be turning.

Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR Global. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has raised more than US$350mil.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that – like in many others around the world – has attracted retail punters in droves.

Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

Worst hit is Hue province, some 700km (434 miles) away from the capital, Hanoi. Police and soldiers have been using canoes and boats in Ha Tinh city to reach the most flooded areas to evacuate people and move property to safety. In this city alone, more than 20,700 people were reported to have been evacuated.

In Quang Binh province, 130km away, flood water continues to rise, swallowing up entire houses or burying them beneath landslides. On Sunday 13 households , about 60 people in total, were relocated, as an estimated 3,000 tonnes of rock and soil came crashing down on homes and roads.

Bulking Up

Vietnam is an “investable market,” according to HSBC Holdings Plc. The flood of local cash has seen trading volumes more than quadruple since the end of 2019, based on 50-day moving averages. The benchmark index now includes 11 stocks exceeding $5 billion in market value, up from just two in 2015. Vingroup JSC has been leading the charge, and the conglomerate is now launching an ambitious plan to sell electric vehicles to the U.S. Vingroup was founded by the country’s richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine. The company started out focusing on property development but it now also makes cars and smartphones.

The stock exchange’s other heavy hitters include a smattering of state-backed behemoths -- Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, PetroVietnam Gas JSC -- as well as steelmaker Hoa Phat Group JSC and Vietnam Dairy Products JSC.

Vietnam’s stocks have been climbing amid optimism its export-oriented economy can maintain momentum after being one of the few in Asia to expand last year. Manufacturing activity jumped in April to the strongest since November 2018, according to a PMI report Tuesday. Equities retreated today, sending the VN Index down 1.1% as of 9:38 a.m. local time, after Vietnam’s capital city instructed school pupils to stay home in order to help contain an increase in local Covid-19 cases.

The country is well positioned as the U.S. and Chinese economies lead a global rebound from the pandemic. That’s because Vietnam benefited when U.S.-China trade tensions spurred companies to diversify supply chains out of its larger Asian neighbor.

“We’ve been positive on Vietnam for a number of years. They are a clear beneficiary of China-U.S. trade tensions and their handling of the pandemic has been among the best examples globally,” said Jeff Gill, who helped manage about $10.9 billion of assets at City of London Investment Management as of Dec. 31.

Waiting Room

Part of the problem may be that international investors overstretched when they splurged. Foreigners sold a net $876 million of Vietnamese stocks last year, similar to what’s been already sold so far this year. That’s in line with a wave of selling across Asian emerging markets. Those moves look to have simply swelled foreigners’ cash positions inside Vietnam, which are already substantially higher now than they were at the end of 2020, according to Vu Bang, former chairman of the State Securities Commission.

Vietnam’s stocks also faced a setback in March when FTSE Russell decided to maintain the country as a frontier market, instead of upgrading it to a secondary emerging market, citing settlement methodology issues. The State Securities Commission expects to resolve the issue later this year. Investors have also cited foreign ownership limits as a concern that could hamstring the market’s capacity to grow further.

Money managers from Sempione Sim SpA, to Asia Frontier Capital and City of London Investment Management Co. say they are busy looking for entry points. They cite solid economic prospects, relatively attractive valuations, rising foreign-direct investment flows and healthy earnings growth as reasons to be optimistic, while also showing faith in the government’s ability to contain the pandemic.

“I see Vietnam as a very nice compelling growth and stable story for the short, mid and long term,” said Federico Parenti, a fund manager at Sempione Sim in Milan.

Since the beginning of October, central Vietnam has been pounded by consecutive tropical storms and typhoons, which have brought widespread flooding and landslides to the region.

At least 1.5 million people have been affected by flooding and 235 people have died or are missing, according to the Vietnamese government.

On October 15, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink declared a national disaster for the Central Vietnam region as a result of the widespread devastation caused by flooding and landslides. This flooding has disrupted electricity and telecommunication networks, as well as destroying infrastructure, houses, livestock, and crops.

On October 28, Typhoon Molave made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Vietnam. It was the worst typhoon to hit the country in the last two decades.

Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are the two of the five central provinces that have been hardest hit by the recent flooding and landslides. The other three provinces that have been severely affected are Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, and Hue.

To make matters worse, the monsoon season is still ongoing and another powerful storm, Typhoon Vamco, made landfall last Sunday morning in central Vietnam, causing even greater damage. This is the third storm system to pummel Vietnam in November and the 13th to hit the country this year. The economic damage is now estimated to be close to $1 billion, according to the Vietnamese government.

International donations are starting to come in from various countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Japan. To date, the U.S. has donated $2.1 million toward the humanitarian relief effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Vietnam Red Cross Society to assist during the ongoing recovery period.

The financial backing also focuses on USAID’s longstanding investments in Vietnam to help minimize loss and destruction caused by natural disasters. Although the Vietnamese government has been quick to allocate disaster relief funds, its efforts and capacities have been strained also by the coronavirus pandemic. Donations from the outside world will be certainly needed and appreciated.

Local NGOs have been working tirelessly alongside the government to deliver aid to those who have been most affected by the catastrophic storms and their results. Pacific Links Foundation is an NGO that currently supports disadvantaged families in central Vietnam and it has been vigorously fundraising to support families in flood-affected Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Hue provinces.

“Our volunteers on the ground have delivered emergency packages, which included rice, food, life jackets, and flashlights, to students and their families,” said Hong Nguyen, the deputy director for SEEDS, a Pacific Links Foundation scholarship program which currently supports over 2,500 students.

SEEDS and the Pacific Links Foundation are now working on another round of support that will focus specifically on long-term recovery, allowing school children in all eight central Provinces to return to school and provide support for the families that suffered the most during the recent typhoons and floods.

“We will provide packages which will include books and school supplies, as well as computer tablets for students to continue learning through our online learning platform, especially when schooling is being disrupted,” said Nguyen.

Another non-profit charitable organization focused on philanthropic activities to benefit Vietnamese people in need throughout the Central Vietnam region is Da Nang Go. The organization uses fundraising events and direct donations to address the specific needs of Vietnamese people affected by natural disasters, poverty, and hunger.

Presently, the group consists of about 20 local and international volunteers who have been doing regular relief trips to some of the harder hit flood and landslide zones across the region. The NGO recently took a convoy of trucks and cars to Tay Giang district in Quang Nam province to provide much-needed supplies.

Tay Giang experienced heavy flooding and deadly landslides in October and November and is generally considered to be one of the more economically disadvantaged areas of Central Vietnam. The majority of the people who live there are from the Co Tu ethnic minority, a patriarchal rural society whose men raise livestock and whose women are well known for making high-quality traditional handicrafts.

The Co Tu live in small stilt huts which can be easily damaged by storms and landslides. At least 30 families had previously been evacuated from one village in Tay Giang due to the recent landslides.

“Before the last storm came, the government wanted to move them to a safer place but the problem is they don’t want to move anywhere because they are scared and if they die then they want to die in their hometown. They are used to yearly storms but they didn’t know this year’s storms would be so bad,” said Hannah Bui, one of the main directors of Da Nang Go and owner of Hannah’s Restaurant in Da Nang.

“I wish I had more money so I could do more to help these people,” she said.

Recently, the Da Nang Go team assembled 250 aid packages for children and 750 for adults in Tay Giang, as well as presenting some cash donations in envelopes at Hannah’s Restaurant.

The aid packages consisted of water, milk, noodles, dry food, oil, fish sauce, salt, blankets, and notebooks. The money was raised through a recent fundraising event and from various donations by local and expat members of the Da Nang community.

The aid was greeted with smiles by the local villagers and government officials. The team also delivered supplies to two elementary schools and to adults in the neediest villages of Tay Giang. In one of the poorest schools, students are so impoverished that they can’t afford basic school uniforms and some students walk up to four kilometers per day to attend classes.

“When I do charity and I do small things like give candy to poor kids they are happy and smile, and when I give old people clothes and they say ‘thank you,’ it warms my heart and makes me feel good knowing I’ve brightened their day,” said Bui.

Da Nang Go will continue its ongoing fundraising and aid missions to help people around central Vietnam affected by these historically devastating storms and typhoons. Both Pacific Links Foundation and Da Nang Go are continuing to deliver aid packages and funds in the aftermath of Typhoon Vamco.

As much as these local charities and NGOs have brought much-needed relief for affected communities, in terms of food, clothing, school supplies, and direct funding, what is really needed now in terms of the recovery effort is the rebuilding of infrastructure, houses, and technological networks, and a re-supply of livestock to get things back to normal.

In both cases, the U.S. became involved in a foreign war without having a clear picture of what our ultimate objective was. We largely took over the direction of each war from a corrupt host government. Many citizens of our host country placed reliance on the U.S. to provide for their safety, come what may. The war became unwinnable because of a series of unfortunate decisions. Losing interest in the endeavor, we shaped settlement terms the host government was required to accept, intimating we would be there to help if worse came to worst. Here, the similarity ends, for now.

In the case of Vietnam, even though we knew weeks beforehand that the fall of South Vietnam was imminent, we made no concerted effort to extract the Vietnamese who had steadfastly supported the U.S. When their government fell, many thousands who had helped, trusted and relied upon us were murdered or incarcerated to the great dishonor of our nation. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the south and, although we gave many of them sanctuary, our help was slow in coming. The final chapter in Afghanistan has yet to be written, but it must not end up with a betrayal of our friends.

During the long and tortured course of America’s war in Afghanistan, many Afghans stepped forward at their great peril to serve and help protect our military personnel. As we withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban have stepped up their violent attacks and the danger to our friends has dramatically increased. We are morally obligated to provide them sanctuary within our borders.

There are two special immigrant visa (SIV) programs in place to bring our Afghan friends to the U.S., but they are mired in red tape — it takes up to three years to process an application. There is a backlog of nearly 19,000 SIV applicants, with about 50,000 family members. They are waiting in line, living in fear of death. There are not enough slots to take care of the backlog. The vetting process is understaffed, underfunded and overly burdensome.

In this crisis situation, there are two feasible alternatives — either review existing documentation in the files and grant visas to those who U.S. personnel have credibly vouched for in the files, or extract the SIVs and families from Afghanistan and complete any necessary vetting in a safe location. We processed South Vietnamese refugees at U.S. military bases in the late 1980s.

We need, also, to consider the plight of Afghans who don’t qualify for SIV status. A Taliban take-over, which appears increasingly likely, will create a flood of refugees, fleeing for their very lives. Being partially responsible for their plight, we are honor bound to provide sanctuary for many of them, just as we eventually did for those fleeing Vietnam. We should plan to evacuate Afghans who will be targets of Taliban reprisal — uncorrupted government and military officials, women’s rights advocates, educators, democracy advocates and the like.

Like many troops who served in America’s wars, this issue is very personal for me. I lived and worked with South Vietnamese soldiers in 1968-1969. I trusted them with my life, while they relied on the U.S. government as a friend and ally. Most of my Vietnamese friends were Catholics who moved from North Vietnam to Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam in 1954 to escape persecution. They were fiercely anti-communist and pro-American. It broke my heart when the communists took over in April 1975, knowing that my friends would be killed or imprisoned, as were many thousands of their countrymen. We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate. We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us.

Today, while in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced the United States is providing an additional $2 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to Typhoon Molave and the ongoing severe flooding that has affected Central Vietnam since early October. This amount brings the total humanitarian assistance from the U.S. Government for people touched by the floods to $2.1 million.

With this new funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is ramping up efforts to meet emergency needs in communities affected by Vietnam’s historic typhoon season. Typhoon Molave, which made landfall in Central Vietnam on October 28, 2020, is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. Typhoon Molave follows weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1.5 million people and killed more than 130.

In response, USAID’s partners, including the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC), are addressing the immediate needs of the affected families for food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Because the floods have washed away livestock, farms, and infrastructure, USAID’s partners also will provide assistance to these families as they begin to restore their livelihoods.

This assistance builds on USAID’s long-term investments in Vietnam to reduce the risk and impact of disasters. With funding from USAID, for example, the VNRC has been on the front lines in responding to the impact of severe weather throughout this typhoon season.

The United States stands with the people of Vietnam during this difficult time.

8,8,FL-2017-000120-VNM,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

9,9,FL-2017-000120-VNM,Vietnam flood death toll rises as storm Nangka dumps more rain - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/12/vietnam-flood-death-toll-rises-as-storm-nangka-to-dump-more-rain,"Most of the 23 victims were washed away by floodwaters as nearly 46,000 people have been evacuated from affected areas.

Vietnam’s flood death toll rose to at least 23 and authorities said the incoming storm Nangka would dump more heavy rain on the country in the coming days.

The floods also left at least 14 people missing in Vietnam’s central provinces, the government said in a statement on Monday.

Most of the victims were washed away by floodwaters, the national disaster management authority said, adding local authorities evacuated nearly 46,000 people from affected areas.

The floods have inundated more than 109,000 homes and 1,443 acres (584 hectares) of crops and damaged roads and bridges, the agency added.

A military helicopter rescues sailors from a submerged ship at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri province [Ho Cau/Reuters] Separately, a landslide on Monday reportedly buried 13 construction workers at a hydropower dam in the central province of Thua Thien Hue.

According to weather forecasters, water levels will keep rising, swelling rivers and submerging more communities in the region, the state-owned Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.

The situation worsened over the weekend when Tropical Storm Linfa, which weakened to a depression when it hit the country, brought more rain to the region.

Torrential rains have flooded central Vietnam and killed dozens since last week [Ho Cau/Reuters] “We received a report saying that between 10 and 13 workers have been buried in a landslide and we don’t know if they are still alive,” a disaster management official in Thua Thien Hue province told Reuters news agency by telephone.

Soldiers were deployed to the area to rescue the workers, said the official, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

“We are concerned that the incoming storm will worsen the flood situation,” the official said.

Storm Nangka, which is forecast to make landfall in northern Vietnam on Wednesday, will trigger heavy rain of up to 400 millimetres (16 inches) in parts of northern and central Vietnam from Wednesday through Friday, the national weather agency said.

Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding because of its long coastline. Natural disasters – predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms – killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.","Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-11T143755Z_682429121_RC2EGJ9EKRCW_RTRMADP_3_VIETNAM-FLOODS.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'rises', 'official', 'death', 'flood', 'nangka', 'dumps', 'workers', 'province', 'rain', 'central', 'floods', 'agency', 'country', 'toll']", ,flood

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Vietnam and local people’s generosity.Luu Thi Phuong, 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.“Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children,” she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.“I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDP’s 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.“Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam,” she said.“However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.”Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last year’s floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.”Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.“It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life,” he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: “I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).“In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households,” said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing. At least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or collapsed./.","Tue, 04 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://en.vietnamplus.vn/favicon.ico,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'receive', 'storms', 'nam', 'quang', 'residents', 'undp', 'nams', 'central', 'support', 'house', 'houses', 'safe']", ,flood
11,11,FL-2017-000120-VNM,How flood protection can paradoxically put people at risk - Horizon,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/how-flood-protection-can-paradoxically-put-people-risk.html,"Professor Jeroen Aerts, a hydrologist at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in The Netherlands, says that when a city builds a defensive wall or dyke, it can make its citizens feel so secure that they actually flock to live or to develop businesses in the protected area. What’s more, they don’t bother to install their own flood protection.

This means that when rare – but inevitable – extreme flooding occurs the damage can be colossal.

It is just one way in which flood protection modellers may be underestimating – and sometimes overestimating – the true consequences of sea level rise, says Prof. Aerts. And it is happening because physical scientists are failing to integrate human behaviour into their models.

Prof. Aerts leads a team that is trying to change this using the technique of agent-based modelling which attempts to reproduce complex phenomena like human behaviour. They use software that creates autonomous decision-making entities called agents, each of which assesses its situation and makes a decision based on a set of rules that have been drawn from survey data and decision theory.

Last year, they published a paper that underlined the problem of the safe development paradox. By modelling what is known about how humans behave when governments install flood protection where they live and work, the team demonstrated that ‘the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas.’

But the study went on to show that governments could ‘largely counteract’ this effect if they simultaneously promoted policies that encourage people to flood-proof their buildings.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’ Prof. Jeroen Aerts, Vrije University, The Netherlands

Migration

Prof. Aerts believes that the failure of physical scientists to take human behaviour into account may also have led them to misjudge the degree to which flooding will drive migration. What’s more, it means they are not identifying precisely where it would be best to target help, because the models don’t distinguish adequately between those who will manage to look after themselves and those who won’t.

Sea level rise will, it is commonly predicted, displace 187 million people by 2100. But the figure, which comes from a 2011 study, is controversial.

‘Most modelling studies that deal with flooding risk or sea level rise use a top-down approach,’ said Prof. Aerts. ‘You have long-term scenarios – like how many centimetres is sea level going to rise, and what will the exposed population be … and you try to estimate the impact.’ Then, he said, the models are rerun to include the effects of various adaptation measures, such as dykes or managed retreat, after which researchers do a cost-benefit analysis.

But, Prof. Aerts said, ‘they forget about (asking) what is the probability that this dyke will be built? Or what is the probability that people will retreat? So they do not take into account the human behavioural factor which determines whether or not this measure will be implemented.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’

Factors that get ignored include evidence that people’s decisions to migrate, or to stay and defend their land, vary with their wealth, age, risk perception, trust of government and attitudes to individual freedom.

Social scientists

Prof. Aerts says that his team is now turning the models on their head, in a new project known as COASTMOVE. They are integrating a global coastal flood risk model with an agent-based model to simulate how governments, private sector actors such as insurance companies, and individuals act and influence each other.

Another difference is that social scientists are feeding data into the project.

‘They provide me with the information about under what conditions are people going to implement a certain measure, from the individual level to the higher aggregate government level,’ said Prof. Aerts.

Some of this information is from pre-existing surveys on what drives people to migrate or otherwise respond to floods. The rest will be gathered from new surveys in six coastal areas in France, Ghana, the Marshall Islands, the United States, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Other, less traditional sources of information will come from data already collected via mobile phones, Twitter posts and even tax returns.

They will use data from Bangladesh, for example, where other researchers have been able to discover, from anonymised mobile phone data, how many people have fled from floods, where they travelled, and how soon they returned. They will also use data that Prof. Aerts has gathered over the last six years using algorithms to monitor tweets that mention the word ‘flood’, in 20 different languages. This provides daily flood maps that give ‘a pretty good idea of where we can expect most of the problems’, he said.

More data is coming from the United States where it has been possible to draw conclusions about migration after flooding from the location from which people have filed their annual tax returns.

Vulnerabilities

By simulating adaptive behaviour, the team hopes to provide more refined predictions about the degree to which sea level rise will cause migration – in the form of 1x1km2 global migration maps.

Dr Bina Desai, head of policy and research at the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, says that sea level rise will bring a variety of direct and indirect impacts, which will affect people differently depending on factors such as inequality and poverty, that are not adequately reflected in models.

‘What’s needed, if we think about risk of migration and displacement, is modelling with a less strong focus on the hazard and a stronger focus on underlying vulnerabilities and what exacerbates them,’ she said.

‘In principle, it’s the only way to do it,’ Dr Desai said of COASTMOVE’s approach. Even as a conceptual model, she adds, it will help to work out how the many factors interrelate.

‘The downside is to move beyond the conceptual model,’ she added. ‘If you want to translate that into numbers then (when we have tried it) we found we failed because all the inputs could not be populated with data.

‘But if they can find a way of doing it by (collecting enough data), using proxies and making assumptions and somehow modelling it out then I think that’s great.’

Just how are our seas changing and rising with climate change and the melting of Earth’s ice caps? This is the final story in a three-part series looking at the past, present and future of extreme sea level rise. In part one, we looked at what the last interglacial can tell us about extreme sea level rise and in part two we looked at rise of atmospheric ‘meteotsunamis’.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

i. Deliver immediate, life-saving assistance to those in the most urgent need, in support of the Government response and in line with Government requests for assistance.

ii. Ensure the most vulnerable people, including women and children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and LGBTIQ persons, are protected against violence and have equal access to humanitarian assistance and services without discrimination.

iii. Prevent the outbreak of communicable diseases and effectively monitor risks to the health of the affected population, including the nutrition status of vulnerable people such as pregnant and lactating women and children under five years of age. Deliver assistance in a manner that minimises the risk of COVID-19 for disaster-affected people.

iv. Ensure access to multi sectoral assistance and re-establish critical services. Promote the repair of key public service infrastructure in affected provinces, ensure food security, by restoring lost food stock, livestock and livelihoods, ensure access to sustainable drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene supplies, housing, replacement of productive assets and household items, and access to basic medical, social and public services to support the affected population transition to recovery and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

On 13 October, the Government of Viet Nam released a call for emergency relief and support following four tropical cyclones and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which combined have caused severe and widespread flooding, landslides, storm surge and strong winds since 6 October. As of 28 October, 214 people have reportedly been killed or are missing, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). An estimated 7.7 million people live in areas affected by flooding caused by the multiple storms, with some 1.5 million people in nine provinces directly affected and approximately 380,000 houses flooded, damaged or destroyed. Of those people directly affected by the current disaster, some 753,000 are women and girls, 134,000 are children under five, and 143,000 are over 65 years old.

On the morning of 11 October, Tropical Storm Linfa (Storm No. 6) made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Viet Nam, resulting in 150 to 300 mm of rain. This was followed on 14 October by Tropical Storm Nangka (Storm No. 7) which made landfall in northern Viet Nam, but also brought a further 150 mm of rain to the still flooded provinces of central Viet Nam. On 16 October, tropical depression INVEST 94W in the East Sea weakened into a low-pressure area and made landfall in the central provinces, and was subsequently followed by Tropical Storm Saudel (Storm No. 8) which made landfall in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces on 25 October. On 28 October, Tropical Cyclone Molave (Storm No. 9) made landfall in approximately the same area as Tropical Storm Linfa, with up to 700 mm of rain reported in Nghe An and Ha Thinh provinces and up to 400 mm of rain in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces.

In Quang Ngai province, some 17,000 people were evacuated because of the strong winds and rain. Between 5 and 20 October, VNDMA reported that many areas in central Viet Nam recorded a total rainfall of more than 2,400 mm, and in some locations, flood waters exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1979 and 1999.

As of 29 October, nine provinces have been affected by the cumulative impacts of the multiple storms including Tropical Cyclone Molave. These are, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Nghe An, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum provinces, with Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces most severely affected.

Following Tropical Cyclone Molave, more than 88,000 houses and 50 schools had their roofs blown off, the majority in Quang Ngai province, and some 375,000 people were evacuated to evacuation centres. Those in the evacuation centres are amongst the most vulnerable having had their houses damaged or destroyed and having lost key household items in the floods. Many of the evacuation centres are overcrowded, do not have access to sufficient basic facilities such as water and sanitation, and health care, and lack appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children.

As well as damage to houses, some 30,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged (including rice, other crops, and aquatic products) and more than 2 million cattle and poultry have been killed. This is likely to have severe impacts on food security and livelihoods, especially for those people who were already experiencing adverse economic impacts due to COVID19. Further, more than 360 schools have been flooded and damaged, with detrimental impacts on children’s ability to continue accessing education. In addition, more than 78 health centres and hospitals have also been damaged or flooded.

To date, the delivery of assistance has been hampered by extensive damage to public transportation infrastructure. VNDMA reports that more than 165 km of national highway, 140 km of local roads and three bridges have been heavily damaged. Rescue teams are accessing affected areas by boat to deliver relief items and to evacuate vulnerable people, prioritizing children, people with disabilities and elderly people. Communication has also been hampered by the loss of electricity in many affected areas.

The areas most severely affected by flooding are also those same provinces which experienced a second wave of COVID19 cases in July and August. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, a further thirty days of lockdown measures were implemented from 28 July to 5 September, with adverse socio-economic impacts for the region which already records higher than national average multidimensional poverty rates. As a consequence of COVID-19 related measures, the most vulnerable people had already had their coping capacities eroded prior to this current disaster and are thus in more acute need of immediate assistance to help them manage the current, compound crisis.

From 20 and 23 October, joint GovernmentUN-NGO assessments were undertaken in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai provinces. Key findings from the assessments include the need for emergency food assistance for 177,000 of the most vulnerable people, restoration of agricultural land, safe access to clean water and sanitation facilities including in health centres and schools, the provision of dignity kits for women and girls, provision of education supplies and alternative learning solutions to ensure continuity of learning, support for those people evacuated from their homes, repairs for damaged houses, replacement of basic household items, health support especially maternal and child health, risk communication activities, provision of micro nutrients and continuation of nutrition activities to prevent an increase in rates of malnutrition.

Protection has been identified as a key need in this response, including the immediate need to ensure protection and safeguards for women and children currently living in evacuation centres. Partners involved in the development of this plan have also highlighted the need to provide assistance in a gender-responsive manner that addresses the specific needs of women and girls. The Government has requested that all relief activities target the most vulnerable people, including poor, near poor, people living with disabilities, children, femaleheaded households and elderly people, which are the target populations for this response plan.","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/VNM-ResponsePlan-201031-051%20%281%29.jpg?itok=QHnLLURt,"['plan', 'response', 'nam', 'quang', 'provinces', '2020', 'viet', 'tropical', 'floods', 'affected', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'assistance', 'storm', 'including']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The lower Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam) experienced prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020 until early December 2020. This was due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka as well as tropical depression INVEST 94W. The three wind systems made landfall in Vietnam but brought along heavy rain to the rest of the lower Mekong region. Tropical storm Linfa made landfall on 11 October 2020, tropical storm Nangka made landfall on 14 October 2020 whilst tropical depression INVEST 94W made landfall on 16 October 2020.

The rainfall brought by the wind systems resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in southern Lao PDR. As of 20 October 2020, nine districts in three provinces of Salawan, Savannaket and Sekong were affected by the floods. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Based on an initial assessment on 20 October 2020, conducted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) with participation of Lao Red Cross, it was highlighted that 163 villages in the three provinces, with an estimated 15,305 households (97,514 people) were affected. Savannaket was the worst affected province with more than 10,000 households from 137 villages were reportedly affected in the province and two people had lost their lives. In Sekong province, around 3,000 people were affected, and two people had lost their lives. Salawan province reported more than 600 people affected with five deaths.

Cyclone Molave – the fourth tropical cyclone to threaten Vietnam this month – is barrelling towards the country’s central coast, worsening severe floods and landslides that have inundated parts of the region for weeks.

Vietnamese authorities are rushing to evacuate half a million people before Molave makes a projected 28 October landfall, packing wind speeds topping 110 kilometres per hour. The country is already struggling with intense floods and landslides that have killed at least 130 people and damaged a quarter of a million homes.

The Vietnamese Red Cross has already warned that 160,000 people may need food aid over the next six months, but that figure could rise after Molave makes landfall and its impact becomes more clear.

Aid groups say parts of Vietnam are seeing their worst floods and landslides in two decades. Disasters are common during Asia’s various monsoon seasons, but this month’s flurry of storms has aggravated conditions, with weeks of extended heavy rainfall.

Parts of Laos and Cambodia are also submerged. And Thailand is projecting that Molave's rains will hit the country’s north and northeast.

Before threatening Southeast Asia’s Mekong region, Cyclone Molave uprooted some 25,000 people in the Philippines earlier this week.

Hue, Vietnam – Before floodwater inundated half their living room one night during the storm season this year, the Trans put their most valuable possessions – their TV and refrigerator – in the attic and told their two daughters to take refuge there.

Tran Nhu Hong, 23, and her 18-year-old sister, who do not know how to swim, survived the storms – the worst her generation had ever experienced and the worst her parents had seen in decades.

A neighbour was not so fortunate. The 19-year-old student was swept away in the floods after the vehicle she was travelling in was tipped over by the force of the water – on the same route the two young women usually take.

“Shortly after the water retreated, I went on that route and the vehicle was still there and had not yet been pulled out (of the mud),” Hong said. “I don’t dare to go on that route late at night any more.”

Across central Vietnam, cascading floods from October onward inundated the living and the dead, as record rainfall submerged towns and cemeteries. Authorities said earlier this month that the typhoons, which they referred to as “abnormal”, cost the Southeast Asian country 30 trillion dong ($1.3bn) in damage and killed at least 192 people – a death toll more than five times higher than the 35 COVID-19 deaths Vietnam recorded this year.

A woman drives along a flooded road beside submerged rice fields [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “In general, it is well-established that rainfall from typhoons is increasing due to climate change, both from observations and from models,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead climate scientist at the Red Cross Climate Center and World Weather Attribution, whose team is conducting a study on the role of climate change in the recent floods and typhoons in central Vietnam.

Crops destroyed

With 70 percent of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas, Vietnam is highly exposed to riverine and coastal flooding and is also one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.

“There is even more damage after the floods,” Hong said, driving by rice fields made inlets because of the storms and floods in her hometown in Thua Thien Hue Province.

When the water retreated, it took crops with it, leaving behind scarred earth. Many farming families in central Vietnam count on rice, various other crops and cattle for income, especially as the Lunar New Year celebration, known as Tet, nears.

Tet is usually when Vietnamese shop for new clothes, gifts and appliances to welcome a new, fulfilling beginning; but with their homes and means of living ravaged by violent storms, severe floods and devastating landslides, Tet, which will take place in February, is likely to be tinged with sadness.

Hong’s parents are still recovering from the wounds and infections they got from wading through hip-high flood water for extended periods, and have yet to find jobs as construction workers due to the double burden of COVID-19 and the recent natural disasters.

Ichiro Sato, senior associate with the Climate Program and Sustainable Finance Center at US-based think tank World Resources Institute, says central Vietnam was battling extreme weather events long before climate change started to take effect.

“If governments have not been well-prepared even for the conventional risk of weather-related disasters that existed before climate change – and I am afraid that is the case for Central Vietnam – then there are so many things they have to work on before worrying about the additional risk of climate change,” Sato said, adding that unregulated urbanisation and economic growth may increase vulnerability to weather-related disasters in places like Vietnam.

The country typically endures between five and six storms and about three tropical depressions a year, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, but in 2020 a total of at least 14 ravaged the country. Seven consecutive tropical storms and cyclones hit the central region between October and mid-November.

Children at risk

According to the UN, an estimated 7.7 million people in nine provinces, including 2.5 million children, were affected – with hundreds of thousands of houses flooded, damaged or destroyed.

“There is no doubt that children are those most affected by natural disasters,” Rana Flowers, UNICEF representative in Vietnam, told Al Jazeera, adding that families’ ability to secure nutritious food for their children had already suffered as a result of the pandemic.

An estimated 375,000 people were sent to evacuation centres during the storms and floods, including about 90,000 children, according to Flowers.

“Many of the evacuation sites were overcrowded, did not have access to sufficient water and sanitation and healthcare, and lacked appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children,’’ Flowers said, adding that the situation severely affected the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children.

A study brief published in August by the US-based Society for Research in Child Development showed that children may suffer longer-term physical and psychological deficits than adults, including difficulty sleeping or concentrating and losing interest in their usual activities – chronic mental health symptoms have been observed among children as long as four years after a disaster.

Deforestation, which affects the ability of the land to retain water, also contributed to the flooding and a series of severe landslides during the stormy season, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said at a legislative National Assembly meeting last month.

Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam lost 657,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of primary forest – 23 percent of its total tree-cover loss according to data from international monitoring service Global Forest Watch. About 50 percent of all tree-cover loss between 2001 and 2019 took place in 11 of the country’s 63 provinces – eight of them in central Vietnam, it said.

The devastating landslides and flooding have prompted concerns about deforestation caused by the construction of hydropower plants in forests.

As of 2018, there were 385 dams in operation, with an additional 143 under construction, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Earlier this month, the minister acknowledged the increased evidence of the loss of watershed forests and vegetation, as well as a loss of soil adhesion, as a result of the developments.

The government has also announced sustainable and long-term missions to cope with storms in central Vietnam, including upgrading climate-change adaptation scenarios and relocating people in areas at risk of landslide and flooding.

No place like home

For those who have been living in the area for generations, like the parents of 21-year-old university student Le Thi Thuyen, leaving their storm-battered homes seems unfathomable.

“We can be accustomed to annual storms but whenever they come, we are still worried,” said Thuyen, a native of Quang Binh, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the central region.

Thuyen, who left for Ho Chi Minh City to study and is currently an intern at a non-governmental organisation in Vietnam’s biggest city, called her parents and siblings back home every day when the storms were pounding their commune, flooding and isolating homes in low-lying areas.

Tears welled up in her eyes when she thought of her 12-year-old brother who does not know how to swim.

Cemeteries were inundated as floodwaters rose in central Vietnam [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “I read news about kids who got swept away by the flood and I was really worried about my brother,” the 21-year-old said.

Thuyen’s parents, who make a living from agriculture and working on other people’s farms, have already been struggling this year because of the pandemic – and the storm season has created more problems, destroying their crops, and fish. It also meant weeks when there were no jobs to be found.

“Tet this year won’t be as fulfilling as others for us,” Thuyen said. “This time, it won’t be my parents supporting me, but I will be supporting them with what I can.”","Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/000_8V93XX-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'children', 'storms', 'water', 'change', 'pieces', 'central', 'relentless', 'floods', 'parents', 'living', 'pick', 'vietnamese', '2020s', 'climate']", ,flood

By Vatican News staff writer

Volunteers and workers of Caritas Vietnam are visiting and assisting people in the central provinces who have to face the brunt of 13 storms this year with some severe flooding.

The umpteenth storm

In just over a month, Vietnam's central region has seen 7 tropical storms and typhoons, causing floods and landslides that killed 235 people and caused an estimated $740,000 in damage in several provinces. The rain from the storms has caused the worst flooding in the region in more than 30 years.

The latest of these typhoons, Vamco, made landfall in Vietnam on Sunday with winds of up to 150 kph, after leaving 67 dead in the Philippines. The storm has damaged more than 400,000 homes, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. At least 150,000 people are at risk of going hungry.

According to Caritas, the social arm of the Catholic Church, rebuilding homes and recovering their livelihood are extremely important apart from immediate help and survival. Farming, such as growing vegetables, rice, raising livestock and poultry, which is the mainstay in the central provinces, has been devastated. Many families have lost everything in the floods and landslides.



Local Caritas in action

The new director of Caritas Vietnam, Father Joseph Ngo Si Dinh, led a delegation to the central provinces, Nov. 9-11, to survey the flooded areas. They first visited the Diocese of Hu? and its two adjoining provinces, talking to families and providing them material and spiritual support.

Father John Nguyen Huy Tuan, director of Caritas Ha Tinh, said priests were actively involved in bringing food and relief to the affected people and moving them to safer places.

Temporary shelters have been built to accommodate 25 families. A parish mobilised its young people to rescue families trapped in flooded homes.

No one excluded

Caritas Vietnam, in collaboration with dioceses and parishes, has been engaged in social outreach and charity works to help people after natural disasters.

The social arm of the Catholic Church assists people to rebuild their lives, repair damaged houses and build new homes for families who have lost theirs. It also provides people and families with seeds, livestock, water filtering systems, and finance for school children.

Caritas discussed ways to come up with concrete plans or projects to rebuild the lives of people regardless of their religion. Father Dinh has urged Catholics to help every person in need. “We hope that the people most affected by these storms, be they Catholic or not, will get some relief,” the Caritas director said.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/reuters/2020/10/13/14/1602592734645.JPG/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'storms', 'provinces', 'flood', 'caritas', 'social', 'homes', 'central', 'region', 'families', 'typhoons', 'storm', 'victims', 'assisting']", ,flood

On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.

The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.

The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.

On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh 400-500 mm, Quang Tri 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City 1,100 mm, Quang Nam 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai 600-800 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In this period, more than 130,000 houses, mostly in Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue provinces had been flooded, with some submerged by four meters.

Streak of tragedies

Around 3 a.m. on October 8, cargo vessel Vietship 01 of a Hanoi-based logistics firm was swept away by floods and rough seas as it docked at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri.

The ship had 12 male crew members on board when swept off. Four crew members who had fallen from the vessel made it safely to shore on October 9 and 10. One member, aged 45, had also jumped into the water but went missing before his body was retrieved on October 11.

Heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas derailed rescue efforts and the vessel sank to the bottom in shallow waters, leaving the rest of the crew and one fisherman, part of a rescue squad, stranded at sea.

It took rescue teams three days to reach the stranded vessel.

""It was difficult for modern vessels to reach the stranded ship so we had to rely on rudimentary boats and experienced fishermen for the mission,"" explained Colonel Le Van Phuong, head of Quang Tri Border Guard.

On the morning of October 11, the fisherman and a crew member jumped into the water and battled their way back through the rough seas and strong waves. Two teams of rescuers rushed to deliver them safely to shore.

Within the same day, a military helicopter was sent to the scene to rescue the remaining six crew members stuck on the vessel. Two days after he was rescued, however, ship captain Nguyen Van Bao, 51, passed away due to multiple organ failure and sepsis.

At midnight on October 12, a hill collapsed onto an operation center of Rao Trang 3 Hydropower Plant, located deep in a jungle of Phong Xuan Commune, Phong Dien District in Thua Thien-Hue.

The landslide buried 17 workers after 40 others escape to a nearby plant, called Rao Trang 4.

The story of the 17 workers is even more tragic since a 21-member rescue team that had set out to verify reports of their predicament got struck by the same calamity.

At midnight the next day, a landslide had buried the ranger station housing the entire rescue team. Only eight members managed to escape, with the remaining 13 confirmed dead, including Major General Nguyen Van Man, deputy commander of the 4th Military Region of Vietnam People's Army. The bodies of the 13 victims have all been found and identified, though only five of the 17 workers' bodies have been retrieved.

During funeral procedures for the 12 soldiers and their deputy commander, another landslide struck a barracks housing 27 personnel of Defense Economics Division 337, also managed by the 4th Military Region.

The division had been assigned to assist five remote communes in Huong Hoa District of Quang Tri, which borders Laos, in mitigating the impacts of prolonged flooding and landslides triggered by abnormally heavy downpours across the central region.

As the mountain collapsed onto their barracks in the first hours of October 19, the 27 division members were all sleeping, with only five managing to escape. Three more landslides buried the remaining 22.

By the afternoon of that day, all 22 bodies had been retrieved.

Luong Thi Ly, who lost her son Le The Linh to the landslide, said she could not believe he and his comrades had lost their lives during peace time.

New flood waves

And as mountainous areas reeled under repeated landslides, urban and coastal areas were hit by a new wave of flooding on October 18 and 20 due to the impact of tropical storms, the intertropical convergence zone and east winds in tandem with water discharged from dam projects.

On October 18, flood peaks recorded on the Hieu River of Quang Tri hit 5.36 m, passing the record level of 1983 by 0.78 m, while the peak on the Thach Han River rose to 7.4 m, 0.11 m higher than the 1999 record. In Quang Binh, floodwaters were measured at 4.88 m on October 19, or 0.97 m higher than the record in 1999.

For the second flood wave, more than 177,000 households in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri were inundated by floodwaters 1-4 m deep.

Many elderly people in Ha Tinh said for the past 40 years, they had never seen such severe flooding causing such serious damage.

In Quang Binh's Le Thuy District, a family who lost their 75-year-old grandmother, on October 17, had to hang her coffin from the roof of their house for nearly a week to avoid floodwaters.

More storms, floods and landslides

With heavy rains yet to show any signs of receding, Storm Saudel developed in the East Sea on October 20, though it had weakened and turned into a tropical depression as it reached the central coast on October 25.

Two days later, Molave entered the East Sea and headed straight to central Vietnam. It landed over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28 as the most powerful storm to have hit Vietnam in 20 years.

The storm had inflicted economic damage worth around VND10 trillion ($430.16 million), according to statistics from affected provinces. The loss was nearly 1.5 times higher than 2019’s total natural disaster-induced damage of VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), mostly ascribed to flooding, storms and landslides.

Subsequently, the storm triggered heavy rains that had led to more floods and landslides.

On October 28 alone, two different landslides struck Tra Leng and Tra Van communes in Quang Nam’s Nam Tra My District.

The Tra Van landslide buried 20, killing eight and injuring 12 while in Tra Leng, a mountain collapsed on 53 villagers, with 33 managing to escape, eight confirmed dead, and 12 still missing.

One day later in Phuoc Loc Commune, Phuoc Son District of Quang Nam, another landslide buried 11 victims. Seven have since been confirmed dead and four are still missing.

A survivor of the Tra Leng landslide, Nguyen Thanh Son, 56, had lost his wife to the accident. The bereaved husband cannot believe he has lost his family, house and entire village in the mere blink of an eye.

""Altogether, tumbling soil, mud, rocks, water and trees smashed in the roofs of our houses, sweeping everything away until hitting the foot of another mountain,"" Son recalled.

By the night of October 28, more than 4,000 families in Nghe An and Ha Tinh had been evacuated to safety after their neighborhoods had been submerged by up to two meters of water.

The third flood lasted until October 30 and by November 1, had receded.

While central Vietnam residents recuperate from Storm Molave and prior flooding, Storm Goni entered the East Sea on Monday morning, forecast to strike central areas from Da Nang to Phu Yen in the next few days.","Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/02/huu-khoa-tang-le-1-1603267441-7792-8579-1604304150_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'quang', 'central', 'landslide', 'month', 'tragedies', 'mm', 'crew', 'storm', 'rescue', 'day', 'm']", ,flood

A search operation has been launched for a missing rescue team as severe flooding and landslides battered central Vietnam, authorities said on Wednesday, as the country braced for further heavy rain.

Close to a million people have been impacted by heavy downpours and rising waters since mid last week, with more than 200,000 homes flooded, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Thirty-six people are now dead, Vietnam's disaster management authority said, while rescue workers have launched a search for around 30 people missing at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue province following landslides.

The missing include a team of soldiers and officials who had tried to find plant workers who disappeared days ago.

Images on state media showed helicopters and hundreds of soldiers struggling to access the site through thick mud and fallen trees.

Elsewhere across the central region, villages and rice fields were submerged, with relief workers resorting to makeshift boats and canoes to deliver food and bottled water to those stuck in flooded homes.

North central Vietnam was also hit by severe weather on Wednesday as Storm Nangka made landfall.

Forecasters said it could bring further rain in the coming days, while warning another storm was expected to form and make impact this weekend.

The IFRC said it had ""grave fears"" that the deadly floods would worsen as more rain was dumped on hard hit communities.

""These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods,"" said IFRC's Hung Ha Nguyen.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and is often affected by more than a dozen storms each year, regularly bringing flooding and landslides.

More then 130 people were reported dead or missing due to natural disasters in the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. “I wasn’t sad,” Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017’s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tay’s land. “That’s what I had to do.” He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldn’t be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasn’t wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. “Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them,” landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a “soft” levee girding the riverbank. She doesn’t view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. “The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and you’ve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made.” Dao’s mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, “a very sensitive and fragile area where ‘hard’ solutions [to erosion] won’t work”, said Dao, who has studied the region’s ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The “common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land”, Dao says. “Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down.” As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Dao’s words, “by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous”. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tay’s riverbank is like a pillow that doesn’t stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Dao’s green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses — a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, “people aren’t afraid of flooding”, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. “We have learnt to live with the floods,” he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. “Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive,” he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yen’s fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the island’s west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals’ trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the city’s famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes aren’t simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi An’s recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground.

In the past it was culture, now it’s ecology,” Hoi An’s vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local government’s development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. “Of course, it is difficult and it will take time,” says Hung. “Perhaps we won’t succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation.” As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemic’s wake, Hung doesn’t want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the city’s revenue. “We’ve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, there’ll be less to worry about.“

Ecology-based development, in Hung’s words, also means preserving the city’s forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. “If we achieve that, we’ll be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals’ life will definitely be improved.” Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. “You don’t see erosion here, but build-up [of land],” said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. “I’ve never seen these trees die because of flooding,” said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the river’s mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huong’s family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as “a fortune” on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river.

Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. “The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; that’s why they protect it,” Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tay’s sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi An’s toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

Molave hit as the equivalent of a Category 2 Atlantic hurricane, packing sustained winds of 165 kilometers per hour (103 miles per hour). The storm is expected to bring rains and dangerous winds as it pushes over the mountains of Southeast Asia, causing potential flash floods and landslides.

""This is a very strong typhoon that will impact a large area,"" Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said before the storm made landfall

Some 310,000 homes were already damaged from last week's deadly flooding, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), with the organization warning that close to 1.2 million people were ""in severe danger and in need of relief.""

""It is estimated that at least 150,000 people are at immediate risk of food shortages and hunger after thousands of hectares of crops have been destroyed,"" the IFRC said last week.

The death toll from flooding and landslides in Vietnam continued to rise Tuesday, while those hit by the disasters triggered by tropical storms in the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos criticized government inaction and made urgent appeals for assistance.

In Vietnam, at least 104 people are dead in the country’s central region, with 49, 27, and 11 deaths reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam alone, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Control. Twenty-seven people are missing, including 15 workers from a hydropower plant in Quang Tri that was hit by a landslide on Oct. 12.

The committee said that some 90,000 residents of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Tri provinces have been evacuated to higher ground. Nearly 7,000 hectares of rice paddy and crop fields have been submerged, while more than 5,800 head of cattle and 685,000 poultry birds have been killed or carried away in floods.

Vietnamese state media on Tuesday reported that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved the allocation of 100 billion Vietnamese dong (U.S. $4.3 million) and 1,000 tons of rice to the five worst flood-hit provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Ha Tinh.

Meanwhile, the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre said a tropical depression in the Philippines has strengthened into what is being called Storm Saudel. Over the next 24 hours, Saudel is expected to enter the South China Sea—called the East Sea in Vietnam—and become the eighth storm to batter Vietnam’s central provinces since the start of the rainy season.

Tran Quang Nang, head of the weather forecasting department under the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre, rejected reports circulating on Facebook, allegedly citing Japanese forecasters, that Saudel is a super typhoon.

“All of these predictions about Typhoon Saudel are baseless and fake,” Nang said. “The Japanese weather forecasting center and other countries have said no such thing.”

Nang called on the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to “punish” those responsible for spreading inaccurate information on social networks, causing public confusion.

“This issue should be handled promptly to ensure people only access accurate information released by the authorities so they can respond to natural disasters, helping to mitigate the damage they cause,” he said.

In Cambodia, the death toll remained at 25 from a day earlier, with some 40,000 evacuated to temporary shelters, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha told RFA’s Khmer Service. More than 200,000 hectares of paddy field and nearly 80,000 farms have also been destroyed, with more than 500 school buildings and 79 garment factories damaged.

Roads, hospitals, and dams have also been affected, authorities said.

In a notice issued on Tuesday, the Poipet Administration of Banteay Meanchey province, along Cambodia’s border with Thailand, temporarily closed portions of National Road 5. Downtown Poipet saw flooding of homes and roads, which the notice attributed to rains in Thailand.

Sann Ratha, a resident of Kaun Damrei village, in Poipet’s Sangkat Nimith district, told RFA that water levels increased so rapidly that several hundred families were forced to leave their homes.

He said people are stranded and in desperate need of food and other supplies.

“We are under the attack from the flood—our village looks like a river now with water everywhere and houses submerged,” he said.

“The current situation is worse than during the [1967-1975] civil war. We need the authorities to help us immediately.”

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen traveled to affected areas visiting with victims and handing out food. He said in a post to his Facebook page that he plans to spend two days in hard-hit Banteay Meanchey province, where 13 of the country’s 25 deaths have occurred and an estimated 20,000 families have been affected.

Opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha is also traveling to Banteay Meanchey to provide assistance.

Din Puthy, head of the Poipet-based Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association, expressed skepticism over the government’s handling of the flooding Tuesday.

He voiced concerns that authorities appear to prefer taking selfies with small numbers of villagers and posting them on social media to pretend they are helping the victims.

“The victims are not receiving equal treatment,” he said. “Only a few people have received some assistance while many others have been left behind.”

More aid needed

In Laos, where storms have ravaged Savannakhet province in the country’s center, authorities remained unable to access many areas due to damaged roads and a lack of boats to transport aid and other supplies, Lao sources said.

More than 125 villages in eight districts have now been flooded, with many houses and over 10,000 hectares of paddy fields submerged, official sources in the province say. Nearly 30,000 people have been impacted in Savannakhet, according to official count.

An official from Savannakhet’s inundated Phin district told RFA Tuesday that people are in need of dry goods, drinking water, medicine, and other necessities. The official said that while most aid had been distributed it still is not enough.

“In Phin district, 45 villages are heavily flooded, but they have received some help already—they mostly need sticky rice and consumer goods,” he said.

He said villagers with boats had been using them to help one another and that there have been no accidents during rescue and supply operations.

A villager in Phin told RFA that the water level is so high that the local river had flooded homes along its banks and urged authorities to provide more assistance.

“They have helped a little, but it’s very difficult for us,” he said. “Higher-level authorities should take care of this. We’re asking for more rice—all houses need rice to eat.”

Authorities in Savannakhet’s Xonbury district said waters remain high and will rise in days to come, forcing villagers to stay in clubs, schools, and other places set up by the local government as temporary shelters until flooding recedes.

According to the Meteorology Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Laos will continue to endure heavy rains and strong winds throughout the country in coming days. It urged villagers to remain vigilant for flash floods and landslides.

Storm Molave, which made landfall at around 11 am local time on Wednesday, is one of the strongest storms to hit the southeast Asian nation in 20 years.

The resulting “extreme rainfall” could continue over the coming days, worsening the already precarious situation faced by many families, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a statement.

“For the affected populations, their homes remain severely damaged, their food stocks have been lost, they have no access to clean water for drinking, washing and cooking; and water and sanitation systems have been damaged,” said the agency.

Evacuation centres flooded

Thousands have been moved to evacuation centres, which are themselves flooded, resulting in difficult health and hygiene conditions for the displaced people, primarily women, children and elderly. Health centres have also been damaged, leaving without to access basic health care services.

“Added to this is the trauma of the violent storms and rushing waters, that for a population where many cannot swim, creates fear and impacts mental wellbeing,” UNICEF added.

The storm has also damaged vital infrastructure, including electricity and roads, leaving many communities cut off from assistance and protection.

Affected populations

An estimated 7.7 million people live in the affected areas, including as many as 1.5 million who have been “directly affected”, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam said in a humanitarian update late Wednesday.

Of these, some 177,000 people considered vulnerable (poor or near-poor), should be prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance, it added.

Response

According to the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UN agencies and partners are developing and will release a multi-sector response plan, within the coming days, to support emergency relief efforts.

In the immediate term, UNICEF has mobilized to provide emergency water, nutrition, sanitation, education and protection support, it said in the statement. It is also coordinating with Government agencies and humanitarian actors to reach the most vulnerable and those most affected.

Description of the disaster

The central region of Viet Nam was experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimetres of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 150 millimetres of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. Additionally, Tropical Storm Saudel hit Viet Nam on 25 October closely followed by Typhoon Molave on 28 October. Typhoon Molave was one of the most devastating typhoons making landfall in Vietnam in decades. The typhoon made landfall after a series of tropical storms hitting Viet Nam and had caused severe flooding and at least three landslides which tragically resulted in the loss of 40 lives. 44 people are still missing, and six people are severely injured. On 5 November, Typhoon Goni made landfall in Viet Nam and Tropical Storm Atsani made landfall on 7 November. Tropical storm Vamco, was the latest to hit central Viet Nam as it made landfall on 15 November 2020.

The recurrent storms bringing heavy rainfall have caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. The Viet Nam National Disaster Management Agency (VNDMA) has reported that many areas in central Vietnam recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 1,600 millimeters between 5 to 20 October 2020, with peaks of 2,400 millimeters in some locations over the same period. The Hieu River (Quang Tri), Bo River (Hue), Gianh River and Kien Giang River (Quang Binh) have reached historically high levels, and in some locations flood waters have exceeded the previous historical highs recorded in 1979 and 1999. In addition, hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs to prevent them from bursting.

Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Authorities estimate that a nearly eight million people have been exposed to the storms, and some 1.5 million people have been directly affected by the storms and floods. On 4 November, ahead of typhoon Goni’s landfall, 98,819 households (372,631 people) in six provinces (Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen) were evacuated to safe shelters. Similarly, evacuations took place on 7 November in anticipation of typhoon Atsani, and on the 15th November ahead of typhoon Vamco’s landfall additional evacuations have been carried out in seven provinces of central Viet Nam with a total of 93,795 households (324,780 people) evacuated to safer places (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai).

Most of the people who had been evacuated have now returned home after their local authorities’ approval. They are actively repairing their homes with the help of their relatives. However, according to the VNDMA 31,637 households must be urgently relocated because they lost their shelter or their houses which have collapsed or been too heavily damaged, and they are now living with host families. After the latest typhoon (Vamco), according to the VNDMA, at least 243 are reported to have been killed or are missing and over two million livestock have been killed or swept away. The floods have caused significant damage to infrastructure including roads, schools, health centres and community facilities. It is reported that 1,569 schools have been affected included 360 schools flooded or damaged, while 46,916 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people are now in desperate needs of emergency relief, such as safe shelter, safe drinking water, food and livelihood income support.","Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1546577-MDRVN020eu1.png?itok=7nf8va0m,"['vietnam', 'n', 'nam', 'update', 'mdrvn020', 'quang', 'provinces', 'viet', 'storms', 'emergency', 'tropical', 'typhoon', 'n1', 'floods', 'central', 'storm', 'operation', 'landfall']", ,flood

These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.

Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.

The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.

As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing.

In addition, 150,000 people have been evacuated and significant impacts on transportation networks and agricultural livelihoods have been reported.

USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance partner VNRC is on the frontline of the response and has mobilized rapid disaster response teams established and trained through ongoing USAID disaster risk reduction programs to support evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency response operations, said the ambassador.

""We stand together with the government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones, address the damage caused by this terrible flood, and move forward, as the people of Vietnam have always done. We pledge to assist you in your work to rebuild,"" he said.

""I would also like to express my concern for persons with disabilities in the provinces affected by the typhoon as they are amongst the most vulnerable populations in this disaster. They are often home-bound, have less access to information and cannot take full advantage of preparedness activities and evacuation protocols,"" he added.

It is estimated that the provinces impacted by storm Linfa are home to over 200,000 persons with disabilities, of whom 61,000 are directly affected by this disaster.

Since 2000, USAID, through the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, has provided over $26 million in disaster response, preparedness, and risk reduction assistance in Vietnam.

Through the Department of Defense, the U.S. government has also provided more than $28 million since 1998 to train military and civilian emergency responders and develop and equip disaster management centers, maritime response centers, and disaster shelters at community level.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/17/anh124581602340198-1602931391-3782-3057-1602931440_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'response', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'central', 'aids', 'floods', 'landslide', 'usaid', 'affected', 'linfa', '100000', 'cope', 'provided']", ,flood

The campaign was organized by Ron Haeberle, the American photographer best known for capturing the My Lai Massacre in 1968, with assistance from Chuck Searcy, co-founder of Project RENEW, an organization that deals with unexploded ordnance left from the Vietnam War, according to a Thursday press release.

The funds would be distributed in Quang Tri Province by Project RENEW staff and in Quang Ngai Province by Quang Ngai Red Cross, it was added. Distribution in Quang Tri would begin on Jan. 25, while a check would be delivered by Project RENEW to Quang Ngai on Jan. 15, it said.

""We were moved by the images of mud slides, and water trapping villagers on the roofs of their homes and water roaring through village streets carrying away trees, furniture, animals and villagers themselves,"" Haeberle said. ""I have been committed to doing all I can to help the people of Vietnam ever since I personally witnessed American war crimes at My Lai.""

Last year, central Vietnam, particularly the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Quang Ngai and Quang Nam, were wrecked by a series of storms and tropical depressions.

The resulting floods and landslides killed at least 192 people and caused property losses of around VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion). More than 1,500 houses were destroyed and 240,000 others damaged. The daily lives of around 5.5 million people were severely disrupted.

The Vietnamese government has provided around VND770 billion to the region as emergency relief.

The fully probabilistic model provides countrywide coverage and enables insurers to assess their exposure to floods, which affect 70 percent of the country’s population.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue simulating both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding. The fluvial component of the hazard was developed using state-of-the-art hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate rainfall and river discharges across the river network in the country. Pluvial flooding is simulated using a proprietary, in-house methodology accounting for local climate conditions, soil type, land use and topography.

Offering enhanced flexibility, the model can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves, and average annual losses at virtually any level of aggregation. The model outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk® platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region. “The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon. These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.

The government decided to grant VND500 billion ($21.52 million) to five central provinces worst hit by historic flooding for rescue and social welfare support.

The five provinces, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Nam, would receive VND100 billion each as part of the government’s efforts to help local communities overcome the consequences of devastating floods, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh sait at a meeting in Quang Tri on Thursday morning.

The government also provided each of the five provinces with 1,000 tons of rice alongside medicine and antiseptic chemicals.

Senior Lieutenant General Le Chiem, Deputy Minister of National Defense, said the ministry has provided 22 tons of dried food to flooded provinces. For Quang Tri, military forces also provided seven motorboats, 36 generators and three water pumps for after-flood clean-up work along with 1,000 life jackets.

Chiem suggested local authorities distribute dried food to victims in flood-prone areas immediately and properly.

In the past, the defense ministry found ""some local leaders had given dried food to officials as gifts because it was delicious,"" Chiem said. ""The dried food is meant for flood victims. They are in need.""

Binh said damage caused by floods in Quang Tri was ""very huge,"" especially in the two mountainous districts of Huong Hoa and Dak Rong where infrastructure has been heavily affected.

Therefore, the government has granted an additional VND40 billion for these two districts to cope with the flood impacts.

Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said floodwater started receding gradually, so it is necessary to focus on relief for flood victims, from Quang Nam to Ha Tinh.

Many international organizations have pledged donations of cash and disaster relief to help central Vietnam.

For more than two weeks, the central region has been swept by historic flooding and deadly landslides that caused damage described by government officials as worst in five years.

At least 114 people in central Vietnam were killed by severe flooding and landslides and more than 170,000 houses in flood-prone Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces have been submerged, with many areas currently isolated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/huukhoatangle21603267443-16033-3261-6190-1603358848_1200x0.jpg,"['floodhit', 'dried', 'vietnam', 'binh', 'mln', 'quang', 'aid', 'provinces', '21', 'disaster', 'minister', 'central', 'grants', 'food', 'victims', 'support', 'tri', 'provided']", ,flood

Many parts of Hoi An, a famous tourist destination, are submerged.

Nguyen The Hung, vice chairman of the town, said the water level reached 1.3 meters on Thursday morning, 0.3 meters above flood danger level 1, prompting authorities to suspend all tourism-related activities.

Quang Tri, which has the historic Hien Luong Bridge and beautiful beaches, was hit by up to 409 mm of rain in the last two days.

Some residential areas in Lao Bao Town are under three meters of water.

Nguyen Khiem, a resident of Lao Bao, said: ""The floodwaters started to rise from Wednesday night. The water level is 0.5 m higher than during the historic floods of 2019.""

In Huong Hoa District 1,100 families have been evacuated to safer areas, but local authorities said four people were swept away and remain missing as of Thursday.

Many roads in Quang Tri have been blocked by severe landslides.

Quang Binh, home to Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and the world's largest cave Son Doong, received rainfall of up to 338 mm in a day. Many places are inundated and students have been told to stay at home to ensure their safety.

The national park in Bo Trach District has closed itself off to tourists since Wednesday due to rising water levels in some rivers.

Thua Thien-Hue Province, which boasts the popular tourist town Hue, got up to 500 mm of rainfall in the past day.

Prolonged downpours and heavy discharge by dams flooded thousands of homes in the province’s downstream areas.

Many streets in Da Nang, a popular tourist city, were under 40 cm of water on Wednesday.

Central localities from Ha Tinh to Quang Ngai provinces should expect heavy rains of 330-400 mm a day until Sunday, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

There could be 11-13 storms and tropical depressions forming over the East Sea this year, half of them hitting Vietnam, meteorologists have warned.

Its long coastline makes Vietnam particularly vulnerable to destructive storms and flooding.

The storm also set off landslides and knocked out power lines, leaving 1.7 million people in the dark.



Storm Molave, the ninth storm this year in the South China Sea and the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years, struck coastal provinces on Oct. 28 with heavy rainfall and winds as high as 115-135 km per hour, according to data provided by Vietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting on Wednesday.



Landslides in central provinces have killed at least 19 people and buried more than 40 others, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, adding that the bodies of 12 fishermen missing since the storm hit on Wednesday were recovered on Thursday, leaving another 14 still unaccounted for.



Around 56,000 houses were stripped of their roofs in Quang Ngai, where a massive blackout from downed power lines left more than a million people trapped in darkness as high winds tore through the province, according to state-controlled Vietnam News, AP said.



Wednesday’s storm hit central regions already devastated by weeks of heavy rains, floods, and landslides beginning Oct. 6 that left at least 130 dead and thousands displaced. The floods and landslides also wrecked highways and roads, blocking efforts to rescue and bring supplies to many cut off from help in remote areas.



Speaking to RFA on Thursday, residents in storm-hit provinces described fast-rising waters and devastated fields, with one saying that floodwaters had risen more quickly now than they had during the storms that battered the area earlier this month.



“During previous storms and floods, the water rose only to the height of my hand. But now the water rose so high that my house was submerged,” Hien Thao, a resident of Quang Tri province, speaking to RFA on Oct. 29.



“I lost 500 kg of paddy rice, and many of my household belongings were washed away,” he said.



“Yesterday, the water rose up to the yard of my house,” added 40-year-old Phan Quoc Vu of Truong Xa commune in Cam Lo district’s Cam Hieu village in Quang Tri. “But luckily it began to recede today,” he said.



“In the opinion of my 80-year-old father, this was the worst storm flooding that he can remember,” Vu said.



Calls for help



At the height of the flood, Vu called unsuccessfully to local authorities for help, and even posted calls for help on social media, but finally had to hire canoes to help evacuate elderly people and young children to safer ground, he said.



In Ninh Thuan province, villagers had made their living mainly through farming and raising shrimp, said Tran Thanh Truc, a resident of the province’s Hien Luong commune.



“But the floodwaters washed everything away—pigs, chickens, and shrimp,” she said. “We are glad to receive whatever help others can give us, but it will be difficult to make up for everything that was lost.”



In Quang Tri, supplies including large quantities of rice have been received so far only from volunteers, Hien Thao said, adding that the local People’s Committee has promised to bring relief goods soon.



“I also learned that the government will provide us with seeds for farming our next crop in the winter and spring.”



“We would like them to also give us boats and other equipment we need, along with rice that will help us while we wait for our next crop to be ready for harvest,” he said.



In Truong Xa commune, officials have cared so far only for their own relatives, though, Pham Quoc Vu said.



“They are not impartial, which is causing much suspicion,” he said.



Heavy rains, flooding in Laos



In Laos, heavy rains and flooding from Wednesday’s storm damaged or destroyed around 51,000 hectares of agricultural production, including more than 23,000 hectares of rice fields, across 13 districts of Savannakhet province, state media sources said on Friday.



Total losses in farm production and livestock from flooding in the storm are now estimated at 283 billion kip (U.S. $6,257,968.), Keoodom Souliya—an official from the province’s Agriculture and Forestry Department—said on Thursday.



In the southern province of Champassak, strong winds toppled power lines, while in Borikhamxay province, Khamkeut district’s Napae village was completely destroyed by floods, a video obtained by RFA showed on Friday, with a narrator on the video saying Napae had now become “a sea of water.”



The video also showed floods and landslides blocking the road leading from Napae to the Naphao International Border Checkpoint with Vietnam.



A rice paddy being harvested was also under water, Phetsamai Xayaathichak told local media. “We will announce the exact amount of local damage later, once we know what it is,” he said.



A total number of deaths in Laos resulting from the storm was not immediately available.

39,39,FL-2017-000120-VNM,Megaprojects threaten water justice for local communities - EurekAlert,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uoa-mtw051821.php,"Urban megaprojects tend to be the antithesis of good urban planning. They have a negative impact on local water systems, deprive local communities of water-related human rights, and their funders and sponsors have little accountability for their impact.

These are the findings of the University of Adelaide's Dr Scott Hawken from the School of Architecture and Built Environment who led a review of the impact of urban megaprojects on water justice in South East Asia.

""Urban megaprojects have severe implications for environmental processes,"" said Dr Hawken.

""They have a major impact on hydrological systems and during all phases of development affect water security and human rights.

""As well as interrupting urban water flows and waste removal, they cause biodiversity degradation and loss of arable landscapes, and increase pollution and change the flood regimes of rivers.""

The study, published in the journal Cities, focussed on the Phu My Hung project in Vietnam, the Amarapura project in Myanmar and Boeung Kak Lake in Cambodia, and is the result of Dr Hawken's engagement with recent calls from the United Nations for greater accountability in megaprojects globally.

Urban megaprojects have been a key mode of development in Southeast Asia since the 1980s. Between three and 14 per cent of GDP is invested in these kind of developments in SE Asia and eight per cent globally. They can include urban regeneration schemes, transport and energy infrastructure, industrial corridors, city clusters, new towns, innovation districts, science and technology parks and sports infrastructure.

""The projects we looked at are typical of most major cities in Southeast Asia in that they are located near coasts or major rivers which exposes people who live there to extreme weather events such as floods and erosion,"" said Dr Hawken.

""At every stage of these projects there needs to be a more systematic approach to sustainability especially when assessing their impact on water security. The community needs to be more involved and funders and sponsors need to be more accountable for the impact.

""Wealthier residents tend to benefit from these urban enclaves while they dramatically displace and disrupt existing economics and social relations. Poor socio-economic urban residents are disproportionately adversely affected.""

Megaprojects are often publicly positioned as economic benefactors for cities with governments and developers framing them as delivering wealth and new technologies to urban regions.

""Considering the prominence of this development model, it is unacceptable that there is so little information or recourse when these projects do not deliver on their promises,"" said Dr Hawken.

""Existing urban issues are rarely solved by these projects so a new approach is needed to better engage with communities and their socio-ecological relationships with natural water systems. Considering where they are built such projects also expose cities to future climate related disasters such as sea-level rise and flooding.

""Our findings and recommendations are relevant to cities around the world which are in semi-aquatic, delta environments and sensitive water catchment areas.

""Developers need to be accountable for such projects now and into the future.""

She said the UNDP plans to build an additional 4,000 houses next year, helping 20,000 people gain access to information on climate change and natural disasters, she said, adding that her agency would continue to support Vietnam in natural disaster management over the next decade.

Tran Quang Hoai, head of the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority, said the houses built by the UNDP in central Vietnam were still standing after the region’s historic storms and floods in October and November, which had demolished over 1,500 houses and damaged 240,000 others.

La Thi Kim Ngan, deputy head of the National Institute of Architecture, said that authorities and investors need to create a comprehensive model for housing complexes, complete with infrastructure like electricity, clean water and waste management systems.

Flood resilient houses can become homestay accommodations and help the region develop economically, she added.

Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said his ministry was cooperating with the architecture institute and the Ministry of Construction to develop appropriate and safe housing models to withstand natural disasters.

It is estimated that by 2025, Vietnam would have around 30 million people living in areas prone to natural disasters. Many of them are likely to be poverty stricken.

Rapid urbanization and economic development can intensify natural disaster risks for Vietnam's coastline and wipe billions of dollars off its economic growth over the next decade, a World Bank report warned in October.

Around 11.8 million people in coastal provinces face the threat of intense flooding, and over 35 percent of settlements are located on eroding coastlines.

Another powerful storm is testing Southeast Asian disaster responders after Typhoon Goni crashed into the Philippines on 1 November, before veering towards flood-hit central Vietnam.

Goni, known as Rolly in the Philippines, made landfall on Sunday on Catanduanes Island in the country’s east, bringing violent winds and extensive flooding. The Red Cross says there’s “massive devastation” in some areas, including 90 percent of the homes in villages in one part of Catanduanes.

Philippine authorities are still assessing the total damage, but the government said 11 people had died as of 2 November, with numbers still rising.

The evacuation of at least 450,000 people and early response planning helped avoid a worse outcome, but aid groups warn that the combined hit from a barrage of recent storms and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will test communities for months to come.

The Philippines has been locked in disaster response mode for weeks after previous storms caused extensive flooding in parts of Luzon, the country’s main island. Typhoon Molave, known as Quinta in the Philippines, killed at least 23 people in October; Typhoon Saudel, known as Pepito, struck days earlier.

Attention now turns to Vietnam, which is preparing for a weakened Goni to strike its flood-hit central region around 5 November – the country’s fifth major storm since mid-October.

Typhoon Goni’s wind speeds slowed to around 90 kilometres per hour by 2 November, but successive storms over the past month have driven severe floods and landslides across central Vietnam.

Vietnam’s government says roughly 160 people have died, with dozens more missing in the worst flooding to hit the country in 20 years. The disasters have inundated more than a quarter of a million homes, and prompted a $40 million humanitarian appeal targeting 177,000 people.

The Philippines isn’t in the clear, either. Another storm, Atsani or Siony, could careen toward northern Luzon in the coming days, though forecasters say its current path is extremely erratic.

Floods are common during Asia’s various monsoon and cyclone seasons, but aid groups say the damage has been particularly severe this year.

Typhoon Goni was the strongest storm to hit the country since 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,300 people and led to a massive humanitarian response.

Climate change is fuelling more volatile extreme weather across the globe. The Philippines’ first typhoon of the season, Vongfong or Ambo, arrived relatively early in May; the storm season typically hits its peak in July.

Posting on Twitter, Yeb Saño, who was the Philippines’ climate negotiator when Haiyan struck in 2013, said Typhoon Goni and the burst of recent extreme weather is further proof of a crisis.

“The climate emergency persists and is wreaking havoc,” he said.

42,42,FL-2017-000120-VNM,Why nations rush to help India - The Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2021/0428/Why-nations-rush-to-help-India,"Now the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, India has received extraordinary offers of aid from other countries. Even archrival Pakistan made a goodwill gesture to help relieve its neighbor’s unprecedented health crisis. Some aid is being given for political or strategic reasons. After all, the world’s largest democracy, with 1.3 billion people and the fifth-largest economy, is difficult to ignore. Yet look closer and you’ll see another motive at work: an appreciation for India’s past generosity.

As for its aid, the U.S. says it is simply being grateful. “Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” President Joe Biden said in a tweet (India also sent aid after Hurricane Katrina in 2005).

Since the coronavirus crisis began last year, India has assisted more than 100 vulnerable countries with supplies and training. Its open heart has opened the hearts of others. “It’s time for the world to extend aid & support to India,” tweeted Volkan Bozkir, president of the United Nations General Assembl. For his part, Secretary-General António Guterres said the U.N. was “extremely grateful” to India.

It was not always thus for India.

Only in the past two decades has it warmed up to being one of the world’s “donor” countries, helping mitigate the impact of foreign disasters and health emergencies. The more it has seen itself as a major power, the more India has embraced a moral obligation to assist other countries, especially as a first responder in food supplies, evacuations, and equipment.

Indian officials cite a spiritual basis for such aid in a Hindu term, daan, translated as “charity without motive.” In a speech in mid-April, the external affairs minister of India, Dr. S. Jaishankar, said, “Even before the pandemic, India has been providing humanitarian assistance, disaster resistance to all. We have demonstrated in a practical manner, our belief that the world is a family.”

Perhaps the turning point for India was its response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Its navy sent relief to coastal states hit by the tragedy, such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka. In 2015, it launched a large aid effort to Nepal after an earthquake. It has also assisted Iran during a locust attack, sent food supplies to South Sudan, and given flood relief to Cambodia and Vietnam.

Like other major donor nations, India sometimes withholds aid for strategic reasons or dispenses it as a display of soft power. But says Dr. Jaishankar, “We work ... on facing disasters together.”

No wonder so many countries now want to assist India. It has graciously accepted much of the aid, with little regard for whether it comes from friend or foe. Such giving is more than a type of mutual-aid society. When done out of gratitude, it also points to a greater good available to all, with no expectation of reciprocity or credit.","Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2021/04/1119546_2_India_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,"['worlds', 'nations', 'united', 'india', 'aid', 'supplies', 'work', 'world', 'pandemic', 'rush', 'countries', 'sent', 'help']", ,flood

Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam.

The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.

The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.

The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.

As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.

Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light.""

Australia is already making ongoing efforts to support Vietnam’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $10.5 million assistance package in June.

Earlier this week the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management, the United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

Heavy rain has pounded over central Vietnam for more than a week, resulting in floods and landslides that have killed at least 64 people, according to the country's disaster management authority.

""From 2 a.m. until now, there have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,"" local official Ha Ngoc Duong said, as reported by Vietnamese newspaper VnExpress, warning that the situation could worsen.

The bodies of some 22 soldiers from the army camp were recovered early on Sunday morning, according to local media reports. Ongoing rain has hampered rescue efforts. Days before, 13 rescue team members died trying to reach a group of 30 employees of a hydropower plant that had been buried by the landslides.

The rains have flooded nearly 200,000 houses in the region.

Widespread damage

Authorities also warned that river levels in the country had reached their highest in two decades, state media said.

The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides. Torrential downpours have flooded nearly 200,000 houses and 300 schools in the region.

Since storms began on October 6, some 72 people have died and a further 19 are still missing, Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said in a report.

Though Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, which often bring flooding and landslides, this month's disaster has been the worst the country has faced in years.

Neighboring Cambodia has also been affected by heavy flooding in the region. The death toll there jumped to 20 on Saturday, according to disaster management authorities.

Several areas of Vietnam hit by the worst floods in decades. In the last month, torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing, and created hardship for 240 thousand families. Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs mobilized. The strengthening of relations between the two countries can be linked to the US's anti-Beijing strategies.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) - Taiwan has donated 400,000 US dollars in aid to Vietnam to support the local population, hit by the worst floods and landslides in decades. In the past two weeks, storms no. 6 and 7 have caused serious damage in the central-northern provinces of Hà Tinh, Qu?ng Bình, Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên-Hu? and in the central-southern ones Ðà N?ng, Qu?ng Nam, Qu?ng Ngãi, Bình Ð?nh and Phú Yên.

The Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention reports that torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing since late September. River levels have risen rapidly in central areas of Vietnam, flooding 212 municipalities inhabited by 240 thousand families.

Many communities are isolated; at the moment in the devastated areas it is possible to move mostly with small boats. Victims are in immediate need of food, bottled water, medicine, clothing, blankets and books.

At the end of the emergency, money will be needed for reconstruction, especially seeds and agricultural machinery. Many Vietnamese have mobilized to support the flood victims. Groups of young people, including Catholics, brought rice, spaghetti (noodles) and drinking water to the most remote flooded areas.

Richard Shih, Taiwanese representative in Hanoi, said that Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs operating in Vietnam have mobilized and sent aid to disaster areas. He hopes the victims can rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon.

The aid delivery ceremony took place on 23 October in the presence of Tr?n Quang Hoài, director of the Vietnamese agency for the management of natural disasters. The Hanoi representative thanked the generosity of the government and the people of Taiwan, stressing that the distribution of aid will start as soon as possible.

The Taiwanese authorities highlighted the strong ties that unite their country to Vietnam. More than 320,000 Vietnamese migrants live and work in Taiwan; Taipei is Hanoi's seventh trading partner, with a turnover of 13.5 billion euros in 2019. The two nations also share fears about the growth of Chinese power, an aspect that links the strengthening of their relations with the United States anti-Beijing strategy in the region.","Mon, 26 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM-TAIWAN_-_1026_-_Aiuti_ter.jpg,"['areas', 'donates', 'vietnam', 'dollars', 'aid', 'flood', 'taiwan', 'qu?ng', 'mobilized', 'vietnamese', 'caused', '400000', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

Huynh Kim Luong was standing in a corner of his home, struggling to find a spot for guests to sit. The pots, pans and clothes scattered around the house were illuminated by the light of flickering candles.

""It has been 21 years since I saw such a flood,"" he said.

For the past 10 days the 60-year-old farmer and his family of three have barely stepped outside. In their Huong Toan Commune in Thua Thien-Hue, floods triggered by heavy rains have inundated over 2,000 homes. The only sounds they hear these days are the thump of rain falling on the roof, the clattering of windows in the wind, and distant hums of motorboats moving through the sea of water.

Like many people in central Vietnam, Luong and his wife Hoa were proud of their ability to live with floods. Since the beginning of this month, Hoa has been stocking up rice, dry fish and peanut on warnings of coming storms and rains. They knew not to stock up on meat since electricity is always cut when a storm hits. They were right.

On the morning of October 9 Luong opened his front door only to see the water almost reaching the threshold following heavy rain the previous night. As the hours passed and the rain showed no signs of relenting, the water started to come inside the house. Everywhere in the neighborhood, people were yelling that the floods had come.

Their eldest daughter, who is in her final year of high school, began to put all her books into plastic bags. Her parents waded around the house to salvage the family’s most valuable belongings like the refrigerator, TV and stove, and put them on a table that is reinforced with four blocks of wood.

Within a span of not even a day, Huong Toan turned from green paddy fields to muddy sea in the afternoon. With the electricity duly cut and dusk falling, the area, now flooded for dozens of kilometers along National Highway 1, slowly sank into darkness.

Also on October 9, in Huong Van Commune, about six kilometers away, Le Thi Thuc spent a sleepless night watching the water rise.

""I say ‘keeping watch,’ but the water will rise anyway even if I’m asleep. But my mind can be a little bit at rest if I watch it,"" she said.

The 54-year-old too has been confined at home for several days.

That night the entire family took refuge in the bedroom of her 85-year-old mother, whose room is situated farthest from the water. Thuc told her three children to go to sleep early, reminding them to turn off their phones to save the battery for the coming days without electricity.

Dung, her husband, shone the flashlight at the floor, sighing. The water was closing in. That night none of the three adults in the household slept a wink.

The local rice milling shop closed as soon as it started raining, catching Thuc off guard, leaving her no time to prepare enough food for the family.

Luckily her sister, who lives on higher ground, helped out, rowing a boat to Thuc’s house to deliver much-needed rice, bamboo shoot broth and boiled duck.

Seeing the family of six enjoying a meal sitting on a bed, surrounded by floodwater, Thuc could not help but weep.

For the next eight days the water ebbed and flowed. The children kept asking when the rain would stop, but the weather forecast kept getting gloomier.

The whole family had to shovel and sweep the mud and sludge entering the house. ""It was like walking in a swamp,"" they said.

Last Friday the water started to recede a little, going down to waist level, and Thuc took the opportunity to go out and buy some fish and vegetables. Looking around the neighborhood after being trapped inside the house for a week, she failed to recognize the place.

In Huong Toan, the situation has been grim. With the water showing no signs of receding, Hoang Trong Hieu, the commune chairman, other officials and police officers have not gone home for the last 10 days.

The group, which consists of over 20 people, has divided itself to take 24-hour shifts at the People’s Committee office to distribute supplies and respond to emergencies like transporting the injured and evacuating people.

Since the entire commune is under a meter of water, all travel is done by boat.

""It has been a long time since we saw our feet,"" a member of the group joked, carrying bags of rice on his shoulder in chest-deep water. The man had given Luong’s family two cartons of instant noodles the other day.

The day before electricity was cut, Luong’s had some vegetables, eggs and fish in the refrigerator, but only enough for two days for the family of three. So for the next eight days they had nothing to eat but rice and dry fish.

""I was given instant noodles but did not dare eat them because I did not want to urinate too much,"" he explained.

Luong’s wife, who had surgery just a month ago, stumbled in the dark and fell one night as she sought to go to the bathroom amid the sea of water. Since then he has been placing pots by the bed and replaces the candles twice every night.

""There are a lot of mosquitoes due to all the water.""

In Huong Van Commune, Nguyen Van Lieu, 63, has taken over the most dangerous task from his wife since the floods came: cooking. He dons his conical hat and raincoat every day to light the stove, standing in chest-deep water.

""If my wife gets into the water to cook, it will come up to her neck,"" he joked, patting his wife’s back with a smile.

Their house was almost completed earlier this year but the roof has not been finished. The family is among the luckier ones in the neighborhood since the water only comes up to the thighs even during the heaviest rains.

But the kitchen is a different story. There had been over 20 bags of rice, weighing over a ton, but everything was soaked the very first night. Vy, Lieu’s wife, had no choice but to give them away to her neighbors to feed their ducks and chickens. She has been borrowing rice from others.

They have not told their two eldest children, who are workers in the south, about their situation, not wanting to worry them.

Like many others, the couple have been trapped inside their home, situated just 100 m from the national highway, for more than a week. Every day Vy would cast her gaze on the other side of the highway to look at the paddy fields longingly despite realizing they must be submerged under water.

A few days before the rains came she had sold her first few gourds of the season. ""They sell well this year at VND10,000 (43 cents) per kilogram,"" she said. She was hoping to earn around VND10 million from selling them all over two months.

But that was before the storm came. She was only able to sell for two days, earning VND240,000, before she was forced to remain at home.

She and her husband have been reminiscing about the historic flood in Thua Thien Hue 21 years ago. The deluge in November 1999 had submerged thousands of houses and paralyzed all traffic and electrical and communication systems in the province. There had been rainfall of up to 2,300 mm in just the first three days. Several people had been swept away and killed during that disaster.

At that time the couple and their children stacked two beds on top of each other and waited for the floods to recede, the anguished voices of people who lost loved ones in the background.

Their son, seeing how his parents had to face flooding year after year, wanted to help them find a safer place to live in, but they cannot countenance moving out of their hometown.

More heavy rains are expected in central Vietnam regions at least until Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Rivers are expected to rise further, as is the risk of floods and landslides. Vehicles continue to line up along National Highway 1 and other roads on higher ground as people park their cars and motorbikes there to avoid the water.

But the people cannot do the same, they cannot just leave their houses.

Australia, Switzerland and Thailand have offered aid to victims of multiple storms and floods in central Vietnam last month.

The Australian embassy in Hanoi said on Friday its government will provide an additional AUD2 million ($1.45 million) to help Vietnam respond to the impacts of prolonged floods and landslides in the central region. The country had earlier provided AUD100,000 ($71,300).

The aid money will be used to meet urgent needs like providing clean water and sanitation and hygiene and dignity kits to affected people, and support the restoration of clean water supply to schools.

The Swiss embassy also announced grant of urgent aid worth CHF300,000 ($333,000) to help address the immediate needs of 160,000 people focusing on housing, livelihoods, healthcare, water, and hygiene.

In a phone call to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-o-cha, offered $30,000 toward relief efforts.

The central region was repeatedly hit by torrential rains, widespread flooding and landslides triggered by four storms in October.

So far 235 people have been killed or are missing, almost 390,000 houses were flooded and more than 300,000 families have been evacuated, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority.

Many people have lost almost all their household possessions or had their homes, food stocks, livestock, and crops badly damaged.

According to Tran Phuoc Anh, acting director of the city’s Foreign Department, the sustainable flood prevention project for Thu Duc City would have a total investment of more than $1bn, and would be implemented as a public–private project with the participation of the Dutch government.

Le Hoa Binh, deputy chair of HCMC, said he hoped the Netherlands would help create a city that was “sustainable and well adapted to climate change”.

Elizabeth Akkerman, the Dutch ambassador to Vietnam, said her government would help HCMC and Thu Duc City with advanced construction technologies.

Thu Duc will be based on advanced industries such as autonomous manufacturing, and will include the university precinct in Thu Duc as well as a new-build urban area and financial centre on the Thu Thiem Peninsula.

Thu Duc is the most elevated area in HCMC, but still suffers from seasonal flooding, and its residents suffer from inundation of streets and even houses every time there is heavy rain or a high tide.

In May 2019, HCMC sent a delegation to the Netherlands to study its urban development and flood management methods, and a number of memorandums of understanding were subsequently signed, including a $1bn anti-flooding project in Thu Duc City.

A tropical depression is projected to hit central Vietnam on Friday night, bringing heavy rains as the area struggles to recover from more than a week of flooding.

As of 10 a.m. Friday, the tropical depression was about 290 km to the east of Da Nang and Binh Dinh Province, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Its maximum wind speed was 50 kph.

Within the next 12 hours, the tropical depression would move west at about 30 kph, before making landfall in central Vietnam, then devolving into a low-pressure area over southern Laos.

By 10 p.m. Friday, the low-pressure area would be above the mountainous area of central Vietnam, with a maximum wind speed of 40 kph.

Rough seas and strong winds should be expected in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, within the next 24 hours.

Central Vietnam should expect particularly heavy rain from now until Wednesday next week, according to the center. Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and southern Nghe An should expect a total rainfall of up to 900 mm during the period, while Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and northern Nghe An should expect up to 500 mm.

Da Nang and its neighbor Quang Nam Province, home to popular ancient town Hoi An, should expect rainfall of up to 500 mm, while regions between Quang Ngai and Phu Yen should expect levels of up to 350 mm.

The Central Highlands should also expect heavy rain until Sunday, with rainfall of up to 250 mm.

Rains are expected to persist in central Vietnam even after Wednesday, the center noted.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Since last week, central Vietnam has been hit by torrential rains, floods and landslides after a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

On Sunday, Storm Linfa intensified from the turbulence and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. The next day, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

At least 56 people have been killed, including two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while coming to rescue the workers.

Thousands of homes in the region have been flooded.

Torrential downpours and discharge of water from hydropower dams have caused rivers in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces to swell and threaten severe flooding.

Storm Molave, said to be the strongest to hit Vietnam in the last two decades, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Wednesday morning before weakening into a tropical depression by 4 p.m.

The provinces have been hit by rains of up to 500 mm between Tuesday night and Wednesday night. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In Quang Ngai, the Tra Bong River was flowing above flood warning danger level 2 at Chau O station while the Tra Khuc, Ve and Tra Cau rivers had crossed the highest danger level of 3 by 4 p.m. Wednesday, according to the province's Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

They are forecast to continue rising quickly on Thursday, possibly triggering severe flooding in large parts of Quang Ngai Town, the capital, and several districts.

The release of water by local hydropower dams is worsening the situation.

Dak Drinh hydropower plant discharged up to 1,680 cubic meters of water a second on Wednesday and Nuoc Trong, the largest irrigation and hydroelectricity project in the central region, discharged 1,100 cubic meters.

Authorities hurriedly evacuated people living in low-lying areas and made emergency announcements about the water discharge via loudspeakers to warn local residents.

In Quang Nam Province, home to ancient town Hoi An, the water level in the Vu Gia River reached 9.41 meters by early morning Thursday, 0.41 meters above danger level 3, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, which warned rivers in the province would rise quickly in the next few hours.

Dak Mi 4 hydropower plant plans to discharge up to 11,400 cubic meters a second and the Vu Gia River is expected to rise to 11.2 meters, surpassing the historic flood level in 2009.

Nguyen Huu Vu, a local official, said authorities have evacuated over 4,000 families living along the river.

If the hydropower plant discharges over 5,000 cubic meters per second, 120,000 houses would be submerged under 0.5-1.5 meters of water, Vu said.

The National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said on Wednesday that Quang Nam could face severe flooding in the next one or two days.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung instructed provincial authorities to evacuate people from areas threatened by landslides and ensure the safety of reservoirs and hydropower plants.

The central region, including Quang Nam, was hit by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that caused at least 130 deaths.

The flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated, killed livestock and caused damage the government said was ""the worst in the last five years.""","Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/29/042266ddd73b2965702aQuangNgaib-7340-7528-1603941528_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'nam', 'dam', 'quang', 'rains', 'water', 'hydropower', 'trigger', 'flooding', 'heavy', 'central', 'fresh', 'discharge', 'level', 'ngai', 'meters', 'vu', 'plant']", ,flood

Phnom Penh (AFP)

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to get them to safety from rising floodwater on Saturday in Cambodia's western province of Battambang.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces -- Pursat, Battambang and Pailin -- have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall ahead of the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

""A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,"" Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told AFP on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to worsen on Sunday.

In central Vietnam almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking north Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to sandbag and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

In Laos, rising floodwater has damaged villages and rice fields along the Xepon and Xebanghieng rivers in Savannakhet province with more rain on the way.

The probabilistic model will provide full national coverage and help re/insurers to assess their exposure to floods – a peril that affects 70% of the population in Vietnam.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue that simulates both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding.

It can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves and average annual losses at any level of aggregation.

Outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region.

“The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon,” Gallagher explained.

“These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flooded.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'model', 'reinsurance', 'population', 'flood', 'guy', 'help', 'launches', 'carpenter', 'vietnamthe', 'includes']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

When a northern cold spell entered the intertropical convergence zone over central Vietnam, it caused abnormally heavy rains and flooding in the region.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh got 400-500 mm, Quang Tri got 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue got 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City got 1,100 mm, Quang Nam got 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai got 600-800 mm.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

The entire central region suffered from severe flooding for days, more than 135,000 houses were submerged under 0.3-4 meters of water, and nearly 46,000 people had to be evacuated.

At least 36 people have died due to flooding and 12 are missing.

Nguyen Van Huong, head of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting’s Climate Forecast Office, said intertropical convergence zone stretches from the Bay of Bengal and across the center of Vietnam to the Philippines.

In these areas clouds and thunderstorms often develop, and when winds from the east meet them, there is an increase in moisture content, which means more thunderstorms, he said.

When the zone has favorable conditions such as the convergence of strong winds that moved over warm seawater, a tropical depression forms and then grows into a storm in the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea, he said.

Since October 6 two storms and a tropical depression have formed in this area.

On Sunday Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.

A day later Storm Nangka formed and hit the coast between the northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa Provinces on Wednesday.

""Storms and tropical depression already cause heavy rains. For instance, Storm Linfa caused rainfall of 500-700 mm,"" Huong said.

On Thursday morning another tropical depression formed over the sea and is heading straight for the central region also with a lot of moisture.

According to the center, more rains are expected in the region until Tuesday or later.

A cold spell coming down from the north and meeting winds from the east also caused heavy rains, Huong said.

The center said the root cause of all these phenomena was La Nina, which appeared in July and is expected to last until early next year. During this period, more storms would form over the East Sea and the rains would last longer than usual, it added.

Four to six more storms and tropical depressions are expected to brew this year with at least two making landfall over the central coast.

La Nina is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years as a result of variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It occurs as strong winds blow warm water on the ocean's surface from South America across the Pacific Ocean toward Indonesia.

The number of patients with melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, has increased sharply at a major hospital in the central region following the prolonged flooding.

Since early October Hue Central Hospital in Thua Thien-Hue Province has admitted 28 people with the disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia Pseudomallei, which infects both humans and animals.

Around half the patients are from Thua Thien-Hue and the rest are from other central provinces like Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri, the province's news website reported.

The hospital is one of three biggest and most advanced general hospitals in Vietnam along with others in Hanoi and HCMC.

It said many of the patients came for treatment only after the disease had become serious, causing sepsis and multi-organ failure and threatening their life.

On November 14 a Quang Binh Province official died of the disease at the hospital.

Phan Thanh Mien, people’s committee chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trach District, had spent days in floodwaters in October managing relief efforts. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee, but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items in inundated areas.

The hospital had treated 83 people with the disease between 2014 and 2019 and 11 in the first nine months of this year.

It said the rise in the number of infections since early October is closely related to the floods that ravaged the central region throughout October and in November.

Various studies around the world have found that melioidosis occurs only in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, with outbreaks occurring after floods and typhoons.

In October central Vietnam was hit by floods thrice.

Melioidosis patients have symptoms like fever, pneumonia and abscesses in and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate is around 40 percent.

The disease was first diagnosed in Vietnam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country.

There are around 10,000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, around half of which prove fatal.

After devastating storms and floods, the airline worked to transport thousands of aid packages to help areas in central Vietnam.

Aid transportation

Vietnam Airlines flew over 24 tons of goods and more than 2,000 packages from organizations like the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee, the Red Cross, and individual donations, among others, to support operations in central Vietnam in cities like Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi.

This is just part of Vietnam Airlines’ aid operations. The airline is expecting to fly more than 100 tons of cargo to support relief operations.

Vietnam Airlines, along with its affiliates, is receiving and transporting goods to Central Vietnam free of charge.

For passengers, Vietnam Airlines is also giving people to Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi one extra free bag in addition to their class of service baggage allowance. This will allow passengers to also fly with additional relief items or essential items.

Vietnam Airlines is expecting to fly over 10,000 pieces of luggage free of charge. This will help those who are bringing relief items to the region.

Central Vietnam is facing awful flooding

Devastating floods, some of the most severe in decades, according to CNN, have claimed over 100 lives and led to immense destruction. Over 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and over 691,000 cattle and poultry have either been killed or swept away. Hundreds of thousands of meters of roadways have also been damaged.

In addition to the flooding, landslides have also caused deaths and damage. However, Vietnam, which is no stranger to rain and typhoons, became overwhelmed after facing a particularly fierce set of storms.

Relief agencies rely on airlines to help transport goods and people. Another set of storms is, including a tropical storm, made its way to Vietnam this last weekend as well.

For the flag carrier of Vietnam, it was now time to step up and fly relief. After facing some operational disruptions due to the storm, the carrier became one lifeline to bring much-needed supplies to the region.

Airlines and aid flights

Over the last few months, aid flights have become common when it came to transporting medical supplies. However, airlines are no strangers when it comes to running aid and relief flights.

Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines partnered to send 20,000 pounds of aid on a brand new Boeing 787. Emirates has flown tens of thousands of kilograms of aid to Lebanon since a blast rocked Beirut.

The European Union will provide €1.3 million ($1.52 million) for critical humanitarian assistance to families affected by severe flooding that wreaked havoc across central Vietnam.

The aid will focus on addressing the urgent needs of the most affected people in central Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces, European External Action Service said in a press release.

""This contribution underlines our solidarity with the people of Vietnam, many of whom have suffered the loss of homes, livelihoods and belongings in the wake of the devastating floods,"" said Olivier Brouant, who oversees the EU’s humanitarian response in the Mekong region.

The funding includes the distribution of hygiene kits and other essential relief items while ensuring access to drinking water, sanitation facilities and the promotion of good hygiene practices. Cash transfers will also be provided, allowing people to buy food or items of their choice.

Female-headed households and people with disabilities will be given priority for humanitarian assistance.

The central region was bombarded by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that resulted in at least 130 deaths.

The historic flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated and livestock killed, damage the government claimed to be ""the worst in the past five years.""

Some countries and international organizations recently pledged immediate humanitarian relief to help central Vietnam overcome the consequences of deadly floods.

Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

South Korea pledged relief worth $300,000 while the U.S. has promised $100,000.

With central Vietnam yet to recover from the historic flooding, Storm Molave, the ninth storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Provinces on Wednesday, triggering heavy rains and strong winds for the central region.

At least seven people have been killed by landslides in Quang Nam, with 46 others still missing.","Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/29/6copy1603608826-1603933286-160-2890-1201-1603933419_1200x0.jpg,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'assist', 'mln', 'quang', 'flood', 'eu', 'humanitarian', 'relief', 'flooding', 'central', '15', 'pledged', 'weeks', 'storm', 'historic', 'victims']", ,flood

Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri.

At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnam’s Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.

A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.

They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.

For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.

At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday.

Saudel is the eighth storm in the East Sea this year, and follows Linfa and Nangka earlier this month.

Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

Over 3,700 UNFPA Dignity Kits worth $180,000 would be provided to the elderly in central Vietnam following a series of storms and tropical depressions that hit the region last year.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) representative in Vietnam, handed over 3,704 kits containing essential items to Bui Quang Huy, standing secretary of the HCMC Communist Youth Union, to support the elderly in three central Vietnam provinces afflicted by floods last year: Ha Tinh, Quang Tri and Quang Ngai at a Wednesday ceremony.

Dignity Kits are a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, mitigate the risk of gender-based violence, and respond to and protect the dignity of women and girls adversely affected by a crisis. Kits meant for the elderly contain items like hand towels, sweaters, socks, wet tissues, toothbrushes, soap, underwear, blankets, flashlights and whistles.

The handover was made possible via financial contributions from U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), according to a UNFPA press release.

The elderly are among the most vulnerable when natural disasters strike, according to UNFPA. During floods and landslides in central Vietnam last year, health facilities were hard hit, causing routine public health programs to be disrupted, it added. The elderly are at risk since they do not always get the care they need, and their vulnerabilities can become a serious challenge to survival and wellbeing, it stated.

Last year, central Vietnam was struck by a series of storms and tropical depressions, triggering heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Over 200 people were killed and property losses amounted to around VND30 trillion ($1.3 trillion). Hundreds of thousands of homes were either destroyed or damaged, affecting the lives of at least 7.7 million residents.

The Vietnamese government has provided around VND770 billion to the region as emergency relief.

With Storm Molave set to make landfall in central Vietnam in the next few days, Vietnamese authorities are preparing to evacuate 1.2 million coast residents to safety.

At 1 p.m. Monday, the storm lay centered around 560 km east-northeast of Southwest Cay islet, with winds of 135 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

Over the next 24 hours, it will move west at 20-25 kph and gradually intensify. At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, it will be 280 km to the north of Southwest Cay with winds of up to 150 kph.

Mai Van Khiem, director of the national forecast center, said at a meeting Monday both the agency and its Japanese counterpart predict the rapidly moving storm would make landfall in central Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces.

The agencies forecast the storm would reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning, before making landfall in the coming hours.

On Wednesday morning, the storm's center would be around 200 km from the coast of Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh with a maximum wind speed of 135 kph, causing waves of up to 10 m.

Storm circulation combined with a cold spell would cause heavy rains on a large scale, and localities stretching over 1,000 km from Nghe An to Phu Yen will be battered by torrential downpours and strong winds from Tuesday until Thursday, with rainfall of between 200-400 mm.

Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh are told to brace for prolonged downpours until Saturday with total rainfall of up to 700 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Mountainous areas will be at high risk of landslides.

Mass evacuation

Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, said with Molave’s strength level, the committee is ready to evacuate over 1.2 million residents in seven central provinces Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

The region, home to popular ancient towns, beautiful beaches and world famous caves, has been bombarded by historic flooding and deadly landslides for the past three weeks, suffering damage government officials described as ""the worst in five years."" At least 130 people have been killed by floods and landslides between October 6 and 25.

Hoai urged provincial leaders to stay in contact with fishing boats, evacuate residents to safety, and make plans to limit storm damage.

There are still 65,000 fishing boats operating along the central coast, of which 45,000 have received official warnings.

""The storm is too strong,"" Hoai said, ordering localities to order boats to take shelter, ban residents from fishing activities, and close all public beaches by Tuesday night.

Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defense has called for the mobilization of more than 368,000 people - soldiers, members of the police force, and civilian volunteers, to assist residents in at-risk areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the meeting that localities must be on high alert and prepare their best flood prevention measures.

""If the storm comes as strong as forecast, damage from rains and floods will be extremely huge,"" Phuc said.

According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Storm Molave's strength is equivalent to Storm Damrey, which hit south central Vietnam in November 2017 and killed 106 people.

Hoang Tan Trong, watching over the family farm in Dong Hoi Town with his father and pregnant wife, witnessed floods tear through his home on the night of October 19. Dao, Trong’s wife, was sitting on their bed, suspended in the air thanks to four ropes connecting it to the roof. But with the walls damaged, the bed wobbled about two meters above ground, leaning to the side.

Seeing what happened, Trong's father, 64-year-old Hoang Tan Truong, immediately jumped into the water and tried securing the ropes, lest Dao fell into the water below.

""We can't just stay here and suffer like this. We need to find a safer house,"" Dao said. That night, Trong rented a motorboat and brought the whole family to the town center, about 2 km away.

Trong later returned to his old home to herd his 30 remaining chickens out of 200 into tree branches to avoid the flood. His three dogs were given to a relative the next day for safe keeping.

""This is the most severe flood since my birth,"" Trong, 44, remarked.

In Dong Hoi, Pham Thanh Hien, 66, frantically relocated his belongings as half-a-meter-deep floodwater swept through his home. A long time resident, Hien said the fact water could invade the house when hydropower plants have yet to discharge water was ""unprecedented.""

Since October 6, heavy rains have inundated the lowlands of Quang Binh. While not suffering fatal landslides like Thua Thien-Hue or Quang Tri provinces, Quang Binh has been the most severely flooded.

The October 19 flood managed to submerge thousands of houses, making even the most hardy residents shudder in fear.

From 1 a.m. on October 16 to 5 p.m. October 20, Quang Binh recorded rainfall of up to 1,380 mm in certain areas. The most heavily flooded was in Le Thuy District, with over 32,000 houses swamped. Throughout the entire province, around 105,000 homes have been similarly affected.

Tran Cong Thuat, chairman of Quang Binh, said: ""Floods this year have eclipsed the record peak in 1979 by up to 0.98 m."" The historic flood peak was recorded on Kien Giang River at 3.91 m. This year, however, the peak remained at 4.89 m for several consecutive days.

""The flood came at night so it was very powerful. The peak was too high, catching certain areas off guard,"" Thuat added. On the night of October 19 alone, thousands of people throughout Quang Binh have called out for help via their phones or social media.

""We still lack boats, but we are doing our best to help alleviate the suffering,"" he said.

Floods in Quang Binh this year not only set new records, but also receded very slowly. By the morning of October 21, traffic across the province remained crippled due to several flooded locations. Over the last fews days, people have confined themselves to their homes, with many of their pets, livestock and vegetables perishing in the water.

It would take a long time for Quang Binh to recover following this historic flood, according to Thuat. As Storm Saudel approaches Vietnamese shores, the province has prepared plans to support people with necessities and food for the coming days.

""During the first days when flood levels rose quickly, we were met with many challenges. But now that the water’s receding, we’ve been surveying heavily flooded and isolated houses so we could perform rescue operations and provide supplies more easily. We would not allow any family to be abandoned amid the flooding,"" said Thuat.

As of Thursday afternoon, at least 10 people have died in Quang Binh due to floods. Over 7,500 tons of food were soaked in water, while several roads and other infrastructure in the province have either been flooded or damaged. Around 30,000 families have had to be evacuated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/a1-1826-1603269458-3402-160334-4400-1598-1603352403_1200x0.jpg,"['flooded', 'binh', 'quang', 'water', 'flood', 'peak', 'province', 'worst', 'flooding', '41', 'trongs', 'night', 'suffers', 'family']", ,flood

Ho Van Rao's lush green fields in Quang Tri were buried under more than two feet of boulders, sand and other debris.

The field was the primary source of income to feed his family of three.

As he inspected the damage done by the prolonged flooding central Vietnam has had to suffer, he noted that some paddy sections had been swept away by floodwaters, while his tapioca field, cultivated over the past 10 months, was buried in rubble.

""We don’t know what to plant to make a living,"" said Rao, a 46-year-old resident of Huong Son Commune in Quang Tri’s Huong Hoa District. Two wet bags of grains they have are all that’s left for the next six months, he said, adding that on sunny days, he would put them out to dry.

The Huong Son Commune has over 192 ha of paddy fields, but around 90 ha were buried under rocks and wood rotting deposited by the floods, rendering them unusable and irrecoverable. Le Trong Tuong, chairman of the Huong Son People’s Committee, said residents were facing food shortages in the future for people.

In Quang Binh Province’s Bo Trach District, Le Xuan Uyen, 56, sees his field buried under mud and soil a meter deep, meaning he cannot plant new saplings for the winter-spring season without putting in significant time and efforts to clean the place up.

Worse still, the soil the fields are buried under has toxic properties that would kill paddy if they’re planted, he said. ""We are worried because we have missed the season for planting, and we don’t know what to plant anyway.""

The Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences said the top soil layer that covers several areas in Bo Trach District is actually heavy clay layers, which would make it difficult for cultivation if left as it is. Farmers should switch to different plants to adapt to the new layers, the academy has suggested.

Around 1,650 ha of fields in Quang Tri were inundated in the past month. Provincial authorities are now cooperating with the people to salvage the buried fields to prepare for the winter-spring planting season in just a month, said Ha Si Dong, deputy chairman of Quang Tri. But as the fields are large, ample time, it would take a lot of people and equipment to complete the job, he added.

Recovery efforts should be completed by mid-December so new saplings can be planted for the winter-spring season on time, Quang Tri authorities have said.

Quang Binh and Quang Tri were among several central Vietnam localities struck by heavy rains, flooding and landslides triggered by numerous storms and tropical depressions in recent months.

The chance of such events could increase five to 10 times by 2050, resulting in economic and infrastructural damage that could cost billions of dollars, according to a McKinsey report, dated April. The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.

Ho Chi Minh City, a historic flood area located some 1,000 miles south of the capital Hanoi, contributes about a quarter of the Vietnam’s gross domestic product. While the metropolis can cope with flood risks today that could hit 23% of its area, further urbanization is raising the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels. Those could cause about $8.4 billion of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact, McKinsey said.

The city still has time to adapt to avoid such risks by having better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas, McKinsey said. Investments and fund-raising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.

Thousands of people fled their homes in Vietnam on Saturday as Typhoon Vamco barrelled towards central regions already pummelled by weeks of successive storms.

Airports have been shut, beaches closed, and a fishing ban put in place as the country braces for winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour (60 miles per hour) when the typhoon makes landfall on Sunday, likely close to Hue.

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in four central provinces, according to the disaster management authority, while state media said hundreds of thousands more may have to flee.

“This is a very strong typhoon,” Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said, warning provinces in Vamco’s projected path to prepare for its impact.

‘No respite’

A series of storms have hit central Vietnam over the past six weeks, causing flooding and landslides that have killed at least 159 people, authorities said, while 70 others are missing.

The severe weather has also damaged or destroyed more than 400,000 homes, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Roads and bridges have been washed away, power supplies disrupted, and crucial food crops destroyed, leaving at least 150,000 people at immediate risk of food shortages, it added.

“There has been no respite for more than eight million people living in central Vietnam,” said Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, Vietnam Red Cross Society president.

“Each time they start rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, they are pummeled by yet another storm.”

Philippine coastguards conduct rescue operations after Typhoon Vamco resulted in severe flooding in the Cagayan Valley region [Reuters] Typhoon Vamco has already caused devastation in the Philippines.

Emergency response teams were dispatched to the northeast on Saturday where more than 340,000 people have been affected by severe flooding following Vamco, which killed at least 53 people across the country, disaster agencies said.

Twenty of the deaths were recorded in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya, which have become the focus of rescue efforts.

Hundreds of people were trapped on rooftops in the hardest-hit areas along the Cagayan river with rescuers unable to reach them because of strong currents, said the spokesman for the regional Office of Civil Defense.

Vast swaths of the region were underwater in what officials have described as the worst flooding in living memory. The release of water from the Magat dam has exacerbated the impact.","Sat, 14 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-14T085834Z_1080446966_RC2W2K9H4DAS_RTRMADP_3_ASIA-STORM-PHILIPPINES.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'red', 'flee', 'severe', 'provinces', 'nears', 'homes', 'typhoon', 'central', 'flooding', 'thousands', 'vamco', 'cagayan']", ,flood
75,75,FL-2017-000120-VNM,Vietnam suffers through a “new normal” of extreme weather events - WSWS,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/28/viet-o28.html,"Vietnam is being pummelled by ongoing tropical storms causing major flooding and landslides in its central regions. As of Monday morning, the death toll had reached 130 with 18 people missing, according to government figures. This was up from 119 fatalities on Saturday, with most occurring in the central provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam.

Close to a million people have been severely affected, with many in desperate need of shelter, food, clean drinking water and income support. According to the UN, as of last Thursday, at least 178,000 homes were currently under water.

Flood levels eclipsed the 1979 record by 0.98 metres, hovering at 4.89 metres for several consecutive days in the province of Quang Binh. The amount of rain that fell between October 6 and 13 was two to six times higher than normal in some regions.

Most of the hardest hit have been poor farmers. Agricultural damage has been extensive, with 1,500 hectares of rice fields and 7,800 hectares of other crops being either flooded or damaged. Close to a million head of cattle and poultry have also been killed or swept away.

The government has stated that the damage caused has been “the worst in five years”. Several highways and local roads are blocked with rocks the size of cars, hampering rescue efforts.

About a third of deaths have been of military personnel.

In one instance, a team of 21 rescuers, most of them military officers, was sent to verify reports of 17 workers buried by a landslide at the Rao Trang 3 hydroelectric plant deep in the jungle. The workers were reportedly asleep when they were buried on October 12.

The rescue team stopped at a ranger station for the night and were buried in a rocky landslide. Of the 13 deaths, 11 were from the military. Only four of the 17 workers at the dam have been recovered thus far and authorities have deployed more rescue forces to the scene.

Days later, a barracks in Quang Tri was consumed by a mudslide in the early hours of the morning, killing 20 military personnel, likely the largest number of military casualties suffered in a period of peace, according to officials.

Scientists believe flooding in central Vietnam is the result of a “new normal” of weather patterns driven by complex processes.

On an international scale, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDDR) reported recently a 75 percent increase in natural disasters in the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, there were 4,212 major natural disasters. Between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded costing 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy USD$2.97 trillion.

The increase is largely attributed to climate related events such as floods, droughts and storms.

Speaking at a virtual conference, UNDDR chief Mami Mizutori accused governments of abandoning effective measures to deal with climate change, “It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction,” he said, “despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.”

In the Asia Pacific, the cyclical la Nina phenomenon is intensifying storms in the region, and is expected to continue until early next year. Cambodia has reported 39 deaths from flooding, with hundreds of thousands affected and 46,216 people evacuated to safer ground.

Vietnam has been hit by three tropical storms and a depression in the month of October. Typhoon Mojave, at present travelling westwards over the Philippines, is also likely to impact in the weeks ahead. It is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds of 130 kilometres per hour. About 9,000 people in the Philippines have fled their homes.

Professor of human ecology at Rutgers University, Pamela McElwee, told the New York Times that the sheer volume of rainfall in Vietnam was, “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it shattered the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in its central regions by the end of the century.

She also stated that the construction of hydroelectric dams and poor mountain roads had weakened the soil. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go.”

Christopher Rassi, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross, warned of the economic fallout: “We are seeing a deadly double disaster unfold before our eyes as these floods compound the difficulties caused by COVID-19. These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.”

The Vietnamese economy relies heavily on its tourism industry which has been drastically cut back during the pandemic. Borders were virtually closed in late March. Apart from an outbreak in Da Nang Hospital in late July, total cases have been kept low and contained at under 1,500, with 40 deaths.

The Asian Development Bank assessed in September that Vietnam’s economy would grow at around 1.8 percent in 2020, its slowest rate in 35 years and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.

The Stalinist regime in Vietnam has ruthlessly pursued a policy of capitalist restoration for decades. According to its own estimates, economic inequality is worsening. Between 2014 and 2018 the GINI index of Vietnam, a standard measure of income inequality, was 0.4 [where 0 represents absolute equality and 1 absolute inequality]. The figure is regarded as a tipping point with higher numbers frequently associated with social unrest and political instability.

Out of fear of social unrest, the regime has sought to suppress criticism from workers and the peasantry. According to the UN, hundreds of people have been interrogated so far over COVID-19 related Facebook posts. In the lead up to the congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in January 2021, the government has begun a campaign of censoring dissident and left-wing publications.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wsws.org/asset/64544160-f1d1-4d85-aecd-24bd939be1eb?rendition=image1280,"['vietnam', 'normal', 'storms', 'quang', 'according', 'extreme', 'workers', 'central', 'events', 'military', 'million', 'rescue', 'suffers', 'weather']", ,flood

Phan Duong

She was worried the 80-kilogram beast might be swept away or escape.

The resident of a village in Quang Dien District explains: ""Pigs can be really destructive if they escape. I did not dare sleep at night.""

Central Vietnam has been hit hard by tropical storms, torrential downpours, floods, and landslides for three weeks now.

The woman, who is in her 50s, took the sow and its litter of four to her brother’s house since it is on higher ground than hers, and never left them alone for a moment.

With a stick in one hand, she made sure the sow behaved. But the animal was spooked and attacked her more than once. Vung has a wound on her right thigh from a bite.

But importantly she has been able to safeguard the family’s most valuable asset.

She had spent a year raising the pig and saw it give birth to four piglets. If she manages to keep all of them safe, and the animal continues to have more litters, she can solve the problem she has been facing: that of paying her daughter’s tuition.

Her daughter is a freshman at a college in Da Nang City, and Vung has to send her VND1.5 million ($65) every month for living expenses besides paying VND6 million a year tuition for the two-year course.

Since her daughter was in 10th grade Vung had been telling her, ""I think you should drop out of school and work; I am not able to afford your schooling.""

But the girl would plead: ""Please let me stay in school so that I can have a proper career in future and build us a better life.""

Vung relented.

Their family consists of just the two of them. Vung does the best she can, growing rice on a 750-square-meter farm and doing agricultural labor and menial jobs for others.

Every year in October she travels to the Central Highlands to harvest coffee and cassava for farmers there. But this year she has been stuck in floods described as the worst in decades.

Earlier this year, along with many other localities across Vietnam, Thua Thien-Hue was also hit by the African swine fever, an incurable and fatal disease in pigs.

Vung worked for other farmers, burying pigs killed by the disease.

""God blessed me and kept my sow healthy.""

Now she has once again kept the sow safe through the floods.

But she has not been able to save a small flock of chickens and a cassava crop that had almost been ready for harvest.

All hopes for the mother and daughter’s future now rest on that one sow.

When meeting us in the courtyard of a government office to receive a donation of essential items from readers of VnExpress through FPT’s Hope Foundation, Vung cannot hold back her tears, and tells us all about her pigs and chickens.

The floodwaters have now started receding in several parts of the central region, including her Quang Dien District, and people are trying to pick up the pieces again after two weeks of living with the floods.

Vung is still at her brother’s house with her pigs since it is still not safe to return home.

Her 20-year-old single-storied house has deteriorated and its walls are cracked, and now after the floods Vung is afraid they could collapse at any time.

""More storms are coming, so I’d better stay here.""

Storm Molave is expected to reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning.

In Phong Dien, another district in Thua Thien Hue, we met Le Thi Sinh, 51.

Three years ago her son passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children. Her daughter-in-law works elsewhere and sends home money for Sinh and her husband to raise the two kids, one of whom is learning to talk while the other is in kindergarten. Sinh’s husband has a number of health problems and so she is the family’s breadwinner.

No one had foreseen such severe flooding. Like many other locals, Sinh and her husband did not have enough time to prepare for the disaster.

When the waters came, they packed off the children, belongings and grain to the first floor. They hung their six piglets, each weighing around 15 kg, from the ceiling, but one was swept away and another was killed.

The floods also swept away their flock of 200 chickens and destroyed their cassava and sweet potato crops.

Her grandchildren cried and asked for their mother. Then they asked for their father after seeing a man next door casting a net to catch fish. There was nothing Sinh could do except shed tears of grief.

Sinh still has a litany of problems to worry about like a loan she took to buy supplements for the pigs and chickens and buying formula and other essential items for the children.

She hopes to get relief from the authorities and plant a new crops and resume her livestock and poultry farming.

In the district’s Phong Xuan Commune, locals grow trees and paddy. In May Storm Noul destroyed grown paperbark and acacia trees, and now the floods have destroyed all the young ones.

In Phong Hien Commune 2,000 families have been living in the floodwaters. They have lost 250 hectares (620 acres) of cassava, 27 hectares of glittering chive, 25 hectares of sugarcane, and 15 hectares of other crops.

""There is nothing left,"" Nguyen Si Hiep, chairman of the commune Fatherland Front Committee, said. The front, an overarching public organization, is tasked with ""promoting national solidarity and unity of mind in political and spiritual matters,"" and conducting many of the government's social programs, especially those to mitigate poverty.

Hiep said the commune administration is advising farmers to switch to short-term crops after the floods recede so that they could earn some income before the new year arrives.

There is way too much attention on flood relief though it is just one part of the big picture when a natural disaster strikes. Reconstructing the livelihoods and rebuilding the lives of millions of people in the central region is now a serious challenge in what has already been a disastrous year.

A World Bank report released last week estimated that 12 million people living in coastal provinces face the threat of severe flooding and over 35 percent of people live on eroding coastlines.

Each year an average of $852 million and 316,000 jobs in key economic sectors are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding.

In this context, I reviewed the concept of social capital. Economists treat social capital as an important resource of the nation. It is understood as the two-way and multidimensional cooperation between members of the society, the power of connection between people in a community, a country, and transactions based on mutual trust that bring mutual benefit.

The fact that Vietnamese everywhere are pitching in to provide succor to people in the central region these days is an expression of social capital in Vietnam.

The World Bank believes that social capital helps the community coordinate voluntarily and effectively because it is based on a common goal to help solve collective problems. The natural disasters in the central region are a collective problem. To address this problem, the government can collaborate with the community and make use of the social capital that has been on display in recent days.

Dealing with the aftermath of the floods gives the government an opportunity to tweak its policies. Authorities should make appropriate decisions to remove unnecessary barriers, paving the way for an increase in tolerance and trust, which would help heal the wounds caused by natural disasters.

A timely and substantial reconstruction plan for people like Vung and Sinh will help soothe the gaping economic wounds suffered by the central region, sustain growth and lead to a sustainable development vision for the country.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

VnExpress’s Hope Foundation is soliciting emergency support for people in central Vietnam, whose lives have been impacted by severe floods and landslides since earlier this month.

When the floodwaters rose on October 12 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Hoang Thi Phuong, a textile worker in Phong Dien District, went into labor.

Her husband tried to take her to hospital, but their motorbike could not cross a flooded section of National Highway 1A. In desperation, he asked a person with a boat to take his wife to the other side.

But the boat capsized just 20 meters from safety. Both Phuong and her unborn baby died.

""I killed you,"" her husband sobbed inconsolably, down on his knees in front of the raging floods that had snatched away his loved ones.

They are not the only victims of the tragedy that has befallen central Vietnam in the last two weeks. Dozens of others, including at least two hydropower plant workers and 13 members of a rescue team, lost their lives to landslides in Thua Thien-Hue.

In the last 10 days nonstop rain and floods have submerged entire regions under a sea of water and triggered massive landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of thousands of houses have been engulfed, and the death toll has been rising relentlessly.

Thousands of families face food and water shortages, and the floods do not seem likely to recede any time soon.

As fighters on the frontlines in a battle against nature, soldiers, doctors, rescuers, and thousands of others have had to take on the harsh and unrelenting elements.

What they need right now are boats, medicines, food, clothes, rescue equipment, and other supplies.

Highlights

From October 6th, the Central region observed prolonged heavy rains that caused severe and widespread flooding and landslides. Water levels have risen rapidly flooding large areas in the provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

80,80,FL-2017-000120-VNM,One million swamped by deadly floods as Viet Nam faces another major storm - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/one-million-swamped-deadly-floods-viet-nam-faces-another-major-storm,"Kuala Lumpur/Hanoi/Geneva, October 14, 2020 – Close to a million people have been severely affected by prolonged flooding in central Viet Nam as the country faces another major tropical storm and further dangerous floods.

Red Cross holds grave fears that deadly floods, which have submerged the country’s central provinces over recent days, will worsen as tropical storm Nangka makes landfall today, bringing destructive winds and dumping more rain on hard hit communities.

Since the floods began in early October, at least 28 people have been killed, more than 200,000 homes flooded and an estimated 84,000 hectares of crops damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people – many cut off by the floodwater – are now in desperate need of emergency relief.

As part of a coordinated relief effort, Viet Nam Red Cross staff and volunteers have been accessing isolated communities by boat to provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and other much needed supplies. More relief supplies are urgently being brought in from other parts of the country.

Mr Hoa Nguyen, Deputy Director of External Relations and Development, Viet Nam Red Cross, said: “Our volunteers and staff have been working in the affected areas since the floods began, providing relief supplies to thousands of people, but we need to reach many more as the rain continues and floods worsen. Every day we hear of more families who have lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods.”

Hung Ha Nguyen, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator said: “These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods.”

“Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities, especially on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need to help ensure families receive the relief they need in the coming days and weeks,” Mr Hung Ha said.

So far, at least 235 people have died or been listed missing after the floods and landslides triggered by storms and heavy rains in central Vietnam last month, the government informed the National Assembly Tuesday.

Among the casualties were 35 military officers and soldiers of two different military teams sent on search and rescue missions after landslides hit several districts in the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri.

The region suffered historic flooding, with the peak time falling between October 12 and 19. Floodwaters inundated the homes of 317,000 families with 1.2 million members from Nghe An to Quang Nam, with many areas being flooded for nearly two weeks.

Over 200,000 houses were seriously damaged. Many public construction projects also suffered heavy damage and roads were heavily eroded.

Of the total damage of VND17 trillion, VND10 trillion ($430.16 million) was caused by Molave, one of the most powerful storms to hit Vietnam, the government said.

The storm made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28, causing heavy rains and deadly landslides in the central region.

Earlier, the government granted over VND1 trillion, over 11,500 tons of rice and other essential items in relief support for the worst-hit central provinces.

Not over

The government said it would continue to mobilize all forces to search for the victims buried in several landslides and fishermen missing at sea. Among the missing are 12 hydropower plant workers in Thua Thien-Hue Province who were hit by a landslide on October 12, 19 residents in Quang Nam Province hit by two landslides as an impact of Storm Molave last week, and 23 fishermen from Binh Dinh Province whose boats sank in rough sea as the storm was near.

Priority in relief support will be given to those in worst-hit localities and isolated areas and to quickly repairing infrastructure and public construction works damaged by storms and floods, the parliament was told.

The government is also joining forces with local authorities to evacuate residents from high risk areas as storm Goni, the 10th storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, heads towards south-central Vietnam.

International forecasting agencies expect the storm to directly affect the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.

Natural disasters, predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

One day in mid-September Cao Van Bi, 50, was rowing a boat with his wife across a paddy field that had been partially flooded.

All over the field, in Phu Hoi, a rural commune in An Giang Province’s An Phu District, traps had been set up to catch fish.

That morning the catch was 2.5 kilograms of carp and five kilograms of other fish and shrimp.

In previous years, during the flooding season, Bi would have got dozens of kilograms worth of fish every day, but these days it never exceeds 10 kg.

The reason is that the annual flooding of Vietnam's Mekong Delta from the upstream Mekong before reaching the sea no longer occurs.

Not far away, in Vinh Hoi Dong Commune in An Phu, Phan Van Lang, 54, was standing in front of his house.

Since they live in an area hit by annual flooding, Lang and his neighbors have their houses built well above the ground. His house is nearly three meters in the air with a flight of the stairs leading up from the road. In 2000, for instance, the floodwater almost reached the house. But ever since the flooding levels have kept decreasing.

Pointing at the road in front of his house, he says the entire road would have been under one meter of water at this time of the year but this year, the water has not even reached the road.

Hung Dien Commune in Long An Province's Tan Hung District, 80 km (50 miles) away, has been witnessing the clearest change.

In the past its paddy fields would have waters reaching waist high and be filled with water lilies and boats would be the only means of getting around.

That scene now exists only in the memories of seniors.

Bay De, 53, who has been fishing for more than 30 years, recalls floods when catching up to 200 kg of various kinds of fish every day and earning a million dong ($40) was a ""piece of cake.""

For several weeks now he has not caught any fish. He spends almost every day drinking tea and chatting with neighbors in his thatched house.

Fifty kilometers away, Tran Van Thanh, 58, of Tan Lap Commune in Moc Hoa District is fixing traps for catching crabs.

He has been doing this for dozens of years, a job that has ensured a decent livelihood, but that has changed.

""I used to set up more than 600 traps during the flood season, but only a few tens of them these days because the flood waters are way too low and there are no crabs to catch.""

In the neighboring province of Dong Thap, Nguyen Van Phuong, 42, of Tan Thanh A Commune in Tan Hong District is watching the news on TV for possible information about the floods, something he has been looking forward to for several weeks now.

He has an eight-hectare rice field and has been waiting for the floods to come so that he could start sowing the winter-spring crop.

There was heavy rain a few weeks ago, and water had filled up canals and then reached the fields. Phuong, thinking the floods had finally arrived, hired people to till the soil.

But soon a scorching sun replaced the rains and water dropped, leaving the field dry and cracked once again.

He says: ""I had spent VND750,000 ($32.44) per hectare, but that has been a wasted effort. Now I have to wait for the floodwaters to come and do that all over again.""

In his neighborhood, farmers are now worried that if the floods do not come or are low, they would have to shell out money to pump water from canals into their fields.

Rice farmers in the delta have for generations depended on the floodwaters to come and inundate their fields before sow seeds directly.

The Plain of Reeds, a wetland straddling Long An and Dong Thap provinces, produces more than two million tons of rice a year.

The floods usually start coming in late July or early August and remain until November or even later to bless the region with extraordinary fertility as they typically deposit silt from upstream areas.

When they do not come or arrive late, cropping and fishing activities are disrupted.

For several years now they have been late or deficient, and experts have been blaming this on climate change and the construction of a series of dams in the upstream area.

According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, this year’s floodwater level in the delta will be only 55 percent of the long-term average, which translates into a shortfall of 130 billion cubic meters.

It will be 15 percent lower than last year’s level and the lowest in a decade, it has warned.

Late last year the highest water levels in the upstream areas of the delta were 1.12-2 meters lower than the long-term average and 1-1.65 meters lower than in the previous year.

The delta suffered the worst salinity levels and resultant freshwater shortage in 100 years but meteorologists warn things could get worse.

Tran Tan Tai, deputy head of the agriculture department of Long An’s Tan Hung District, says the water level in his hometown is currently 1.4 meters, or 80 centimeters lower than a year ago.

""If there are no floods, the fields will lack silt, and pathogens and wild grass seeds will not be washed away, and farmers will have to spend more on pesticide and fertilizers.""

Meteorologists expect the floods to come around the middle of this month, stay low and ebb away quickly.

Those were the days

Early one morning in late September, Muoi, 64, of Tan Lap rides a motorbike to a wet market two kilometers away from home. He returned after a while with a bag of barb.

""All my life I have seen fish all over the place every time it is the flooding season, but now I have to go buy them... Isn’t it weird?""

Not far from his home a neighbor had set up a lift net the previous night, but until around noon the next day, when Muoi returned from the market, it had only around two kilograms of fish.

Muoi can never forget what it was like one or two decades ago: Every year when the flood season arrived, water would be everywhere, covering the fields and even the streets. People would be rowing boats, picking water lilies and river hemp, both used to make specialty dishes of the region.

In the water, there would be so much fish that anyone could become a fisherman without having to learn any skills.

""Back then people did not weigh fish in kilograms but in a unit of around 20 kilograms. Normally, in one night a family could catch at least five to seven of that unit. Some would even feed the fish to their pigs.""

In years of heavy flooding fish moving down stream into the delta would breed along the way, and it would be extremely rare to see a field or waterway without fish in it.

Fishermen would enlarge the holes in their net to only catch adult fish, leaving the young ones untouched.

When the floods retreated, mud, algae and water lilies would be left in the paddy fields. The fields mud would be silt while the algae and flowers served as organic fertilizers, leaving the fields with all the nutrition they needed.

Besides, the floods would wash away the pathogens and wild grass seeds, and it was not common for farmers to use fertilizers or pesticides.

A kilometer away from Muoi’s place, Danh Van Minh, 62, asks his son to take him by motorbike to a house nearby. The house stands along a canal and in front is a concrete road around three meters wide.

""This used to be a small dirt road, and every year during this season it would be two or three meters under water,"" Minh says.

""The house used to be just a hut beside which I would anchor my boat after fishing.""

Minh’s life has been filled with tragedy. He lost his first wife and two of his children during two different flood seasons.

In the middle of the 1991 season his wife had twins, but both died at birth due to lack of medical care in that rural area.

Worse still the floods covered every inch of land that they could not find a place to bury the children. All he could do was put their bodies in a coffin, stick a bamboo pole in the water and hang the coffin up that.

Only a month after they passed away could he give them a proper burial.

Five years after they lost the twins, Minh’s wife suddenly fell sick and died. Once again he could not bury her immediately, and had to leave her body inside a coffin on the family boat and leave it anchored next to the hut.

In the past 20 years the delta has witnessed several floods that left a significant impact on its residents, especially in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2011.

The 2000 floods were the most severe in 70 years, with the water rising to 4.78 meters. They claimed 481 lives and caused losses of nearly VND4 trillion.

As told by Le Thanh Tam, party chief of Long An Province in 1999-2005, 20 years ago and further, the Plain of Reeds had heavy floods almost every year.

The region had not yet got an embankment system, and every time it flooded there was no way to tell where the road was and where the canal was. The only way people could move around was by boat.

""Back then we always had fish, shrimps and crabs in abundance, but we would lose lives every year, and of children in most cases.

""When the floods retreated, we had to expend a lot of effort to rebuild houses and roads.""

But a 2017 study by the Mekong River Commission estimated that the flooding provides $8-10 billion in annual economic benefits while causing losses of just $60-70 million.

The Mekong River flows through six countries, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before reaching the sea.

Many parts of the Mekong Delta were formed by sedimentation over eons.

When the Vietnamese expanded their nation to the south, they began to conquer the delta in the 18th century. For generations, no other place in the nation could compare with it as a agriculture and aquaculture hub.

In his book ‘Last days of the Mighty Mekong’ published in February last year, Brian Eyler, director of the Asia Program at U.S. think tank Stimson Center, writes: ""For the past 3,000 years, the Mekong carried about 150 million tons of sediment in its system to the delta each year.""

Without the sedimentation, the delta’s land would fall apart under natural conditions, which are worsened by intense groundwater extraction and sea level rise, he says.

He strongly condemns China’s dam building in the upstream areas of the Mekong for holding back floodwaters and, along with them, sediments.

Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent researcher into the ecology of the Mekong Delta, says the main cause of the low floods this year is the El Nino phenomenon that lasted from the year’s beginning to the end of August, resulting in scanty rain fall in the region.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the rainy season arrived late last year and was shorter than usual, with the result that rainfall was 8 percent below normal at 1,240 mm.

Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of Can Tho University’s Research Institute of Climate Change, says the calamity faced by the delta cannot be blamed just on nature or Chinese dams.

""Sea levels rise and the Earth gets warmer. Yes. But that happens just a little each year and it needs a long period for dramatic changes. It is humans who have accelerated that process.""

He cites one example of human action that changed the delta’s hydrological profile. Ever since the delta was formed, it has had several low-lying areas like the Long Xuyen quadrilateral in Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and Can Tho City and the Plain of Reeds that worked as natural reservoirs to store the seasonal floodwaters, he explains.

For generations farmers did not use them for cultivation, but due to the wars, the nation had to consider food security, and built embankments to keep the seasonal floodwaters from flowing into them and directed the water toward the sea, he says.

""Now in peace time, we still have the mindset of growing as much rice as we can, and many have treated the seasonal floods as a disaster for their paddy fields while in fact it is a blessing.

""With that thinking, many have continued to keep out the floods, going against nature, thus intensifying the lack of water once it took hold in the region.""

Minh, who has been a poor farmer his entire life and is haunted by a tragic past related to the floods, does not care much for the explanations experts like Tuan have to offer.

After his wife’s death, he took his son to another village, remarried and built a new life.

He now owns a 6,000 sq.m rice field and both his home and field are surrounded by embankments, allowing him and others in his neighborhood to go against nature and cultivate three instead of just two rice crops as in the past.

The field does not have any time to recover, and instead of getting floodwaters that wash it clean and deposit sediments, it has to do with plant protection chemicals instead.

With this method of growing rice, farmers remain mired in poverty since they have to spend money on fertilizers and pesticides for every crop and also lose out on an abundant source of fish, shrimp and crab and the plants that always grow in the flood season.

""My children and grandchildren have all taken turns to leave,"" Minh says, reflecting the trend of delta dwellers abandoning their hometown for Ho Chi Minh City and other industrial areas, where they work in factories or the service sector.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/05/lu-dong-thap-muoi-2300-1601345-2309-7479-1601885014_1200x0.jpg,"['continue', 'annual', 'field', 'water', 'dry', 'flooding', 'floods', 'delta', 'anguish', 'mekong', 'fields', 'season', 'away', 'fish', 'deltas']", ,flood

Highways in the provinces have also been severely damaged, with the total cost of repairs estimated at around VND 355 billion, state media said, citing figures provided by the Directorate of Roads of Vietnam on Oct. 21.

Also on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung and deputies of Vietnam’s National Assembly welcomed efforts by Vietnamese pop star Thuy Tien to collect more than VND 100 billion (U.S. $15,316,811) for relief work in flood-hit Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue.

Large-scale fundraising is normally restricted by law to state organizations or social associations to reduce the risk of personal gain, with penalties prescribed for violations. But National Assembly deputy Le Thanh Vanh voiced confidence in the work of Thuy Tien and her staff.

“They are ready to take responsibility before the sponsors who donated the funds,” Vanh said, quoted on Oct. 21 in state media reports. “I am sure they will be completely transparent,” he said.

Relief teams have poured for the last few days into central regions hit by floods and landslides that have destroyed roads and buried workers at a hydropower plant and soldiers at a military barracks, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told state media on Wednesday.

Many areas have already received help, while others remain cut off because of damaged roads, Dung said, calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to send more teams to reach remote areas and give further support to those already helped.

34 now killed in Cambodia

Relief work meanwhile continues in Cambodia, where 34 people have now been killed by floods to date, with Prime Minister Hun Sen urging local authorities to guard damaged homes to prevent looting and calling on banks and other lending institutions to delay or reduce payments owed to them by villagers impoverished by the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 has hit us hard for the last 10 months, and now we are facing floods that are destroying us,” Hun Sen said.

“We have not concluded our damage assessments yet. For now, we are just working to rescue people and take them to safer areas,” he said.

Around 10,000 families have already been safely evacuated from flood-hit areas, Cambodian media sources say.

Speaking to RFA, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha said that flood waters are now receding in several provinces, including Oddor Meanchey, Pursat, Takeo, Pailin, Kampong Speu, Stung Treng, and the two hardest-hit provinces of Banteay Meahchey and Battambang.

The 34 flood deaths reported so far reflect the inability of central government and local authorities to deal effectively with the disaster, said Kean Ponlok, secretary general of the Cambodia Intellectual Students Alliance.

“The authorities must look into the causes of these deaths and hold themselves responsible,” he said, adding that because of corruption in Cambodia, he is not convinced that all donations handed over to the government will be spent on victims of the floods.

Banteay Meanchey villager Nay Thoeun said she has now lost her home and job because of the floods and is debt after borrowing money from a bank to buy medicine to treat the tuberculosis to which she was exposed in her family.

“I am very worried. I’m living now under a shelter on a hill, but the water is still rising here, and I’m afraid of [venomous insects].”

“I’m urgently calling for aid to be delivered to this hill. There are many poor families here,” she said.

Flood begins to recede in Laos

In Laos, flood waters have begun to recede from eight districts in Savannakhet province, where 125 villages containing 5,134 families, or nearly 30,000 people, have been affected, Lao media sources say.

In the province’s Sepon district alone, 40 villages containing nearly a thousand households have been flooded, with many houses completely destroyed, sources said.

Sepon’s La Or and Vang Khot villages were hardest hit, with 44 houses swept away, and another 90 dwellings hit by fast-running floods and partly damaged, a district official said on Oct. 21.

“The district is still asking for help, but we will set up temporary refuges in the villages for people to live in,” the official said, adding that funds are being sought for building materials such as roofs and nails for the construction of temporary shelters.

Fast-rising water hit one village on Oct. 18 and swept away 28 or 29 houses, leaving nothing to come back to when villagers returned two days later, one villager said. “Now we have no place to stay in but the schools, and no one has any clothing. We are waiting to see how the authorities plan to handle this.”

“We are all in a very poor condition. We have no rice to eat, and all our rice fields are flooded. We will have to buy all the rice that we eat next year,” he said.

“The water is receding now, but the villagers’ houses are damaged beyond repair, and nothing can be restored. There is no thought of fixing them now,” a rescue team member said, adding that many residents of Sepon and other districts are still cut off because of damage to the roads.

Though Lao authorities had moved quickly to help victims of the floods, more help is needed, an NGO official said, asking that neither he nor his organization be named. “For a start, we urgently need dry food and drinking water, clothes, rice, and many other things, as so many houses have been swept away.”

“The authorities did go down to do everything they could, but there are just too many villagers to help,” he said.

Many residents in areas of Sepon and Phin districts are still out of reach, a Sepon district official said. “We are still unable to get to almost half of the areas affected by the floods because the roads have been cut off by landslides,” he said.

Losses in Savannakhet including houses damaged, livestock drowned, and paddy fields destroyed are still being calculated, the official Vientiane Times said on Oct. 21.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguy?n Thái H?p celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vu?t Lu C?ng Ð?ng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p, the bishop of Hà Tinh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghia, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Ngu?n N?y River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tinh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghia, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Ð?n.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_festaOK.JPG,"['tinh', 'h?p', 'centre', 'build', 'bishop', 'thái', 'hà', 'catholics', 'flood', 'work', 'nguy?n', 'local', 'community', 'paul', 'house', 'tiên', 'victims']", ,flood

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan donated US$400,000 on Friday (Oct. 23) to Vietnam in aid after the country suffered the severest floods and landslides in decades.

Richard Shih (???), Taiwan’s representative in Vietnam, said the Taiwanese business community in Vietnam, as well as non-governmental organizations from Taiwan, have mobilized themselves to send relief to the stricken areas in the country's central region. He said he hoped the victims will be able to reconstruct their homes and return to a normal life as soon as possible.

As of Friday, the series of floods and landslides have killed at least 114 people, and 20 people remain missing. Among those who lost their lives are dozens of military personnel who were deployed to search for those who had gone missing in previous disasters.

The Vietnamese military said it has suffered the most serious casualties in peacetime. In addition to the loss of lives, hundreds and thousands of houses were wiped out in central Vietnam, including Quang Tri and Thua Thien Huei provinces, and schools and other facilities have been forced to close.

Tran Quang Hoai, an official responsible for coordinating Vietnam’s rescue missions, accepted Taiwan's donation on behalf of the Vietnamese government at a ceremony on Friday. He remarked that the government is grateful for the generosity of the Taiwanese authorities and people, and that it will make the most appropriate arrangement for the donation so that relief and aid can be distributed to those in need soon, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

MOFA said via a statement that more than 320,000 Vietnamese migrant workers and new immigrants are living in Taiwan, and that the people of the two countries have been more than good partners.

87,87,FL-2017-000120-VNM,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hardest', 'flooded', 'water', 'change', 'infrastructure', 'flood', 'flooding', 'region', 'floods', 'global', 'risk', 'river', 'hits', 'asia', 'climate']", ,flood

The bodies of two people were recovered on Saturday evening, while one remains missing.

The Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Van Ban District reported that the sudden floods affected 25 households, with furniture, motorbikes and construction materials damaged.

Two houses were swept away and dozens of others were damaged.

Prime Minister Ph?m Minh Chính issued a dispatch asking localities to focus resources on dealing with the consequences of floods and heavy rain in the northern mountainous region since Friday.

In the dispatch to the people’s committees of the six northern mountainous provinces of Lai Chau, Yen Bai, Son La, Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang, the Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control, National Committee for Disaster Response and Search and Rescue, and relevant ministries and agencies, the PM extended his condolences to families of the victims, and asked the local authorities to help locals fix houses and clean the environment, and provide them with food and essential goods.

He also asked the localities to keep a close watch on developments of flooding and rain, and to review and assess the safety of homes, especially in areas at high risk of flash floods and landslides, while preparing forces, vehicles, and equipment to deal with any circumstances.

The media will continue to provide information on developments of the natural disaster, damage, and response efforts, according to the dispatch.

The recent, devastating floods highlight the fragility of the country's natural environment. Deforestation, expanded farming, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric dams are the main culprits. In four years, 7,300 hectares of forest have been lost. So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built with another 450 on their way.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) – Recent floods in Vietnam caused by typhoons and tropical storms have had a devastating impact in terms of lost human lives, environmental damage, and economic dislocations, highlighting the fragility of the Asian country's environment.

Frequent and violent weather events worry both environmentalists and the affected communities more and more.

According to Vietnam’s Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, the main factor is deforestation and the conversion of entire forests to farmland, timber harvesting, and the large dam and hydroelectric plant construction.

Among the most affected areas are the central coastal region and the central Highlands, scene of the recent devastations.

The General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control estimates that some 7,300 hectares of forest land were lost between 2016 and 2019, with an annual average of 1,800.

At the current rate of deforestation, if nothing is done to slow this down, the risk of floods and landslides will increase considerably, along with periods of drought and loss of mangroves.

Environmentalists and experts note that the life and survival of Highland communities are closely linked to local forests.

From the central part of the country to the Mekong River Delta in the south, forests play a leading role in regulating local ecosystems, biodiversity, water resources, and the climate of much of the country.

For Prof Nguy?n Ng?c Lung, forests are key to blocking winds, limiting soil erosion and containing the devastating force of storms. In addition, tree roots absorb excess water.

Deforestation contributes to climate change, global warming, drought, rising water levels, pollution, and famine.

In view of the situation, the General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, noting that the country has recently had to face between 10 and 15 floods.

The blame goes to extensive “legal and illegal” deforestation to expand farmland, harvest timber or build crucial hydro-electric plants to meet the country’s energy needs.

So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built and another 450 are in the planning phase with further devastating impact on the environment.

Some see these plants as ""water bombs"" ready to strike at the population. Their effects are visible in many parts of the country, including Da Lat, a city that is located about 1,500 metres above sea level and a major tourist destination, with its almost year-round cool and temperate climate.

Since 2012, the city has been hit by flooding with increasing frequency, to the extent that today, when rain is intense, many parts of the city and Lam Dong province ""end up submerged by water"".

Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc Thanh.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Vietnam has given $540,000 in immediate support to women and girls in six central provinces affected by flooding.

UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of hygiene items and maternal health equipment. It is also supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services.

The central region has suffered unprecedented flooding from prolonged downpours and successive typhoons since October 6, resulting in at least 230 people dead or missing. Storm Molave hit the region on October 28, reportedly one of the strongest in 20 years.

At least 5.5 million people in the region have been affected, including more than 1.3 million women of reproductive age, over 92,000 of them pregnant mothers, who need uninterrupted services for pregnancy and menstruation, UNFPA said.

According to joint rapid assessment led by UNFPA last week, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programs such as antenatal, delivery, post-natal care and family planning services have been disrupted.

As a result, local women are unable to manage their hygiene properly and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear needed to manage menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and places to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged, the organization explained.

On October 12, a 35-year-old pregnant mother living in Phong Dien District of Thua Thien-Hue Province died on her way to give birth.

She entered labor in the morning, with her husband hiring a boat to take her to a local medical center for delivery. However, the boat was upturned and she was swept away by floodwater.

Her husband and local residents tried to look for her, but failed because of the fast-flowing current. Her body was found in the afternoon.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA representative in Vietnam, said: ""When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousands of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable. Women do not need to die giving birth, and this must hold true even in emergencies.

The National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on Monday afternoon that the low pressure out in the north of the South China Sea (known in Vietnam as the East Sea) had strengthened into a typhoon internationally known as Nangka.

Nangka is forecast to make landfall in the north-central part of Vietnam on Wednesday, while the accompanying rains could cover the central region already battered by torrential downpours over the last few days.

The centre forecast that central provinces would face heavy rains ranging from 150 to 300mm on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control issued an urgent letter on Monday asking the bureau to closely supervise the development of the low pressure system and issue warnings to localities and ships.

Authorities also instructed boats and ships to find safe habour and to take measures to ensure the safety of local people and tourists on islands and in coastal areas.

The Foreign Ministry was also asked to contact countries and territories to ask for shelter for Vietnamese fishermen.

The ongoing downpour, exacerbated by Typhoon Linfa which hit the central region on Sunday morning before weakening to a low pressure area, destroyed a total of 382 houses and flooded 109,034 others, and damaged 108 sections of national highways and 8.6km of provincial highways.

The disaster caused big losses to agricultural production by destroying 584ha of rice, 3,879ha of vegetable, 2,141ha of aquaculture, whilst killing about 150,700 cattle and poultry.

In Danang, many communes were submerged by rising floods worsened by water discharged from hydropower reservoirs.

As of 7am on Monday morning, the communes of Hòa Phong, Hòa Nhon, Hòa Liên, Hòa Khuong, Hòa Châu and Hòa Ti?n were badly submerged, affecting the lives of 3,000 local households in 38 hamlets.

In the mountainous districts of Hoà Vang, Liên Chi?u and C?m L?, there was high risk of flash floods and landslides.

At present, 882 households in typhoon-affected areas have been moved to safer areas.

Meanwhile, people in the central province of Th?a Thiên-Hu? are entering their fifth day of flooding and heavy rain.

Rainfall of over 1,000mm flooded areas near the B? River, badly affecting to districts of Phong Ði?n and Qu?ng Ði?n, as well as Huong Trà Township.

Local people have been suffering from food shortages due to disrupted transport.

Hoàng Sinh, a resident of Phong Hi?n Commune, told Vietnam News Agency that his family’s food reserves were running due to the prolonged rain and flooding, and they were down to a few packs of instant noodles and rice.

Tr?n Ð?c Thi?n, chairman of Phong Hi?n Commune, said the local government was trying to reach local households to supply food, drink and medicine.

“The floods surged rapidly and people in low-lying areas could not keep up. Water spilled into their houses submerging them up to one metre,” said Tr?n Van Hoàn from Huong Trà Township.

“The whole family had to move to a neighbour's house. For several days, we only had instant noodles to survive,” said Hoàn.

“This is the worst flood since 2006. It has badly affected 70 per cent of local people,” said Ph?m Công Phu?c, vice chairman of Qu?ng Thái Commune.

The provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Rescue reported that as of 6pm on Sunday, three people had died, while seven were injured and another was missing.

Nineteen houses had, and 53,385 houses and 360ha of crops had been flooded.

More than 100km of coastline from Huong River across Huong Th? Commune and Huong Trà Township was severely damaged by erosion. About 300m of the dyke in Qu?ng Phú Commune, Qu?ng Ði?n District was also hit.

In Hu?, more than 50 per cent of roads in 27 wards and 2,560 houses were flooded as of Monday morning.

In Qu?ng Tr? Province, the flooding dramatically increased on Monday morning.

The downpour made the water in the Th?ch Hãn and Ô Lâu rivers reach alert levels.

The river water levels were forecast to continue rising today and next days.

To cope with the situation, Qu?ng Tr? authorities have asked the central Government to supply materials and rescue equipment, including two amphibious vehicles, 27 boats, rescue equipment and chemicals for disinfection.

The week-long rain killed six and injured two in the province, with a further six reported missing in the province.

Hue, Vietnam — Every day for the last four months, Duong Thi Mong has carried food, pots, dishes and other utensils on her shoulders to walk nearly 5 kilometers daily from her house to a nearby village, where she serves com hen (rice mixed with mussel, a popular traditional dish) to local people on streets of Thua Thien Hue province. Mong, a Buddhist from Hue's Vi Da ward in central Vietnam, which is famous for its mussels, said she usually takes her boat to carry food over the Huong River then walks only 600 meters to her destination. However, her boat was wiped out in severe flooding after six tropical storms hit the central provinces in October and November. The 56-year-old mother of two said she earns 80,000 to 100,000 dong ($3.50 to $4.30) per day to support her family, not enough money to buy a new boat. She said she had to work harder and sell food at night to get money to prepare food for the celebration of Tet, or Lunar New Year. Local markets closed for the weeklong traditional festival Feb. 10 ahead of the New Year, which starts Feb. 12. Thankfully, sisters across Vietnam have stepped in to help Mong and others like her.

""I am excited for the nuns who offered me 10 million dong [$435] on Jan. 28. I will use the money to buy a new boat for my work soon,"" Mong said cheerfully, adding that the boat is really a lifeboat that will help save her energy so she can work longer and earn more money to put food on the table. Sr. Maria Truong Thi Minh Yen of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate said her community provided boats for 12 people who lost their boats during the severe floods that left many people nothing in their wake. Yen, who serves Tan Thuy Parish, said she called on benefactors for donations. ""We do want to provide local flood victims with longer-term help so that they can stand on their own feet and return to normal life soon,"" she said. Many victims do not have enough money to be able to purchase basic means of doing their jobs. The 69-year-old nun said her convent gives clothes, blankets, rice and medicine to more than 100 street people, migrants, boat people and slum dwellers on a regular basis. Many live in makeshift shelters while others stay in low-rent, stuffy lodgings as their properties were washed away by flooding. ""They have suffered much from the last natural disasters and the chilly weather this year,"" Yen said. The temperature fell to 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January in the tropical area.

Yen, member of the Hue Archdiocese's committee representing local women religious orders, said some local congregations have built and repaired 40 victims' homes at a total cost of 1 billion dong ($43,000). Luong The Thien from Phu Hiep ward said he built a new house in January after he received 65 million dong from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. His old 40-square-meter house was damaged in the floods. Thien, a 54-year-old Buddhist, said he could not afford to rebuild his house as he works as a motorbike taxi driver to support his wife, who has lung cancer, and three children. ""We are happy to celebrate the Tet festival in the dream house. We are extremely grateful for the nuns' generous help that benefits our life long-term,"" he said, adding that according to tradition, people cannot be well-established in their careers until they have stable homes.

Thien said he has had a good relationship with the nuns since he took a nun from a local hospital to her convent in 2008. The nuns regularly visit his family, and his children receive a monthly scholarship from them. Nguyen The Thieu, a Buddhist from Cau Nhi village, said he is among seven local families who received money to repair their storm-damaged houses. His Catholic son-in-law introduced him to the nuns. ""We have received humanitarian aid seven times from sisters and Catholic benefactors, and we gradually overcame the hard times,"" the 78-year-old father of four said. Sr. Maria Nguyen Thi Hong of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Visitation, who serves Nam Dong Parish, said the nuns offer 60 local ethnic Co Tu and Kinh families money to buy pigs and chicken to raise and fertilizers to cultivate their crops. Local people lost all their crops, poultry and cattle during the floods and now have to collect firewood and bamboo shoots for a living.

As of Wednesday morning, northern Vinh Phuc Province had reported two fatalities while Lao Cai, Son La, Lai Chau and Thai Nguyen claimed one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.

The committee said at least four others were injured.

Since last Sunday, northern provinces have been battered by torrential downpours due to the influence of a tropical convergence zone and effects from tropical storm Higos, which made landfall on China’s southern coast Wednesday morning.

Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Ha Giang and Tuyen Giang experienced heavy rainfall of up to 300 mm each downpour while Quang Ninh, home to world famous Ha Long Bay, and Hai Phong City received rainfall of between 200 and 350 mm each time. Levels of 180 mm a day are considered heavy.

At least 334 houses in the localities were damaged. Over 550 ha of rice and other crops were inundated while landslides blocked many roads leading to northern mountainous provinces like Lai Chau and Lao Cai, home to popular Sa Pa Town.

Weather forecasters warned northern provinces should expect heavy downpours with rainfall of between 100 and 250 mm from Thursday to Saturday due to the impacts of Higos.

Tran Quang Hoai, vice head of the committee, asked northern authorities to deploy rescue teams and evacuate residents in flood-prone areas.

Higos is the fourth storm formed in the East Sea this year.

The waters, known internationally as the South China Sea, could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, half of them directly affecting the country, meteorologists said.

Natural disasters, including drought, floods and landslides, killed 133 Vietnamese last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In the first half of this year, natural disasters killed 47 people and caused economic damages of VND3.3 trillion, according to official data.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/08/19/a9f5d4e442a7abf9f2b6-159782323-4253-6860-1597823279_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'flood', 'provinces', 'tropical', 'hit', 'heavy', 'rainfall', 'mm', 'committee', 'cai', 'killed', 'northern', 'ha']", ,flood_and_drought

The United Nations Population Fund in Vietnam will provide an additional $800,000 to support women and girls affected by flooding in eight central provinces and cities.

It brings the UNFPA's total support to $1.34 million. In October it had given $540,000.

The support includes setting up mobile and outreach health care clinics and the distribution of dignity kits with essential hygiene items and vital maternal health equipment and supplies.

Between early October and mid-November the central region and parts of the Central Highlands were hit by a succession of storms that brought torrential rains, resulting in severe flooding and landslides.

At least 192 people were killed and 57 others are still listed missing, and losses amounted to VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), the government said.

Around 5.5 million people have been affected, including over 1.3 million women of reproductive age and more than 92,000 pregnant women, the UNFPA said.

The disaster forced women and girls into shelters without having the time to pack essential supplies, and many lack basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear that are needed to manage their menstrual periods, it said, adding that access to water and places to wash, dry reusable pads and clothes and dispose of used materials are lacking.

Routine public health programs such as antenatal, child birth, post-natal care, and family planning services have been disrupted.

The government provided VND770 billion for emergency relief.

Many international organizations and countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Australia also provided aid.","Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/08/huukhoaduadeolethuy51603180554-1148-5001-1607411128_1200x0.jpg,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'rains', 'health', 'girls', 'flooding', 'central', 'agency', '800000', 'women', 'pregnant', 'million', 'support', 'provided']", ,floood

On the night of October 11, Le Trung Lam, a resident of the central town, braved the floods to go and pick up some migrant students who had been marooned in their inundated home for days. He took them to his company on Ngu Binh Street, An Tay Ward, where 30 people were already sheltering.

They cook in the kitchen and eat three meals a day, and also have blankets, mattresses and electricity.

Three days earlier, many students from other places now studying in Hue, had no idea where to shelter as the floodwaters rose relentlessly and inundated their homes. Then Lam's message arrived out of the blue.

He said: ""The company's headquarters, a five-floor building, is situated on Ngu Binh Mountain, and so the water has not reached it yet. Its two top floors have 10 rooms each that can accommodate 20-30 people.""

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential downpours in central Vietnam for a week now have killed 29 as of Tuesday morning. Among the deaths, six are from Thua Thien-Hue Province, home to Hue.

Lam, 33, decided to turn his company into a shelter on October 8 as the waters reached some major roads and were expected to rise further. Driving around the town to check on the flood situation and how people were coping, he passed by the studio apartment where he himself had lived 15 years ago as a migrant student from central Nghe An Province. He too had suffered during flooding.

Fearing for students who were possibly cut off, he posted an announcement that he was willing to shelter people.

In the last few days he has received hundreds of calls from people seeking help. Since the neighborhood still has access to electricity and the market remains open, Lam's employees have been able to buy food and cook meals.

Lam said he would take care of the students until the floods receded.

If the water level keeps rising, he plans to also use the main hall which can hold 500 people.

Le Thi Anh Ngoc, 19, from the central Quang Binh Province, said she walked on flooded streets for more than an hour to reach Lam's place on the morning of October 11.

""I arrived in Hue four days ago. I did not know who would help us before I learned about Lam.""

Six kilometers away from the company, on Tung Thien Vuong Street, Ngo Thi Kim Loan is busy making 500 banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich, with the help of a few others to send to people stranded on Hen Dune and Han Mac Tu Street.

Loan, who regularly does charity, always has instant noodles at home. Three days ago, seeing the rising water levels, she gave away 100 boxes of them to households in her neighborhood facing difficulties.

On October 12 she cooked 40 kilograms of rice for people living in areas where power has been turned off due to the floods.

The owner of a noodles restaurant also posted on her Facebook page that families with children or old people could command shelter at her home.

In the evening, when Loan sent 300 banh mi to households on Hen, Le Quoc Phong, Loan's neighbor, 40, was eating dinner under an oil lamp. The island in the middle of the Huong River was cut off by the rising waters.

Phong volunteered to help distribute food to those in need. Finishing his meal, he quickly got on a boat to take the banh mi to people before dinner time was over.

Distributing food and offering accommodation are Hue people’s way of supporting people affected by the floods.

Dozens of families living in higher places said they are ready to take in people whose houses are flooded and provide instant noodles to those who need them.

Free food distribution centers have been set up in downtown areas in the last few days, but are accessible only to people living nearby because of the situation.

People are also helping their fellows facing a threat of losing their livelihoods.

Over several days, strong winds and torrential rains caused huge damage, submerging homes, wiping out farmland, killing and sweeping away cattle. The Diocese of Hà Tinh, along with Caritas and the Catholic Business Association brought donations.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) - Strong winds and torrential rain over several days have caused flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 37 so far. Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên Hu? and Qu?ng Nam are the most affected provinces.

Heavy rains from 10 to 13 October inundated residential areas, farmland and roads, causing huge damages to people and property.

The General Department of Disaster Prevention reported that, in addition to the 37 deaths, at least 50,000 houses were flooded or wrecked whilst 250 hectares of rice fields and 2,500 hectares planted with vegetables were wiped out. Some 900 hectares dedicated to aquaculture were also damaged; at least 60,000 animals, mainly cows and poultry, were killed or swept away by the raging waters.

Bishop Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p of Hà Tinh (about 340 km south of the capital, near the coast), decided to visit the flooded areas to bring some help. On Saturday, he led a delegation from his diocese to Trung Quán parish.

The prelate tried to visit every family, one by one, to encourage them and leave them with some small gifts. For those who met him, “He is a true pastor. He did not just give us some gifts; he brought us God.”

Trung Quán parish, one of the hardest hit, saw homes submerged and streets turned into rivers.

Thanks Caritas and the Hà Tinh Catholic Business Association, the bishop was able to leave a package containing instant noodles, a bottle of oil and two packs of condiments for each family he visited.

He also brought more than 200 million dong (about US$ 8,600). The diocese donated 100 million; Caritas 50 million and the Catholic Business Association, another 50 million. Although not huge, the money will help with the emergency.

Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p encouraged the faithful to recite the rosary and pray for all the people living in the flooded area.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VN-_Evacuation.jpg,"['tinh', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'business', 'bishop', 'diocese', 'hà', 'left', 'hectares', 'catholic', 'caritas', 'central', 'floods', '37', 'huge', 'million', 'visits', 'dead']", ,flood

The country’s benchmark VN Index soared 17% in the three months ended April 30, beating every major market in the region and almost doubling gains from the S&P 500 Index.

While foreign investors pulled about US$842mil (RM3.46bil) from the country’s shares so far this year, the tide could be turning.

Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR Global. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has raised more than US$350mil.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that – like in many others around the world – has attracted retail punters in droves.

Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

“The stock market was very active and many of my friends were making money from it, so I decided to withdraw money from the bank to invest in stocks for a better return, ” said Nguyen Lan Huong, a 30-year-old grocery store worker from the riverside district of Long Bien in Hanoi.

Worst hit is Hue province, some 700km (434 miles) away from the capital, Hanoi. Police and soldiers have been using canoes and boats in Ha Tinh city to reach the most flooded areas to evacuate people and move property to safety. In this city alone, more than 20,700 people were reported to have been evacuated.

Bulking Up

Vietnam is an “investable market,” according to HSBC Holdings Plc. The flood of local cash has seen trading volumes more than quadruple since the end of 2019, based on 50-day moving averages. The benchmark index now includes 11 stocks exceeding $5 billion in market value, up from just two in 2015. Vingroup JSC has been leading the charge, and the conglomerate is now launching an ambitious plan to sell electric vehicles to the U.S. Vingroup was founded by the country’s richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine.

The stock exchange’s other heavy hitters include a smattering of state-backed behemoths -- Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, PetroVietnam Gas JSC -- as well as steelmaker Hoa Phat Group JSC and Vietnam Dairy Products JSC.

Vietnam’s stocks have been climbing amid optimism its export-oriented economy can maintain momentum after being one of the few in Asia to expand last year. Manufacturing activity jumped in April to the strongest since November 2018, according to a PMI report Tuesday. Equities retreated today, sending the VN Index down 1.1% as of 9:38 a.m. local time, after Vietnam’s capital city instructed school pupils to stay home in order to help contain an increase in local Covid-19 cases.

The country is well positioned as the U.S. and Chinese economies lead a global rebound from the pandemic. That’s because Vietnam benefited when U.S.-China trade tensions spurred companies to diversify supply chains out of its larger Asian neighbor.

“We’ve been positive on Vietnam for a number of years. They are a clear beneficiary of China-U.S. trade tensions and their handling of the pandemic has been among the best examples globally,” said Jeff Gill, who helped manage about $10.9 billion of assets at City of London Investment Management as of Dec. 31.

Waiting Room

Part of the problem may be that international investors overstretched when they splurged. Foreigners sold a net $876 million of Vietnamese stocks last year, similar to what’s been already sold so far this year. That’s in line with a wave of selling across Asian emerging markets. Those moves look to have simply swelled foreigners’ cash positions inside Vietnam, which are already substantially higher now than they were at the end of 2020, according to Vu Bang, former chairman of the State Securities Commission.

Vietnam’s stocks also faced a setback in March when FTSE Russell decided to maintain the country as a frontier market, instead of upgrading it to a secondary emerging market, citing settlement methodology issues. The State Securities Commission expects to resolve the issue later this year. Investors have also cited foreign ownership limits as a concern that could hamstring the market’s capacity to grow further.

Money managers from Sempione Sim SpA, to Asia Frontier Capital and City of London Investment Management Co. say they are busy looking for entry points. They cite solid economic prospects, relatively attractive valuations, rising foreign-direct investment flows and healthy earnings growth as reasons to be optimistic, while also showing faith in the government’s ability to contain the pandemic.

“I see Vietnam as a very nice compelling growth and stable story for the short, mid and long term,” said Federico Parenti, a fund manager at Sempione Sim in Milan.

Since the beginning of October, central Vietnam has been pounded by consecutive tropical storms and typhoons, which have brought widespread flooding and landslides to the region.

At least 1.5 million people have been affected by flooding and 235 people have died or are missing, according to the Vietnamese government.

On October 15, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink declared a national disaster for the Central Vietnam region as a result of the widespread devastation caused by flooding and landslides. This flooding has disrupted electricity and telecommunication networks, as well as destroying infrastructure, houses, livestock, and crops.

On October 28, Typhoon Molave made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Vietnam. It was the worst typhoon to hit the country in the last two decades.

Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are the two of the five central provinces that have been hardest hit by the recent flooding and landslides. The other three provinces that have been severely affected are Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, and Hue.

To make matters worse, the monsoon season is still ongoing and another powerful storm, Typhoon Vamco, made landfall last Sunday morning in central Vietnam, causing even greater damage. This is the third storm system to pummel Vietnam in November and the 13th to hit the country this year. The economic damage is now estimated to be close to $1 billion, according to the Vietnamese government.

International donations are starting to come in from various countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Japan. To date, the U.S. has donated $2.1 million toward the humanitarian relief effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Vietnam Red Cross Society to assist during the ongoing recovery period.

The financial backing also focuses on USAID’s longstanding investments in Vietnam to help minimize loss and destruction caused by natural disasters. Although the Vietnamese government has been quick to allocate disaster relief funds, its efforts and capacities have been strained also by the coronavirus pandemic. Donations from the outside world will be certainly needed and appreciated.

Local NGOs have been working tirelessly alongside the government to deliver aid to those who have been most affected by the catastrophic storms and their results. Pacific Links Foundation is an NGO that currently supports disadvantaged families in central Vietnam and it has been vigorously fundraising to support families in flood-affected Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Hue provinces.

“Our volunteers on the ground have delivered emergency packages, which included rice, food, life jackets, and flashlights, to students and their families,” said Hong Nguyen, the deputy director for SEEDS, a Pacific Links Foundation scholarship program which currently supports over 2,500 students.

SEEDS and the Pacific Links Foundation are now working on another round of support that will focus specifically on long-term recovery, allowing school children in all eight central Provinces to return to school and provide support for the families that suffered the most during the recent typhoons and floods.

“We will provide packages which will include books and school supplies, as well as computer tablets for students to continue learning through our online learning platform, especially when schooling is being disrupted,” said Nguyen.

Another non-profit charitable organization focused on philanthropic activities to benefit Vietnamese people in need throughout the Central Vietnam region is Da Nang Go. The organization uses fundraising events and direct donations to address the specific needs of Vietnamese people affected by natural disasters, poverty, and hunger.

Presently, the group consists of about 20 local and international volunteers who have been doing regular relief trips to some of the harder hit flood and landslide zones across the region. The NGO recently took a convoy of trucks and cars to Tay Giang district in Quang Nam province to provide much-needed supplies.

Tay Giang experienced heavy flooding and deadly landslides in October and November and is generally considered to be one of the more economically disadvantaged areas of Central Vietnam. The majority of the people who live there are from the Co Tu ethnic minority, a patriarchal rural society whose men raise livestock and whose women are well known for making high-quality traditional handicrafts.

The Co Tu live in small stilt huts which can be easily damaged by storms and landslides. At least 30 families had previously been evacuated from one village in Tay Giang due to the recent landslides.

“Before the last storm came, the government wanted to move them to a safer place but the problem is they don’t want to move anywhere because they are scared and if they die then they want to die in their hometown. They are used to yearly storms but they didn’t know this year’s storms would be so bad,” said Hannah Bui, one of the main directors of Da Nang Go and owner of Hannah’s Restaurant in Da Nang.

“I wish I had more money so I could do more to help these people,” she said.

Recently, the Da Nang Go team assembled 250 aid packages for children and 750 for adults in Tay Giang, as well as presenting some cash donations in envelopes at Hannah’s Restaurant.

The aid packages consisted of water, milk, noodles, dry food, oil, fish sauce, salt, blankets, and notebooks. The money was raised through a recent fundraising event and from various donations by local and expat members of the Da Nang community.

The aid was greeted with smiles by the local villagers and government officials. The team also delivered supplies to two elementary schools and to adults in the neediest villages of Tay Giang. In one of the poorest schools, students are so impoverished that they can’t afford basic school uniforms and some students walk up to four kilometers per day to attend classes.

“When I do charity and I do small things like give candy to poor kids they are happy and smile, and when I give old people clothes and they say ‘thank you,’ it warms my heart and makes me feel good knowing I’ve brightened their day,” said Bui.

Da Nang Go will continue its ongoing fundraising and aid missions to help people around central Vietnam affected by these historically devastating storms and typhoons. Both Pacific Links Foundation and Da Nang Go are continuing to deliver aid packages and funds in the aftermath of Typhoon Vamco.

As much as these local charities and NGOs have brought much-needed relief for affected communities, in terms of food, clothing, school supplies, and direct funding, what is really needed now in terms of the recovery effort is the rebuilding of infrastructure, houses, and technological networks, and a re-supply of livestock to get things back to normal.

Floodwaters that had killed scores across Vietnam were rising ominously around their village. At a washed-out railway overpass, he hired a man to ferry them in a small boat. But strong winds carried away some of the baby clothes the couple had packed, and Mr. Minh waded into the water to retrieve them.

Suddenly, the boat capsized in the fast-moving current. His wife, Hoang Thi Phuong, a 35-year-old cancer survivor, was just out of reach, and she was swept away by water turned brown by loosened sediment.

6,6,FL-2018-000416-VNM,We must not repeat the Vietnam refugee tragedy in Afghanistan - Military Times,https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2021/05/18/we-must-not-repeat-the-vietnam-refugee-tragedy-in-afghanistan/,"The parallel between the Vietnam War and Afghan War is troubling. In both cases, the U.S. became involved in a foreign war without having a clear picture of what our ultimate objective was. We largely took over the direction of each war from a corrupt host government. Many citizens of our host country placed reliance on the U.S. to provide for their safety, come what may. The war became unwinnable because of a series of unfortunate decisions. Losing interest in the endeavor, we shaped settlement terms the host government was required to accept, intimating we would be there to help if worse came to worst. Here, the similarity ends, for now.

In the case of Vietnam, even though we knew weeks beforehand that the fall of South Vietnam was imminent, we made no concerted effort to extract the Vietnamese who had steadfastly supported the U.S. When their government fell, many thousands who had helped, trusted and relied upon us were murdered or incarcerated to the great dishonor of our nation. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the south and, although we gave many of them sanctuary, our help was slow in coming. The final chapter in Afghanistan has yet to be written, but it must not end up with a betrayal of our friends.

During the long and tortured course of America’s war in Afghanistan, many Afghans stepped forward at their great peril to serve and help protect our military personnel. As we withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban have stepped up their violent attacks and the danger to our friends has dramatically increased. We are morally obligated to provide them sanctuary within our borders.

There are two special immigrant visa (SIV) programs in place to bring our Afghan friends to the U.S., but they are mired in red tape — it takes up to three years to process an application. There is a backlog of nearly 19,000 SIV applicants, with about 50,000 family members. They are waiting in line, living in fear of death. There are not enough slots to take care of the backlog. The vetting process is understaffed, underfunded and overly burdensome.

In this crisis situation, there are two feasible alternatives — either review existing documentation in the files and grant visas to those who U.S. personnel have credibly vouched for in the files, or extract the SIVs and families from Afghanistan and complete any necessary vetting in a safe location. We processed South Vietnamese refugees at U.S. military bases in the late 1980s.

We need, also, to consider the plight of Afghans who don’t qualify for SIV status. A Taliban take-over, which appears increasingly likely, will create a flood of refugees, fleeing for their very lives. Being partially responsible for their plight, we are honor bound to provide sanctuary for many of them, just as we eventually did for those fleeing Vietnam. We should plan to evacuate Afghans who will be targets of Taliban reprisal — uncorrupted government and military officials, women’s rights advocates, educators, democracy advocates and the like.

Like many troops who served in America’s wars, this issue is very personal for me. I lived and worked with South Vietnamese soldiers in 1968-1969. I trusted them with my life, while they relied on the U.S. government as a friend and ally. Most of my Vietnamese friends were Catholics who moved from North Vietnam to Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam in 1954 to escape persecution. They were fiercely anti-communist and pro-American. It broke my heart when the communists took over in April 1975, knowing that my friends would be killed or imprisoned, as were many thousands of their countrymen. We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate. We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us.

7,7,FL-2018-000416-VNM,United States announces additional humanitarian assistance in response to flooding in Vietnam - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-assistance-response-flooding-vietnam,"Friday, October 30, 2020

Office of Press Relations

press@usaid.gov

Today, while in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced the United States is providing an additional $2 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to Typhoon Molave and the ongoing severe flooding that has affected Central Vietnam since early October. This amount brings the total humanitarian assistance from the U.S. Government for people touched by the floods to $2.1 million.

With this new funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is ramping up efforts to meet emergency needs in communities affected by Vietnam’s historic typhoon season. Typhoon Molave, which made landfall in Central Vietnam on October 28, 2020, is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. Typhoon Molave follows weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1.5 million people and killed more than 130.

In response, USAID’s partners, including the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC), are addressing the immediate needs of the affected families for food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Because the floods have washed away livestock, farms, and infrastructure, USAID’s partners also will provide assistance to these families as they begin to restore their livelihoods.

This assistance builds on USAID’s long-term investments in Vietnam to reduce the risk and impact of disasters. With funding from USAID, for example, the VNRC has been on the front lines in responding to the impact of severe weather throughout this typhoon season.

The United States stands with the people of Vietnam during this difficult time.

8,8,FL-2018-000416-VNM,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Vietnam and local people’s generosity.Luu Thi Phuong, 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.“Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children,” she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.“I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDP’s 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.“Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam,” she said.“However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.”Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last year’s floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.”Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.“It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life,” he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: “I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).“In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households,” said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing. At least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or collapsed./.","Tue, 04 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://en.vietnamplus.vn/favicon.ico,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'receive', 'storms', 'nam', 'quang', 'residents', 'undp', 'nams', 'central', 'support', 'house', 'houses', 'safe']", ,flood
11,11,FL-2018-000416-VNM,How flood protection can paradoxically put people at risk - Horizon,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/how-flood-protection-can-paradoxically-put-people-risk.html,"Professor Jeroen Aerts, a hydrologist at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in The Netherlands, says that when a city builds a defensive wall or dyke, it can make its citizens feel so secure that they actually flock to live or to develop businesses in the protected area. What’s more, they don’t bother to install their own flood protection.

This means that when rare – but inevitable – extreme flooding occurs the damage can be colossal.

It is just one way in which flood protection modellers may be underestimating – and sometimes overestimating – the true consequences of sea level rise, says Prof. Aerts. And it is happening because physical scientists are failing to integrate human behaviour into their models.

Prof. Aerts leads a team that is trying to change this using the technique of agent-based modelling which attempts to reproduce complex phenomena like human behaviour. They use software that creates autonomous decision-making entities called agents, each of which assesses its situation and makes a decision based on a set of rules that have been drawn from survey data and decision theory.

Last year, they published a paper that underlined the problem of the safe development paradox. By modelling what is known about how humans behave when governments install flood protection where they live and work, the team demonstrated that ‘the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas.’

But the study went on to show that governments could ‘largely counteract’ this effect if they simultaneously promoted policies that encourage people to flood-proof their buildings.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’ Prof. Jeroen Aerts, Vrije University, The Netherlands

Migration

Prof. Aerts believes that the failure of physical scientists to take human behaviour into account may also have led them to misjudge the degree to which flooding will drive migration. What’s more, it means they are not identifying precisely where it would be best to target help, because the models don’t distinguish adequately between those who will manage to look after themselves and those who won’t.

Sea level rise will, it is commonly predicted, displace 187 million people by 2100. But the figure, which comes from a 2011 study, is controversial.

‘Most modelling studies that deal with flooding risk or sea level rise use a top-down approach,’ said Prof. Aerts. ‘You have long-term scenarios – like how many centimetres is sea level going to rise, and what will the exposed population be … and you try to estimate the impact.’ Then, he said, the models are rerun to include the effects of various adaptation measures, such as dykes or managed retreat, after which researchers do a cost-benefit analysis.

But, Prof. Aerts said, ‘they forget about (asking) what is the probability that this dyke will be built? Or what is the probability that people will retreat? So they do not take into account the human behavioural factor which determines whether or not this measure will be implemented.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’

Factors that get ignored include evidence that people’s decisions to migrate, or to stay and defend their land, vary with their wealth, age, risk perception, trust of government and attitudes to individual freedom.

Social scientists

Prof. Aerts says that his team is now turning the models on their head, in a new project known as COASTMOVE. They are integrating a global coastal flood risk model with an agent-based model to simulate how governments, private sector actors such as insurance companies, and individuals act and influence each other.

Another difference is that social scientists are feeding data into the project.

‘They provide me with the information about under what conditions are people going to implement a certain measure, from the individual level to the higher aggregate government level,’ said Prof. Aerts.

Some of this information is from pre-existing surveys on what drives people to migrate or otherwise respond to floods. The rest will be gathered from new surveys in six coastal areas in France, Ghana, the Marshall Islands, the United States, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Other, less traditional sources of information will come from data already collected via mobile phones, Twitter posts and even tax returns.

They will use data from Bangladesh, for example, where other researchers have been able to discover, from anonymised mobile phone data, how many people have fled from floods, where they travelled, and how soon they returned. They will also use data that Prof. Aerts has gathered over the last six years using algorithms to monitor tweets that mention the word ‘flood’, in 20 different languages. This provides daily flood maps that give ‘a pretty good idea of where we can expect most of the problems’, he said.

More data is coming from the United States where it has been possible to draw conclusions about migration after flooding from the location from which people have filed their annual tax returns.

Vulnerabilities

By simulating adaptive behaviour, the team hopes to provide more refined predictions about the degree to which sea level rise will cause migration – in the form of 1x1km2 global migration maps.

Dr Bina Desai, head of policy and research at the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, says that sea level rise will bring a variety of direct and indirect impacts, which will affect people differently depending on factors such as inequality and poverty, that are not adequately reflected in models.

‘What’s needed, if we think about risk of migration and displacement, is modelling with a less strong focus on the hazard and a stronger focus on underlying vulnerabilities and what exacerbates them,’ she said.

‘In principle, it’s the only way to do it,’ Dr Desai said of COASTMOVE’s approach. Even as a conceptual model, she adds, it will help to work out how the many factors interrelate.

‘The downside is to move beyond the conceptual model,’ she added. ‘If you want to translate that into numbers then (when we have tried it) we found we failed because all the inputs could not be populated with data.

‘But if they can find a way of doing it by (collecting enough data), using proxies and making assumptions and somehow modelling it out then I think that’s great.’

Just how are our seas changing and rising with climate change and the melting of Earth’s ice caps? This is the final story in a three-part series looking at the past, present and future of extreme sea level rise. In part one, we looked at what the last interglacial can tell us about extreme sea level rise and in part two we looked at rise of atmospheric ‘meteotsunamis’.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

On 13 October, the Government of Viet Nam released a call for emergency relief and support following four tropical cyclones and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which combined have caused severe and widespread flooding, landslides, storm surge and strong winds since 6 October. As of 28 October, 214 people have reportedly been killed or are missing, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). An estimated 7.7 million people live in areas affected by flooding caused by the multiple storms, with some 1.5 million people in nine provinces directly affected and approximately 380,000 houses flooded, damaged or destroyed. Of those people directly affected by the current disaster, some 753,000 are women and girls, 134,000 are children under five, and 143,000 are over 65 years old.

On the morning of 11 October, Tropical Storm Linfa (Storm No. 6) made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Viet Nam, resulting in 150 to 300 mm of rain. This was followed on 14 October by Tropical Storm Nangka (Storm No. 7) which made landfall in northern Viet Nam, but also brought a further 150 mm of rain to the still flooded provinces of central Viet Nam. On 16 October, tropical depression INVEST 94W in the East Sea weakened into a low-pressure area and made landfall in the central provinces, and was subsequently followed by Tropical Storm Saudel (Storm No. 8) which made landfall in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces on 25 October. On 28 October, Tropical Cyclone Molave (Storm No. 9) made landfall in approximately the same area as Tropical Storm Linfa, with up to 700 mm of rain reported in Nghe An and Ha Thinh provinces and up to 400 mm of rain in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces.

In Quang Ngai province, some 17,000 people were evacuated because of the strong winds and rain. Between 5 and 20 October, VNDMA reported that many areas in central Viet Nam recorded a total rainfall of more than 2,400 mm, and in some locations, flood waters exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1979 and 1999.

As of 29 October, nine provinces have been affected by the cumulative impacts of the multiple storms including Tropical Cyclone Molave. These are, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Nghe An, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum provinces, with Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces most severely affected.

Following Tropical Cyclone Molave, more than 88,000 houses and 50 schools had their roofs blown off, the majority in Quang Ngai province, and some 375,000 people were evacuated to evacuation centres. Those in the evacuation centres are amongst the most vulnerable having had their houses damaged or destroyed and having lost key household items in the floods. Many of the evacuation centres are overcrowded, do not have access to sufficient basic facilities such as water and sanitation, and health care, and lack appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children.

As well as damage to houses, some 30,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged (including rice, other crops, and aquatic products) and more than 2 million cattle and poultry have been killed. This is likely to have severe impacts on food security and livelihoods, especially for those people who were already experiencing adverse economic impacts due to COVID19. Further, more than 360 schools have been flooded and damaged, with detrimental impacts on children’s ability to continue accessing education. In addition, more than 78 health centres and hospitals have also been damaged or flooded.

To date, the delivery of assistance has been hampered by extensive damage to public transportation infrastructure. VNDMA reports that more than 165 km of national highway, 140 km of local roads and three bridges have been heavily damaged. Rescue teams are accessing affected areas by boat to deliver relief items and to evacuate vulnerable people, prioritizing children, people with disabilities and elderly people. Communication has also been hampered by the loss of electricity in many affected areas.

The areas most severely affected by flooding are also those same provinces which experienced a second wave of COVID19 cases in July and August. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, a further thirty days of lockdown measures were implemented from 28 July to 5 September, with adverse socio-economic impacts for the region which already records higher than national average multidimensional poverty rates. As a consequence of COVID-19 related measures, the most vulnerable people had already had their coping capacities eroded prior to this current disaster and are thus in more acute need of immediate assistance to help them manage the current, compound crisis.

From 20 and 23 October, joint GovernmentUN-NGO assessments were undertaken in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai provinces. Key findings from the assessments include the need for emergency food assistance for 177,000 of the most vulnerable people, restoration of agricultural land, safe access to clean water and sanitation facilities including in health centres and schools, the provision of dignity kits for women and girls, provision of education supplies and alternative learning solutions to ensure continuity of learning, support for those people evacuated from their homes, repairs for damaged houses, replacement of basic household items, health support especially maternal and child health, risk communication activities, provision of micro nutrients and continuation of nutrition activities to prevent an increase in rates of malnutrition.

Protection has been identified as a key need in this response, including the immediate need to ensure protection and safeguards for women and children currently living in evacuation centres. Partners involved in the development of this plan have also highlighted the need to provide assistance in a gender-responsive manner that addresses the specific needs of women and girls. The Government has requested that all relief activities target the most vulnerable people, including poor, near poor, people living with disabilities, children, femaleheaded households and elderly people, which are the target populations for this response plan.","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/VNM-ResponsePlan-201031-051%20%281%29.jpg?itok=QHnLLURt,"['plan', 'response', 'nam', 'quang', 'provinces', '2020', 'viet', 'tropical', 'floods', 'affected', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'assistance', 'storm', 'including']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The lower Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam) experienced prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020 until early December 2020. This was due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka as well as tropical depression INVEST 94W. The three wind systems made landfall in Vietnam but brought along heavy rain to the rest of the lower Mekong region. Tropical storm Linfa made landfall on 11 October 2020, tropical storm Nangka made landfall on 14 October 2020 whilst tropical depression INVEST 94W made landfall on 16 October 2020.

The rainfall brought by the wind systems resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in southern Lao PDR. As of 20 October 2020, nine districts in three provinces of Salawan, Savannaket and Sekong were affected by the floods. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Based on an initial assessment on 20 October 2020, conducted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) with participation of Lao Red Cross, it was highlighted that 163 villages in the three provinces, with an estimated 15,305 households (97,514 people) were affected. Savannaket was the worst affected province with more than 10,000 households from 137 villages were reportedly affected in the province and two people had lost their lives. In Sekong province, around 3,000 people were affected, and two people had lost their lives. Salawan province reported more than 600 people affected with five deaths.

Cyclone Molave – the fourth tropical cyclone to threaten Vietnam this month – is barrelling towards the country’s central coast, worsening severe floods and landslides that have inundated parts of the region for weeks.

Vietnamese authorities are rushing to evacuate half a million people before Molave makes a projected 28 October landfall, packing wind speeds topping 110 kilometres per hour. The country is already struggling with intense floods and landslides that have killed at least 130 people and damaged a quarter of a million homes.

The Vietnamese Red Cross has already warned that 160,000 people may need food aid over the next six months, but that figure could rise after Molave makes landfall and its impact becomes more clear.

Aid groups say parts of Vietnam are seeing their worst floods and landslides in two decades. Disasters are common during Asia’s various monsoon seasons, but this month’s flurry of storms has aggravated conditions, with weeks of extended heavy rainfall.

Parts of Laos and Cambodia are also submerged. And Thailand is projecting that Molave's rains will hit the country’s north and northeast.

Before threatening Southeast Asia’s Mekong region, Cyclone Molave uprooted some 25,000 people in the Philippines earlier this week.

Hue, Vietnam – Before floodwater inundated half their living room one night during the storm season this year, the Trans put their most valuable possessions – their TV and refrigerator – in the attic and told their two daughters to take refuge there.

Tran Nhu Hong, 23, and her 18-year-old sister, who do not know how to swim, survived the storms – the worst her generation had ever experienced and the worst her parents had seen in decades.

A neighbour was not so fortunate. The 19-year-old student was swept away in the floods after the vehicle she was travelling in was tipped over by the force of the water – on the same route the two young women usually take.

“Shortly after the water retreated, I went on that route and the vehicle was still there and had not yet been pulled out (of the mud),” Hong said. “I don’t dare to go on that route late at night any more.”

Across central Vietnam, cascading floods from October onward inundated the living and the dead, as record rainfall submerged towns and cemeteries. Authorities said earlier this month that the typhoons, which they referred to as “abnormal”, cost the Southeast Asian country 30 trillion dong ($1.3bn) in damage and killed at least 192 people – a death toll more than five times higher than the 35 COVID-19 deaths Vietnam recorded this year.

A woman drives along a flooded road beside submerged rice fields [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “In general, it is well-established that rainfall from typhoons is increasing due to climate change, both from observations and from models,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead climate scientist at the Red Cross Climate Center and World Weather Attribution, whose team is conducting a study on the role of climate change in the recent floods and typhoons in central Vietnam.

Crops destroyed

With 70 percent of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas, Vietnam is highly exposed to riverine and coastal flooding and is also one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.

“There is even more damage after the floods,” Hong said, driving by rice fields made inlets because of the storms and floods in her hometown in Thua Thien Hue Province.

When the water retreated, it took crops with it, leaving behind scarred earth. Many farming families in central Vietnam count on rice, various other crops and cattle for income, especially as the Lunar New Year celebration, known as Tet, nears.

Tet is usually when Vietnamese shop for new clothes, gifts and appliances to welcome a new, fulfilling beginning; but with their homes and means of living ravaged by violent storms, severe floods and devastating landslides, Tet, which will take place in February, is likely to be tinged with sadness.

Hong’s parents are still recovering from the wounds and infections they got from wading through hip-high flood water for extended periods, and have yet to find jobs as construction workers due to the double burden of COVID-19 and the recent natural disasters.

Ichiro Sato, senior associate with the Climate Program and Sustainable Finance Center at US-based think tank World Resources Institute, says central Vietnam was battling extreme weather events long before climate change started to take effect.

“If governments have not been well-prepared even for the conventional risk of weather-related disasters that existed before climate change – and I am afraid that is the case for Central Vietnam – then there are so many things they have to work on before worrying about the additional risk of climate change,” Sato said, adding that unregulated urbanisation and economic growth may increase vulnerability to weather-related disasters in places like Vietnam.

The country typically endures between five and six storms and about three tropical depressions a year, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, but in 2020 a total of at least 14 ravaged the country. Seven consecutive tropical storms and cyclones hit the central region between October and mid-November.

Children at risk

According to the UN, an estimated 7.7 million people in nine provinces, including 2.5 million children, were affected – with hundreds of thousands of houses flooded, damaged or destroyed.

“There is no doubt that children are those most affected by natural disasters,” Rana Flowers, UNICEF representative in Vietnam, told Al Jazeera, adding that families’ ability to secure nutritious food for their children had already suffered as a result of the pandemic.

An estimated 375,000 people were sent to evacuation centres during the storms and floods, including about 90,000 children, according to Flowers.

“Many of the evacuation sites were overcrowded, did not have access to sufficient water and sanitation and healthcare, and lacked appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children,’’ Flowers said, adding that the situation severely affected the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children.

A study brief published in August by the US-based Society for Research in Child Development showed that children may suffer longer-term physical and psychological deficits than adults, including difficulty sleeping or concentrating and losing interest in their usual activities – chronic mental health symptoms have been observed among children as long as four years after a disaster.

Deforestation, which affects the ability of the land to retain water, also contributed to the flooding and a series of severe landslides during the stormy season, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said at a legislative National Assembly meeting last month.

Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam lost 657,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of primary forest – 23 percent of its total tree-cover loss according to data from international monitoring service Global Forest Watch. About 50 percent of all tree-cover loss between 2001 and 2019 took place in 11 of the country’s 63 provinces – eight of them in central Vietnam, it said.

The devastating landslides and flooding have prompted concerns about deforestation caused by the construction of hydropower plants in forests.

As of 2018, there were 385 dams in operation, with an additional 143 under construction, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Earlier this month, the minister acknowledged the increased evidence of the loss of watershed forests and vegetation, as well as a loss of soil adhesion, as a result of the developments.

The government has also announced sustainable and long-term missions to cope with storms in central Vietnam, including upgrading climate-change adaptation scenarios and relocating people in areas at risk of landslide and flooding.

No place like home

For those who have been living in the area for generations, like the parents of 21-year-old university student Le Thi Thuyen, leaving their storm-battered homes seems unfathomable.

“We can be accustomed to annual storms but whenever they come, we are still worried,” said Thuyen, a native of Quang Binh, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the central region.

Thuyen, who left for Ho Chi Minh City to study and is currently an intern at a non-governmental organisation in Vietnam’s biggest city, called her parents and siblings back home every day when the storms were pounding their commune, flooding and isolating homes in low-lying areas.

Tears welled up in her eyes when she thought of her 12-year-old brother who does not know how to swim.

Cemeteries were inundated as floodwaters rose in central Vietnam [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “I read news about kids who got swept away by the flood and I was really worried about my brother,” the 21-year-old said.

Thuyen’s parents, who make a living from agriculture and working on other people’s farms, have already been struggling this year because of the pandemic – and the storm season has created more problems, destroying their crops, and fish. It also meant weeks when there were no jobs to be found.

“Tet this year won’t be as fulfilling as others for us,” Thuyen said. “This time, it won’t be my parents supporting me, but I will be supporting them with what I can.”","Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/000_8V93XX-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'children', 'storms', 'water', 'change', 'pieces', 'central', 'relentless', 'floods', 'parents', 'living', 'pick', 'vietnamese', '2020s', 'climate']", ,flood

By Vatican News staff writer

Volunteers and workers of Caritas Vietnam are visiting and assisting people in the central provinces who have to face the brunt of 13 storms this year with some severe flooding.

The umpteenth storm

In just over a month, Vietnam's central region has seen 7 tropical storms and typhoons, causing floods and landslides that killed 235 people and caused an estimated $740,000 in damage in several provinces. The rain from the storms has caused the worst flooding in the region in more than 30 years.

The latest of these typhoons, Vamco, made landfall in Vietnam on Sunday with winds of up to 150 kph, after leaving 67 dead in the Philippines. The storm has damaged more than 400,000 homes, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. At least 150,000 people are at risk of going hungry.

According to Caritas, the social arm of the Catholic Church, rebuilding homes and recovering their livelihood are extremely important apart from immediate help and survival. Farming, such as growing vegetables, rice, raising livestock and poultry, which is the mainstay in the central provinces, has been devastated. Many families have lost everything in the floods and landslides.



Local Caritas in action

The new director of Caritas Vietnam, Father Joseph Ngo Si Dinh, led a delegation to the central provinces, Nov. 9-11, to survey the flooded areas. They first visited the Diocese of Hu? and its two adjoining provinces, talking to families and providing them material and spiritual support.

Father John Nguyen Huy Tuan, director of Caritas Ha Tinh, said priests were actively involved in bringing food and relief to the affected people and moving them to safer places.

Temporary shelters have been built to accommodate 25 families. A parish mobilised its young people to rescue families trapped in flooded homes.

No one excluded

Caritas Vietnam, in collaboration with dioceses and parishes, has been engaged in social outreach and charity works to help people after natural disasters.

The social arm of the Catholic Church assists people to rebuild their lives, repair damaged houses and build new homes for families who have lost theirs. It also provides people and families with seeds, livestock, water filtering systems, and finance for school children.

Caritas discussed ways to come up with concrete plans or projects to rebuild the lives of people regardless of their religion. Father Dinh has urged Catholics to help every person in need. “We hope that the people most affected by these storms, be they Catholic or not, will get some relief,” the Caritas director said.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/reuters/2020/10/13/14/1602592734645.JPG/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'storms', 'provinces', 'flood', 'caritas', 'social', 'homes', 'central', 'region', 'families', 'typhoons', 'storm', 'victims', 'assisting']", ,flood

On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.

The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.

The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.

On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh 400-500 mm, Quang Tri 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City 1,100 mm, Quang Nam 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai 600-800 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In this period, more than 130,000 houses, mostly in Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue provinces had been flooded, with some submerged by four meters.

Streak of tragedies

Around 3 a.m. on October 8, cargo vessel Vietship 01 of a Hanoi-based logistics firm was swept away by floods and rough seas as it docked at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri.

The ship had 12 male crew members on board when swept off. Four crew members who had fallen from the vessel made it safely to shore on October 9 and 10. One member, aged 45, had also jumped into the water but went missing before his body was retrieved on October 11.

Heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas derailed rescue efforts and the vessel sank to the bottom in shallow waters, leaving the rest of the crew and one fisherman, part of a rescue squad, stranded at sea.

It took rescue teams three days to reach the stranded vessel.

""It was difficult for modern vessels to reach the stranded ship so we had to rely on rudimentary boats and experienced fishermen for the mission,"" explained Colonel Le Van Phuong, head of Quang Tri Border Guard.

On the morning of October 11, the fisherman and a crew member jumped into the water and battled their way back through the rough seas and strong waves. Two teams of rescuers rushed to deliver them safely to shore.

Within the same day, a military helicopter was sent to the scene to rescue the remaining six crew members stuck on the vessel. Two days after he was rescued, however, ship captain Nguyen Van Bao, 51, passed away due to multiple organ failure and sepsis.

At midnight on October 12, a hill collapsed onto an operation center of Rao Trang 3 Hydropower Plant, located deep in a jungle of Phong Xuan Commune, Phong Dien District in Thua Thien-Hue.

The landslide buried 17 workers after 40 others escape to a nearby plant, called Rao Trang 4.

The story of the 17 workers is even more tragic since a 21-member rescue team that had set out to verify reports of their predicament got struck by the same calamity.

At midnight the next day, a landslide had buried the ranger station housing the entire rescue team. Only eight members managed to escape, with the remaining 13 confirmed dead, including Major General Nguyen Van Man, deputy commander of the 4th Military Region of Vietnam People's Army. The bodies of the 13 victims have all been found and identified, though only five of the 17 workers' bodies have been retrieved.

During funeral procedures for the 12 soldiers and their deputy commander, another landslide struck a barracks housing 27 personnel of Defense Economics Division 337, also managed by the 4th Military Region.

The division had been assigned to assist five remote communes in Huong Hoa District of Quang Tri, which borders Laos, in mitigating the impacts of prolonged flooding and landslides triggered by abnormally heavy downpours across the central region.

As the mountain collapsed onto their barracks in the first hours of October 19, the 27 division members were all sleeping, with only five managing to escape. Three more landslides buried the remaining 22.

By the afternoon of that day, all 22 bodies had been retrieved.

Luong Thi Ly, who lost her son Le The Linh to the landslide, said she could not believe he and his comrades had lost their lives during peace time.

New flood waves

And as mountainous areas reeled under repeated landslides, urban and coastal areas were hit by a new wave of flooding on October 18 and 20 due to the impact of tropical storms, the intertropical convergence zone and east winds in tandem with water discharged from dam projects.

On October 18, flood peaks recorded on the Hieu River of Quang Tri hit 5.36 m, passing the record level of 1983 by 0.78 m, while the peak on the Thach Han River rose to 7.4 m, 0.11 m higher than the 1999 record. In Quang Binh, floodwaters were measured at 4.88 m on October 19, or 0.97 m higher than the record in 1999.

For the second flood wave, more than 177,000 households in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri were inundated by floodwaters 1-4 m deep.

Many elderly people in Ha Tinh said for the past 40 years, they had never seen such severe flooding causing such serious damage.

In Quang Binh's Le Thuy District, a family who lost their 75-year-old grandmother, on October 17, had to hang her coffin from the roof of their house for nearly a week to avoid floodwaters.

More storms, floods and landslides

With heavy rains yet to show any signs of receding, Storm Saudel developed in the East Sea on October 20, though it had weakened and turned into a tropical depression as it reached the central coast on October 25.

Two days later, Molave entered the East Sea and headed straight to central Vietnam. It landed over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28 as the most powerful storm to have hit Vietnam in 20 years.

The storm had inflicted economic damage worth around VND10 trillion ($430.16 million), according to statistics from affected provinces. The loss was nearly 1.5 times higher than 2019’s total natural disaster-induced damage of VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), mostly ascribed to flooding, storms and landslides.

Subsequently, the storm triggered heavy rains that had led to more floods and landslides.

On October 28 alone, two different landslides struck Tra Leng and Tra Van communes in Quang Nam’s Nam Tra My District.

The Tra Van landslide buried 20, killing eight and injuring 12 while in Tra Leng, a mountain collapsed on 53 villagers, with 33 managing to escape, eight confirmed dead, and 12 still missing.

One day later in Phuoc Loc Commune, Phuoc Son District of Quang Nam, another landslide buried 11 victims. Seven have since been confirmed dead and four are still missing.

A survivor of the Tra Leng landslide, Nguyen Thanh Son, 56, had lost his wife to the accident. The bereaved husband cannot believe he has lost his family, house and entire village in the mere blink of an eye.

""Altogether, tumbling soil, mud, rocks, water and trees smashed in the roofs of our houses, sweeping everything away until hitting the foot of another mountain,"" Son recalled.

By the night of October 28, more than 4,000 families in Nghe An and Ha Tinh had been evacuated to safety after their neighborhoods had been submerged by up to two meters of water.

The third flood lasted until October 30 and by November 1, had receded.

While central Vietnam residents recuperate from Storm Molave and prior flooding, Storm Goni entered the East Sea on Monday morning, forecast to strike central areas from Da Nang to Phu Yen in the next few days.","Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/02/huu-khoa-tang-le-1-1603267441-7792-8579-1604304150_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'quang', 'central', 'landslide', 'month', 'tragedies', 'mm', 'crew', 'storm', 'rescue', 'day', 'm']", ,flood

A search operation has been launched for a missing rescue team as severe flooding and landslides battered central Vietnam, authorities said on Wednesday, as the country braced for further heavy rain.

Close to a million people have been impacted by heavy downpours and rising waters since mid last week, with more than 200,000 homes flooded, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Thirty-six people are now dead, Vietnam's disaster management authority said, while rescue workers have launched a search for around 30 people missing at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue province following landslides.

The missing include a team of soldiers and officials who had tried to find plant workers who disappeared days ago.

Images on state media showed helicopters and hundreds of soldiers struggling to access the site through thick mud and fallen trees.

Elsewhere across the central region, villages and rice fields were submerged, with relief workers resorting to makeshift boats and canoes to deliver food and bottled water to those stuck in flooded homes.

North central Vietnam was also hit by severe weather on Wednesday as Storm Nangka made landfall.

Forecasters said it could bring further rain in the coming days, while warning another storm was expected to form and make impact this weekend.

The IFRC said it had ""grave fears"" that the deadly floods would worsen as more rain was dumped on hard hit communities.

""These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods,"" said IFRC's Hung Ha Nguyen.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and is often affected by more than a dozen storms each year, regularly bringing flooding and landslides.

More then 130 people were reported dead or missing due to natural disasters in the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. “I wasn’t sad,” Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017’s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tay’s land. “That’s what I had to do.” He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldn’t be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasn’t wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. “Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them,” landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a “soft” levee girding the riverbank. She doesn’t view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. “The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and you’ve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made.” Dao’s mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, “a very sensitive and fragile area where ‘hard’ solutions [to erosion] won’t work”, said Dao, who has studied the region’s ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The “common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land”, Dao says. “Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down.” As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Dao’s words, “by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous”. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tay’s riverbank is like a pillow that doesn’t stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Dao’s green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses — a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, “people aren’t afraid of flooding”, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. “We have learnt to live with the floods,” he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. “Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive,” he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yen’s fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the island’s west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals’ trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the city’s famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes aren’t simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi An’s recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground. Dr Dao Ngo bought her own land in Triem Tay village to do her conservation work. Credit:Yen Duong “Now the ecological component is extremely important. In the past it was culture, now it’s ecology,” Hoi An’s vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local government’s development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. “Of course, it is difficult and it will take time,” says Hung. “Perhaps we won’t succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation.” As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemic’s wake, Hung doesn’t want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the city’s revenue. “We’ve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, there’ll be less to worry about.“

Ecology-based development, in Hung’s words, also means preserving the city’s forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. “If we achieve that, we’ll be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals’ life will definitely be improved.” Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. “You don’t see erosion here, but build-up [of land],” said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. “I’ve never seen these trees die because of flooding,” said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the river’s mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huong’s family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as “a fortune” on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river. Le Thi Huong, 59, a mangrove palm farmer, in her home made from the palms in Cam Thanh commune. Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. “The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; that’s why they protect it,” Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tay’s sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi An’s toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

The death toll from flooding and landslides in Vietnam continued to rise Tuesday, while those hit by the disasters triggered by tropical storms in the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos criticized government inaction and made urgent appeals for assistance.

In Vietnam, at least 104 people are dead in the country’s central region, with 49, 27, and 11 deaths reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam alone, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Control. Twenty-seven people are missing, including 15 workers from a hydropower plant in Quang Tri that was hit by a landslide on Oct. 12.

The committee said that some 90,000 residents of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Tri provinces have been evacuated to higher ground. Nearly 7,000 hectares of rice paddy and crop fields have been submerged, while more than 5,800 head of cattle and 685,000 poultry birds have been killed or carried away in floods.

Vietnamese state media on Tuesday reported that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved the allocation of 100 billion Vietnamese dong (U.S. $4.3 million) and 1,000 tons of rice to the five worst flood-hit provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Ha Tinh.

Meanwhile, the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre said a tropical depression in the Philippines has strengthened into what is being called Storm Saudel. Over the next 24 hours, Saudel is expected to enter the South China Sea—called the East Sea in Vietnam—and become the eighth storm to batter Vietnam’s central provinces since the start of the rainy season.

Tran Quang Nang, head of the weather forecasting department under the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre, rejected reports circulating on Facebook, allegedly citing Japanese forecasters, that Saudel is a super typhoon.

“All of these predictions about Typhoon Saudel are baseless and fake,” Nang said. “The Japanese weather forecasting center and other countries have said no such thing.”

Nang called on the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to “punish” those responsible for spreading inaccurate information on social networks, causing public confusion.

“This issue should be handled promptly to ensure people only access accurate information released by the authorities so they can respond to natural disasters, helping to mitigate the damage they cause,” he said.

In Cambodia, the death toll remained at 25 from a day earlier, with some 40,000 evacuated to temporary shelters, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha told RFA’s Khmer Service. More than 200,000 hectares of paddy field and nearly 80,000 farms have also been destroyed, with more than 500 school buildings and 79 garment factories damaged.

Roads, hospitals, and dams have also been affected, authorities said.

In a notice issued on Tuesday, the Poipet Administration of Banteay Meanchey province, along Cambodia’s border with Thailand, temporarily closed portions of National Road 5. Downtown Poipet saw flooding of homes and roads, which the notice attributed to rains in Thailand.

Sann Ratha, a resident of Kaun Damrei village, in Poipet’s Sangkat Nimith district, told RFA that water levels increased so rapidly that several hundred families were forced to leave their homes.

He said people are stranded and in desperate need of food and other supplies.

“We are under the attack from the flood—our village looks like a river now with water everywhere and houses submerged,” he said.

“The current situation is worse than during the [1967-1975] civil war. We need the authorities to help us immediately.”

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen traveled to affected areas visiting with victims and handing out food. He said in a post to his Facebook page that he plans to spend two days in hard-hit Banteay Meanchey province, where 13 of the country’s 25 deaths have occurred and an estimated 20,000 families have been affected.

Opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha is also traveling to Banteay Meanchey to provide assistance.

Din Puthy, head of the Poipet-based Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association, expressed skepticism over the government’s handling of the flooding Tuesday.

He voiced concerns that authorities appear to prefer taking selfies with small numbers of villagers and posting them on social media to pretend they are helping the victims.

“The victims are not receiving equal treatment,” he said. “Only a few people have received some assistance while many others have been left behind.”

More aid needed

In Laos, where storms have ravaged Savannakhet province in the country’s center, authorities remained unable to access many areas due to damaged roads and a lack of boats to transport aid and other supplies, Lao sources said.

More than 125 villages in eight districts have now been flooded, with many houses and over 10,000 hectares of paddy fields submerged, official sources in the province say. Nearly 30,000 people have been impacted in Savannakhet, according to official count.

An official from Savannakhet’s inundated Phin district told RFA Tuesday that people are in need of dry goods, drinking water, medicine, and other necessities. The official said that while most aid had been distributed it still is not enough.

“In Phin district, 45 villages are heavily flooded, but they have received some help already—they mostly need sticky rice and consumer goods,” he said.

He said villagers with boats had been using them to help one another and that there have been no accidents during rescue and supply operations.

A villager in Phin told RFA that the water level is so high that the local river had flooded homes along its banks and urged authorities to provide more assistance.

“They have helped a little, but it’s very difficult for us,” he said. “Higher-level authorities should take care of this. We’re asking for more rice—all houses need rice to eat.”

Authorities in Savannakhet’s Xonbury district said waters remain high and will rise in days to come, forcing villagers to stay in clubs, schools, and other places set up by the local government as temporary shelters until flooding recedes.

According to the Meteorology Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Laos will continue to endure heavy rains and strong winds throughout the country in coming days. It urged villagers to remain vigilant for flash floods and landslides.

Storm Molave, which made landfall at around 11 am local time on Wednesday, is one of the strongest storms to hit the southeast Asian nation in 20 years.

The resulting “extreme rainfall” could continue over the coming days, worsening the already precarious situation faced by many families, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a statement.

“For the affected populations, their homes remain severely damaged, their food stocks have been lost, they have no access to clean water for drinking, washing and cooking; and water and sanitation systems have been damaged,” said the agency.

Evacuation centres flooded

Thousands have been moved to evacuation centres, which are themselves flooded, resulting in difficult health and hygiene conditions for the displaced people, primarily women, children and elderly. Health centres have also been damaged, leaving without to access basic health care services.

“Added to this is the trauma of the violent storms and rushing waters, that for a population where many cannot swim, creates fear and impacts mental wellbeing,” UNICEF added.

The storm has also damaged vital infrastructure, including electricity and roads, leaving many communities cut off from assistance and protection.

Affected populations

An estimated 7.7 million people live in the affected areas, including as many as 1.5 million who have been “directly affected”, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam said in a humanitarian update late Wednesday.

Of these, some 177,000 people considered vulnerable (poor or near-poor), should be prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance, it added.

Response

According to the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UN agencies and partners are developing and will release a multi-sector response plan, within the coming days, to support emergency relief efforts.

In the immediate term, UNICEF has mobilized to provide emergency water, nutrition, sanitation, education and protection support, it said in the statement. It is also coordinating with Government agencies and humanitarian actors to reach the most vulnerable and those most affected.

Description of the disaster

The central region of Viet Nam was experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimetres of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 150 millimetres of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. Additionally, Tropical Storm Saudel hit Viet Nam on 25 October closely followed by Typhoon Molave on 28 October. Typhoon Molave was one of the most devastating typhoons making landfall in Vietnam in decades. The typhoon made landfall after a series of tropical storms hitting Viet Nam and had caused severe flooding and at least three landslides which tragically resulted in the loss of 40 lives. 44 people are still missing, and six people are severely injured. On 5 November, Typhoon Goni made landfall in Viet Nam and Tropical Storm Atsani made landfall on 7 November. Tropical storm Vamco, was the latest to hit central Viet Nam as it made landfall on 15 November 2020.

The recurrent storms bringing heavy rainfall have caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. The Viet Nam National Disaster Management Agency (VNDMA) has reported that many areas in central Vietnam recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 1,600 millimeters between 5 to 20 October 2020, with peaks of 2,400 millimeters in some locations over the same period. The Hieu River (Quang Tri), Bo River (Hue), Gianh River and Kien Giang River (Quang Binh) have reached historically high levels, and in some locations flood waters have exceeded the previous historical highs recorded in 1979 and 1999. In addition, hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs to prevent them from bursting.

Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Authorities estimate that a nearly eight million people have been exposed to the storms, and some 1.5 million people have been directly affected by the storms and floods. On 4 November, ahead of typhoon Goni’s landfall, 98,819 households (372,631 people) in six provinces (Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen) were evacuated to safe shelters. Similarly, evacuations took place on 7 November in anticipation of typhoon Atsani, and on the 15th November ahead of typhoon Vamco’s landfall additional evacuations have been carried out in seven provinces of central Viet Nam with a total of 93,795 households (324,780 people) evacuated to safer places (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai).

Most of the people who had been evacuated have now returned home after their local authorities’ approval. They are actively repairing their homes with the help of their relatives.

These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.

Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.

The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.

As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing.

In addition, 150,000 people have been evacuated and significant impacts on transportation networks and agricultural livelihoods have been reported.

USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance partner VNRC is on the frontline of the response and has mobilized rapid disaster response teams established and trained through ongoing USAID disaster risk reduction programs to support evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency response operations, said the ambassador.

""We stand together with the government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones, address the damage caused by this terrible flood, and move forward, as the people of Vietnam have always done. We pledge to assist you in your work to rebuild,"" he said.

""I would also like to express my concern for persons with disabilities in the provinces affected by the typhoon as they are amongst the most vulnerable populations in this disaster. They are often home-bound, have less access to information and cannot take full advantage of preparedness activities and evacuation protocols,"" he added.

It is estimated that the provinces impacted by storm Linfa are home to over 200,000 persons with disabilities, of whom 61,000 are directly affected by this disaster.

Since 2000, USAID, through the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, has provided over $26 million in disaster response, preparedness, and risk reduction assistance in Vietnam.

Through the Department of Defense, the U.S. government has also provided more than $28 million since 1998 to train military and civilian emergency responders and develop and equip disaster management centers, maritime response centers, and disaster shelters at community level.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/17/anh124581602340198-1602931391-3782-3057-1602931440_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'response', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'central', 'aids', 'floods', 'landslide', 'usaid', 'affected', 'linfa', '100000', 'cope', 'provided']", ,flood

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to bring them to safety beyond rising floodwater in Cambodia’s western province of Battambang, which is expected to worsen on Sunday.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces – Pursat, Battambang and Pailin – have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall heralding the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

“A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,” Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told the AFP news agency late on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to get worse.

In central Vietnam, almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking northern Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand’s Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to place sandbags and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial Governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Flooding also affected Vietnam’s old city of Hoi An following heavy rainfall in the Mekong region [Vietnam News Agency via AFP] Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

“The water is three metres deep in some parts,” he told reporters on Saturday.

Last year, central Vietnam, particularly the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Quang Ngai and Quang Nam, were wrecked by a series of storms and tropical depressions.

The resulting floods and landslides killed at least 192 people and caused property losses of around VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion). More than 1,500 houses were destroyed and 240,000 others damaged. The daily lives of around 5.5 million people were severely disrupted.

The fully probabilistic model provides countrywide coverage and enables insurers to assess their exposure to floods, which affect 70 percent of the country’s population.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue simulating both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding. The fluvial component of the hazard was developed using state-of-the-art hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate rainfall and river discharges across the river network in the country. Pluvial flooding is simulated using a proprietary, in-house methodology accounting for local climate conditions, soil type, land use and topography.

Offering enhanced flexibility, the model can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves, and average annual losses at virtually any level of aggregation. The model outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk® platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region. “The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon. These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.

The government decided to grant VND500 billion ($21.52 million) to five central provinces worst hit by historic flooding for rescue and social welfare support.

The five provinces, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Nam, would receive VND100 billion each as part of the government’s efforts to help local communities overcome the consequences of devastating floods, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh sait at a meeting in Quang Tri on Thursday morning.

The government also provided each of the five provinces with 1,000 tons of rice alongside medicine and antiseptic chemicals.

Senior Lieutenant General Le Chiem, Deputy Minister of National Defense, said the ministry has provided 22 tons of dried food to flooded provinces. For Quang Tri, military forces also provided seven motorboats, 36 generators and three water pumps for after-flood clean-up work along with 1,000 life jackets.

Chiem suggested local authorities distribute dried food to victims in flood-prone areas immediately and properly.

In the past, the defense ministry found ""some local leaders had given dried food to officials as gifts because it was delicious,"" Chiem said. ""The dried food is meant for flood victims. They are in need.""

Binh said damage caused by floods in Quang Tri was ""very huge,"" especially in the two mountainous districts of Huong Hoa and Dak Rong where infrastructure has been heavily affected.

Therefore, the government has granted an additional VND40 billion for these two districts to cope with the flood impacts.

Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said floodwater started receding gradually, so it is necessary to focus on relief for flood victims, from Quang Nam to Ha Tinh.

Many international organizations have pledged donations of cash and disaster relief to help central Vietnam.

For more than two weeks, the central region has been swept by historic flooding and deadly landslides that caused damage described by government officials as worst in five years.

At least 114 people in central Vietnam were killed by severe flooding and landslides and more than 170,000 houses in flood-prone Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces have been submerged, with many areas currently isolated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/huukhoatangle21603267443-16033-3261-6190-1603358848_1200x0.jpg,"['floodhit', 'dried', 'vietnam', 'binh', 'mln', 'quang', 'aid', 'provinces', '21', 'disaster', 'minister', 'central', 'grants', 'food', 'victims', 'support', 'tri', 'provided']", ,flood

The storm also set off landslides and knocked out power lines, leaving 1.7 million people in the dark.



Storm Molave, the ninth storm this year in the South China Sea and the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years, struck coastal provinces on Oct. 28 with heavy rainfall and winds as high as 115-135 km per hour, according to data provided by Vietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting on Wednesday.



Landslides in central provinces have killed at least 19 people and buried more than 40 others, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, adding that the bodies of 12 fishermen missing since the storm hit on Wednesday were recovered on Thursday, leaving another 14 still unaccounted for.



Around 56,000 houses were stripped of their roofs in Quang Ngai, where a massive blackout from downed power lines left more than a million people trapped in darkness as high winds tore through the province, according to state-controlled Vietnam News, AP said.



Wednesday’s storm hit central regions already devastated by weeks of heavy rains, floods, and landslides beginning Oct. 6 that left at least 130 dead and thousands displaced. The floods and landslides also wrecked highways and roads, blocking efforts to rescue and bring supplies to many cut off from help in remote areas.



Speaking to RFA on Thursday, residents in storm-hit provinces described fast-rising waters and devastated fields, with one saying that floodwaters had risen more quickly now than they had during the storms that battered the area earlier this month.



“During previous storms and floods, the water rose only to the height of my hand. But now the water rose so high that my house was submerged,” Hien Thao, a resident of Quang Tri province, speaking to RFA on Oct. 29.



“I lost 500 kg of paddy rice, and many of my household belongings were washed away,” he said.



“Yesterday, the water rose up to the yard of my house,” added 40-year-old Phan Quoc Vu of Truong Xa commune in Cam Lo district’s Cam Hieu village in Quang Tri. “But luckily it began to recede today,” he said.



“In the opinion of my 80-year-old father, this was the worst storm flooding that he can remember,” Vu said.



Calls for help



At the height of the flood, Vu called unsuccessfully to local authorities for help, and even posted calls for help on social media, but finally had to hire canoes to help evacuate elderly people and young children to safer ground, he said.



In Ninh Thuan province, villagers had made their living mainly through farming and raising shrimp, said Tran Thanh Truc, a resident of the province’s Hien Luong commune.



“But the floodwaters washed everything away—pigs, chickens, and shrimp,” she said. “We are glad to receive whatever help others can give us, but it will be difficult to make up for everything that was lost.”



In Quang Tri, supplies including large quantities of rice have been received so far only from volunteers, Hien Thao said, adding that the local People’s Committee has promised to bring relief goods soon.



“I also learned that the government will provide us with seeds for farming our next crop in the winter and spring.”



“We would like them to also give us boats and other equipment we need, along with rice that will help us while we wait for our next crop to be ready for harvest,” he said.



In Truong Xa commune, officials have cared so far only for their own relatives, though, Pham Quoc Vu said.



“They are not impartial, which is causing much suspicion,” he said.



Heavy rains, flooding in Laos



In Laos, heavy rains and flooding from Wednesday’s storm damaged or destroyed around 51,000 hectares of agricultural production, including more than 23,000 hectares of rice fields, across 13 districts of Savannakhet province, state media sources said on Friday.



Total losses in farm production and livestock from flooding in the storm are now estimated at 283 billion kip (U.S. $6,257,968.), Keoodom Souliya—an official from the province’s Agriculture and Forestry Department—said on Thursday.



In the southern province of Champassak, strong winds toppled power lines, while in Borikhamxay province, Khamkeut district’s Napae village was completely destroyed by floods, a video obtained by RFA showed on Friday, with a narrator on the video saying Napae had now become “a sea of water.”



The video also showed floods and landslides blocking the road leading from Napae to the Naphao International Border Checkpoint with Vietnam.



A rice paddy being harvested was also under water, Phetsamai Xayaathichak told local media. “We will announce the exact amount of local damage later, once we know what it is,” he said.



A total number of deaths in Laos resulting from the storm was not immediately available.

39,39,FL-2018-000416-VNM,Megaprojects threaten water justice for local communities - EurekAlert,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uoa-mtw051821.php,"Urban megaprojects tend to be the antithesis of good urban planning. They have a negative impact on local water systems, deprive local communities of water-related human rights, and their funders and sponsors have little accountability for their impact.

These are the findings of the University of Adelaide's Dr Scott Hawken from the School of Architecture and Built Environment who led a review of the impact of urban megaprojects on water justice in South East Asia.

""Urban megaprojects have severe implications for environmental processes,"" said Dr Hawken.

""They have a major impact on hydrological systems and during all phases of development affect water security and human rights.

""As well as interrupting urban water flows and waste removal, they cause biodiversity degradation and loss of arable landscapes, and increase pollution and change the flood regimes of rivers.""

The study, published in the journal Cities, focussed on the Phu My Hung project in Vietnam, the Amarapura project in Myanmar and Boeung Kak Lake in Cambodia, and is the result of Dr Hawken's engagement with recent calls from the United Nations for greater accountability in megaprojects globally.

Urban megaprojects have been a key mode of development in Southeast Asia since the 1980s. Between three and 14 per cent of GDP is invested in these kind of developments in SE Asia and eight per cent globally. They can include urban regeneration schemes, transport and energy infrastructure, industrial corridors, city clusters, new towns, innovation districts, science and technology parks and sports infrastructure.

""The projects we looked at are typical of most major cities in Southeast Asia in that they are located near coasts or major rivers which exposes people who live there to extreme weather events such as floods and erosion,"" said Dr Hawken.

""At every stage of these projects there needs to be a more systematic approach to sustainability especially when assessing their impact on water security. The community needs to be more involved and funders and sponsors need to be more accountable for the impact.

""Wealthier residents tend to benefit from these urban enclaves while they dramatically displace and disrupt existing economics and social relations. Poor socio-economic urban residents are disproportionately adversely affected.""

Megaprojects are often publicly positioned as economic benefactors for cities with governments and developers framing them as delivering wealth and new technologies to urban regions.

""Considering the prominence of this development model, it is unacceptable that there is so little information or recourse when these projects do not deliver on their promises,"" said Dr Hawken.

""Existing urban issues are rarely solved by these projects so a new approach is needed to better engage with communities and their socio-ecological relationships with natural water systems. Considering where they are built such projects also expose cities to future climate related disasters such as sea-level rise and flooding.

""Our findings and recommendations are relevant to cities around the world which are in semi-aquatic, delta environments and sensitive water catchment areas.

""Developers need to be accountable for such projects now and into the future.""

She said the UNDP plans to build an additional 4,000 houses next year, helping 20,000 people gain access to information on climate change and natural disasters, she said, adding that her agency would continue to support Vietnam in natural disaster management over the next decade.

Tran Quang Hoai, head of the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority, said the houses built by the UNDP in central Vietnam were still standing after the region’s historic storms and floods in October and November, which had demolished over 1,500 houses and damaged 240,000 others.

La Thi Kim Ngan, deputy head of the National Institute of Architecture, said that authorities and investors need to create a comprehensive model for housing complexes, complete with infrastructure like electricity, clean water and waste management systems.

Flood resilient houses can become homestay accommodations and help the region develop economically, she added.

Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said his ministry was cooperating with the architecture institute and the Ministry of Construction to develop appropriate and safe housing models to withstand natural disasters.

It is estimated that by 2025, Vietnam would have around 30 million people living in areas prone to natural disasters. Many of them are likely to be poverty stricken.

Rapid urbanization and economic development can intensify natural disaster risks for Vietnam's coastline and wipe billions of dollars off its economic growth over the next decade, a World Bank report warned in October.

Around 11.8 million people in coastal provinces face the threat of intense flooding, and over 35 percent of settlements are located on eroding coastlines. Each year, an average of $852 million, along with around 316,000 jobs in sectors like agriculture, aquaculture and tourism, are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding, the report said.","Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/17/img065481941608185336-16082067-5924-6541-1608206823_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'needs', 'proof', 'flood', 'disaster', 'undp', 'coast', 'management', 'development', 'natural', 'vietnams', 'million', '100000', 'houses', 'coastal']", ,flood

Another powerful storm is testing Southeast Asian disaster responders after Typhoon Goni crashed into the Philippines on 1 November, before veering towards flood-hit central Vietnam.

Goni, known as Rolly in the Philippines, made landfall on Sunday on Catanduanes Island in the country’s east, bringing violent winds and extensive flooding. The Red Cross says there’s “massive devastation” in some areas, including 90 percent of the homes in villages in one part of Catanduanes.

Philippine authorities are still assessing the total damage, but the government said 11 people had died as of 2 November, with numbers still rising.

The evacuation of at least 450,000 people and early response planning helped avoid a worse outcome, but aid groups warn that the combined hit from a barrage of recent storms and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will test communities for months to come.

The Philippines has been locked in disaster response mode for weeks after previous storms caused extensive flooding in parts of Luzon, the country’s main island. Typhoon Molave, known as Quinta in the Philippines, killed at least 23 people in October; Typhoon Saudel, known as Pepito, struck days earlier.

Attention now turns to Vietnam, which is preparing for a weakened Goni to strike its flood-hit central region around 5 November – the country’s fifth major storm since mid-October.

Typhoon Goni’s wind speeds slowed to around 90 kilometres per hour by 2 November, but successive storms over the past month have driven severe floods and landslides across central Vietnam.

Vietnam’s government says roughly 160 people have died, with dozens more missing in the worst flooding to hit the country in 20 years. The disasters have inundated more than a quarter of a million homes, and prompted a $40 million humanitarian appeal targeting 177,000 people.

The Philippines isn’t in the clear, either. Another storm, Atsani or Siony, could careen toward northern Luzon in the coming days, though forecasters say its current path is extremely erratic.

Floods are common during Asia’s various monsoon and cyclone seasons, but aid groups say the damage has been particularly severe this year.

Typhoon Goni was the strongest storm to hit the country since 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,300 people and led to a massive humanitarian response.

Climate change is fuelling more volatile extreme weather across the globe. The Philippines’ first typhoon of the season, Vongfong or Ambo, arrived relatively early in May; the storm season typically hits its peak in July.

Posting on Twitter, Yeb Saño, who was the Philippines’ climate negotiator when Haiyan struck in 2013, said Typhoon Goni and the burst of recent extreme weather is further proof of a crisis.

“The climate emergency persists and is wreaking havoc,” he said.

42,42,FL-2018-000416-VNM,Why nations rush to help India - The Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2021/0428/Why-nations-rush-to-help-India,"Now the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, India has received extraordinary offers of aid from other countries. Even archrival Pakistan made a goodwill gesture to help relieve its neighbor’s unprecedented health crisis. Some aid is being given for political or strategic reasons. After all, the world’s largest democracy, with 1.3 billion people and the fifth-largest economy, is difficult to ignore. Yet look closer and you’ll see another motive at work: an appreciation for India’s past generosity.

As for its aid, the U.S. says it is simply being grateful. “Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” President Joe Biden said in a tweet (India also sent aid after Hurricane Katrina in 2005).

Since the coronavirus crisis began last year, India has assisted more than 100 vulnerable countries with supplies and training. Its open heart has opened the hearts of others. “It’s time for the world to extend aid & support to India,” tweeted Volkan Bozkir, president of the United Nations General Assembl. For his part, Secretary-General António Guterres said the U.N. was “extremely grateful” to India.

It was not always thus for India.

Only in the past two decades has it warmed up to being one of the world’s “donor” countries, helping mitigate the impact of foreign disasters and health emergencies. The more it has seen itself as a major power, the more India has embraced a moral obligation to assist other countries, especially as a first responder in food supplies, evacuations, and equipment.

Indian officials cite a spiritual basis for such aid in a Hindu term, daan, translated as “charity without motive.” In a speech in mid-April, the external affairs minister of India, Dr. S. Jaishankar, said, “Even before the pandemic, India has been providing humanitarian assistance, disaster resistance to all. We have demonstrated in a practical manner, our belief that the world is a family.”

Perhaps the turning point for India was its response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Its navy sent relief to coastal states hit by the tragedy, such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka. In 2015, it launched a large aid effort to Nepal after an earthquake. It has also assisted Iran during a locust attack, sent food supplies to South Sudan, and given flood relief to Cambodia and Vietnam.

Like other major donor nations, India sometimes withholds aid for strategic reasons or dispenses it as a display of soft power. But says Dr. Jaishankar, “We work ... on facing disasters together.”

No wonder so many countries now want to assist India. It has graciously accepted much of the aid, with little regard for whether it comes from friend or foe. Such giving is more than a type of mutual-aid society. When done out of gratitude, it also points to a greater good available to all, with no expectation of reciprocity or credit.","Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2021/04/1119546_2_India_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,"['worlds', 'nations', 'united', 'india', 'aid', 'supplies', 'work', 'world', 'pandemic', 'rush', 'countries', 'sent', 'help']", ,flood

Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam.

The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.

The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.

The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.

As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.

Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light.""

Australia is already making ongoing efforts to support Vietnam’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $10.5 million assistance package in June.

Earlier this week the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management, the United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

""From 2 a.m. until now, there have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,"" local official Ha Ngoc Duong said, as reported by Vietnamese newspaper VnExpress, warning that the situation could worsen.

The bodies of some 22 soldiers from the army camp were recovered early on Sunday morning, according to local media reports. Ongoing rain has hampered rescue efforts. Days before, 13 rescue team members died trying to reach a group of 30 employees of a hydropower plant that had been buried by the landslides.

The rains have flooded nearly 200,000 houses in the region.

Widespread damage

Authorities also warned that river levels in the country had reached their highest in two decades, state media said.

The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides. Torrential downpours have flooded nearly 200,000 houses and 300 schools in the region.

Since storms began on October 6, some 72 people have died and a further 19 are still missing, Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said in a report.

Though Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, which often bring flooding and landslides, this month's disaster has been the worst the country has faced in years.

Neighboring Cambodia has also been affected by heavy flooding in the region. The death toll there jumped to 20 on Saturday, according to disaster management authorities.

Several areas of Vietnam hit by the worst floods in decades. In the last month, torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing, and created hardship for 240 thousand families.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) - Taiwan has donated 400,000 US dollars in aid to Vietnam to support the local population, hit by the worst floods and landslides in decades. In the past two weeks, storms no. 6 and 7 have caused serious damage in the central-northern provinces of Hà Tinh, Qu?ng Bình, Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên-Hu? and in the central-southern ones Ðà N?ng, Qu?ng Nam, Qu?ng Ngãi, Bình Ð?nh and Phú Yên.

The Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention reports that torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing since late September. River levels have risen rapidly in central areas of Vietnam, flooding 212 municipalities inhabited by 240 thousand families.

Many communities are isolated; at the moment in the devastated areas it is possible to move mostly with small boats. Victims are in immediate need of food, bottled water, medicine, clothing, blankets and books.

At the end of the emergency, money will be needed for reconstruction, especially seeds and agricultural machinery. Many Vietnamese have mobilized to support the flood victims. Groups of young people, including Catholics, brought rice, spaghetti (noodles) and drinking water to the most remote flooded areas.

Richard Shih, Taiwanese representative in Hanoi, said that Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs operating in Vietnam have mobilized and sent aid to disaster areas. He hopes the victims can rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon.

The aid delivery ceremony took place on 23 October in the presence of Tr?n Quang Hoài, director of the Vietnamese agency for the management of natural disasters. The Hanoi representative thanked the generosity of the government and the people of Taiwan, stressing that the distribution of aid will start as soon as possible.

The Taiwanese authorities highlighted the strong ties that unite their country to Vietnam.

Huynh Kim Luong was standing in a corner of his home, struggling to find a spot for guests to sit. The pots, pans and clothes scattered around the house were illuminated by the light of flickering candles.

""It has been 21 years since I saw such a flood,"" he said.

For the past 10 days the 60-year-old farmer and his family of three have barely stepped outside. In their Huong Toan Commune in Thua Thien-Hue, floods triggered by heavy rains have inundated over 2,000 homes. The only sounds they hear these days are the thump of rain falling on the roof, the clattering of windows in the wind, and distant hums of motorboats moving through the sea of water.

Like many people in central Vietnam, Luong and his wife Hoa were proud of their ability to live with floods. Since the beginning of this month, Hoa has been stocking up rice, dry fish and peanut on warnings of coming storms and rains. They knew not to stock up on meat since electricity is always cut when a storm hits. They were right.

On the morning of October 9 Luong opened his front door only to see the water almost reaching the threshold following heavy rain the previous night. As the hours passed and the rain showed no signs of relenting, the water started to come inside the house. Everywhere in the neighborhood, people were yelling that the floods had come.

Their eldest daughter, who is in her final year of high school, began to put all her books into plastic bags. Her parents waded around the house to salvage the family’s most valuable belongings like the refrigerator, TV and stove, and put them on a table that is reinforced with four blocks of wood.

Within a span of not even a day, Huong Toan turned from green paddy fields to muddy sea in the afternoon. With the electricity duly cut and dusk falling, the area, now flooded for dozens of kilometers along National Highway 1, slowly sank into darkness.

Also on October 9, in Huong Van Commune, about six kilometers away, Le Thi Thuc spent a sleepless night watching the water rise.

""I say ‘keeping watch,’ but the water will rise anyway even if I’m asleep. But my mind can be a little bit at rest if I watch it,"" she said.

The 54-year-old too has been confined at home for several days.

That night the entire family took refuge in the bedroom of her 85-year-old mother, whose room is situated farthest from the water. Thuc told her three children to go to sleep early, reminding them to turn off their phones to save the battery for the coming days without electricity.

Dung, her husband, shone the flashlight at the floor, sighing. The water was closing in. That night none of the three adults in the household slept a wink.

The local rice milling shop closed as soon as it started raining, catching Thuc off guard, leaving her no time to prepare enough food for the family.

Luckily her sister, who lives on higher ground, helped out, rowing a boat to Thuc’s house to deliver much-needed rice, bamboo shoot broth and boiled duck.

Seeing the family of six enjoying a meal sitting on a bed, surrounded by floodwater, Thuc could not help but weep.

For the next eight days the water ebbed and flowed. The children kept asking when the rain would stop, but the weather forecast kept getting gloomier.

The whole family had to shovel and sweep the mud and sludge entering the house. ""It was like walking in a swamp,"" they said.

Last Friday the water started to recede a little, going down to waist level, and Thuc took the opportunity to go out and buy some fish and vegetables. Looking around the neighborhood after being trapped inside the house for a week, she failed to recognize the place.

In Huong Toan, the situation has been grim. With the water showing no signs of receding, Hoang Trong Hieu, the commune chairman, other officials and police officers have not gone home for the last 10 days.

The group, which consists of over 20 people, has divided itself to take 24-hour shifts at the People’s Committee office to distribute supplies and respond to emergencies like transporting the injured and evacuating people.

Since the entire commune is under a meter of water, all travel is done by boat.

""It has been a long time since we saw our feet,"" a member of the group joked, carrying bags of rice on his shoulder in chest-deep water. The man had given Luong’s family two cartons of instant noodles the other day.

The day before electricity was cut, Luong’s had some vegetables, eggs and fish in the refrigerator, but only enough for two days for the family of three. So for the next eight days they had nothing to eat but rice and dry fish.

""I was given instant noodles but did not dare eat them because I did not want to urinate too much,"" he explained.

Luong’s wife, who had surgery just a month ago, stumbled in the dark and fell one night as she sought to go to the bathroom amid the sea of water. Since then he has been placing pots by the bed and replaces the candles twice every night.

""There are a lot of mosquitoes due to all the water.""

In Huong Van Commune, Nguyen Van Lieu, 63, has taken over the most dangerous task from his wife since the floods came: cooking. He dons his conical hat and raincoat every day to light the stove, standing in chest-deep water.

""If my wife gets into the water to cook, it will come up to her neck,"" he joked, patting his wife’s back with a smile.

Their house was almost completed earlier this year but the roof has not been finished. The family is among the luckier ones in the neighborhood since the water only comes up to the thighs even during the heaviest rains.

But the kitchen is a different story. There had been over 20 bags of rice, weighing over a ton, but everything was soaked the very first night. Vy, Lieu’s wife, had no choice but to give them away to her neighbors to feed their ducks and chickens. She has been borrowing rice from others.

They have not told their two eldest children, who are workers in the south, about their situation, not wanting to worry them.

Like many others, the couple have been trapped inside their home, situated just 100 m from the national highway, for more than a week. Every day Vy would cast her gaze on the other side of the highway to look at the paddy fields longingly despite realizing they must be submerged under water.

A few days before the rains came she had sold her first few gourds of the season. ""They sell well this year at VND10,000 (43 cents) per kilogram,"" she said. She was hoping to earn around VND10 million from selling them all over two months.

But that was before the storm came. She was only able to sell for two days, earning VND240,000, before she was forced to remain at home.

She and her husband have been reminiscing about the historic flood in Thua Thien Hue 21 years ago. The deluge in November 1999 had submerged thousands of houses and paralyzed all traffic and electrical and communication systems in the province. There had been rainfall of up to 2,300 mm in just the first three days. Several people had been swept away and killed during that disaster.

At that time the couple and their children stacked two beds on top of each other and waited for the floods to recede, the anguished voices of people who lost loved ones in the background.

Their son, seeing how his parents had to face flooding year after year, wanted to help them find a safer place to live in, but they cannot countenance moving out of their hometown.

More heavy rains are expected in central Vietnam regions at least until Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Rivers are expected to rise further, as is the risk of floods and landslides. Vehicles continue to line up along National Highway 1 and other roads on higher ground as people park their cars and motorbikes there to avoid the water.

But the people cannot do the same, they cannot just leave their houses. The only thing that Luong, Thuc and Lieu can do is to barricade themselves inside their homes and pray for the water to go away","Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/19/fbbdc0d9e2fe1ca045ef7172160297-3133-2038-1603105515_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'misery', 'rice', 'water', 'province', 'rain', 'thuc', 'floods', 'house', 'amid', 'days', 'wife', 'drowns', 'thua', 'night', 'family', 'continuing']", ,flood

Australia, Switzerland and Thailand have offered aid to victims of multiple storms and floods in central Vietnam last month.

The Australian embassy in Hanoi said on Friday its government will provide an additional AUD2 million ($1.45 million) to help Vietnam respond to the impacts of prolonged floods and landslides in the central region. The country had earlier provided AUD100,000 ($71,300).

The aid money will be used to meet urgent needs like providing clean water and sanitation and hygiene and dignity kits to affected people, and support the restoration of clean water supply to schools.

The Swiss embassy also announced grant of urgent aid worth CHF300,000 ($333,000) to help address the immediate needs of 160,000 people focusing on housing, livelihoods, healthcare, water, and hygiene.

In a phone call to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-o-cha, offered $30,000 toward relief efforts.

The central region was repeatedly hit by torrential rains, widespread flooding and landslides triggered by four storms in October.

So far 235 people have been killed or are missing, almost 390,000 houses were flooded and more than 300,000 families have been evacuated, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority.

Many people have lost almost all their household possessions or had their homes, food stocks, livestock, and crops badly damaged.

According to Tran Phuoc Anh, acting director of the city’s Foreign Department, the sustainable flood prevention project for Thu Duc City would have a total investment of more than $1bn, and would be implemented as a public–private project with the participation of the Dutch government.

Le Hoa Binh, deputy chair of HCMC, said he hoped the Netherlands would help create a city that was “sustainable and well adapted to climate change”.

Elizabeth Akkerman, the Dutch ambassador to Vietnam, said her government would help HCMC and Thu Duc City with advanced construction technologies.

Thu Duc will be based on advanced industries such as autonomous manufacturing, and will include the university precinct in Thu Duc as well as a new-build urban area and financial centre on the Thu Thiem Peninsula.

Thu Duc is the most elevated area in HCMC, but still suffers from seasonal flooding, and its residents suffer from inundation of streets and even houses every time there is heavy rain or a high tide.

In May 2019, HCMC sent a delegation to the Netherlands to study its urban development and flood management methods, and a number of memorandums of understanding were subsequently signed, including a $1bn anti-flooding project in Thu Duc City.

A tropical depression is projected to hit central Vietnam on Friday night, bringing heavy rains as the area struggles to recover from more than a week of flooding.

As of 10 a.m. Friday, the tropical depression was about 290 km to the east of Da Nang and Binh Dinh Province, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Its maximum wind speed was 50 kph.

Within the next 12 hours, the tropical depression would move west at about 30 kph, before making landfall in central Vietnam, then devolving into a low-pressure area over southern Laos.

By 10 p.m. Friday, the low-pressure area would be above the mountainous area of central Vietnam, with a maximum wind speed of 40 kph.

Rough seas and strong winds should be expected in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, within the next 24 hours.

Central Vietnam should expect particularly heavy rain from now until Wednesday next week, according to the center. Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and southern Nghe An should expect a total rainfall of up to 900 mm during the period, while Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and northern Nghe An should expect up to 500 mm.

Da Nang and its neighbor Quang Nam Province, home to popular ancient town Hoi An, should expect rainfall of up to 500 mm, while regions between Quang Ngai and Phu Yen should expect levels of up to 350 mm.

The Central Highlands should also expect heavy rain until Sunday, with rainfall of up to 250 mm.

Rains are expected to persist in central Vietnam even after Wednesday, the center noted.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Since last week, central Vietnam has been hit by torrential rains, floods and landslides after a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

On Sunday, Storm Linfa intensified from the turbulence and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. The next day, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

At least 56 people have been killed, including two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while coming to rescue the workers.

Thousands of homes in the region have been flooded.

Torrential downpours and discharge of water from hydropower dams have caused rivers in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces to swell and threaten severe flooding.

Storm Molave, said to be the strongest to hit Vietnam in the last two decades, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Wednesday morning before weakening into a tropical depression by 4 p.m.

The provinces have been hit by rains of up to 500 mm between Tuesday night and Wednesday night. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In Quang Ngai, the Tra Bong River was flowing above flood warning danger level 2 at Chau O station while the Tra Khuc, Ve and Tra Cau rivers had crossed the highest danger level of 3 by 4 p.m. Wednesday, according to the province's Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

They are forecast to continue rising quickly on Thursday, possibly triggering severe flooding in large parts of Quang Ngai Town, the capital, and several districts.

The release of water by local hydropower dams is worsening the situation.

Dak Drinh hydropower plant discharged up to 1,680 cubic meters of water a second on Wednesday and Nuoc Trong, the largest irrigation and hydroelectricity project in the central region, discharged 1,100 cubic meters.

Authorities hurriedly evacuated people living in low-lying areas and made emergency announcements about the water discharge via loudspeakers to warn local residents.

In Quang Nam Province, home to ancient town Hoi An, the water level in the Vu Gia River reached 9.41 meters by early morning Thursday, 0.41 meters above danger level 3, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, which warned rivers in the province would rise quickly in the next few hours.

Dak Mi 4 hydropower plant plans to discharge up to 11,400 cubic meters a second and the Vu Gia River is expected to rise to 11.2 meters, surpassing the historic flood level in 2009.

Nguyen Huu Vu, a local official, said authorities have evacuated over 4,000 families living along the river.

If the hydropower plant discharges over 5,000 cubic meters per second, 120,000 houses would be submerged under 0.5-1.5 meters of water, Vu said.

The National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said on Wednesday that Quang Nam could face severe flooding in the next one or two days.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung instructed provincial authorities to evacuate people from areas threatened by landslides and ensure the safety of reservoirs and hydropower plants.

The central region, including Quang Nam, was hit by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that caused at least 130 deaths.

Phnom Penh (AFP)

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to get them to safety from rising floodwater on Saturday in Cambodia's western province of Battambang.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces -- Pursat, Battambang and Pailin -- have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall ahead of the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

""A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,"" Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told AFP on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to worsen on Sunday.

In central Vietnam almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking north Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to sandbag and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

In Laos, rising floodwater has damaged villages and rice fields along the Xepon and Xebanghieng rivers in Savannakhet province with more rain on the way.

The probabilistic model will provide full national coverage and help re/insurers to assess their exposure to floods – a peril that affects 70% of the population in Vietnam.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue that simulates both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding.

It can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves and average annual losses at any level of aggregation.

Outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region.

“The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon,” Gallagher explained.

“These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flooded.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'model', 'reinsurance', 'population', 'flood', 'guy', 'help', 'launches', 'carpenter', 'vietnamthe', 'includes']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

When a northern cold spell entered the intertropical convergence zone over central Vietnam, it caused abnormally heavy rains and flooding in the region.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh got 400-500 mm, Quang Tri got 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue got 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City got 1,100 mm, Quang Nam got 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai got 600-800 mm.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

The entire central region suffered from severe flooding for days, more than 135,000 houses were submerged under 0.3-4 meters of water, and nearly 46,000 people had to be evacuated.

At least 36 people have died due to flooding and 12 are missing.

Nguyen Van Huong, head of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting’s Climate Forecast Office, said intertropical convergence zone stretches from the Bay of Bengal and across the center of Vietnam to the Philippines.

In these areas clouds and thunderstorms often develop, and when winds from the east meet them, there is an increase in moisture content, which means more thunderstorms, he said.

When the zone has favorable conditions such as the convergence of strong winds that moved over warm seawater, a tropical depression forms and then grows into a storm in the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea, he said.

Since October 6 two storms and a tropical depression have formed in this area.

On Sunday Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.

A day later Storm Nangka formed and hit the coast between the northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa Provinces on Wednesday.

""Storms and tropical depression already cause heavy rains. For instance, Storm Linfa caused rainfall of 500-700 mm,"" Huong said.

On Thursday morning another tropical depression formed over the sea and is heading straight for the central region also with a lot of moisture.

According to the center, more rains are expected in the region until Tuesday or later.

A cold spell coming down from the north and meeting winds from the east also caused heavy rains, Huong said.

The center said the root cause of all these phenomena was La Nina, which appeared in July and is expected to last until early next year. During this period, more storms would form over the East Sea and the rains would last longer than usual, it added.

Four to six more storms and tropical depressions are expected to brew this year with at least two making landfall over the central coast.

La Nina is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years as a result of variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It occurs as strong winds blow warm water on the ocean's surface from South America across the Pacific Ocean toward Indonesia.

Hoi An, a tourist hotspot and UNESCO heritage site, is like a massive lake following prolonged downpours with many streets under 0.5 meter of water.

Nguyen The Hung, the town’s vice chairman, said plans are underway to evacuate people living in low-lying areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Thursday ordered provinces from Ha Tinh to Phu Yen to deal with the heavy flooding and take urgent measures including evacuation to ensure people’s safety.

The number of patients with melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, has increased sharply at a major hospital in the central region following the prolonged flooding.

Since early October Hue Central Hospital in Thua Thien-Hue Province has admitted 28 people with the disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia Pseudomallei, which infects both humans and animals.

Around half the patients are from Thua Thien-Hue and the rest are from other central provinces like Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri, the province's news website reported.

The hospital is one of three biggest and most advanced general hospitals in Vietnam along with others in Hanoi and HCMC.

It said many of the patients came for treatment only after the disease had become serious, causing sepsis and multi-organ failure and threatening their life.

On November 14 a Quang Binh Province official died of the disease at the hospital.

Phan Thanh Mien, people’s committee chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trach District, had spent days in floodwaters in October managing relief efforts. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee, but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items in inundated areas.

The hospital had treated 83 people with the disease between 2014 and 2019 and 11 in the first nine months of this year.

It said the rise in the number of infections since early October is closely related to the floods that ravaged the central region throughout October and in November.

Various studies around the world have found that melioidosis occurs only in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, with outbreaks occurring after floods and typhoons.

In October central Vietnam was hit by floods thrice.

Melioidosis patients have symptoms like fever, pneumonia and abscesses in and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate is around 40 percent.

The disease was first diagnosed in Vietnam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country.

There are around 10,000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, around half of which prove fatal. There is no vaccine.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/17/muangapohue031602226049-160558-2074-9150-1605581241_1200x0.jpg,"['thienhue', 'infection', 'vietnam', 'patients', 'quang', 'province', 'outbreak', 'central', 'hospital', 'floods', 'cause', 'bacterial', 'floodwaters', 'thua', 'disease']", ,flood

After devastating storms and floods, the airline worked to transport thousands of aid packages to help areas in central Vietnam.

Aid transportation

Vietnam Airlines flew over 24 tons of goods and more than 2,000 packages from organizations like the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee, the Red Cross, and individual donations, among others, to support operations in central Vietnam in cities like Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi.

This is just part of Vietnam Airlines’ aid operations. The airline is expecting to fly more than 100 tons of cargo to support relief operations.

Vietnam Airlines, along with its affiliates, is receiving and transporting goods to Central Vietnam free of charge.

Stay informed: Sign up for our daily aviation news digest.

For passengers, Vietnam Airlines is also giving people to Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi one extra free bag in addition to their class of service baggage allowance. This will allow passengers to also fly with additional relief items or essential items.

Vietnam Airlines is expecting to fly over 10,000 pieces of luggage free of charge. This will help those who are bringing relief items to the region.

Central Vietnam is facing awful flooding

Devastating floods, some of the most severe in decades, according to CNN, have claimed over 100 lives and led to immense destruction. Over 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and over 691,000 cattle and poultry have either been killed or swept away. Hundreds of thousands of meters of roadways have also been damaged.

In addition to the flooding, landslides have also caused deaths and damage. However, Vietnam, which is no stranger to rain and typhoons, became overwhelmed after facing a particularly fierce set of storms.

Relief agencies rely on airlines to help transport goods and people. Another set of storms is, including a tropical storm, made its way to Vietnam this last weekend as well.

For the flag carrier of Vietnam, it was now time to step up and fly relief. After facing some operational disruptions due to the storm, the carrier became one lifeline to bring much-needed supplies to the region.

Airlines and aid flights

Over the last few months, aid flights have become common when it came to transporting medical supplies. However, airlines are no strangers when it comes to running aid and relief flights.

Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines partnered to send 20,000 pounds of aid on a brand new Boeing 787. Emirates has flown tens of thousands of kilograms of aid to Lebanon since a blast rocked Beirut.

Flag carriers, in particular, tend to step up when the country needs airlines to fly in (or fly out) people and supplies. Vietnam Airlines has used aircraft, like the ATR 72, to fly in aid.

The European Union will provide €1.3 million ($1.52 million) for critical humanitarian assistance to families affected by severe flooding that wreaked havoc across central Vietnam.

The aid will focus on addressing the urgent needs of the most affected people in central Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces, European External Action Service said in a press release.

""This contribution underlines our solidarity with the people of Vietnam, many of whom have suffered the loss of homes, livelihoods and belongings in the wake of the devastating floods,"" said Olivier Brouant, who oversees the EU’s humanitarian response in the Mekong region.

The funding includes the distribution of hygiene kits and other essential relief items while ensuring access to drinking water, sanitation facilities and the promotion of good hygiene practices. Cash transfers will also be provided, allowing people to buy food or items of their choice.

Female-headed households and people with disabilities will be given priority for humanitarian assistance.

The central region was bombarded by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that resulted in at least 130 deaths.

The historic flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated and livestock killed, damage the government claimed to be ""the worst in the past five years.""

Some countries and international organizations recently pledged immediate humanitarian relief to help central Vietnam overcome the consequences of deadly floods.

Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

South Korea pledged relief worth $300,000 while the U.S. has promised $100,000.

With central Vietnam yet to recover from the historic flooding, Storm Molave, the ninth storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Provinces on Wednesday, triggering heavy rains and strong winds for the central region.

Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri.

At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnam’s Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.

A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.

They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.

For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.

At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday.

Saudel is the eighth storm in the East Sea this year, and follows Linfa and Nangka earlier this month.

Over 3,700 UNFPA Dignity Kits worth $180,000 would be provided to the elderly in central Vietnam following a series of storms and tropical depressions that hit the region last year.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) representative in Vietnam, handed over 3,704 kits containing essential items to Bui Quang Huy, standing secretary of the HCMC Communist Youth Union, to support the elderly in three central Vietnam provinces afflicted by floods last year: Ha Tinh, Quang Tri and Quang Ngai at a Wednesday ceremony.

Dignity Kits are a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, mitigate the risk of gender-based violence, and respond to and protect the dignity of women and girls adversely affected by a crisis. Kits meant for the elderly contain items like hand towels, sweaters, socks, wet tissues, toothbrushes, soap, underwear, blankets, flashlights and whistles.

The handover was made possible via financial contributions from U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), according to a UNFPA press release.

The elderly are among the most vulnerable when natural disasters strike, according to UNFPA. During floods and landslides in central Vietnam last year, health facilities were hard hit, causing routine public health programs to be disrupted, it added. The elderly are at risk since they do not always get the care they need, and their vulnerabilities can become a serious challenge to survival and wellbeing, it stated.

Last year, central Vietnam was struck by a series of storms and tropical depressions, triggering heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Over 200 people were killed and property losses amounted to around VND30 trillion ($1.3 trillion). Hundreds of thousands of homes were either destroyed or damaged, affecting the lives of at least 7.7 million residents.

With Storm Molave set to make landfall in central Vietnam in the next few days, Vietnamese authorities are preparing to evacuate 1.2 million coast residents to safety.

At 1 p.m. Monday, the storm lay centered around 560 km east-northeast of Southwest Cay islet, with winds of 135 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

Over the next 24 hours, it will move west at 20-25 kph and gradually intensify. At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, it will be 280 km to the north of Southwest Cay with winds of up to 150 kph.

Mai Van Khiem, director of the national forecast center, said at a meeting Monday both the agency and its Japanese counterpart predict the rapidly moving storm would make landfall in central Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces.

The agencies forecast the storm would reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning, before making landfall in the coming hours.

On Wednesday morning, the storm's center would be around 200 km from the coast of Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh with a maximum wind speed of 135 kph, causing waves of up to 10 m.

Storm circulation combined with a cold spell would cause heavy rains on a large scale, and localities stretching over 1,000 km from Nghe An to Phu Yen will be battered by torrential downpours and strong winds from Tuesday until Thursday, with rainfall of between 200-400 mm.

Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh are told to brace for prolonged downpours until Saturday with total rainfall of up to 700 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Mountainous areas will be at high risk of landslides.

Mass evacuation

Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, said with Molave’s strength level, the committee is ready to evacuate over 1.2 million residents in seven central provinces Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

The region, home to popular ancient towns, beautiful beaches and world famous caves, has been bombarded by historic flooding and deadly landslides for the past three weeks, suffering damage government officials described as ""the worst in five years."" At least 130 people have been killed by floods and landslides between October 6 and 25.

Hoai urged provincial leaders to stay in contact with fishing boats, evacuate residents to safety, and make plans to limit storm damage.

There are still 65,000 fishing boats operating along the central coast, of which 45,000 have received official warnings.

""The storm is too strong,"" Hoai said, ordering localities to order boats to take shelter, ban residents from fishing activities, and close all public beaches by Tuesday night.

Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defense has called for the mobilization of more than 368,000 people - soldiers, members of the police force, and civilian volunteers, to assist residents in at-risk areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the meeting that localities must be on high alert and prepare their best flood prevention measures.

""If the storm comes as strong as forecast, damage from rains and floods will be extremely huge,"" Phuc said.

According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Storm Molave's strength is equivalent to Storm Damrey, which hit south central Vietnam in November 2017 and killed 106 people.

Hoang Tan Trong, watching over the family farm in Dong Hoi Town with his father and pregnant wife, witnessed floods tear through his home on the night of October 19. Dao, Trong’s wife, was sitting on their bed, suspended in the air thanks to four ropes connecting it to the roof. But with the walls damaged, the bed wobbled about two meters above ground, leaning to the side.

Trong later returned to his old home to herd his 30 remaining chickens out of 200 into tree branches to avoid the flood. His three dogs were given to a relative the next day for safe keeping.

Since October 6, heavy rains have inundated the lowlands of Quang Binh. While not suffering fatal landslides like Thua Thien-Hue or Quang Tri provinces, Quang Binh has been the most severely flooded.

The October 19 flood managed to submerge thousands of houses, making even the most hardy residents shudder in fear.

From 1 a.m. on October 16 to 5 p.m. October 20, Quang Binh recorded rainfall of up to 1,380 mm in certain areas. The most heavily flooded was in Le Thuy District, with over 32,000 houses swamped. Throughout the entire province, around 105,000 homes have been similarly affected.

Tran Cong Thuat, chairman of Quang Binh, said: ""Floods this year have eclipsed the record peak in 1979 by up to 0.98 m."" The historic flood peak was recorded on Kien Giang River at 3.91 m. This year, however, the peak remained at 4.89 m for several consecutive days.

""The flood came at night so it was very powerful. The peak was too high, catching certain areas off guard,"" Thuat added. On the night of October 19 alone, thousands of people throughout Quang Binh have called out for help via their phones or social media.

""We still lack boats, but we are doing our best to help alleviate the suffering,"" he said.

Floods in Quang Binh this year not only set new records, but also receded very slowly. By the morning of October 21, traffic across the province remained crippled due to several flooded locations. Over the last fews days, people have confined themselves to their homes, with many of their pets, livestock and vegetables perishing in the water.

It would take a long time for Quang Binh to recover following this historic flood, according to Thuat. As Storm Saudel approaches Vietnamese shores, the province has prepared plans to support people with necessities and food for the coming days.

""During the first days when flood levels rose quickly, we were met with many challenges. But now that the water’s receding, we’ve been surveying heavily flooded and isolated houses so we could perform rescue operations and provide supplies more easily. We would not allow any family to be abandoned amid the flooding,"" said Thuat.

The field was the primary source of income to feed his family of three.

As he inspected the damage done by the prolonged flooding central Vietnam has had to suffer, he noted that some paddy sections had been swept away by floodwaters, while his tapioca field, cultivated over the past 10 months, was buried in rubble.

""We don’t know what to plant to make a living,"" said Rao, a 46-year-old resident of Huong Son Commune in Quang Tri’s Huong Hoa District. Two wet bags of grains they have are all that’s left for the next six months, he said, adding that on sunny days, he would put them out to dry.

The Huong Son Commune has over 192 ha of paddy fields, but around 90 ha were buried under rocks and wood rotting deposited by the floods, rendering them unusable and irrecoverable. Le Trong Tuong, chairman of the Huong Son People’s Committee, said residents were facing food shortages in the future for people.

In Quang Binh Province’s Bo Trach District, Le Xuan Uyen, 56, sees his field buried under mud and soil a meter deep, meaning he cannot plant new saplings for the winter-spring season without putting in significant time and efforts to clean the place up.

Worse still, the soil the fields are buried under has toxic properties that would kill paddy if they’re planted, he said. ""We are worried because we have missed the season for planting, and we don’t know what to plant anyway.""

The Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences said the top soil layer that covers several areas in Bo Trach District is actually heavy clay layers, which would make it difficult for cultivation if left as it is. Farmers should switch to different plants to adapt to the new layers, the academy has suggested.

Around 1,650 ha of fields in Quang Tri were inundated in the past month. Provincial authorities are now cooperating with the people to salvage the buried fields to prepare for the winter-spring planting season in just a month, said Ha Si Dong, deputy chairman of Quang Tri. But as the fields are large, ample time, it would take a lot of people and equipment to complete the job, he added.

Recovery efforts should be completed by mid-December so new saplings can be planted for the winter-spring season on time, Quang Tri authorities have said.

While the metropolis can cope with flood risks today that could hit 23% of its area, further urbanization is raising the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels. Those could cause about $8.4 billion of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact, McKinsey said.

The city still has time to adapt to avoid such risks by having better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas, McKinsey said. Investments and fund-raising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.

Thousands of people fled their homes in Vietnam on Saturday as Typhoon Vamco barrelled towards central regions already pummelled by weeks of successive storms.

Airports have been shut, beaches closed, and a fishing ban put in place as the country braces for winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour (60 miles per hour) when the typhoon makes landfall on Sunday, likely close to Hue.

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in four central provinces, according to the disaster management authority, while state media said hundreds of thousands more may have to flee.

“This is a very strong typhoon,” Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said, warning provinces in Vamco’s projected path to prepare for its impact.

‘No respite’

A series of storms have hit central Vietnam over the past six weeks, causing flooding and landslides that have killed at least 159 people, authorities said, while 70 others are missing.

The severe weather has also damaged or destroyed more than 400,000 homes, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Roads and bridges have been washed away, power supplies disrupted, and crucial food crops destroyed, leaving at least 150,000 people at immediate risk of food shortages, it added.

“There has been no respite for more than eight million people living in central Vietnam,” said Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, Vietnam Red Cross Society president.

“Each time they start rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, they are pummeled by yet another storm.”

Philippine coastguards conduct rescue operations after Typhoon Vamco resulted in severe flooding in the Cagayan Valley region [Reuters] Typhoon Vamco has already caused devastation in the Philippines.

Emergency response teams were dispatched to the northeast on Saturday where more than 340,000 people have been affected by severe flooding following Vamco, which killed at least 53 people across the country, disaster agencies said.

Twenty of the deaths were recorded in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya, which have become the focus of rescue efforts.

Hundreds of people were trapped on rooftops in the hardest-hit areas along the Cagayan river with rescuers unable to reach them because of strong currents, said the spokesman for the regional Office of Civil Defense.

Vast swaths of the region were underwater in what officials have described as the worst flooding in living memory. The release of water from the Magat dam has exacerbated the impact.","Sat, 14 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-14T085834Z_1080446966_RC2W2K9H4DAS_RTRMADP_3_ASIA-STORM-PHILIPPINES.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'red', 'flee', 'severe', 'provinces', 'nears', 'homes', 'typhoon', 'central', 'flooding', 'thousands', 'vamco', 'cagayan']", ,flood
75,75,FL-2018-000416-VNM,Vietnam suffers through a “new normal” of extreme weather events - WSWS,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/28/viet-o28.html,"Vietnam is being pummelled by ongoing tropical storms causing major flooding and landslides in its central regions. As of Monday morning, the death toll had reached 130 with 18 people missing, according to government figures. This was up from 119 fatalities on Saturday, with most occurring in the central provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam.

Close to a million people have been severely affected, with many in desperate need of shelter, food, clean drinking water and income support. According to the UN, as of last Thursday, at least 178,000 homes were currently under water.

Flood levels eclipsed the 1979 record by 0.98 metres, hovering at 4.89 metres for several consecutive days in the province of Quang Binh. The amount of rain that fell between October 6 and 13 was two to six times higher than normal in some regions.

Most of the hardest hit have been poor farmers. Agricultural damage has been extensive, with 1,500 hectares of rice fields and 7,800 hectares of other crops being either flooded or damaged. Close to a million head of cattle and poultry have also been killed or swept away.

The government has stated that the damage caused has been “the worst in five years”. Several highways and local roads are blocked with rocks the size of cars, hampering rescue efforts.

About a third of deaths have been of military personnel.

In one instance, a team of 21 rescuers, most of them military officers, was sent to verify reports of 17 workers buried by a landslide at the Rao Trang 3 hydroelectric plant deep in the jungle. The workers were reportedly asleep when they were buried on October 12.

The rescue team stopped at a ranger station for the night and were buried in a rocky landslide. Of the 13 deaths, 11 were from the military. Only four of the 17 workers at the dam have been recovered thus far and authorities have deployed more rescue forces to the scene.

Days later, a barracks in Quang Tri was consumed by a mudslide in the early hours of the morning, killing 20 military personnel, likely the largest number of military casualties suffered in a period of peace, according to officials.

Scientists believe flooding in central Vietnam is the result of a “new normal” of weather patterns driven by complex processes.

On an international scale, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDDR) reported recently a 75 percent increase in natural disasters in the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, there were 4,212 major natural disasters. Between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded costing 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy USD$2.97 trillion.

The increase is largely attributed to climate related events such as floods, droughts and storms.

Speaking at a virtual conference, UNDDR chief Mami Mizutori accused governments of abandoning effective measures to deal with climate change, “It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction,” he said, “despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.”

In the Asia Pacific, the cyclical la Nina phenomenon is intensifying storms in the region, and is expected to continue until early next year. Cambodia has reported 39 deaths from flooding, with hundreds of thousands affected and 46,216 people evacuated to safer ground.

Vietnam has been hit by three tropical storms and a depression in the month of October. Typhoon Mojave, at present travelling westwards over the Philippines, is also likely to impact in the weeks ahead. It is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds of 130 kilometres per hour. About 9,000 people in the Philippines have fled their homes.

Professor of human ecology at Rutgers University, Pamela McElwee, told the New York Times that the sheer volume of rainfall in Vietnam was, “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it shattered the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in its central regions by the end of the century.

She also stated that the construction of hydroelectric dams and poor mountain roads had weakened the soil. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go.”

Christopher Rassi, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross, warned of the economic fallout: “We are seeing a deadly double disaster unfold before our eyes as these floods compound the difficulties caused by COVID-19. These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.”

The Vietnamese economy relies heavily on its tourism industry which has been drastically cut back during the pandemic. Borders were virtually closed in late March. Apart from an outbreak in Da Nang Hospital in late July, total cases have been kept low and contained at under 1,500, with 40 deaths.

The Asian Development Bank assessed in September that Vietnam’s economy would grow at around 1.8 percent in 2020, its slowest rate in 35 years and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.

The Stalinist regime in Vietnam has ruthlessly pursued a policy of capitalist restoration for decades. According to its own estimates, economic inequality is worsening. Between 2014 and 2018 the GINI index of Vietnam, a standard measure of income inequality, was 0.4 [where 0 represents absolute equality and 1 absolute inequality]. The figure is regarded as a tipping point with higher numbers frequently associated with social unrest and political instability.

Out of fear of social unrest, the regime has sought to suppress criticism from workers and the peasantry. According to the UN, hundreds of people have been interrogated so far over COVID-19 related Facebook posts. In the lead up to the congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in January 2021, the government has begun a campaign of censoring dissident and left-wing publications.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wsws.org/asset/64544160-f1d1-4d85-aecd-24bd939be1eb?rendition=image1280,"['vietnam', 'normal', 'storms', 'quang', 'according', 'extreme', 'workers', 'central', 'events', 'military', 'million', 'rescue', 'suffers', 'weather']", ,flood
76,76,FL-2018-000416-VNM,Flood relief necessary but post-disaster reconstruction vital - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/perspectives/flood-relief-necessary-but-post-disaster-reconstruction-vital-4182755.html,"Nguyen Thi Vung had to keep an eye on her sow for five days straight during the flooding in Thua Thien-Hue Province and lost three kilograms consequently.

Phan Duong

She was worried the 80-kilogram beast might be swept away or escape.

The resident of a village in Quang Dien District explains: ""Pigs can be really destructive if they escape. I did not dare sleep at night.""

Central Vietnam has been hit hard by tropical storms, torrential downpours, floods, and landslides for three weeks now.

The woman, who is in her 50s, took the sow and its litter of four to her brother’s house since it is on higher ground than hers, and never left them alone for a moment.

With a stick in one hand, she made sure the sow behaved. But the animal was spooked and attacked her more than once. Vung has a wound on her right thigh from a bite.

But importantly she has been able to safeguard the family’s most valuable asset.

She had spent a year raising the pig and saw it give birth to four piglets. If she manages to keep all of them safe, and the animal continues to have more litters, she can solve the problem she has been facing: that of paying her daughter’s tuition.

Her daughter is a freshman at a college in Da Nang City, and Vung has to send her VND1.5 million ($65) every month for living expenses besides paying VND6 million a year tuition for the two-year course.

Since her daughter was in 10th grade Vung had been telling her, ""I think you should drop out of school and work; I am not able to afford your schooling.""

But the girl would plead: ""Please let me stay in school so that I can have a proper career in future and build us a better life.""

Vung relented.

Their family consists of just the two of them. Vung does the best she can, growing rice on a 750-square-meter farm and doing agricultural labor and menial jobs for others.

Every year in October she travels to the Central Highlands to harvest coffee and cassava for farmers there. But this year she has been stuck in floods described as the worst in decades.

Earlier this year, along with many other localities across Vietnam, Thua Thien-Hue was also hit by the African swine fever, an incurable and fatal disease in pigs.

Vung worked for other farmers, burying pigs killed by the disease.

""God blessed me and kept my sow healthy.""

Now she has once again kept the sow safe through the floods.

But she has not been able to save a small flock of chickens and a cassava crop that had almost been ready for harvest.

All hopes for the mother and daughter’s future now rest on that one sow.

When meeting us in the courtyard of a government office to receive a donation of essential items from readers of VnExpress through FPT’s Hope Foundation, Vung cannot hold back her tears, and tells us all about her pigs and chickens.

The floodwaters have now started receding in several parts of the central region, including her Quang Dien District, and people are trying to pick up the pieces again after two weeks of living with the floods.

Vung is still at her brother’s house with her pigs since it is still not safe to return home.

Her 20-year-old single-storied house has deteriorated and its walls are cracked, and now after the floods Vung is afraid they could collapse at any time.

""More storms are coming, so I’d better stay here.""

Storm Molave is expected to reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning.

In Phong Dien, another district in Thua Thien Hue, we met Le Thi Sinh, 51.

Three years ago her son passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children. Her daughter-in-law works elsewhere and sends home money for Sinh and her husband to raise the two kids, one of whom is learning to talk while the other is in kindergarten. Sinh’s husband has a number of health problems and so she is the family’s breadwinner.

No one had foreseen such severe flooding. Like many other locals, Sinh and her husband did not have enough time to prepare for the disaster.

When the waters came, they packed off the children, belongings and grain to the first floor. They hung their six piglets, each weighing around 15 kg, from the ceiling, but one was swept away and another was killed.

The floods also swept away their flock of 200 chickens and destroyed their cassava and sweet potato crops.

Her grandchildren cried and asked for their mother. Then they asked for their father after seeing a man next door casting a net to catch fish. There was nothing Sinh could do except shed tears of grief.

Sinh still has a litany of problems to worry about like a loan she took to buy supplements for the pigs and chickens and buying formula and other essential items for the children.

She hopes to get relief from the authorities and plant a new crops and resume her livestock and poultry farming.

In the district’s Phong Xuan Commune, locals grow trees and paddy. In May Storm Noul destroyed grown paperbark and acacia trees, and now the floods have destroyed all the young ones.

In Phong Hien Commune 2,000 families have been living in the floodwaters. They have lost 250 hectares (620 acres) of cassava, 27 hectares of glittering chive, 25 hectares of sugarcane, and 15 hectares of other crops.

""There is nothing left,"" Nguyen Si Hiep, chairman of the commune Fatherland Front Committee, said. The front, an overarching public organization, is tasked with ""promoting national solidarity and unity of mind in political and spiritual matters,"" and conducting many of the government's social programs, especially those to mitigate poverty.

Hiep said the commune administration is advising farmers to switch to short-term crops after the floods recede so that they could earn some income before the new year arrives.

There is way too much attention on flood relief though it is just one part of the big picture when a natural disaster strikes. Reconstructing the livelihoods and rebuilding the lives of millions of people in the central region is now a serious challenge in what has already been a disastrous year.

A World Bank report released last week estimated that 12 million people living in coastal provinces face the threat of severe flooding and over 35 percent of people live on eroding coastlines.

Each year an average of $852 million and 316,000 jobs in key economic sectors are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding.

In this context, I reviewed the concept of social capital. Economists treat social capital as an important resource of the nation. It is understood as the two-way and multidimensional cooperation between members of the society, the power of connection between people in a community, a country, and transactions based on mutual trust that bring mutual benefit.

The fact that Vietnamese everywhere are pitching in to provide succor to people in the central region these days is an expression of social capital in Vietnam.

The World Bank believes that social capital helps the community coordinate voluntarily and effectively because it is based on a common goal to help solve collective problems. The natural disasters in the central region are a collective problem. To address this problem, the government can collaborate with the community and make use of the social capital that has been on display in recent days.

Dealing with the aftermath of the floods gives the government an opportunity to tweak its policies. Authorities should make appropriate decisions to remove unnecessary barriers, paving the way for an increase in tolerance and trust, which would help heal the wounds caused by natural disasters.

A timely and substantial reconstruction plan for people like Vung and Sinh will help soothe the gaping economic wounds suffered by the central region, sustain growth and lead to a sustainable development vision for the country.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

VnExpress’s Hope Foundation is soliciting emergency support for people in central Vietnam, whose lives have been impacted by severe floods and landslides since earlier this month.

When the floodwaters rose on October 12 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Hoang Thi Phuong, a textile worker in Phong Dien District, went into labor.

Her husband tried to take her to hospital, but their motorbike could not cross a flooded section of National Highway 1A. In desperation, he asked a person with a boat to take his wife to the other side.

But the boat capsized just 20 meters from safety. Both Phuong and her unborn baby died.

""I killed you,"" her husband sobbed inconsolably, down on his knees in front of the raging floods that had snatched away his loved ones.

They are not the only victims of the tragedy that has befallen central Vietnam in the last two weeks. Dozens of others, including at least two hydropower plant workers and 13 members of a rescue team, lost their lives to landslides in Thua Thien-Hue.

In the last 10 days nonstop rain and floods have submerged entire regions under a sea of water and triggered massive landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of thousands of houses have been engulfed, and the death toll has been rising relentlessly.

Thousands of families face food and water shortages, and the floods do not seem likely to recede any time soon.

As fighters on the frontlines in a battle against nature, soldiers, doctors, rescuers, and thousands of others have had to take on the harsh and unrelenting elements.

What they need right now are boats, medicines, food, clothes, rescue equipment, and other supplies.

The Hope Foundation by VnExpress and FPT is calling for emergency support for millions of people in central Vietnam. We are soliciting help from every person and every section of the community, and trying to find the quickest way to help those in need right now.

Highlights

From October 6th, the Central region observed prolonged heavy rains that caused severe and widespread flooding and landslides. Water levels have risen rapidly flooding large areas in the provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

In response, the Government of Viet Nam: i) Conducted daily meetings of the Central Steering Committee of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (CCNDPC); ii) Sent missions to the affected provinces to provide concrete guidance, support and coordination; iii) Released a call for emergency relief and support, sent to international organizations; iv) Is planning to hold a meeting convening the Disaster Risk Reduction Partnership, on Monday 19th to discuss and coordinate international support.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539933-Flash%20Update%20No.%201%20-%20Viet%20Nam%20Floods.png?itok=aGT5G35x,"['storms', 'update', 'nam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'quang', 'viet', 'coordinator', 'provinces', 'issued', 'office', 'floods', 'river', 'sent', 'resident', 'support', 'tri']", ,flood
80,80,FL-2018-000416-VNM,One million swamped by deadly floods as Viet Nam faces another major storm - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/one-million-swamped-deadly-floods-viet-nam-faces-another-major-storm,"Kuala Lumpur/Hanoi/Geneva, October 14, 2020 – Close to a million people have been severely affected by prolonged flooding in central Viet Nam as the country faces another major tropical storm and further dangerous floods.

Red Cross holds grave fears that deadly floods, which have submerged the country’s central provinces over recent days, will worsen as tropical storm Nangka makes landfall today, bringing destructive winds and dumping more rain on hard hit communities.

Since the floods began in early October, at least 28 people have been killed, more than 200,000 homes flooded and an estimated 84,000 hectares of crops damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people – many cut off by the floodwater – are now in desperate need of emergency relief.

As part of a coordinated relief effort, Viet Nam Red Cross staff and volunteers have been accessing isolated communities by boat to provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and other much needed supplies. More relief supplies are urgently being brought in from other parts of the country.

Mr Hoa Nguyen, Deputy Director of External Relations and Development, Viet Nam Red Cross, said: “Our volunteers and staff have been working in the affected areas since the floods began, providing relief supplies to thousands of people, but we need to reach many more as the rain continues and floods worsen. Every day we hear of more families who have lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods.”

Hung Ha Nguyen, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator said: “These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods.”

“Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities, especially on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need to help ensure families receive the relief they need in the coming days and weeks,” Mr Hung Ha said.

So far, at least 235 people have died or been listed missing after the floods and landslides triggered by storms and heavy rains in central Vietnam last month, the government informed the National Assembly Tuesday.

Among the casualties were 35 military officers and soldiers of two different military teams sent on search and rescue missions after landslides hit several districts in the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri.

The region suffered historic flooding, with the peak time falling between October 12 and 19. Floodwaters inundated the homes of 317,000 families with 1.2 million members from Nghe An to Quang Nam, with many areas being flooded for nearly two weeks.

Over 200,000 houses were seriously damaged. Many public construction projects also suffered heavy damage and roads were heavily eroded.

Of the total damage of VND17 trillion, VND10 trillion ($430.16 million) was caused by Molave, one of the most powerful storms to hit Vietnam, the government said.

The storm made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28, causing heavy rains and deadly landslides in the central region.

Earlier, the government granted over VND1 trillion, over 11,500 tons of rice and other essential items in relief support for the worst-hit central provinces.

Not over

The government said it would continue to mobilize all forces to search for the victims buried in several landslides and fishermen missing at sea. Among the missing are 12 hydropower plant workers in Thua Thien-Hue Province who were hit by a landslide on October 12, 19 residents in Quang Nam Province hit by two landslides as an impact of Storm Molave last week, and 23 fishermen from Binh Dinh Province whose boats sank in rough sea as the storm was near.

Priority in relief support will be given to those in worst-hit localities and isolated areas and to quickly repairing infrastructure and public construction works damaged by storms and floods, the parliament was told.

The government is also joining forces with local authorities to evacuate residents from high risk areas as storm Goni, the 10th storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, heads towards south-central Vietnam.

International forecasting agencies expect the storm to directly affect the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.

Natural disasters, predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

The reason is that the annual flooding of Vietnam's Mekong Delta from the upstream Mekong before reaching the sea no longer occurs.

Not far away, in Vinh Hoi Dong Commune in An Phu, Phan Van Lang, 54, was standing in front of his house.

Since they live in an area hit by annual flooding, Lang and his neighbors have their houses built well above the ground. His house is nearly three meters in the air with a flight of the stairs leading up from the road. In 2000, for instance, the floodwater almost reached the house. But ever since the flooding levels have kept decreasing.

Pointing at the road in front of his house, he says the entire road would have been under one meter of water at this time of the year but this year, the water has not even reached the road.

Hung Dien Commune in Long An Province's Tan Hung District, 80 km (50 miles) away, has been witnessing the clearest change.

In the past its paddy fields would have waters reaching waist high and be filled with water lilies and boats would be the only means of getting around.

That scene now exists only in the memories of seniors.

Bay De, 53, who has been fishing for more than 30 years, recalls floods when catching up to 200 kg of various kinds of fish every day and earning a million dong ($40) was a ""piece of cake.""

For several weeks now he has not caught any fish. He spends almost every day drinking tea and chatting with neighbors in his thatched house.

Fifty kilometers away, Tran Van Thanh, 58, of Tan Lap Commune in Moc Hoa District is fixing traps for catching crabs.

He has been doing this for dozens of years, a job that has ensured a decent livelihood, but that has changed.

""I used to set up more than 600 traps during the flood season, but only a few tens of them these days because the flood waters are way too low and there are no crabs to catch.""

In the neighboring province of Dong Thap, Nguyen Van Phuong, 42, of Tan Thanh A Commune in Tan Hong District is watching the news on TV for possible information about the floods, something he has been looking forward to for several weeks now.

He has an eight-hectare rice field and has been waiting for the floods to come so that he could start sowing the winter-spring crop.

There was heavy rain a few weeks ago, and water had filled up canals and then reached the fields. Phuong, thinking the floods had finally arrived, hired people to till the soil.

But soon a scorching sun replaced the rains and water dropped, leaving the field dry and cracked once again.

He says: ""I had spent VND750,000 ($32.44) per hectare, but that has been a wasted effort. Now I have to wait for the floodwaters to come and do that all over again.""

In his neighborhood, farmers are now worried that if the floods do not come or are low, they would have to shell out money to pump water from canals into their fields.

Rice farmers in the delta have for generations depended on the floodwaters to come and inundate their fields before sow seeds directly.

The Plain of Reeds, a wetland straddling Long An and Dong Thap provinces, produces more than two million tons of rice a year.

The floods usually start coming in late July or early August and remain until November or even later to bless the region with extraordinary fertility as they typically deposit silt from upstream areas.

When they do not come or arrive late, cropping and fishing activities are disrupted.

For several years now they have been late or deficient, and experts have been blaming this on climate change and the construction of a series of dams in the upstream area.

According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, this year’s floodwater level in the delta will be only 55 percent of the long-term average, which translates into a shortfall of 130 billion cubic meters.

It will be 15 percent lower than last year’s level and the lowest in a decade, it has warned.

Late last year the highest water levels in the upstream areas of the delta were 1.12-2 meters lower than the long-term average and 1-1.65 meters lower than in the previous year.

The delta suffered the worst salinity levels and resultant freshwater shortage in 100 years but meteorologists warn things could get worse.

Tran Tan Tai, deputy head of the agriculture department of Long An’s Tan Hung District, says the water level in his hometown is currently 1.4 meters, or 80 centimeters lower than a year ago.

""If there are no floods, the fields will lack silt, and pathogens and wild grass seeds will not be washed away, and farmers will have to spend more on pesticide and fertilizers.""

Meteorologists expect the floods to come around the middle of this month, stay low and ebb away quickly.

Those were the days

Early one morning in late September, Muoi, 64, of Tan Lap rides a motorbike to a wet market two kilometers away from home. He returned after a while with a bag of barb.

""All my life I have seen fish all over the place every time it is the flooding season, but now I have to go buy them... Isn’t it weird?""

Not far from his home a neighbor had set up a lift net the previous night, but until around noon the next day, when Muoi returned from the market, it had only around two kilograms of fish.

Muoi can never forget what it was like one or two decades ago: Every year when the flood season arrived, water would be everywhere, covering the fields and even the streets. People would be rowing boats, picking water lilies and river hemp, both used to make specialty dishes of the region.

In the water, there would be so much fish that anyone could become a fisherman without having to learn any skills.

""Back then people did not weigh fish in kilograms but in a unit of around 20 kilograms. Normally, in one night a family could catch at least five to seven of that unit. Some would even feed the fish to their pigs.""

In years of heavy flooding fish moving down stream into the delta would breed along the way, and it would be extremely rare to see a field or waterway without fish in it.

Fishermen would enlarge the holes in their net to only catch adult fish, leaving the young ones untouched.

When the floods retreated, mud, algae and water lilies would be left in the paddy fields. The fields mud would be silt while the algae and flowers served as organic fertilizers, leaving the fields with all the nutrition they needed.

Besides, the floods would wash away the pathogens and wild grass seeds, and it was not common for farmers to use fertilizers or pesticides.

A kilometer away from Muoi’s place, Danh Van Minh, 62, asks his son to take him by motorbike to a house nearby. The house stands along a canal and in front is a concrete road around three meters wide.

""This used to be a small dirt road, and every year during this season it would be two or three meters under water,"" Minh says.

""The house used to be just a hut beside which I would anchor my boat after fishing.""

Minh’s life has been filled with tragedy. He lost his first wife and two of his children during two different flood seasons.

In the middle of the 1991 season his wife had twins, but both died at birth due to lack of medical care in that rural area.

Worse still the floods covered every inch of land that they could not find a place to bury the children. All he could do was put their bodies in a coffin, stick a bamboo pole in the water and hang the coffin up that.

Only a month after they passed away could he give them a proper burial.

Five years after they lost the twins, Minh’s wife suddenly fell sick and died. Once again he could not bury her immediately, and had to leave her body inside a coffin on the family boat and leave it anchored next to the hut.

In the past 20 years the delta has witnessed several floods that left a significant impact on its residents, especially in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2011.

The 2000 floods were the most severe in 70 years, with the water rising to 4.78 meters. They claimed 481 lives and caused losses of nearly VND4 trillion.

As told by Le Thanh Tam, party chief of Long An Province in 1999-2005, 20 years ago and further, the Plain of Reeds had heavy floods almost every year.

The region had not yet got an embankment system, and every time it flooded there was no way to tell where the road was and where the canal was. The only way people could move around was by boat.

""Back then we always had fish, shrimps and crabs in abundance, but we would lose lives every year, and of children in most cases.

""When the floods retreated, we had to expend a lot of effort to rebuild houses and roads.""

But a 2017 study by the Mekong River Commission estimated that the flooding provides $8-10 billion in annual economic benefits while causing losses of just $60-70 million.

The Mekong River flows through six countries, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before reaching the sea.

Many parts of the Mekong Delta were formed by sedimentation over eons.

When the Vietnamese expanded their nation to the south, they began to conquer the delta in the 18th century. For generations, no other place in the nation could compare with it as a agriculture and aquaculture hub.

In his book ‘Last days of the Mighty Mekong’ published in February last year, Brian Eyler, director of the Asia Program at U.S. think tank Stimson Center, writes: ""For the past 3,000 years, the Mekong carried about 150 million tons of sediment in its system to the delta each year.""

Without the sedimentation, the delta’s land would fall apart under natural conditions, which are worsened by intense groundwater extraction and sea level rise, he says.

He strongly condemns China’s dam building in the upstream areas of the Mekong for holding back floodwaters and, along with them, sediments.

Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent researcher into the ecology of the Mekong Delta, says the main cause of the low floods this year is the El Nino phenomenon that lasted from the year’s beginning to the end of August, resulting in scanty rain fall in the region.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the rainy season arrived late last year and was shorter than usual, with the result that rainfall was 8 percent below normal at 1,240 mm.

Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of Can Tho University’s Research Institute of Climate Change, says the calamity faced by the delta cannot be blamed just on nature or Chinese dams.

""Sea levels rise and the Earth gets warmer. Yes. But that happens just a little each year and it needs a long period for dramatic changes. It is humans who have accelerated that process.""

He cites one example of human action that changed the delta’s hydrological profile. Ever since the delta was formed, it has had several low-lying areas like the Long Xuyen quadrilateral in Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and Can Tho City and the Plain of Reeds that worked as natural reservoirs to store the seasonal floodwaters, he explains.

For generations farmers did not use them for cultivation, but due to the wars, the nation had to consider food security, and built embankments to keep the seasonal floodwaters from flowing into them and directed the water toward the sea, he says.

""Now in peace time, we still have the mindset of growing as much rice as we can, and many have treated the seasonal floods as a disaster for their paddy fields while in fact it is a blessing.

""With that thinking, many have continued to keep out the floods, going against nature, thus intensifying the lack of water once it took hold in the region.""

Minh, who has been a poor farmer his entire life and is haunted by a tragic past related to the floods, does not care much for the explanations experts like Tuan have to offer.

After his wife’s death, he took his son to another village, remarried and built a new life.

He now owns a 6,000 sq.m rice field and both his home and field are surrounded by embankments, allowing him and others in his neighborhood to go against nature and cultivate three instead of just two rice crops as in the past.

The field does not have any time to recover, and instead of getting floodwaters that wash it clean and deposit sediments, it has to do with plant protection chemicals instead.

With this method of growing rice, farmers remain mired in poverty since they have to spend money on fertilizers and pesticides for every crop and also lose out on an abundant source of fish, shrimp and crab and the plants that always grow in the flood season.

""My children and grandchildren have all taken turns to leave,"" Minh says, reflecting the trend of delta dwellers abandoning their hometown for Ho Chi Minh City and other industrial areas, where they work in factories or the service sector.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/05/lu-dong-thap-muoi-2300-1601345-2309-7479-1601885014_1200x0.jpg,"['continue', 'annual', 'field', 'water', 'dry', 'flooding', 'floods', 'delta', 'anguish', 'mekong', 'fields', 'season', 'away', 'fish', 'deltas']", ,flood

Highways in the provinces have also been severely damaged, with the total cost of repairs estimated at around VND 355 billion, state media said, citing figures provided by the Directorate of Roads of Vietnam on Oct. 21.

Also on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung and deputies of Vietnam’s National Assembly welcomed efforts by Vietnamese pop star Thuy Tien to collect more than VND 100 billion (U.S. $15,316,811) for relief work in flood-hit Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue.

Large-scale fundraising is normally restricted by law to state organizations or social associations to reduce the risk of personal gain, with penalties prescribed for violations. But National Assembly deputy Le Thanh Vanh voiced confidence in the work of Thuy Tien and her staff.

“They are ready to take responsibility before the sponsors who donated the funds,” Vanh said, quoted on Oct. 21 in state media reports. “I am sure they will be completely transparent,” he said.

Relief teams have poured for the last few days into central regions hit by floods and landslides that have destroyed roads and buried workers at a hydropower plant and soldiers at a military barracks, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told state media on Wednesday.

Many areas have already received help, while others remain cut off because of damaged roads, Dung said, calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to send more teams to reach remote areas and give further support to those already helped.

34 now killed in Cambodia

Relief work meanwhile continues in Cambodia, where 34 people have now been killed by floods to date, with Prime Minister Hun Sen urging local authorities to guard damaged homes to prevent looting and calling on banks and other lending institutions to delay or reduce payments owed to them by villagers impoverished by the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 has hit us hard for the last 10 months, and now we are facing floods that are destroying us,” Hun Sen said.

“We have not concluded our damage assessments yet. For now, we are just working to rescue people and take them to safer areas,” he said.

Around 10,000 families have already been safely evacuated from flood-hit areas, Cambodian media sources say.

Speaking to RFA, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha said that flood waters are now receding in several provinces, including Oddor Meanchey, Pursat, Takeo, Pailin, Kampong Speu, Stung Treng, and the two hardest-hit provinces of Banteay Meahchey and Battambang.

The 34 flood deaths reported so far reflect the inability of central government and local authorities to deal effectively with the disaster, said Kean Ponlok, secretary general of the Cambodia Intellectual Students Alliance.

“The authorities must look into the causes of these deaths and hold themselves responsible,” he said, adding that because of corruption in Cambodia, he is not convinced that all donations handed over to the government will be spent on victims of the floods.

Banteay Meanchey villager Nay Thoeun said she has now lost her home and job because of the floods and is debt after borrowing money from a bank to buy medicine to treat the tuberculosis to which she was exposed in her family.

“I am very worried. I’m living now under a shelter on a hill, but the water is still rising here, and I’m afraid of [venomous insects].”

“I’m urgently calling for aid to be delivered to this hill. There are many poor families here,” she said.

Flood begins to recede in Laos

In Laos, flood waters have begun to recede from eight districts in Savannakhet province, where 125 villages containing 5,134 families, or nearly 30,000 people, have been affected, Lao media sources say.

In the province’s Sepon district alone, 40 villages containing nearly a thousand households have been flooded, with many houses completely destroyed, sources said.

Sepon’s La Or and Vang Khot villages were hardest hit, with 44 houses swept away, and another 90 dwellings hit by fast-running floods and partly damaged, a district official said on Oct. 21.

“The district is still asking for help, but we will set up temporary refuges in the villages for people to live in,” the official said, adding that funds are being sought for building materials such as roofs and nails for the construction of temporary shelters.

Fast-rising water hit one village on Oct. 18 and swept away 28 or 29 houses, leaving nothing to come back to when villagers returned two days later, one villager said. “Now we have no place to stay in but the schools, and no one has any clothing. We are waiting to see how the authorities plan to handle this.”

“We are all in a very poor condition. We have no rice to eat, and all our rice fields are flooded. We will have to buy all the rice that we eat next year,” he said.

“The water is receding now, but the villagers’ houses are damaged beyond repair, and nothing can be restored. There is no thought of fixing them now,” a rescue team member said, adding that many residents of Sepon and other districts are still cut off because of damage to the roads.

Though Lao authorities had moved quickly to help victims of the floods, more help is needed, an NGO official said, asking that neither he nor his organization be named. “For a start, we urgently need dry food and drinking water, clothes, rice, and many other things, as so many houses have been swept away.”

“The authorities did go down to do everything they could, but there are just too many villagers to help,” he said.

Many residents in areas of Sepon and Phin districts are still out of reach, a Sepon district official said. “We are still unable to get to almost half of the areas affected by the floods because the roads have been cut off by landslides,” he said.

Losses in Savannakhet including houses damaged, livestock drowned, and paddy fields destroyed are still being calculated, the official Vientiane Times said on Oct. 21.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguy?n Thái H?p celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vu?t Lu C?ng Ð?ng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p, the bishop of Hà Tinh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghia, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Ngu?n N?y River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tinh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghia, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Ð?n.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_festaOK.JPG,"['tinh', 'h?p', 'centre', 'build', 'bishop', 'thái', 'hà', 'catholics', 'flood', 'work', 'nguy?n', 'local', 'community', 'paul', 'house', 'tiên', 'victims']", ,flood

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan donated US$400,000 on Friday (Oct. 23) to Vietnam in aid after the country suffered the severest floods and landslides in decades.

Richard Shih (???), Taiwan’s representative in Vietnam, said the Taiwanese business community in Vietnam, as well as non-governmental organizations from Taiwan, have mobilized themselves to send relief to the stricken areas in the country's central region. He said he hoped the victims will be able to reconstruct their homes and return to a normal life as soon as possible.

As of Friday, the series of floods and landslides have killed at least 114 people, and 20 people remain missing. Among those who lost their lives are dozens of military personnel who were deployed to search for those who had gone missing in previous disasters.

The Vietnamese military said it has suffered the most serious casualties in peacetime. In addition to the loss of lives, hundreds and thousands of houses were wiped out in central Vietnam, including Quang Tri and Thua Thien Huei provinces, and schools and other facilities have been forced to close.

Tran Quang Hoai, an official responsible for coordinating Vietnam’s rescue missions, accepted Taiwan's donation on behalf of the Vietnamese government at a ceremony on Friday. He remarked that the government is grateful for the generosity of the Taiwanese authorities and people, and that it will make the most appropriate arrangement for the donation so that relief and aid can be distributed to those in need soon, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

MOFA said via a statement that more than 320,000 Vietnamese migrant workers and new immigrants are living in Taiwan, and that the people of the two countries have been more than good partners.

87,87,FL-2018-000416-VNM,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hardest', 'flooded', 'water', 'change', 'infrastructure', 'flood', 'flooding', 'region', 'floods', 'global', 'risk', 'river', 'hits', 'asia', 'climate']", ,flood

The bodies of two people were recovered on Saturday evening, while one remains missing.

The Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Van Ban District reported that the sudden floods affected 25 households, with furniture, motorbikes and construction materials damaged.

Two houses were swept away and dozens of others were damaged.

Prime Minister Ph?m Minh Chính issued a dispatch asking localities to focus resources on dealing with the consequences of floods and heavy rain in the northern mountainous region since Friday.

In the dispatch to the people’s committees of the six northern mountainous provinces of Lai Chau, Yen Bai, Son La, Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang, the Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control, National Committee for Disaster Response and Search and Rescue, and relevant ministries and agencies, the PM extended his condolences to families of the victims, and asked the local authorities to help locals fix houses and clean the environment, and provide them with food and essential goods.

He also asked the localities to keep a close watch on developments of flooding and rain, and to review and assess the safety of homes, especially in areas at high risk of flash floods and landslides, while preparing forces, vehicles, and equipment to deal with any circumstances.

The media will continue to provide information on developments of the natural disaster, damage, and response efforts, according to the dispatch.

The recent, devastating floods highlight the fragility of the country's natural environment. Deforestation, expanded farming, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric dams are the main culprits. In four years, 7,300 hectares of forest have been lost. So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built with another 450 on their way.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) – Recent floods in Vietnam caused by typhoons and tropical storms have had a devastating impact in terms of lost human lives, environmental damage, and economic dislocations, highlighting the fragility of the Asian country's environment.

Frequent and violent weather events worry both environmentalists and the affected communities more and more.

According to Vietnam’s Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, the main factor is deforestation and the conversion of entire forests to farmland, timber harvesting, and the large dam and hydroelectric plant construction.

Among the most affected areas are the central coastal region and the central Highlands, scene of the recent devastations.

The General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control estimates that some 7,300 hectares of forest land were lost between 2016 and 2019, with an annual average of 1,800.

At the current rate of deforestation, if nothing is done to slow this down, the risk of floods and landslides will increase considerably, along with periods of drought and loss of mangroves.

Environmentalists and experts note that the life and survival of Highland communities are closely linked to local forests.

From the central part of the country to the Mekong River Delta in the south, forests play a leading role in regulating local ecosystems, biodiversity, water resources, and the climate of much of the country.

For Prof Nguy?n Ng?c Lung, forests are key to blocking winds, limiting soil erosion and containing the devastating force of storms. In addition, tree roots absorb excess water.

Deforestation contributes to climate change, global warming, drought, rising water levels, pollution, and famine.

In view of the situation, the General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, noting that the country has recently had to face between 10 and 15 floods.

The blame goes to extensive “legal and illegal” deforestation to expand farmland, harvest timber or build crucial hydro-electric plants to meet the country’s energy needs.

So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built and another 450 are in the planning phase with further devastating impact on the environment.

Some see these plants as ""water bombs"" ready to strike at the population. Their effects are visible in many parts of the country, including Da Lat, a city that is located about 1,500 metres above sea level and a major tourist destination, with its almost year-round cool and temperate climate.

Since 2012, the city has been hit by flooding with increasing frequency, to the extent that today, when rain is intense, many parts of the city and Lam Dong province ""end up submerged by water"".

Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc Thanh.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Vietnam has given $540,000 in immediate support to women and girls in six central provinces affected by flooding.

UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of hygiene items and maternal health equipment. It is also supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services.

The central region has suffered unprecedented flooding from prolonged downpours and successive typhoons since October 6, resulting in at least 230 people dead or missing. Storm Molave hit the region on October 28, reportedly one of the strongest in 20 years.

At least 5.5 million people in the region have been affected, including more than 1.3 million women of reproductive age, over 92,000 of them pregnant mothers, who need uninterrupted services for pregnancy and menstruation, UNFPA said.

According to joint rapid assessment led by UNFPA last week, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programs such as antenatal, delivery, post-natal care and family planning services have been disrupted.

As a result, local women are unable to manage their hygiene properly and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear needed to manage menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and places to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged, the organization explained.

On October 12, a 35-year-old pregnant mother living in Phong Dien District of Thua Thien-Hue Province died on her way to give birth.

She entered labor in the morning, with her husband hiring a boat to take her to a local medical center for delivery. However, the boat was upturned and she was swept away by floodwater.

Her husband and local residents tried to look for her, but failed because of the fast-flowing current. Her body was found in the afternoon.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA representative in Vietnam, said: ""When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousands of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable.

The National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on Monday afternoon that the low pressure out in the north of the South China Sea (known in Vietnam as the East Sea) had strengthened into a typhoon internationally known as Nangka.

Nangka is forecast to make landfall in the north-central part of Vietnam on Wednesday, while the accompanying rains could cover the central region already battered by torrential downpours over the last few days.

The centre forecast that central provinces would face heavy rains ranging from 150 to 300mm on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control issued an urgent letter on Monday asking the bureau to closely supervise the development of the low pressure system and issue warnings to localities and ships.

Authorities also instructed boats and ships to find safe habour and to take measures to ensure the safety of local people and tourists on islands and in coastal areas.

The Foreign Ministry was also asked to contact countries and territories to ask for shelter for Vietnamese fishermen.

The ongoing downpour, exacerbated by Typhoon Linfa which hit the central region on Sunday morning before weakening to a low pressure area, destroyed a total of 382 houses and flooded 109,034 others, and damaged 108 sections of national highways and 8.6km of provincial highways.

The disaster caused big losses to agricultural production by destroying 584ha of rice, 3,879ha of vegetable, 2,141ha of aquaculture, whilst killing about 150,700 cattle and poultry.

In Danang, many communes were submerged by rising floods worsened by water discharged from hydropower reservoirs.

As of 7am on Monday morning, the communes of Hòa Phong, Hòa Nhon, Hòa Liên, Hòa Khuong, Hòa Châu and Hòa Ti?n were badly submerged, affecting the lives of 3,000 local households in 38 hamlets.

In the mountainous districts of Hoà Vang, Liên Chi?u and C?m L?, there was high risk of flash floods and landslides.

At present, 882 households in typhoon-affected areas have been moved to safer areas.

Meanwhile, people in the central province of Th?a Thiên-Hu? are entering their fifth day of flooding and heavy rain.

Rainfall of over 1,000mm flooded areas near the B? River, badly affecting to districts of Phong Ði?n and Qu?ng Ði?n, as well as Huong Trà Township.

Local people have been suffering from food shortages due to disrupted transport.

Hoàng Sinh, a resident of Phong Hi?n Commune, told Vietnam News Agency that his family’s food reserves were running due to the prolonged rain and flooding, and they were down to a few packs of instant noodles and rice.

Tr?n Ð?c Thi?n, chairman of Phong Hi?n Commune, said the local government was trying to reach local households to supply food, drink and medicine.

“The floods surged rapidly and people in low-lying areas could not keep up. Water spilled into their houses submerging them up to one metre,” said Tr?n Van Hoàn from Huong Trà Township.

“The whole family had to move to a neighbour's house. For several days, we only had instant noodles to survive,” said Hoàn.

“This is the worst flood since 2006. It has badly affected 70 per cent of local people,” said Ph?m Công Phu?c, vice chairman of Qu?ng Thái Commune.

The provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Rescue reported that as of 6pm on Sunday, three people had died, while seven were injured and another was missing.

Nineteen houses had, and 53,385 houses and 360ha of crops had been flooded.

More than 100km of coastline from Huong River across Huong Th? Commune and Huong Trà Township was severely damaged by erosion. About 300m of the dyke in Qu?ng Phú Commune, Qu?ng Ði?n District was also hit.

In Hu?, more than 50 per cent of roads in 27 wards and 2,560 houses were flooded as of Monday morning.

In Qu?ng Tr? Province, the flooding dramatically increased on Monday morning.

The downpour made the water in the Th?ch Hãn and Ô Lâu rivers reach alert levels.

The river water levels were forecast to continue rising today and next days.

To cope with the situation, Qu?ng Tr? authorities have asked the central Government to supply materials and rescue equipment, including two amphibious vehicles, 27 boats, rescue equipment and chemicals for disinfection.

The week-long rain killed six and injured two in the province, with a further six reported missing in the province.

Hue, Vietnam — Every day for the last four months, Duong Thi Mong has carried food, pots, dishes and other utensils on her shoulders to walk nearly 5 kilometers daily from her house to a nearby village, where she serves com hen (rice mixed with mussel, a popular traditional dish) to local people on streets of Thua Thien Hue province. Mong, a Buddhist from Hue's Vi Da ward in central Vietnam, which is famous for its mussels, said she usually takes her boat to carry food over the Huong River then walks only 600 meters to her destination. However, her boat was wiped out in severe flooding after six tropical storms hit the central provinces in October and November. The 56-year-old mother of two said she earns 80,000 to 100,000 dong ($3.50 to $4.30) per day to support her family, not enough money to buy a new boat. She said she had to work harder and sell food at night to get money to prepare food for the celebration of Tet, or Lunar New Year. Local markets closed for the weeklong traditional festival Feb. 10 ahead of the New Year, which starts Feb. 12. Thankfully, sisters across Vietnam have stepped in to help Mong and others like her.

""I am excited for the nuns who offered me 10 million dong [$435] on Jan. 28. I will use the money to buy a new boat for my work soon,"" Mong said cheerfully, adding that the boat is really a lifeboat that will help save her energy so she can work longer and earn more money to put food on the table. Sr. Maria Truong Thi Minh Yen of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate said her community provided boats for 12 people who lost their boats during the severe floods that left many people nothing in their wake. Yen, who serves Tan Thuy Parish, said she called on benefactors for donations. ""We do want to provide local flood victims with longer-term help so that they can stand on their own feet and return to normal life soon,"" she said. Many victims do not have enough money to be able to purchase basic means of doing their jobs. The 69-year-old nun said her convent gives clothes, blankets, rice and medicine to more than 100 street people, migrants, boat people and slum dwellers on a regular basis. Many live in makeshift shelters while others stay in low-rent, stuffy lodgings as their properties were washed away by flooding. ""They have suffered much from the last natural disasters and the chilly weather this year,"" Yen said. The temperature fell to 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January in the tropical area.

Yen, member of the Hue Archdiocese's committee representing local women religious orders, said some local congregations have built and repaired 40 victims' homes at a total cost of 1 billion dong ($43,000). Luong The Thien from Phu Hiep ward said he built a new house in January after he received 65 million dong from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. His old 40-square-meter house was damaged in the floods. Thien, a 54-year-old Buddhist, said he could not afford to rebuild his house as he works as a motorbike taxi driver to support his wife, who has lung cancer, and three children. ""We are happy to celebrate the Tet festival in the dream house. We are extremely grateful for the nuns' generous help that benefits our life long-term,"" he said, adding that according to tradition, people cannot be well-established in their careers until they have stable homes.

Thien said he has had a good relationship with the nuns since he took a nun from a local hospital to her convent in 2008. The nuns regularly visit his family, and his children receive a monthly scholarship from them. Nguyen The Thieu, a Buddhist from Cau Nhi village, said he is among seven local families who received money to repair their storm-damaged houses. His Catholic son-in-law introduced him to the nuns. ""We have received humanitarian aid seven times from sisters and Catholic benefactors, and we gradually overcame the hard times,"" the 78-year-old father of four said.

As of Wednesday morning, northern Vinh Phuc Province had reported two fatalities while Lao Cai, Son La, Lai Chau and Thai Nguyen claimed one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.

The committee said at least four others were injured.

Since last Sunday, northern provinces have been battered by torrential downpours due to the influence of a tropical convergence zone and effects from tropical storm Higos, which made landfall on China’s southern coast Wednesday morning.

Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Ha Giang and Tuyen Giang experienced heavy rainfall of up to 300 mm each downpour while Quang Ninh, home to world famous Ha Long Bay, and Hai Phong City received rainfall of between 200 and 350 mm each time. Levels of 180 mm a day are considered heavy.

At least 334 houses in the localities were damaged. Over 550 ha of rice and other crops were inundated while landslides blocked many roads leading to northern mountainous provinces like Lai Chau and Lao Cai, home to popular Sa Pa Town.

Weather forecasters warned northern provinces should expect heavy downpours with rainfall of between 100 and 250 mm from Thursday to Saturday due to the impacts of Higos.

Tran Quang Hoai, vice head of the committee, asked northern authorities to deploy rescue teams and evacuate residents in flood-prone areas.

Higos is the fourth storm formed in the East Sea this year.

The waters, known internationally as the South China Sea, could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, half of them directly affecting the country, meteorologists said.

Natural disasters, including drought, floods and landslides, killed 133 Vietnamese last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In the first half of this year, natural disasters killed 47 people and caused economic damages of VND3.3 trillion, according to official data.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/08/19/a9f5d4e442a7abf9f2b6-159782323-4253-6860-1597823279_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'flood', 'provinces', 'tropical', 'hit', 'heavy', 'rainfall', 'mm', 'committee', 'cai', 'killed', 'northern', 'ha']", ,flood_and_drought

The United Nations Population Fund in Vietnam will provide an additional $800,000 to support women and girls affected by flooding in eight central provinces and cities.

It brings the UNFPA's total support to $1.34 million. In October it had given $540,000.

The support includes setting up mobile and outreach health care clinics and the distribution of dignity kits with essential hygiene items and vital maternal health equipment and supplies.

Between early October and mid-November the central region and parts of the Central Highlands were hit by a succession of storms that brought torrential rains, resulting in severe flooding and landslides.

At least 192 people were killed and 57 others are still listed missing, and losses amounted to VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), the government said.

Around 5.5 million people have been affected, including over 1.3 million women of reproductive age and more than 92,000 pregnant women, the UNFPA said.

The disaster forced women and girls into shelters without having the time to pack essential supplies, and many lack basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear that are needed to manage their menstrual periods, it said, adding that access to water and places to wash, dry reusable pads and clothes and dispose of used materials are lacking.

Routine public health programs such as antenatal, child birth, post-natal care, and family planning services have been disrupted.

The government provided VND770 billion for emergency relief.

Many international organizations and countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Australia also provided aid.","Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/08/huukhoaduadeolethuy51603180554-1148-5001-1607411128_1200x0.jpg,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'rains', 'health', 'girls', 'flooding', 'central', 'agency', '800000', 'women', 'pregnant', 'million', 'support', 'provided']", ,floood

On the night of October 11, Le Trung Lam, a resident of the central town, braved the floods to go and pick up some migrant students who had been marooned in their inundated home for days. He took them to his company on Ngu Binh Street, An Tay Ward, where 30 people were already sheltering.

They cook in the kitchen and eat three meals a day, and also have blankets, mattresses and electricity.

Three days earlier, many students from other places now studying in Hue, had no idea where to shelter as the floodwaters rose relentlessly and inundated their homes. Then Lam's message arrived out of the blue.

He said: ""The company's headquarters, a five-floor building, is situated on Ngu Binh Mountain, and so the water has not reached it yet. Its two top floors have 10 rooms each that can accommodate 20-30 people.""

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential downpours in central Vietnam for a week now have killed 29 as of Tuesday morning. Among the deaths, six are from Thua Thien-Hue Province, home to Hue.

Lam, 33, decided to turn his company into a shelter on October 8 as the waters reached some major roads and were expected to rise further. Driving around the town to check on the flood situation and how people were coping, he passed by the studio apartment where he himself had lived 15 years ago as a migrant student from central Nghe An Province. He too had suffered during flooding.

Fearing for students who were possibly cut off, he posted an announcement that he was willing to shelter people.

In the last few days he has received hundreds of calls from people seeking help. Since the neighborhood still has access to electricity and the market remains open, Lam's employees have been able to buy food and cook meals.

Lam said he would take care of the students until the floods receded.

If the water level keeps rising, he plans to also use the main hall which can hold 500 people.

Le Thi Anh Ngoc, 19, from the central Quang Binh Province, said she walked on flooded streets for more than an hour to reach Lam's place on the morning of October 11.

""I arrived in Hue four days ago. I did not know who would help us before I learned about Lam.""

Six kilometers away from the company, on Tung Thien Vuong Street, Ngo Thi Kim Loan is busy making 500 banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich, with the help of a few others to send to people stranded on Hen Dune and Han Mac Tu Street.

Loan, who regularly does charity, always has instant noodles at home. Three days ago, seeing the rising water levels, she gave away 100 boxes of them to households in her neighborhood facing difficulties.

On October 12 she cooked 40 kilograms of rice for people living in areas where power has been turned off due to the floods.

The owner of a noodles restaurant also posted on her Facebook page that families with children or old people could command shelter at her home.

In the evening, when Loan sent 300 banh mi to households on Hen, Le Quoc Phong, Loan's neighbor, 40, was eating dinner under an oil lamp. The island in the middle of the Huong River was cut off by the rising waters.

Phong volunteered to help distribute food to those in need. Finishing his meal, he quickly got on a boat to take the banh mi to people before dinner time was over.

Distributing food and offering accommodation are Hue people’s way of supporting people affected by the floods.

Dozens of families living in higher places said they are ready to take in people whose houses are flooded and provide instant noodles to those who need them.

Free food distribution centers have been set up in downtown areas in the last few days, but are accessible only to people living nearby because of the situation.

People are also helping their fellows facing a threat of losing their livelihoods.

Over several days, strong winds and torrential rains caused huge damage, submerging homes, wiping out farmland, killing and sweeping away cattle. The Diocese of Hà Tinh, along with Caritas and the Catholic Business Association brought donations.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) - Strong winds and torrential rain over several days have caused flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 37 so far. Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên Hu? and Qu?ng Nam are the most affected provinces.

Heavy rains from 10 to 13 October inundated residential areas, farmland and roads, causing huge damages to people and property.

The General Department of Disaster Prevention reported that, in addition to the 37 deaths, at least 50,000 houses were flooded or wrecked whilst 250 hectares of rice fields and 2,500 hectares planted with vegetables were wiped out. Some 900 hectares dedicated to aquaculture were also damaged; at least 60,000 animals, mainly cows and poultry, were killed or swept away by the raging waters.

Bishop Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p of Hà Tinh (about 340 km south of the capital, near the coast), decided to visit the flooded areas to bring some help. On Saturday, he led a delegation from his diocese to Trung Quán parish.

The prelate tried to visit every family, one by one, to encourage them and leave them with some small gifts. For those who met him, “He is a true pastor. He did not just give us some gifts; he brought us God.”

Trung Quán parish, one of the hardest hit, saw homes submerged and streets turned into rivers.

Thanks Caritas and the Hà Tinh Catholic Business Association, the bishop was able to leave a package containing instant noodles, a bottle of oil and two packs of condiments for each family he visited.

He also brought more than 200 million dong (about US$ 8,600). The diocese donated 100 million; Caritas 50 million and the Catholic Business Association, another 50 million. Although not huge, the money will help with the emergency.

Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p encouraged the faithful to recite the rosary and pray for all the people living in the flooded area.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VN-_Evacuation.jpg,"['tinh', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'business', 'bishop', 'diocese', 'hà', 'left', 'hectares', 'catholic', 'caritas', 'central', 'floods', '37', 'huge', 'million', 'visits', 'dead']", ,flood

The country’s benchmark VN Index soared 17% in the three months ended April 30, beating every major market in the region and almost doubling gains from the S&P 500 Index.

While foreign investors pulled about US$842mil (RM3.46bil) from the country’s shares so far this year, the tide could be turning.

Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR Global. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has raised more than US$350mil.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that – like in many others around the world – has attracted retail punters in droves.

Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

“The stock market was very active and many of my friends were making money from it, so I decided to withdraw money from the bank to invest in stocks for a better return, ” said Nguyen Lan Huong, a 30-year-old grocery store worker from the riverside district of Long Bien in Hanoi.

Worst hit is Hue province, some 700km (434 miles) away from the capital, Hanoi. Police and soldiers have been using canoes and boats in Ha Tinh city to reach the most flooded areas to evacuate people and move property to safety. In this city alone, more than 20,700 people were reported to have been evacuated.

Bulking Up

Vietnam is an “investable market,” according to HSBC Holdings Plc. The flood of local cash has seen trading volumes more than quadruple since the end of 2019, based on 50-day moving averages. The benchmark index now includes 11 stocks exceeding $5 billion in market value, up from just two in 2015. Vingroup JSC has been leading the charge, and the conglomerate is now launching an ambitious plan to sell electric vehicles to the U.S. Vingroup was founded by the country’s richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine.

The stock exchange’s other heavy hitters include a smattering of state-backed behemoths -- Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, PetroVietnam Gas JSC -- as well as steelmaker Hoa Phat Group JSC and Vietnam Dairy Products JSC.

Vietnam’s stocks have been climbing amid optimism its export-oriented economy can maintain momentum after being one of the few in Asia to expand last year. Manufacturing activity jumped in April to the strongest since November 2018, according to a PMI report Tuesday. Equities retreated today, sending the VN Index down 1.1% as of 9:38 a.m. local time, after Vietnam’s capital city instructed school pupils to stay home in order to help contain an increase in local Covid-19 cases.

The country is well positioned as the U.S. and Chinese economies lead a global rebound from the pandemic. That’s because Vietnam benefited when U.S.-China trade tensions spurred companies to diversify supply chains out of its larger Asian neighbor.

“We’ve been positive on Vietnam for a number of years. They are a clear beneficiary of China-U.S. trade tensions and their handling of the pandemic has been among the best examples globally,” said Jeff Gill, who helped manage about $10.9 billion of assets at City of London Investment Management as of Dec. 31.

Waiting Room

Part of the problem may be that international investors overstretched when they splurged. Foreigners sold a net $876 million of Vietnamese stocks last year, similar to what’s been already sold so far this year. That’s in line with a wave of selling across Asian emerging markets. Those moves look to have simply swelled foreigners’ cash positions inside Vietnam, which are already substantially higher now than they were at the end of 2020, according to Vu Bang, former chairman of the State Securities Commission.

Vietnam’s stocks also faced a setback in March when FTSE Russell decided to maintain the country as a frontier market, instead of upgrading it to a secondary emerging market, citing settlement methodology issues. The State Securities Commission expects to resolve the issue later this year. Investors have also cited foreign ownership limits as a concern that could hamstring the market’s capacity to grow further.

Money managers from Sempione Sim SpA, to Asia Frontier Capital and City of London Investment Management Co. say they are busy looking for entry points. They cite solid economic prospects, relatively attractive valuations, rising foreign-direct investment flows and healthy earnings growth as reasons to be optimistic, while also showing faith in the government’s ability to contain the pandemic.

“I see Vietnam as a very nice compelling growth and stable story for the short, mid and long term,” said Federico Parenti, a fund manager at Sempione Sim in Milan.

Since the beginning of October, central Vietnam has been pounded by consecutive tropical storms and typhoons, which have brought widespread flooding and landslides to the region.

At least 1.5 million people have been affected by flooding and 235 people have died or are missing, according to the Vietnamese government.

On October 15, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink declared a national disaster for the Central Vietnam region as a result of the widespread devastation caused by flooding and landslides. This flooding has disrupted electricity and telecommunication networks, as well as destroying infrastructure, houses, livestock, and crops.

On October 28, Typhoon Molave made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Vietnam. It was the worst typhoon to hit the country in the last two decades.

Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are the two of the five central provinces that have been hardest hit by the recent flooding and landslides. The other three provinces that have been severely affected are Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, and Hue.

To make matters worse, the monsoon season is still ongoing and another powerful storm, Typhoon Vamco, made landfall last Sunday morning in central Vietnam, causing even greater damage. This is the third storm system to pummel Vietnam in November and the 13th to hit the country this year. The economic damage is now estimated to be close to $1 billion, according to the Vietnamese government.

International donations are starting to come in from various countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Japan. To date, the U.S. has donated $2.1 million toward the humanitarian relief effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Vietnam Red Cross Society to assist during the ongoing recovery period.

The financial backing also focuses on USAID’s longstanding investments in Vietnam to help minimize loss and destruction caused by natural disasters. Although the Vietnamese government has been quick to allocate disaster relief funds, its efforts and capacities have been strained also by the coronavirus pandemic. Donations from the outside world will be certainly needed and appreciated.

Local NGOs have been working tirelessly alongside the government to deliver aid to those who have been most affected by the catastrophic storms and their results. Pacific Links Foundation is an NGO that currently supports disadvantaged families in central Vietnam and it has been vigorously fundraising to support families in flood-affected Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Hue provinces.

“Our volunteers on the ground have delivered emergency packages, which included rice, food, life jackets, and flashlights, to students and their families,” said Hong Nguyen, the deputy director for SEEDS, a Pacific Links Foundation scholarship program which currently supports over 2,500 students.

SEEDS and the Pacific Links Foundation are now working on another round of support that will focus specifically on long-term recovery, allowing school children in all eight central Provinces to return to school and provide support for the families that suffered the most during the recent typhoons and floods.

“We will provide packages which will include books and school supplies, as well as computer tablets for students to continue learning through our online learning platform, especially when schooling is being disrupted,” said Nguyen.

Another non-profit charitable organization focused on philanthropic activities to benefit Vietnamese people in need throughout the Central Vietnam region is Da Nang Go. The organization uses fundraising events and direct donations to address the specific needs of Vietnamese people affected by natural disasters, poverty, and hunger.

Presently, the group consists of about 20 local and international volunteers who have been doing regular relief trips to some of the harder hit flood and landslide zones across the region. The NGO recently took a convoy of trucks and cars to Tay Giang district in Quang Nam province to provide much-needed supplies.

Tay Giang experienced heavy flooding and deadly landslides in October and November and is generally considered to be one of the more economically disadvantaged areas of Central Vietnam. The majority of the people who live there are from the Co Tu ethnic minority, a patriarchal rural society whose men raise livestock and whose women are well known for making high-quality traditional handicrafts.

The Co Tu live in small stilt huts which can be easily damaged by storms and landslides. At least 30 families had previously been evacuated from one village in Tay Giang due to the recent landslides.

“Before the last storm came, the government wanted to move them to a safer place but the problem is they don’t want to move anywhere because they are scared and if they die then they want to die in their hometown. They are used to yearly storms but they didn’t know this year’s storms would be so bad,” said Hannah Bui, one of the main directors of Da Nang Go and owner of Hannah’s Restaurant in Da Nang.

“I wish I had more money so I could do more to help these people,” she said.

Recently, the Da Nang Go team assembled 250 aid packages for children and 750 for adults in Tay Giang, as well as presenting some cash donations in envelopes at Hannah’s Restaurant.

The aid packages consisted of water, milk, noodles, dry food, oil, fish sauce, salt, blankets, and notebooks. The money was raised through a recent fundraising event and from various donations by local and expat members of the Da Nang community.

The aid was greeted with smiles by the local villagers and government officials. The team also delivered supplies to two elementary schools and to adults in the neediest villages of Tay Giang. In one of the poorest schools, students are so impoverished that they can’t afford basic school uniforms and some students walk up to four kilometers per day to attend classes.

“When I do charity and I do small things like give candy to poor kids they are happy and smile, and when I give old people clothes and they say ‘thank you,’ it warms my heart and makes me feel good knowing I’ve brightened their day,” said Bui.

Da Nang Go will continue its ongoing fundraising and aid missions to help people around central Vietnam affected by these historically devastating storms and typhoons. Both Pacific Links Foundation and Da Nang Go are continuing to deliver aid packages and funds in the aftermath of Typhoon Vamco.

As much as these local charities and NGOs have brought much-needed relief for affected communities, in terms of food, clothing, school supplies, and direct funding, what is really needed now in terms of the recovery effort is the rebuilding of infrastructure, houses, and technological networks, and a re-supply of livestock to get things back to normal.

Today, while in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced the United States is providing an additional $2 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to Typhoon Molave and the ongoing severe flooding that has affected Central Vietnam since early October. This amount brings the total humanitarian assistance from the U.S. Government for people touched by the floods to $2.1 million.

With this new funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is ramping up efforts to meet emergency needs in communities affected by Vietnam’s historic typhoon season. Typhoon Molave, which made landfall in Central Vietnam on October 28, 2020, is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. Typhoon Molave follows weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1.5 million people and killed more than 130.

In response, USAID’s partners, including the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC), are addressing the immediate needs of the affected families for food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Because the floods have washed away livestock, farms, and infrastructure, USAID’s partners also will provide assistance to these families as they begin to restore their livelihoods.

This assistance builds on USAID’s long-term investments in Vietnam to reduce the risk and impact of disasters. With funding from USAID, for example, the VNRC has been on the front lines in responding to the impact of severe weather throughout this typhoon season.

The United States stands with the people of Vietnam during this difficult time.

7,7,FL-2018-000074-VNM,We must not repeat the Vietnam refugee tragedy in Afghanistan - Military Times,https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2021/05/18/we-must-not-repeat-the-vietnam-refugee-tragedy-in-afghanistan/,"The parallel between the Vietnam War and Afghan War is troubling. In both cases, the U.S. became involved in a foreign war without having a clear picture of what our ultimate objective was. We largely took over the direction of each war from a corrupt host government. Many citizens of our host country placed reliance on the U.S. to provide for their safety, come what may. The war became unwinnable because of a series of unfortunate decisions. Losing interest in the endeavor, we shaped settlement terms the host government was required to accept, intimating we would be there to help if worse came to worst. Here, the similarity ends, for now.

In the case of Vietnam, even though we knew weeks beforehand that the fall of South Vietnam was imminent, we made no concerted effort to extract the Vietnamese who had steadfastly supported the U.S. When their government fell, many thousands who had helped, trusted and relied upon us were murdered or incarcerated to the great dishonor of our nation. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the south and, although we gave many of them sanctuary, our help was slow in coming. The final chapter in Afghanistan has yet to be written, but it must not end up with a betrayal of our friends.

During the long and tortured course of America’s war in Afghanistan, many Afghans stepped forward at their great peril to serve and help protect our military personnel. As we withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban have stepped up their violent attacks and the danger to our friends has dramatically increased. We are morally obligated to provide them sanctuary within our borders.

There are two special immigrant visa (SIV) programs in place to bring our Afghan friends to the U.S., but they are mired in red tape — it takes up to three years to process an application. There is a backlog of nearly 19,000 SIV applicants, with about 50,000 family members. They are waiting in line, living in fear of death. There are not enough slots to take care of the backlog. The vetting process is understaffed, underfunded and overly burdensome.

In this crisis situation, there are two feasible alternatives — either review existing documentation in the files and grant visas to those who U.S. personnel have credibly vouched for in the files, or extract the SIVs and families from Afghanistan and complete any necessary vetting in a safe location. We processed South Vietnamese refugees at U.S. military bases in the late 1980s.

We need, also, to consider the plight of Afghans who don’t qualify for SIV status. A Taliban take-over, which appears increasingly likely, will create a flood of refugees, fleeing for their very lives. Being partially responsible for their plight, we are honor bound to provide sanctuary for many of them, just as we eventually did for those fleeing Vietnam. We should plan to evacuate Afghans who will be targets of Taliban reprisal — uncorrupted government and military officials, women’s rights advocates, educators, democracy advocates and the like.

Like many troops who served in America’s wars, this issue is very personal for me. I lived and worked with South Vietnamese soldiers in 1968-1969. I trusted them with my life, while they relied on the U.S. government as a friend and ally. Most of my Vietnamese friends were Catholics who moved from North Vietnam to Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam in 1954 to escape persecution. They were fiercely anti-communist and pro-American. It broke my heart when the communists took over in April 1975, knowing that my friends would be killed or imprisoned, as were many thousands of their countrymen. We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate. We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us.

8,8,FL-2018-000074-VNM,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

Vietnam’s flood death toll rose to at least 23 and authorities said the incoming storm Nangka would dump more heavy rain on the country in the coming days.

The floods also left at least 14 people missing in Vietnam’s central provinces, the government said in a statement on Monday.

Most of the victims were washed away by floodwaters, the national disaster management authority said, adding local authorities evacuated nearly 46,000 people from affected areas.

The floods have inundated more than 109,000 homes and 1,443 acres (584 hectares) of crops and damaged roads and bridges, the agency added.

A military helicopter rescues sailors from a submerged ship at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri province [Ho Cau/Reuters] Separately, a landslide on Monday reportedly buried 13 construction workers at a hydropower dam in the central province of Thua Thien Hue.

According to weather forecasters, water levels will keep rising, swelling rivers and submerging more communities in the region, the state-owned Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.

The situation worsened over the weekend when Tropical Storm Linfa, which weakened to a depression when it hit the country, brought more rain to the region.

Torrential rains have flooded central Vietnam and killed dozens since last week [Ho Cau/Reuters] “We received a report saying that between 10 and 13 workers have been buried in a landslide and we don’t know if they are still alive,” a disaster management official in Thua Thien Hue province told Reuters news agency by telephone.

Soldiers were deployed to the area to rescue the workers, said the official, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

“We are concerned that the incoming storm will worsen the flood situation,” the official said.

Storm Nangka, which is forecast to make landfall in northern Vietnam on Wednesday, will trigger heavy rain of up to 400 millimetres (16 inches) in parts of northern and central Vietnam from Wednesday through Friday, the national weather agency said.

Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding because of its long coastline.

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) in Vietnam and local people’s generosity. Luu Thi Phuong , 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.“Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children,” she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.“I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDP’s 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.“Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam,” she said.“However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.”Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last year’s floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.”Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.“It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life,” he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: “I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).“In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households,” said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing.

11,11,FL-2018-000074-VNM,How flood protection can paradoxically put people at risk - Horizon,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/how-flood-protection-can-paradoxically-put-people-risk.html,"Professor Jeroen Aerts, a hydrologist at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in The Netherlands, says that when a city builds a defensive wall or dyke, it can make its citizens feel so secure that they actually flock to live or to develop businesses in the protected area. What’s more, they don’t bother to install their own flood protection.

This means that when rare – but inevitable – extreme flooding occurs the damage can be colossal.

It is just one way in which flood protection modellers may be underestimating – and sometimes overestimating – the true consequences of sea level rise, says Prof. Aerts. And it is happening because physical scientists are failing to integrate human behaviour into their models.

Prof. Aerts leads a team that is trying to change this using the technique of agent-based modelling which attempts to reproduce complex phenomena like human behaviour. They use software that creates autonomous decision-making entities called agents, each of which assesses its situation and makes a decision based on a set of rules that have been drawn from survey data and decision theory.

Last year, they published a paper that underlined the problem of the safe development paradox. By modelling what is known about how humans behave when governments install flood protection where they live and work, the team demonstrated that ‘the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas.’

But the study went on to show that governments could ‘largely counteract’ this effect if they simultaneously promoted policies that encourage people to flood-proof their buildings.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’ Prof. Jeroen Aerts, Vrije University, The Netherlands

Migration

Prof. Aerts believes that the failure of physical scientists to take human behaviour into account may also have led them to misjudge the degree to which flooding will drive migration. What’s more, it means they are not identifying precisely where it would be best to target help, because the models don’t distinguish adequately between those who will manage to look after themselves and those who won’t.

Sea level rise will, it is commonly predicted, displace 187 million people by 2100. But the figure, which comes from a 2011 study, is controversial.

‘Most modelling studies that deal with flooding risk or sea level rise use a top-down approach,’ said Prof. Aerts. ‘You have long-term scenarios – like how many centimetres is sea level going to rise, and what will the exposed population be … and you try to estimate the impact.’ Then, he said, the models are rerun to include the effects of various adaptation measures, such as dykes or managed retreat, after which researchers do a cost-benefit analysis.

But, Prof. Aerts said, ‘they forget about (asking) what is the probability that this dyke will be built? Or what is the probability that people will retreat? So they do not take into account the human behavioural factor which determines whether or not this measure will be implemented.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’

Factors that get ignored include evidence that people’s decisions to migrate, or to stay and defend their land, vary with their wealth, age, risk perception, trust of government and attitudes to individual freedom.

Social scientists

Prof. Aerts says that his team is now turning the models on their head, in a new project known as COASTMOVE. They are integrating a global coastal flood risk model with an agent-based model to simulate how governments, private sector actors such as insurance companies, and individuals act and influence each other.

Another difference is that social scientists are feeding data into the project.

‘They provide me with the information about under what conditions are people going to implement a certain measure, from the individual level to the higher aggregate government level,’ said Prof. Aerts.

Some of this information is from pre-existing surveys on what drives people to migrate or otherwise respond to floods. The rest will be gathered from new surveys in six coastal areas in France, Ghana, the Marshall Islands, the United States, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Other, less traditional sources of information will come from data already collected via mobile phones, Twitter posts and even tax returns.

They will use data from Bangladesh, for example, where other researchers have been able to discover, from anonymised mobile phone data, how many people have fled from floods, where they travelled, and how soon they returned. They will also use data that Prof. Aerts has gathered over the last six years using algorithms to monitor tweets that mention the word ‘flood’, in 20 different languages. This provides daily flood maps that give ‘a pretty good idea of where we can expect most of the problems’, he said.

More data is coming from the United States where it has been possible to draw conclusions about migration after flooding from the location from which people have filed their annual tax returns.

Vulnerabilities

By simulating adaptive behaviour, the team hopes to provide more refined predictions about the degree to which sea level rise will cause migration – in the form of 1x1km2 global migration maps.

Dr Bina Desai, head of policy and research at the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, says that sea level rise will bring a variety of direct and indirect impacts, which will affect people differently depending on factors such as inequality and poverty, that are not adequately reflected in models.

‘What’s needed, if we think about risk of migration and displacement, is modelling with a less strong focus on the hazard and a stronger focus on underlying vulnerabilities and what exacerbates them,’ she said.

‘In principle, it’s the only way to do it,’ Dr Desai said of COASTMOVE’s approach. Even as a conceptual model, she adds, it will help to work out how the many factors interrelate.

‘The downside is to move beyond the conceptual model,’ she added. ‘If you want to translate that into numbers then (when we have tried it) we found we failed because all the inputs could not be populated with data.

‘But if they can find a way of doing it by (collecting enough data), using proxies and making assumptions and somehow modelling it out then I think that’s great.’

Just how are our seas changing and rising with climate change and the melting of Earth’s ice caps? This is the final story in a three-part series looking at the past, present and future of extreme sea level rise. In part one, we looked at what the last interglacial can tell us about extreme sea level rise and in part two we looked at rise of atmospheric ‘meteotsunamis’.

iii. Prevent the outbreak of communicable diseases and effectively monitor risks to the health of the affected population, including the nutrition status of vulnerable people such as pregnant and lactating women and children under five years of age. Deliver assistance in a manner that minimises the risk of COVID-19 for disaster-affected people.

iv. Ensure access to multi sectoral assistance and re-establish critical services. Promote the repair of key public service infrastructure in affected provinces, ensure food security, by restoring lost food stock, livestock and livelihoods, ensure access to sustainable drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene supplies, housing, replacement of productive assets and household items, and access to basic medical, social and public services to support the affected population transition to recovery and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

On 13 October, the Government of Viet Nam released a call for emergency relief and support following four tropical cyclones and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which combined have caused severe and widespread flooding, landslides, storm surge and strong winds since 6 October. As of 28 October, 214 people have reportedly been killed or are missing, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). An estimated 7.7 million people live in areas affected by flooding caused by the multiple storms, with some 1.5 million people in nine provinces directly affected and approximately 380,000 houses flooded, damaged or destroyed. Of those people directly affected by the current disaster, some 753,000 are women and girls, 134,000 are children under five, and 143,000 are over 65 years old.

On the morning of 11 October, Tropical Storm Linfa (Storm No. 6) made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Viet Nam, resulting in 150 to 300 mm of rain. This was followed on 14 October by Tropical Storm Nangka (Storm No. 7) which made landfall in northern Viet Nam, but also brought a further 150 mm of rain to the still flooded provinces of central Viet Nam. On 16 October, tropical depression INVEST 94W in the East Sea weakened into a low-pressure area and made landfall in the central provinces, and was subsequently followed by Tropical Storm Saudel (Storm No. 8) which made landfall in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces on 25 October. On 28 October, Tropical Cyclone Molave (Storm No. 9) made landfall in approximately the same area as Tropical Storm Linfa, with up to 700 mm of rain reported in Nghe An and Ha Thinh provinces and up to 400 mm of rain in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces.

In Quang Ngai province, some 17,000 people were evacuated because of the strong winds and rain. Between 5 and 20 October, VNDMA reported that many areas in central Viet Nam recorded a total rainfall of more than 2,400 mm, and in some locations, flood waters exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1979 and 1999.

As of 29 October, nine provinces have been affected by the cumulative impacts of the multiple storms including Tropical Cyclone Molave. These are, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Nghe An, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum provinces, with Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces most severely affected.

Following Tropical Cyclone Molave, more than 88,000 houses and 50 schools had their roofs blown off, the majority in Quang Ngai province, and some 375,000 people were evacuated to evacuation centres. Those in the evacuation centres are amongst the most vulnerable having had their houses damaged or destroyed and having lost key household items in the floods. Many of the evacuation centres are overcrowded, do not have access to sufficient basic facilities such as water and sanitation, and health care, and lack appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children.

As well as damage to houses, some 30,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged (including rice, other crops, and aquatic products) and more than 2 million cattle and poultry have been killed. This is likely to have severe impacts on food security and livelihoods, especially for those people who were already experiencing adverse economic impacts due to COVID19. Further, more than 360 schools have been flooded and damaged, with detrimental impacts on children’s ability to continue accessing education. In addition, more than 78 health centres and hospitals have also been damaged or flooded.

To date, the delivery of assistance has been hampered by extensive damage to public transportation infrastructure. VNDMA reports that more than 165 km of national highway, 140 km of local roads and three bridges have been heavily damaged. Rescue teams are accessing affected areas by boat to deliver relief items and to evacuate vulnerable people, prioritizing children, people with disabilities and elderly people. Communication has also been hampered by the loss of electricity in many affected areas.

The areas most severely affected by flooding are also those same provinces which experienced a second wave of COVID19 cases in July and August. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, a further thirty days of lockdown measures were implemented from 28 July to 5 September, with adverse socio-economic impacts for the region which already records higher than national average multidimensional poverty rates. As a consequence of COVID-19 related measures, the most vulnerable people had already had their coping capacities eroded prior to this current disaster and are thus in more acute need of immediate assistance to help them manage the current, compound crisis.

From 20 and 23 October, joint GovernmentUN-NGO assessments were undertaken in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai provinces. Key findings from the assessments include the need for emergency food assistance for 177,000 of the most vulnerable people, restoration of agricultural land, safe access to clean water and sanitation facilities including in health centres and schools, the provision of dignity kits for women and girls, provision of education supplies and alternative learning solutions to ensure continuity of learning, support for those people evacuated from their homes, repairs for damaged houses, replacement of basic household items, health support especially maternal and child health, risk communication activities, provision of micro nutrients and continuation of nutrition activities to prevent an increase in rates of malnutrition.

Protection has been identified as a key need in this response, including the immediate need to ensure protection and safeguards for women and children currently living in evacuation centres. Partners involved in the development of this plan have also highlighted the need to provide assistance in a gender-responsive manner that addresses the specific needs of women and girls. The Government has requested that all relief activities target the most vulnerable people, including poor, near poor, people living with disabilities, children, femaleheaded households and elderly people, which are the target populations for this response plan.","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/VNM-ResponsePlan-201031-051%20%281%29.jpg?itok=QHnLLURt,"['plan', 'response', 'nam', 'quang', 'provinces', '2020', 'viet', 'tropical', 'floods', 'affected', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'assistance', 'storm', 'including']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The lower Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam) experienced prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020 until early December 2020. This was due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka as well as tropical depression INVEST 94W. The three wind systems made landfall in Vietnam but brought along heavy rain to the rest of the lower Mekong region. Tropical storm Linfa made landfall on 11 October 2020, tropical storm Nangka made landfall on 14 October 2020 whilst tropical depression INVEST 94W made landfall on 16 October 2020.

The rainfall brought by the wind systems resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in southern Lao PDR. As of 20 October 2020, nine districts in three provinces of Salawan, Savannaket and Sekong were affected by the floods. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Based on an initial assessment on 20 October 2020, conducted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) with participation of Lao Red Cross, it was highlighted that 163 villages in the three provinces, with an estimated 15,305 households (97,514 people) were affected. Savannaket was the worst affected province with more than 10,000 households from 137 villages were reportedly affected in the province and two people had lost their lives. In Sekong province, around 3,000 people were affected, and two people had lost their lives. Salawan province reported more than 600 people affected with five deaths.

Cyclone Molave – the fourth tropical cyclone to threaten Vietnam this month – is barrelling towards the country’s central coast, worsening severe floods and landslides that have inundated parts of the region for weeks.

Vietnamese authorities are rushing to evacuate half a million people before Molave makes a projected 28 October landfall, packing wind speeds topping 110 kilometres per hour. The country is already struggling with intense floods and landslides that have killed at least 130 people and damaged a quarter of a million homes.

The Vietnamese Red Cross has already warned that 160,000 people may need food aid over the next six months, but that figure could rise after Molave makes landfall and its impact becomes more clear.

Aid groups say parts of Vietnam are seeing their worst floods and landslides in two decades. Disasters are common during Asia’s various monsoon seasons, but this month’s flurry of storms has aggravated conditions, with weeks of extended heavy rainfall.

Parts of Laos and Cambodia are also submerged. And Thailand is projecting that Molave's rains will hit the country’s north and northeast.

Before threatening Southeast Asia’s Mekong region, Cyclone Molave uprooted some 25,000 people in the Philippines earlier this week.

Hue, Vietnam – Before floodwater inundated half their living room one night during the storm season this year, the Trans put their most valuable possessions – their TV and refrigerator – in the attic and told their two daughters to take refuge there.

Tran Nhu Hong, 23, and her 18-year-old sister, who do not know how to swim, survived the storms – the worst her generation had ever experienced and the worst her parents had seen in decades.

A neighbour was not so fortunate. The 19-year-old student was swept away in the floods after the vehicle she was travelling in was tipped over by the force of the water – on the same route the two young women usually take.

“Shortly after the water retreated, I went on that route and the vehicle was still there and had not yet been pulled out (of the mud),” Hong said. “I don’t dare to go on that route late at night any more.”

Across central Vietnam, cascading floods from October onward inundated the living and the dead, as record rainfall submerged towns and cemeteries. Authorities said earlier this month that the typhoons, which they referred to as “abnormal”, cost the Southeast Asian country 30 trillion dong ($1.3bn) in damage and killed at least 192 people – a death toll more than five times higher than the 35 COVID-19 deaths Vietnam recorded this year.

A woman drives along a flooded road beside submerged rice fields [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “In general, it is well-established that rainfall from typhoons is increasing due to climate change, both from observations and from models,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead climate scientist at the Red Cross Climate Center and World Weather Attribution, whose team is conducting a study on the role of climate change in the recent floods and typhoons in central Vietnam.

Crops destroyed

With 70 percent of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas, Vietnam is highly exposed to riverine and coastal flooding and is also one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.

“There is even more damage after the floods,” Hong said, driving by rice fields made inlets because of the storms and floods in her hometown in Thua Thien Hue Province.

When the water retreated, it took crops with it, leaving behind scarred earth. Many farming families in central Vietnam count on rice, various other crops and cattle for income, especially as the Lunar New Year celebration, known as Tet, nears.

Tet is usually when Vietnamese shop for new clothes, gifts and appliances to welcome a new, fulfilling beginning; but with their homes and means of living ravaged by violent storms, severe floods and devastating landslides, Tet, which will take place in February, is likely to be tinged with sadness.

Hong’s parents are still recovering from the wounds and infections they got from wading through hip-high flood water for extended periods, and have yet to find jobs as construction workers due to the double burden of COVID-19 and the recent natural disasters.

Ichiro Sato, senior associate with the Climate Program and Sustainable Finance Center at US-based think tank World Resources Institute, says central Vietnam was battling extreme weather events long before climate change started to take effect.

“If governments have not been well-prepared even for the conventional risk of weather-related disasters that existed before climate change – and I am afraid that is the case for Central Vietnam – then there are so many things they have to work on before worrying about the additional risk of climate change,” Sato said, adding that unregulated urbanisation and economic growth may increase vulnerability to weather-related disasters in places like Vietnam.

The country typically endures between five and six storms and about three tropical depressions a year, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, but in 2020 a total of at least 14 ravaged the country. Seven consecutive tropical storms and cyclones hit the central region between October and mid-November.

Children at risk

According to the UN, an estimated 7.7 million people in nine provinces, including 2.5 million children, were affected – with hundreds of thousands of houses flooded, damaged or destroyed.

“There is no doubt that children are those most affected by natural disasters,” Rana Flowers, UNICEF representative in Vietnam, told Al Jazeera, adding that families’ ability to secure nutritious food for their children had already suffered as a result of the pandemic.

An estimated 375,000 people were sent to evacuation centres during the storms and floods, including about 90,000 children, according to Flowers.

“Many of the evacuation sites were overcrowded, did not have access to sufficient water and sanitation and healthcare, and lacked appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children,’’ Flowers said, adding that the situation severely affected the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children.

A study brief published in August by the US-based Society for Research in Child Development showed that children may suffer longer-term physical and psychological deficits than adults, including difficulty sleeping or concentrating and losing interest in their usual activities – chronic mental health symptoms have been observed among children as long as four years after a disaster.

A woman carries food through the submerged streets of Hue in central Vietnam [File: Manan Vatsyana/AFP] “In the long run, to be sustainable, the Vietnamese government should invest more to strengthen mental health services for children and their families, looking at the nationwide system and also building the workforce,’’ Flowers said.

Deforestation, which affects the ability of the land to retain water, also contributed to the flooding and a series of severe landslides during the stormy season, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said at a legislative National Assembly meeting last month.

Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam lost 657,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of primary forest – 23 percent of its total tree-cover loss according to data from international monitoring service Global Forest Watch. About 50 percent of all tree-cover loss between 2001 and 2019 took place in 11 of the country’s 63 provinces – eight of them in central Vietnam, it said.

The devastating landslides and flooding have prompted concerns about deforestation caused by the construction of hydropower plants in forests.

As of 2018, there were 385 dams in operation, with an additional 143 under construction, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Earlier this month, the minister acknowledged the increased evidence of the loss of watershed forests and vegetation, as well as a loss of soil adhesion, as a result of the developments.

The government has also announced sustainable and long-term missions to cope with storms in central Vietnam, including upgrading climate-change adaptation scenarios and relocating people in areas at risk of landslide and flooding.

No place like home

For those who have been living in the area for generations, like the parents of 21-year-old university student Le Thi Thuyen, leaving their storm-battered homes seems unfathomable.

“We can be accustomed to annual storms but whenever they come, we are still worried,” said Thuyen, a native of Quang Binh, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the central region.

Thuyen, who left for Ho Chi Minh City to study and is currently an intern at a non-governmental organisation in Vietnam’s biggest city, called her parents and siblings back home every day when the storms were pounding their commune, flooding and isolating homes in low-lying areas.

Tears welled up in her eyes when she thought of her 12-year-old brother who does not know how to swim.

Cemeteries were inundated as floodwaters rose in central Vietnam [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “I read news about kids who got swept away by the flood and I was really worried about my brother,” the 21-year-old said.

Thuyen’s parents, who make a living from agriculture and working on other people’s farms, have already been struggling this year because of the pandemic – and the storm season has created more problems, destroying their crops, and fish. It also meant weeks when there were no jobs to be found.

“Tet this year won’t be as fulfilling as others for us,” Thuyen said. “This time, it won’t be my parents supporting me, but I will be supporting them with what I can.”","Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/000_8V93XX-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'children', 'storms', 'water', 'change', 'pieces', 'central', 'relentless', 'floods', 'parents', 'living', 'pick', 'vietnamese', '2020s', 'climate']", ,flood

By Vatican News staff writer

Volunteers and workers of Caritas Vietnam are visiting and assisting people in the central provinces who have to face the brunt of 13 storms this year with some severe flooding.

The umpteenth storm

In just over a month, Vietnam's central region has seen 7 tropical storms and typhoons, causing floods and landslides that killed 235 people and caused an estimated $740,000 in damage in several provinces. The rain from the storms has caused the worst flooding in the region in more than 30 years.

The latest of these typhoons, Vamco, made landfall in Vietnam on Sunday with winds of up to 150 kph, after leaving 67 dead in the Philippines. The storm has damaged more than 400,000 homes, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. At least 150,000 people are at risk of going hungry.

According to Caritas, the social arm of the Catholic Church, rebuilding homes and recovering their livelihood are extremely important apart from immediate help and survival. Farming, such as growing vegetables, rice, raising livestock and poultry, which is the mainstay in the central provinces, has been devastated. Many families have lost everything in the floods and landslides.



Local Caritas in action

The new director of Caritas Vietnam, Father Joseph Ngo Si Dinh, led a delegation to the central provinces, Nov. 9-11, to survey the flooded areas. They first visited the Diocese of Hu? and its two adjoining provinces, talking to families and providing them material and spiritual support.

Father John Nguyen Huy Tuan, director of Caritas Ha Tinh, said priests were actively involved in bringing food and relief to the affected people and moving them to safer places.

Temporary shelters have been built to accommodate 25 families. A parish mobilised its young people to rescue families trapped in flooded homes.

No one excluded

Caritas Vietnam, in collaboration with dioceses and parishes, has been engaged in social outreach and charity works to help people after natural disasters.

The social arm of the Catholic Church assists people to rebuild their lives, repair damaged houses and build new homes for families who have lost theirs. It also provides people and families with seeds, livestock, water filtering systems, and finance for school children.

Caritas discussed ways to come up with concrete plans or projects to rebuild the lives of people regardless of their religion. Father Dinh has urged Catholics to help every person in need. “We hope that the people most affected by these storms, be they Catholic or not, will get some relief,” the Caritas director said.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/reuters/2020/10/13/14/1602592734645.JPG/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'storms', 'provinces', 'flood', 'caritas', 'social', 'homes', 'central', 'region', 'families', 'typhoons', 'storm', 'victims', 'assisting']", ,flood

On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.

The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.

The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.

On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh 400-500 mm, Quang Tri 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City 1,100 mm, Quang Nam 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai 600-800 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In this period, more than 130,000 houses, mostly in Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue provinces had been flooded, with some submerged by four meters.

Streak of tragedies

Around 3 a.m. on October 8, cargo vessel Vietship 01 of a Hanoi-based logistics firm was swept away by floods and rough seas as it docked at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri.

The ship had 12 male crew members on board when swept off. Four crew members who had fallen from the vessel made it safely to shore on October 9 and 10. One member, aged 45, had also jumped into the water but went missing before his body was retrieved on October 11.

Heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas derailed rescue efforts and the vessel sank to the bottom in shallow waters, leaving the rest of the crew and one fisherman, part of a rescue squad, stranded at sea.

It took rescue teams three days to reach the stranded vessel.

""It was difficult for modern vessels to reach the stranded ship so we had to rely on rudimentary boats and experienced fishermen for the mission,"" explained Colonel Le Van Phuong, head of Quang Tri Border Guard.

On the morning of October 11, the fisherman and a crew member jumped into the water and battled their way back through the rough seas and strong waves. Two teams of rescuers rushed to deliver them safely to shore.

Within the same day, a military helicopter was sent to the scene to rescue the remaining six crew members stuck on the vessel. Two days after he was rescued, however, ship captain Nguyen Van Bao, 51, passed away due to multiple organ failure and sepsis.

At midnight on October 12, a hill collapsed onto an operation center of Rao Trang 3 Hydropower Plant, located deep in a jungle of Phong Xuan Commune, Phong Dien District in Thua Thien-Hue.

The landslide buried 17 workers after 40 others escape to a nearby plant, called Rao Trang 4.

The story of the 17 workers is even more tragic since a 21-member rescue team that had set out to verify reports of their predicament got struck by the same calamity.

At midnight the next day, a landslide had buried the ranger station housing the entire rescue team. Only eight members managed to escape, with the remaining 13 confirmed dead, including Major General Nguyen Van Man, deputy commander of the 4th Military Region of Vietnam People's Army. The bodies of the 13 victims have all been found and identified, though only five of the 17 workers' bodies have been retrieved.

During funeral procedures for the 12 soldiers and their deputy commander, another landslide struck a barracks housing 27 personnel of Defense Economics Division 337, also managed by the 4th Military Region.

The division had been assigned to assist five remote communes in Huong Hoa District of Quang Tri, which borders Laos, in mitigating the impacts of prolonged flooding and landslides triggered by abnormally heavy downpours across the central region.

As the mountain collapsed onto their barracks in the first hours of October 19, the 27 division members were all sleeping, with only five managing to escape. Three more landslides buried the remaining 22.

By the afternoon of that day, all 22 bodies had been retrieved.

Luong Thi Ly, who lost her son Le The Linh to the landslide, said she could not believe he and his comrades had lost their lives during peace time.

New flood waves

And as mountainous areas reeled under repeated landslides, urban and coastal areas were hit by a new wave of flooding on October 18 and 20 due to the impact of tropical storms, the intertropical convergence zone and east winds in tandem with water discharged from dam projects.

On October 18, flood peaks recorded on the Hieu River of Quang Tri hit 5.36 m, passing the record level of 1983 by 0.78 m, while the peak on the Thach Han River rose to 7.4 m, 0.11 m higher than the 1999 record. In Quang Binh, floodwaters were measured at 4.88 m on October 19, or 0.97 m higher than the record in 1999.

For the second flood wave, more than 177,000 households in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri were inundated by floodwaters 1-4 m deep.

Many elderly people in Ha Tinh said for the past 40 years, they had never seen such severe flooding causing such serious damage.

In Quang Binh's Le Thuy District, a family who lost their 75-year-old grandmother, on October 17, had to hang her coffin from the roof of their house for nearly a week to avoid floodwaters.

More storms, floods and landslides

With heavy rains yet to show any signs of receding, Storm Saudel developed in the East Sea on October 20, though it had weakened and turned into a tropical depression as it reached the central coast on October 25.

Two days later, Molave entered the East Sea and headed straight to central Vietnam. It landed over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28 as the most powerful storm to have hit Vietnam in 20 years.

The storm had inflicted economic damage worth around VND10 trillion ($430.16 million), according to statistics from affected provinces. The loss was nearly 1.5 times higher than 2019’s total natural disaster-induced damage of VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), mostly ascribed to flooding, storms and landslides.

Subsequently, the storm triggered heavy rains that had led to more floods and landslides.

On October 28 alone, two different landslides struck Tra Leng and Tra Van communes in Quang Nam’s Nam Tra My District.

The Tra Van landslide buried 20, killing eight and injuring 12 while in Tra Leng, a mountain collapsed on 53 villagers, with 33 managing to escape, eight confirmed dead, and 12 still missing.

One day later in Phuoc Loc Commune, Phuoc Son District of Quang Nam, another landslide buried 11 victims. Seven have since been confirmed dead and four are still missing.

A survivor of the Tra Leng landslide, Nguyen Thanh Son, 56, had lost his wife to the accident. The bereaved husband cannot believe he has lost his family, house and entire village in the mere blink of an eye.

""Altogether, tumbling soil, mud, rocks, water and trees smashed in the roofs of our houses, sweeping everything away until hitting the foot of another mountain,"" Son recalled.

By the night of October 28, more than 4,000 families in Nghe An and Ha Tinh had been evacuated to safety after their neighborhoods had been submerged by up to two meters of water.

The third flood lasted until October 30 and by November 1, had receded.

A search operation has been launched for a missing rescue team as severe flooding and landslides battered central Vietnam, authorities said on Wednesday, as the country braced for further heavy rain.

Close to a million people have been impacted by heavy downpours and rising waters since mid last week, with more than 200,000 homes flooded, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Thirty-six people are now dead, Vietnam's disaster management authority said, while rescue workers have launched a search for around 30 people missing at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue province following landslides.

The missing include a team of soldiers and officials who had tried to find plant workers who disappeared days ago.

Images on state media showed helicopters and hundreds of soldiers struggling to access the site through thick mud and fallen trees.

Elsewhere across the central region, villages and rice fields were submerged, with relief workers resorting to makeshift boats and canoes to deliver food and bottled water to those stuck in flooded homes.

North central Vietnam was also hit by severe weather on Wednesday as Storm Nangka made landfall.

Forecasters said it could bring further rain in the coming days, while warning another storm was expected to form and make impact this weekend.

The IFRC said it had ""grave fears"" that the deadly floods would worsen as more rain was dumped on hard hit communities.

""These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods,"" said IFRC's Hung Ha Nguyen.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and is often affected by more than a dozen storms each year, regularly bringing flooding and landslides.

More then 130 people were reported dead or missing due to natural disasters in the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. “I wasn’t sad,” Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017’s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tay’s land. “That’s what I had to do.” He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldn’t be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasn’t wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. “Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them,” landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a “soft” levee girding the riverbank. She doesn’t view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. “The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and you’ve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made.” Dao’s mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, “a very sensitive and fragile area where ‘hard’ solutions [to erosion] won’t work”, said Dao, who has studied the region’s ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The “common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land”, Dao says. “Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down.” As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Dao’s words, “by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous”. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tay’s riverbank is like a pillow that doesn’t stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Dao’s green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses — a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, “people aren’t afraid of flooding”, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. “We have learnt to live with the floods,” he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. “Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive,” he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yen’s fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the island’s west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals’ trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the city’s famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes aren’t simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi An’s recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground. Dr Dao Ngo bought her own land in Triem Tay village to do her conservation work. Credit:Yen Duong “Now the ecological component is extremely important. In the past it was culture, now it’s ecology,” Hoi An’s vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local government’s development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. “Of course, it is difficult and it will take time,” says Hung. “Perhaps we won’t succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation.” As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemic’s wake, Hung doesn’t want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the city’s revenue. “We’ve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, there’ll be less to worry about.“

Ecology-based development, in Hung’s words, also means preserving the city’s forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. “If we achieve that, we’ll be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals’ life will definitely be improved.” Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. “You don’t see erosion here, but build-up [of land],” said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. “I’ve never seen these trees die because of flooding,” said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the river’s mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huong’s family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as “a fortune” on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river. Le Thi Huong, 59, a mangrove palm farmer, in her home made from the palms in Cam Thanh commune. Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. “The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; that’s why they protect it,” Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tay’s sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi An’s toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

Molave hit as the equivalent of a Category 2 Atlantic hurricane, packing sustained winds of 165 kilometers per hour (103 miles per hour). The storm is expected to bring rains and dangerous winds as it pushes over the mountains of Southeast Asia, causing potential flash floods and landslides.

""This is a very strong typhoon that will impact a large area,"" Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said before the storm made landfall

Some 310,000 homes were already damaged from last week's deadly flooding, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), with the organization warning that close to 1.2 million people were ""in severe danger and in need of relief.""

""It is estimated that at least 150,000 people are at immediate risk of food shortages and hunger after thousands of hectares of crops have been destroyed,"" the IFRC said last week.

The death toll from flooding and landslides in Vietnam continued to rise Tuesday, while those hit by the disasters triggered by tropical storms in the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos criticized government inaction and made urgent appeals for assistance.

In Vietnam, at least 104 people are dead in the country’s central region, with 49, 27, and 11 deaths reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam alone, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Control. Twenty-seven people are missing, including 15 workers from a hydropower plant in Quang Tri that was hit by a landslide on Oct. 12.

The committee said that some 90,000 residents of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Tri provinces have been evacuated to higher ground. Nearly 7,000 hectares of rice paddy and crop fields have been submerged, while more than 5,800 head of cattle and 685,000 poultry birds have been killed or carried away in floods.

Vietnamese state media on Tuesday reported that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved the allocation of 100 billion Vietnamese dong (U.S. $4.3 million) and 1,000 tons of rice to the five worst flood-hit provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Ha Tinh.

Meanwhile, the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre said a tropical depression in the Philippines has strengthened into what is being called Storm Saudel. Over the next 24 hours, Saudel is expected to enter the South China Sea—called the East Sea in Vietnam—and become the eighth storm to batter Vietnam’s central provinces since the start of the rainy season.

Tran Quang Nang, head of the weather forecasting department under the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre, rejected reports circulating on Facebook, allegedly citing Japanese forecasters, that Saudel is a super typhoon.

“All of these predictions about Typhoon Saudel are baseless and fake,” Nang said. “The Japanese weather forecasting center and other countries have said no such thing.”

Nang called on the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to “punish” those responsible for spreading inaccurate information on social networks, causing public confusion.

“This issue should be handled promptly to ensure people only access accurate information released by the authorities so they can respond to natural disasters, helping to mitigate the damage they cause,” he said.

In Cambodia, the death toll remained at 25 from a day earlier, with some 40,000 evacuated to temporary shelters, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha told RFA’s Khmer Service. More than 200,000 hectares of paddy field and nearly 80,000 farms have also been destroyed, with more than 500 school buildings and 79 garment factories damaged.

Roads, hospitals, and dams have also been affected, authorities said.

In a notice issued on Tuesday, the Poipet Administration of Banteay Meanchey province, along Cambodia’s border with Thailand, temporarily closed portions of National Road 5. Downtown Poipet saw flooding of homes and roads, which the notice attributed to rains in Thailand.

Sann Ratha, a resident of Kaun Damrei village, in Poipet’s Sangkat Nimith district, told RFA that water levels increased so rapidly that several hundred families were forced to leave their homes.

He said people are stranded and in desperate need of food and other supplies.

“We are under the attack from the flood—our village looks like a river now with water everywhere and houses submerged,” he said.

“The current situation is worse than during the [1967-1975] civil war. We need the authorities to help us immediately.”

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen traveled to affected areas visiting with victims and handing out food. He said in a post to his Facebook page that he plans to spend two days in hard-hit Banteay Meanchey province, where 13 of the country’s 25 deaths have occurred and an estimated 20,000 families have been affected.

Opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha is also traveling to Banteay Meanchey to provide assistance.

Din Puthy, head of the Poipet-based Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association, expressed skepticism over the government’s handling of the flooding Tuesday.

He voiced concerns that authorities appear to prefer taking selfies with small numbers of villagers and posting them on social media to pretend they are helping the victims.

“The victims are not receiving equal treatment,” he said. “Only a few people have received some assistance while many others have been left behind.”

More aid needed

In Laos, where storms have ravaged Savannakhet province in the country’s center, authorities remained unable to access many areas due to damaged roads and a lack of boats to transport aid and other supplies, Lao sources said.

More than 125 villages in eight districts have now been flooded, with many houses and over 10,000 hectares of paddy fields submerged, official sources in the province say. Nearly 30,000 people have been impacted in Savannakhet, according to official count.

An official from Savannakhet’s inundated Phin district told RFA Tuesday that people are in need of dry goods, drinking water, medicine, and other necessities. The official said that while most aid had been distributed it still is not enough.

“In Phin district, 45 villages are heavily flooded, but they have received some help already—they mostly need sticky rice and consumer goods,” he said.

He said villagers with boats had been using them to help one another and that there have been no accidents during rescue and supply operations.

A villager in Phin told RFA that the water level is so high that the local river had flooded homes along its banks and urged authorities to provide more assistance.

“They have helped a little, but it’s very difficult for us,” he said. “Higher-level authorities should take care of this. We’re asking for more rice—all houses need rice to eat.”

Authorities in Savannakhet’s Xonbury district said waters remain high and will rise in days to come, forcing villagers to stay in clubs, schools, and other places set up by the local government as temporary shelters until flooding recedes.

According to the Meteorology Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Laos will continue to endure heavy rains and strong winds throughout the country in coming days. It urged villagers to remain vigilant for flash floods and landslides.

Storm Molave, which made landfall at around 11 am local time on Wednesday, is one of the strongest storms to hit the southeast Asian nation in 20 years.

The resulting “extreme rainfall” could continue over the coming days, worsening the already precarious situation faced by many families, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a statement.

“For the affected populations, their homes remain severely damaged, their food stocks have been lost, they have no access to clean water for drinking, washing and cooking; and water and sanitation systems have been damaged,” said the agency.

Evacuation centres flooded

Thousands have been moved to evacuation centres, which are themselves flooded, resulting in difficult health and hygiene conditions for the displaced people, primarily women, children and elderly. Health centres have also been damaged, leaving without to access basic health care services.

“Added to this is the trauma of the violent storms and rushing waters, that for a population where many cannot swim, creates fear and impacts mental wellbeing,” UNICEF added.

The storm has also damaged vital infrastructure, including electricity and roads, leaving many communities cut off from assistance and protection.

Affected populations

An estimated 7.7 million people live in the affected areas, including as many as 1.5 million who have been “directly affected”, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam said in a humanitarian update late Wednesday.

Of these, some 177,000 people considered vulnerable (poor or near-poor), should be prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance, it added.

Response

According to the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UN agencies and partners are developing and will release a multi-sector response plan, within the coming days, to support emergency relief efforts.

In the immediate term, UNICEF has mobilized to provide emergency water, nutrition, sanitation, education and protection support, it said in the statement. It is also coordinating with Government agencies and humanitarian actors to reach the most vulnerable and those most affected.

Description of the disaster

The central region of Viet Nam was experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimetres of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 150 millimetres of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. Additionally, Tropical Storm Saudel hit Viet Nam on 25 October closely followed by Typhoon Molave on 28 October. Typhoon Molave was one of the most devastating typhoons making landfall in Vietnam in decades. The typhoon made landfall after a series of tropical storms hitting Viet Nam and had caused severe flooding and at least three landslides which tragically resulted in the loss of 40 lives. 44 people are still missing, and six people are severely injured. On 5 November, Typhoon Goni made landfall in Viet Nam and Tropical Storm Atsani made landfall on 7 November. Tropical storm Vamco, was the latest to hit central Viet Nam as it made landfall on 15 November 2020.

The recurrent storms bringing heavy rainfall have caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. The Viet Nam National Disaster Management Agency (VNDMA) has reported that many areas in central Vietnam recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 1,600 millimeters between 5 to 20 October 2020, with peaks of 2,400 millimeters in some locations over the same period. The Hieu River (Quang Tri), Bo River (Hue), Gianh River and Kien Giang River (Quang Binh) have reached historically high levels, and in some locations flood waters have exceeded the previous historical highs recorded in 1979 and 1999. In addition, hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs to prevent them from bursting.

Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Authorities estimate that a nearly eight million people have been exposed to the storms, and some 1.5 million people have been directly affected by the storms and floods. On 4 November, ahead of typhoon Goni’s landfall, 98,819 households (372,631 people) in six provinces (Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen) were evacuated to safe shelters. Similarly, evacuations took place on 7 November in anticipation of typhoon Atsani, and on the 15th November ahead of typhoon Vamco’s landfall additional evacuations have been carried out in seven provinces of central Viet Nam with a total of 93,795 households (324,780 people) evacuated to safer places (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai).

Most of the people who had been evacuated have now returned home after their local authorities’ approval. They are actively repairing their homes with the help of their relatives. However, according to the VNDMA 31,637 households must be urgently relocated because they lost their shelter or their houses which have collapsed or been too heavily damaged, and they are now living with host families. After the latest typhoon (Vamco), according to the VNDMA, at least 243 are reported to have been killed or are missing and over two million livestock have been killed or swept away. The floods have caused significant damage to infrastructure including roads, schools, health centres and community facilities. It is reported that 1,569 schools have been affected included 360 schools flooded or damaged, while 46,916 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people are now in desperate needs of emergency relief, such as safe shelter, safe drinking water, food and livelihood income support.","Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1546577-MDRVN020eu1.png?itok=7nf8va0m,"['vietnam', 'n', 'nam', 'update', 'mdrvn020', 'quang', 'provinces', 'viet', 'storms', 'emergency', 'tropical', 'typhoon', 'n1', 'floods', 'central', 'storm', 'operation', 'landfall']", ,flood

Central Vietnam has been battered by 03 subsequent storms and 01 tropical depression over the past four weeks. Heavy downpours triggered flash floods and landslides, affecting the lives of thousands of people. The country is now preparing for another onslaught from tropical storm Molave which is heading toward Central Vietnam coastline from Da Nang to Phu Yen with maximum sustained winds of level 12, and a gale of level 14. Molave will be the ninth storm landfall over Vietnam this year and the fourth hitting the country in October after Linfa, Nangka, Saudel.

These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.

Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.

The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.

As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing.

In addition, 150,000 people have been evacuated and significant impacts on transportation networks and agricultural livelihoods have been reported.

USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance partner VNRC is on the frontline of the response and has mobilized rapid disaster response teams established and trained through ongoing USAID disaster risk reduction programs to support evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency response operations, said the ambassador.

""We stand together with the government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones, address the damage caused by this terrible flood, and move forward, as the people of Vietnam have always done. We pledge to assist you in your work to rebuild,"" he said.

""I would also like to express my concern for persons with disabilities in the provinces affected by the typhoon as they are amongst the most vulnerable populations in this disaster. They are often home-bound, have less access to information and cannot take full advantage of preparedness activities and evacuation protocols,"" he added.

It is estimated that the provinces impacted by storm Linfa are home to over 200,000 persons with disabilities, of whom 61,000 are directly affected by this disaster.

Since 2000, USAID, through the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, has provided over $26 million in disaster response, preparedness, and risk reduction assistance in Vietnam.

Through the Department of Defense, the U.S. government has also provided more than $28 million since 1998 to train military and civilian emergency responders and develop and equip disaster management centers, maritime response centers, and disaster shelters at community level.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/17/anh124581602340198-1602931391-3782-3057-1602931440_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'response', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'central', 'aids', 'floods', 'landslide', 'usaid', 'affected', 'linfa', '100000', 'cope', 'provided']", ,flood

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to bring them to safety beyond rising floodwater in Cambodia’s western province of Battambang, which is expected to worsen on Sunday.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces – Pursat, Battambang and Pailin – have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall heralding the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

“A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,” Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told the AFP news agency late on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to get worse.

In central Vietnam, almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking northern Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand’s Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to place sandbags and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial Governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Last year, central Vietnam, particularly the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Quang Ngai and Quang Nam, were wrecked by a series of storms and tropical depressions.

The resulting floods and landslides killed at least 192 people and caused property losses of around VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion). More than 1,500 houses were destroyed and 240,000 others damaged. The daily lives of around 5.5 million people were severely disrupted.

The fully probabilistic model provides countrywide coverage and enables insurers to assess their exposure to floods, which affect 70 percent of the country’s population.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue simulating both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding. The fluvial component of the hazard was developed using state-of-the-art hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate rainfall and river discharges across the river network in the country. Pluvial flooding is simulated using a proprietary, in-house methodology accounting for local climate conditions, soil type, land use and topography.

Offering enhanced flexibility, the model can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves, and average annual losses at virtually any level of aggregation. The model outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk® platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region. “The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon. These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.

The entire central region has been battered by downpours since Tuesday as a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

Quang Nam, home to the ancient town of Hoi An and the My Son Sanctuary, received 188 mm of rain in the past day. Rainfall of 180 mm in a day is considered heavy.

Many parts of Hoi An, a famous tourist destination, are submerged.

Nguyen The Hung, vice chairman of the town, said the water level reached 1.3 meters on Thursday morning, 0.3 meters above flood danger level 1, prompting authorities to suspend all tourism-related activities.

Quang Tri, which has the historic Hien Luong Bridge and beautiful beaches, was hit by up to 409 mm of rain in the last two days.

Some residential areas in Lao Bao Town are under three meters of water.

Nguyen Khiem, a resident of Lao Bao, said: ""The floodwaters started to rise from Wednesday night. The water level is 0.5 m higher than during the historic floods of 2019.""

In Huong Hoa District 1,100 families have been evacuated to safer areas, but local authorities said four people were swept away and remain missing as of Thursday.

Many roads in Quang Tri have been blocked by severe landslides.

Quang Binh, home to Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and the world's largest cave Son Doong, received rainfall of up to 338 mm in a day. Many places are inundated and students have been told to stay at home to ensure their safety.

The national park in Bo Trach District has closed itself off to tourists since Wednesday due to rising water levels in some rivers.

Thua Thien-Hue Province, which boasts the popular tourist town Hue, got up to 500 mm of rainfall in the past day.

Prolonged downpours and heavy discharge by dams flooded thousands of homes in the province’s downstream areas.

Many streets in Da Nang, a popular tourist city, were under 40 cm of water on Wednesday.

Central localities from Ha Tinh to Quang Ngai provinces should expect heavy rains of 330-400 mm a day until Sunday, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

The storm also set off landslides and knocked out power lines, leaving 1.7 million people in the dark.



Storm Molave, the ninth storm this year in the South China Sea and the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years, struck coastal provinces on Oct. 28 with heavy rainfall and winds as high as 115-135 km per hour, according to data provided by Vietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting on Wednesday.



Landslides in central provinces have killed at least 19 people and buried more than 40 others, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, adding that the bodies of 12 fishermen missing since the storm hit on Wednesday were recovered on Thursday, leaving another 14 still unaccounted for.



Around 56,000 houses were stripped of their roofs in Quang Ngai, where a massive blackout from downed power lines left more than a million people trapped in darkness as high winds tore through the province, according to state-controlled Vietnam News, AP said.



Wednesday’s storm hit central regions already devastated by weeks of heavy rains, floods, and landslides beginning Oct. 6 that left at least 130 dead and thousands displaced. The floods and landslides also wrecked highways and roads, blocking efforts to rescue and bring supplies to many cut off from help in remote areas.



Speaking to RFA on Thursday, residents in storm-hit provinces described fast-rising waters and devastated fields, with one saying that floodwaters had risen more quickly now than they had during the storms that battered the area earlier this month.



“During previous storms and floods, the water rose only to the height of my hand. But now the water rose so high that my house was submerged,” Hien Thao, a resident of Quang Tri province, speaking to RFA on Oct. 29.



“I lost 500 kg of paddy rice, and many of my household belongings were washed away,” he said.



“Yesterday, the water rose up to the yard of my house,” added 40-year-old Phan Quoc Vu of Truong Xa commune in Cam Lo district’s Cam Hieu village in Quang Tri. “But luckily it began to recede today,” he said.



“In the opinion of my 80-year-old father, this was the worst storm flooding that he can remember,” Vu said.



Calls for help



At the height of the flood, Vu called unsuccessfully to local authorities for help, and even posted calls for help on social media, but finally had to hire canoes to help evacuate elderly people and young children to safer ground, he said.



In Ninh Thuan province, villagers had made their living mainly through farming and raising shrimp, said Tran Thanh Truc, a resident of the province’s Hien Luong commune.



“But the floodwaters washed everything away—pigs, chickens, and shrimp,” she said. “We are glad to receive whatever help others can give us, but it will be difficult to make up for everything that was lost.”



In Quang Tri, supplies including large quantities of rice have been received so far only from volunteers, Hien Thao said, adding that the local People’s Committee has promised to bring relief goods soon.



“I also learned that the government will provide us with seeds for farming our next crop in the winter and spring.”



“We would like them to also give us boats and other equipment we need, along with rice that will help us while we wait for our next crop to be ready for harvest,” he said.



In Truong Xa commune, officials have cared so far only for their own relatives, though, Pham Quoc Vu said.



“They are not impartial, which is causing much suspicion,” he said.



Heavy rains, flooding in Laos



In Laos, heavy rains and flooding from Wednesday’s storm damaged or destroyed around 51,000 hectares of agricultural production, including more than 23,000 hectares of rice fields, across 13 districts of Savannakhet province, state media sources said on Friday.



Total losses in farm production and livestock from flooding in the storm are now estimated at 283 billion kip (U.S. $6,257,968.), Keoodom Souliya—an official from the province’s Agriculture and Forestry Department—said on Thursday.



In the southern province of Champassak, strong winds toppled power lines, while in Borikhamxay province, Khamkeut district’s Napae village was completely destroyed by floods, a video obtained by RFA showed on Friday, with a narrator on the video saying Napae had now become “a sea of water.”



The video also showed floods and landslides blocking the road leading from Napae to the Naphao International Border Checkpoint with Vietnam.



A rice paddy being harvested was also under water, Phetsamai Xayaathichak told local media. “We will announce the exact amount of local damage later, once we know what it is,” he said.



A total number of deaths in Laos resulting from the storm was not immediately available.

The government decided to grant VND500 billion ($21.52 million) to five central provinces worst hit by historic flooding for rescue and social welfare support.

The five provinces, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Nam, would receive VND100 billion each as part of the government’s efforts to help local communities overcome the consequences of devastating floods, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh sait at a meeting in Quang Tri on Thursday morning.

The government also provided each of the five provinces with 1,000 tons of rice alongside medicine and antiseptic chemicals.

Senior Lieutenant General Le Chiem, Deputy Minister of National Defense, said the ministry has provided 22 tons of dried food to flooded provinces. For Quang Tri, military forces also provided seven motorboats, 36 generators and three water pumps for after-flood clean-up work along with 1,000 life jackets.

Chiem suggested local authorities distribute dried food to victims in flood-prone areas immediately and properly.

In the past, the defense ministry found ""some local leaders had given dried food to officials as gifts because it was delicious,"" Chiem said. ""The dried food is meant for flood victims. They are in need.""

Binh said damage caused by floods in Quang Tri was ""very huge,"" especially in the two mountainous districts of Huong Hoa and Dak Rong where infrastructure has been heavily affected.

Therefore, the government has granted an additional VND40 billion for these two districts to cope with the flood impacts.

Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said floodwater started receding gradually, so it is necessary to focus on relief for flood victims, from Quang Nam to Ha Tinh.

Many international organizations have pledged donations of cash and disaster relief to help central Vietnam.

For more than two weeks, the central region has been swept by historic flooding and deadly landslides that caused damage described by government officials as worst in five years.

At least 114 people in central Vietnam were killed by severe flooding and landslides and more than 170,000 houses in flood-prone Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces have been submerged, with many areas currently isolated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/huukhoatangle21603267443-16033-3261-6190-1603358848_1200x0.jpg,"['floodhit', 'dried', 'vietnam', 'binh', 'mln', 'quang', 'aid', 'provinces', '21', 'disaster', 'minister', 'central', 'grants', 'food', 'victims', 'support', 'tri', 'provided']", ,flood

She said the UNDP plans to build an additional 4,000 houses next year, helping 20,000 people gain access to information on climate change and natural disasters, she said, adding that her agency would continue to support Vietnam in natural disaster management over the next decade.

Tran Quang Hoai, head of the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority, said the houses built by the UNDP in central Vietnam were still standing after the region’s historic storms and floods in October and November, which had demolished over 1,500 houses and damaged 240,000 others.

La Thi Kim Ngan, deputy head of the National Institute of Architecture, said that authorities and investors need to create a comprehensive model for housing complexes, complete with infrastructure like electricity, clean water and waste management systems.

Flood resilient houses can become homestay accommodations and help the region develop economically, she added.

Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said his ministry was cooperating with the architecture institute and the Ministry of Construction to develop appropriate and safe housing models to withstand natural disasters.

It is estimated that by 2025, Vietnam would have around 30 million people living in areas prone to natural disasters. Many of them are likely to be poverty stricken.

Rapid urbanization and economic development can intensify natural disaster risks for Vietnam's coastline and wipe billions of dollars off its economic growth over the next decade, a World Bank report warned in October.

Around 11.8 million people in coastal provinces face the threat of intense flooding, and over 35 percent of settlements are located on eroding coastlines. Each year, an average of $852 million, along with around 316,000 jobs in sectors like agriculture, aquaculture and tourism, are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding, the report said.","Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/17/img065481941608185336-16082067-5924-6541-1608206823_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'needs', 'proof', 'flood', 'disaster', 'undp', 'coast', 'management', 'development', 'natural', 'vietnams', 'million', '100000', 'houses', 'coastal']", ,flood

Another powerful storm is testing Southeast Asian disaster responders after Typhoon Goni crashed into the Philippines on 1 November, before veering towards flood-hit central Vietnam.

Goni, known as Rolly in the Philippines, made landfall on Sunday on Catanduanes Island in the country’s east, bringing violent winds and extensive flooding. The Red Cross says there’s “massive devastation” in some areas, including 90 percent of the homes in villages in one part of Catanduanes.

Philippine authorities are still assessing the total damage, but the government said 11 people had died as of 2 November, with numbers still rising.

The evacuation of at least 450,000 people and early response planning helped avoid a worse outcome, but aid groups warn that the combined hit from a barrage of recent storms and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will test communities for months to come.

The Philippines has been locked in disaster response mode for weeks after previous storms caused extensive flooding in parts of Luzon, the country’s main island. Typhoon Molave, known as Quinta in the Philippines, killed at least 23 people in October; Typhoon Saudel, known as Pepito, struck days earlier.

Attention now turns to Vietnam, which is preparing for a weakened Goni to strike its flood-hit central region around 5 November – the country’s fifth major storm since mid-October.

Typhoon Goni’s wind speeds slowed to around 90 kilometres per hour by 2 November, but successive storms over the past month have driven severe floods and landslides across central Vietnam.

Vietnam’s government says roughly 160 people have died, with dozens more missing in the worst flooding to hit the country in 20 years. The disasters have inundated more than a quarter of a million homes, and prompted a $40 million humanitarian appeal targeting 177,000 people.

The Philippines isn’t in the clear, either. Another storm, Atsani or Siony, could careen toward northern Luzon in the coming days, though forecasters say its current path is extremely erratic.

Floods are common during Asia’s various monsoon and cyclone seasons, but aid groups say the damage has been particularly severe this year.

Typhoon Goni was the strongest storm to hit the country since 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,300 people and led to a massive humanitarian response.

Climate change is fuelling more volatile extreme weather across the globe. The Philippines’ first typhoon of the season, Vongfong or Ambo, arrived relatively early in May; the storm season typically hits its peak in July.

Posting on Twitter, Yeb Saño, who was the Philippines’ climate negotiator when Haiyan struck in 2013, said Typhoon Goni and the burst of recent extreme weather is further proof of a crisis.

“The climate emergency persists and is wreaking havoc,” he said.

Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam.

The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.

The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.

The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.

As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.

Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light.""

Australia is already making ongoing efforts to support Vietnam’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $10.5 million assistance package in June.

Earlier this week the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management, the United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

""From 2 a.m. until now, there have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,"" local official Ha Ngoc Duong said, as reported by Vietnamese newspaper VnExpress, warning that the situation could worsen.

The bodies of some 22 soldiers from the army camp were recovered early on Sunday morning, according to local media reports. Ongoing rain has hampered rescue efforts. Days before, 13 rescue team members died trying to reach a group of 30 employees of a hydropower plant that had been buried by the landslides.

The rains have flooded nearly 200,000 houses in the region.

Widespread damage

Authorities also warned that river levels in the country had reached their highest in two decades, state media said.

The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides. Torrential downpours have flooded nearly 200,000 houses and 300 schools in the region.

Since storms began on October 6, some 72 people have died and a further 19 are still missing, Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said in a report.

Though Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, which often bring flooding and landslides, this month's disaster has been the worst the country has faced in years.

Neighboring Cambodia has also been affected by heavy flooding in the region. The death toll there jumped to 20 on Saturday, according to disaster management authorities.

Several areas of Vietnam hit by the worst floods in decades. In the last month, torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing, and created hardship for 240 thousand families. Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs mobilized. The strengthening of relations between the two countries can be linked to the US's anti-Beijing strategies.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) - Taiwan has donated 400,000 US dollars in aid to Vietnam to support the local population, hit by the worst floods and landslides in decades. In the past two weeks, storms no. 6 and 7 have caused serious damage in the central-northern provinces of Hà Tinh, Qu?ng Bình, Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên-Hu? and in the central-southern ones Ðà N?ng, Qu?ng Nam, Qu?ng Ngãi, Bình Ð?nh and Phú Yên.

The Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention reports that torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing since late September. River levels have risen rapidly in central areas of Vietnam, flooding 212 municipalities inhabited by 240 thousand families.

Many communities are isolated; at the moment in the devastated areas it is possible to move mostly with small boats. Victims are in immediate need of food, bottled water, medicine, clothing, blankets and books.

At the end of the emergency, money will be needed for reconstruction, especially seeds and agricultural machinery. Many Vietnamese have mobilized to support the flood victims. Groups of young people, including Catholics, brought rice, spaghetti (noodles) and drinking water to the most remote flooded areas.

Richard Shih, Taiwanese representative in Hanoi, said that Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs operating in Vietnam have mobilized and sent aid to disaster areas. He hopes the victims can rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon.

The aid delivery ceremony took place on 23 October in the presence of Tr?n Quang Hoài, director of the Vietnamese agency for the management of natural disasters. The Hanoi representative thanked the generosity of the government and the people of Taiwan, stressing that the distribution of aid will start as soon as possible.

The Taiwanese authorities highlighted the strong ties that unite their country to Vietnam. More than 320,000 Vietnamese migrants live and work in Taiwan; Taipei is Hanoi's seventh trading partner, with a turnover of 13.5 billion euros in 2019. The two nations also share fears about the growth of Chinese power, an aspect that links the strengthening of their relations with the United States anti-Beijing strategy in the region.","Mon, 26 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM-TAIWAN_-_1026_-_Aiuti_ter.jpg,"['areas', 'donates', 'vietnam', 'dollars', 'aid', 'flood', 'taiwan', 'qu?ng', 'mobilized', 'vietnamese', 'caused', '400000', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

Huynh Kim Luong was standing in a corner of his home, struggling to find a spot for guests to sit. The pots, pans and clothes scattered around the house were illuminated by the light of flickering candles.

""It has been 21 years since I saw such a flood,"" he said.

For the past 10 days the 60-year-old farmer and his family of three have barely stepped outside. In their Huong Toan Commune in Thua Thien-Hue, floods triggered by heavy rains have inundated over 2,000 homes. The only sounds they hear these days are the thump of rain falling on the roof, the clattering of windows in the wind, and distant hums of motorboats moving through the sea of water.

Like many people in central Vietnam, Luong and his wife Hoa were proud of their ability to live with floods. Since the beginning of this month, Hoa has been stocking up rice, dry fish and peanut on warnings of coming storms and rains. They knew not to stock up on meat since electricity is always cut when a storm hits. They were right.

On the morning of October 9 Luong opened his front door only to see the water almost reaching the threshold following heavy rain the previous night. As the hours passed and the rain showed no signs of relenting, the water started to come inside the house. Everywhere in the neighborhood, people were yelling that the floods had come.

Their eldest daughter, who is in her final year of high school, began to put all her books into plastic bags. Her parents waded around the house to salvage the family’s most valuable belongings like the refrigerator, TV and stove, and put them on a table that is reinforced with four blocks of wood.

Within a span of not even a day, Huong Toan turned from green paddy fields to muddy sea in the afternoon. With the electricity duly cut and dusk falling, the area, now flooded for dozens of kilometers along National Highway 1, slowly sank into darkness.

Also on October 9, in Huong Van Commune, about six kilometers away, Le Thi Thuc spent a sleepless night watching the water rise.

""I say ‘keeping watch,’ but the water will rise anyway even if I’m asleep. But my mind can be a little bit at rest if I watch it,"" she said.

The 54-year-old too has been confined at home for several days.

That night the entire family took refuge in the bedroom of her 85-year-old mother, whose room is situated farthest from the water. Thuc told her three children to go to sleep early, reminding them to turn off their phones to save the battery for the coming days without electricity.

Dung, her husband, shone the flashlight at the floor, sighing. The water was closing in. That night none of the three adults in the household slept a wink.

The local rice milling shop closed as soon as it started raining, catching Thuc off guard, leaving her no time to prepare enough food for the family.

Luckily her sister, who lives on higher ground, helped out, rowing a boat to Thuc’s house to deliver much-needed rice, bamboo shoot broth and boiled duck.

Seeing the family of six enjoying a meal sitting on a bed, surrounded by floodwater, Thuc could not help but weep.

For the next eight days the water ebbed and flowed. The children kept asking when the rain would stop, but the weather forecast kept getting gloomier.

The whole family had to shovel and sweep the mud and sludge entering the house. ""It was like walking in a swamp,"" they said.

Last Friday the water started to recede a little, going down to waist level, and Thuc took the opportunity to go out and buy some fish and vegetables. Looking around the neighborhood after being trapped inside the house for a week, she failed to recognize the place.

In Huong Toan, the situation has been grim. With the water showing no signs of receding, Hoang Trong Hieu, the commune chairman, other officials and police officers have not gone home for the last 10 days.

The group, which consists of over 20 people, has divided itself to take 24-hour shifts at the People’s Committee office to distribute supplies and respond to emergencies like transporting the injured and evacuating people.

Since the entire commune is under a meter of water, all travel is done by boat.

""It has been a long time since we saw our feet,"" a member of the group joked, carrying bags of rice on his shoulder in chest-deep water. The man had given Luong’s family two cartons of instant noodles the other day.

The day before electricity was cut, Luong’s had some vegetables, eggs and fish in the refrigerator, but only enough for two days for the family of three. So for the next eight days they had nothing to eat but rice and dry fish.

""I was given instant noodles but did not dare eat them because I did not want to urinate too much,"" he explained.

Luong’s wife, who had surgery just a month ago, stumbled in the dark and fell one night as she sought to go to the bathroom amid the sea of water. Since then he has been placing pots by the bed and replaces the candles twice every night.

""There are a lot of mosquitoes due to all the water.""

In Huong Van Commune, Nguyen Van Lieu, 63, has taken over the most dangerous task from his wife since the floods came: cooking. He dons his conical hat and raincoat every day to light the stove, standing in chest-deep water.

""If my wife gets into the water to cook, it will come up to her neck,"" he joked, patting his wife’s back with a smile.

Their house was almost completed earlier this year but the roof has not been finished. The family is among the luckier ones in the neighborhood since the water only comes up to the thighs even during the heaviest rains.

But the kitchen is a different story. There had been over 20 bags of rice, weighing over a ton, but everything was soaked the very first night. Vy, Lieu’s wife, had no choice but to give them away to her neighbors to feed their ducks and chickens. She has been borrowing rice from others.

They have not told their two eldest children, who are workers in the south, about their situation, not wanting to worry them.

Like many others, the couple have been trapped inside their home, situated just 100 m from the national highway, for more than a week. Every day Vy would cast her gaze on the other side of the highway to look at the paddy fields longingly despite realizing they must be submerged under water.

A few days before the rains came she had sold her first few gourds of the season. ""They sell well this year at VND10,000 (43 cents) per kilogram,"" she said. She was hoping to earn around VND10 million from selling them all over two months.

But that was before the storm came. She was only able to sell for two days, earning VND240,000, before she was forced to remain at home.

She and her husband have been reminiscing about the historic flood in Thua Thien Hue 21 years ago. The deluge in November 1999 had submerged thousands of houses and paralyzed all traffic and electrical and communication systems in the province. There had been rainfall of up to 2,300 mm in just the first three days. Several people had been swept away and killed during that disaster.

At that time the couple and their children stacked two beds on top of each other and waited for the floods to recede, the anguished voices of people who lost loved ones in the background.

Their son, seeing how his parents had to face flooding year after year, wanted to help them find a safer place to live in, but they cannot countenance moving out of their hometown.

More heavy rains are expected in central Vietnam regions at least until Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Rivers are expected to rise further, as is the risk of floods and landslides. Vehicles continue to line up along National Highway 1 and other roads on higher ground as people park their cars and motorbikes there to avoid the water.

But the people cannot do the same, they cannot just leave their houses. The only thing that Luong, Thuc and Lieu can do is to barricade themselves inside their homes and pray for the water to go away","Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/19/fbbdc0d9e2fe1ca045ef7172160297-3133-2038-1603105515_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'misery', 'rice', 'water', 'province', 'rain', 'thuc', 'floods', 'house', 'amid', 'days', 'wife', 'drowns', 'thua', 'night', 'family', 'continuing']", ,flood

Australia, Switzerland and Thailand have offered aid to victims of multiple storms and floods in central Vietnam last month.

The Australian embassy in Hanoi said on Friday its government will provide an additional AUD2 million ($1.45 million) to help Vietnam respond to the impacts of prolonged floods and landslides in the central region. The country had earlier provided AUD100,000 ($71,300).

The aid money will be used to meet urgent needs like providing clean water and sanitation and hygiene and dignity kits to affected people, and support the restoration of clean water supply to schools.

The Swiss embassy also announced grant of urgent aid worth CHF300,000 ($333,000) to help address the immediate needs of 160,000 people focusing on housing, livelihoods, healthcare, water, and hygiene.

In a phone call to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-o-cha, offered $30,000 toward relief efforts.

The central region was repeatedly hit by torrential rains, widespread flooding and landslides triggered by four storms in October.

So far 235 people have been killed or are missing, almost 390,000 houses were flooded and more than 300,000 families have been evacuated, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority.

Many people have lost almost all their household possessions or had their homes, food stocks, livestock, and crops badly damaged.

According to Tran Phuoc Anh, acting director of the city’s Foreign Department, the sustainable flood prevention project for Thu Duc City would have a total investment of more than $1bn, and would be implemented as a public–private project with the participation of the Dutch government.

Le Hoa Binh, deputy chair of HCMC, said he hoped the Netherlands would help create a city that was “sustainable and well adapted to climate change”.

Elizabeth Akkerman, the Dutch ambassador to Vietnam, said her government would help HCMC and Thu Duc City with advanced construction technologies.

Thu Duc will be based on advanced industries such as autonomous manufacturing, and will include the university precinct in Thu Duc as well as a new-build urban area and financial centre on the Thu Thiem Peninsula.

Thu Duc is the most elevated area in HCMC, but still suffers from seasonal flooding, and its residents suffer from inundation of streets and even houses every time there is heavy rain or a high tide.

In May 2019, HCMC sent a delegation to the Netherlands to study its urban development and flood management methods, and a number of memorandums of understanding were subsequently signed, including a $1bn anti-flooding project in Thu Duc City.

A tropical depression is projected to hit central Vietnam on Friday night, bringing heavy rains as the area struggles to recover from more than a week of flooding.

As of 10 a.m. Friday, the tropical depression was about 290 km to the east of Da Nang and Binh Dinh Province, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Its maximum wind speed was 50 kph.

Within the next 12 hours, the tropical depression would move west at about 30 kph, before making landfall in central Vietnam, then devolving into a low-pressure area over southern Laos.

By 10 p.m. Friday, the low-pressure area would be above the mountainous area of central Vietnam, with a maximum wind speed of 40 kph.

Rough seas and strong winds should be expected in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, within the next 24 hours.

Central Vietnam should expect particularly heavy rain from now until Wednesday next week, according to the center. Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and southern Nghe An should expect a total rainfall of up to 900 mm during the period, while Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and northern Nghe An should expect up to 500 mm.

Da Nang and its neighbor Quang Nam Province, home to popular ancient town Hoi An, should expect rainfall of up to 500 mm, while regions between Quang Ngai and Phu Yen should expect levels of up to 350 mm.

The Central Highlands should also expect heavy rain until Sunday, with rainfall of up to 250 mm.

Rains are expected to persist in central Vietnam even after Wednesday, the center noted.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Since last week, central Vietnam has been hit by torrential rains, floods and landslides after a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

On Sunday, Storm Linfa intensified from the turbulence and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. The next day, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

At least 56 people have been killed, including two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while coming to rescue the workers.

Thousands of homes in the region have been flooded.

Torrential downpours and discharge of water from hydropower dams have caused rivers in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces to swell and threaten severe flooding.

Storm Molave, said to be the strongest to hit Vietnam in the last two decades, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Wednesday morning before weakening into a tropical depression by 4 p.m.

The provinces have been hit by rains of up to 500 mm between Tuesday night and Wednesday night. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In Quang Ngai, the Tra Bong River was flowing above flood warning danger level 2 at Chau O station while the Tra Khuc, Ve and Tra Cau rivers had crossed the highest danger level of 3 by 4 p.m. Wednesday, according to the province's Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

They are forecast to continue rising quickly on Thursday, possibly triggering severe flooding in large parts of Quang Ngai Town, the capital, and several districts.

The release of water by local hydropower dams is worsening the situation.

Dak Drinh hydropower plant discharged up to 1,680 cubic meters of water a second on Wednesday and Nuoc Trong, the largest irrigation and hydroelectricity project in the central region, discharged 1,100 cubic meters.

Authorities hurriedly evacuated people living in low-lying areas and made emergency announcements about the water discharge via loudspeakers to warn local residents.

In Quang Nam Province, home to ancient town Hoi An, the water level in the Vu Gia River reached 9.41 meters by early morning Thursday, 0.41 meters above danger level 3, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, which warned rivers in the province would rise quickly in the next few hours.

Dak Mi 4 hydropower plant plans to discharge up to 11,400 cubic meters a second and the Vu Gia River is expected to rise to 11.2 meters, surpassing the historic flood level in 2009.

Nguyen Huu Vu, a local official, said authorities have evacuated over 4,000 families living along the river.

If the hydropower plant discharges over 5,000 cubic meters per second, 120,000 houses would be submerged under 0.5-1.5 meters of water, Vu said.

The National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said on Wednesday that Quang Nam could face severe flooding in the next one or two days.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung instructed provincial authorities to evacuate people from areas threatened by landslides and ensure the safety of reservoirs and hydropower plants.

The central region, including Quang Nam, was hit by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that caused at least 130 deaths.

Phnom Penh (AFP)

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to get them to safety from rising floodwater on Saturday in Cambodia's western province of Battambang.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces -- Pursat, Battambang and Pailin -- have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall ahead of the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

""A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,"" Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told AFP on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to worsen on Sunday.

In central Vietnam almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking north Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to sandbag and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

In Laos, rising floodwater has damaged villages and rice fields along the Xepon and Xebanghieng rivers in Savannakhet province with more rain on the way.

The probabilistic model will provide full national coverage and help re/insurers to assess their exposure to floods – a peril that affects 70% of the population in Vietnam.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue that simulates both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding.

It can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves and average annual losses at any level of aggregation.

Outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region.

“The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon,” Gallagher explained.

“These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flooded.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'model', 'reinsurance', 'population', 'flood', 'guy', 'help', 'launches', 'carpenter', 'vietnamthe', 'includes']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

When a northern cold spell entered the intertropical convergence zone over central Vietnam, it caused abnormally heavy rains and flooding in the region.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh got 400-500 mm, Quang Tri got 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue got 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City got 1,100 mm, Quang Nam got 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai got 600-800 mm.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

The entire central region suffered from severe flooding for days, more than 135,000 houses were submerged under 0.3-4 meters of water, and nearly 46,000 people had to be evacuated.

At least 36 people have died due to flooding and 12 are missing.

Nguyen Van Huong, head of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting’s Climate Forecast Office, said intertropical convergence zone stretches from the Bay of Bengal and across the center of Vietnam to the Philippines.

In these areas clouds and thunderstorms often develop, and when winds from the east meet them, there is an increase in moisture content, which means more thunderstorms, he said.

When the zone has favorable conditions such as the convergence of strong winds that moved over warm seawater, a tropical depression forms and then grows into a storm in the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea, he said.

Since October 6 two storms and a tropical depression have formed in this area.

On Sunday Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.

A day later Storm Nangka formed and hit the coast between the northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa Provinces on Wednesday.

""Storms and tropical depression already cause heavy rains. For instance, Storm Linfa caused rainfall of 500-700 mm,"" Huong said.

On Thursday morning another tropical depression formed over the sea and is heading straight for the central region also with a lot of moisture.

According to the center, more rains are expected in the region until Tuesday or later.

A cold spell coming down from the north and meeting winds from the east also caused heavy rains, Huong said.

The center said the root cause of all these phenomena was La Nina, which appeared in July and is expected to last until early next year. During this period, more storms would form over the East Sea and the rains would last longer than usual, it added.

Four to six more storms and tropical depressions are expected to brew this year with at least two making landfall over the central coast.

La Nina is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years as a result of variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It occurs as strong winds blow warm water on the ocean's surface from South America across the Pacific Ocean toward Indonesia.

The number of patients with melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, has increased sharply at a major hospital in the central region following the prolonged flooding.

Since early October Hue Central Hospital in Thua Thien-Hue Province has admitted 28 people with the disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia Pseudomallei, which infects both humans and animals.

Around half the patients are from Thua Thien-Hue and the rest are from other central provinces like Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri, the province's news website reported.

The hospital is one of three biggest and most advanced general hospitals in Vietnam along with others in Hanoi and HCMC.

It said many of the patients came for treatment only after the disease had become serious, causing sepsis and multi-organ failure and threatening their life.

On November 14 a Quang Binh Province official died of the disease at the hospital.

Phan Thanh Mien, people’s committee chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trach District, had spent days in floodwaters in October managing relief efforts. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee, but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items in inundated areas.

The hospital had treated 83 people with the disease between 2014 and 2019 and 11 in the first nine months of this year.

It said the rise in the number of infections since early October is closely related to the floods that ravaged the central region throughout October and in November.

Various studies around the world have found that melioidosis occurs only in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, with outbreaks occurring after floods and typhoons.

In October central Vietnam was hit by floods thrice.

Melioidosis patients have symptoms like fever, pneumonia and abscesses in and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate is around 40 percent.

The disease was first diagnosed in Vietnam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country.

There are around 10,000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, around half of which prove fatal.

Vietnam Airlines flew over 24 tons of goods and more than 2,000 packages from organizations like the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee, the Red Cross, and individual donations, among others, to support operations in central Vietnam in cities like Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi.

This is just part of Vietnam Airlines’ aid operations. The airline is expecting to fly more than 100 tons of cargo to support relief operations.

Vietnam Airlines, along with its affiliates, is receiving and transporting goods to Central Vietnam free of charge.

For passengers, Vietnam Airlines is also giving people to Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi one extra free bag in addition to their class of service baggage allowance. This will allow passengers to also fly with additional relief items or essential items.

Vietnam Airlines is expecting to fly over 10,000 pieces of luggage free of charge. This will help those who are bringing relief items to the region.

Central Vietnam is facing awful flooding

Devastating floods, some of the most severe in decades, according to CNN, have claimed over 100 lives and led to immense destruction. Over 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and over 691,000 cattle and poultry have either been killed or swept away. Hundreds of thousands of meters of roadways have also been damaged.

In addition to the flooding, landslides have also caused deaths and damage. However, Vietnam, which is no stranger to rain and typhoons, became overwhelmed after facing a particularly fierce set of storms.

Relief agencies rely on airlines to help transport goods and people. Another set of storms is, including a tropical storm, made its way to Vietnam this last weekend as well.

For the flag carrier of Vietnam, it was now time to step up and fly relief. After facing some operational disruptions due to the storm, the carrier became one lifeline to bring much-needed supplies to the region.

Airlines and aid flights

Over the last few months, aid flights have become common when it came to transporting medical supplies. However, airlines are no strangers when it comes to running aid and relief flights.

Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines partnered to send 20,000 pounds of aid on a brand new Boeing 787. Emirates has flown tens of thousands of kilograms of aid to Lebanon since a blast rocked Beirut.

Flag carriers, in particular, tend to step up when the country needs airlines to fly in (or fly out) people and supplies. Vietnam Airlines has used aircraft, like the ATR 72, to fly in aid.

The European Union will provide €1.3 million ($1.52 million) for critical humanitarian assistance to families affected by severe flooding that wreaked havoc across central Vietnam.

The aid will focus on addressing the urgent needs of the most affected people in central Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces, European External Action Service said in a press release.

""This contribution underlines our solidarity with the people of Vietnam, many of whom have suffered the loss of homes, livelihoods and belongings in the wake of the devastating floods,"" said Olivier Brouant, who oversees the EU’s humanitarian response in the Mekong region.

The funding includes the distribution of hygiene kits and other essential relief items while ensuring access to drinking water, sanitation facilities and the promotion of good hygiene practices. Cash transfers will also be provided, allowing people to buy food or items of their choice.

Female-headed households and people with disabilities will be given priority for humanitarian assistance.

The central region was bombarded by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that resulted in at least 130 deaths.

The historic flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated and livestock killed, damage the government claimed to be ""the worst in the past five years.""

Some countries and international organizations recently pledged immediate humanitarian relief to help central Vietnam overcome the consequences of deadly floods.

Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

South Korea pledged relief worth $300,000 while the U.S. has promised $100,000.

With central Vietnam yet to recover from the historic flooding, Storm Molave, the ninth storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Provinces on Wednesday, triggering heavy rains and strong winds for the central region.

Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri.

At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnam’s Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.

A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.

They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.

For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.

At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday.

Saudel is the eighth storm in the East Sea this year, and follows Linfa and Nangka earlier this month.

Over 3,700 UNFPA Dignity Kits worth $180,000 would be provided to the elderly in central Vietnam following a series of storms and tropical depressions that hit the region last year.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) representative in Vietnam, handed over 3,704 kits containing essential items to Bui Quang Huy, standing secretary of the HCMC Communist Youth Union, to support the elderly in three central Vietnam provinces afflicted by floods last year: Ha Tinh, Quang Tri and Quang Ngai at a Wednesday ceremony.

Dignity Kits are a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, mitigate the risk of gender-based violence, and respond to and protect the dignity of women and girls adversely affected by a crisis. Kits meant for the elderly contain items like hand towels, sweaters, socks, wet tissues, toothbrushes, soap, underwear, blankets, flashlights and whistles.

The handover was made possible via financial contributions from U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), according to a UNFPA press release.

The elderly are among the most vulnerable when natural disasters strike, according to UNFPA. During floods and landslides in central Vietnam last year, health facilities were hard hit, causing routine public health programs to be disrupted, it added. The elderly are at risk since they do not always get the care they need, and their vulnerabilities can become a serious challenge to survival and wellbeing, it stated.

Last year, central Vietnam was struck by a series of storms and tropical depressions, triggering heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Over 200 people were killed and property losses amounted to around VND30 trillion ($1.3 trillion). Hundreds of thousands of homes were either destroyed or damaged, affecting the lives of at least 7.7 million residents.

The Vietnamese government has provided around VND770 billion to the region as emergency relief.

With Storm Molave set to make landfall in central Vietnam in the next few days, Vietnamese authorities are preparing to evacuate 1.2 million coast residents to safety.

At 1 p.m. Monday, the storm lay centered around 560 km east-northeast of Southwest Cay islet, with winds of 135 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

Over the next 24 hours, it will move west at 20-25 kph and gradually intensify. At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, it will be 280 km to the north of Southwest Cay with winds of up to 150 kph.

Mai Van Khiem, director of the national forecast center, said at a meeting Monday both the agency and its Japanese counterpart predict the rapidly moving storm would make landfall in central Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces.

The agencies forecast the storm would reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning, before making landfall in the coming hours.

On Wednesday morning, the storm's center would be around 200 km from the coast of Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh with a maximum wind speed of 135 kph, causing waves of up to 10 m.

Storm circulation combined with a cold spell would cause heavy rains on a large scale, and localities stretching over 1,000 km from Nghe An to Phu Yen will be battered by torrential downpours and strong winds from Tuesday until Thursday, with rainfall of between 200-400 mm.

Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh are told to brace for prolonged downpours until Saturday with total rainfall of up to 700 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Mountainous areas will be at high risk of landslides.

Mass evacuation

Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, said with Molave’s strength level, the committee is ready to evacuate over 1.2 million residents in seven central provinces Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

The region, home to popular ancient towns, beautiful beaches and world famous caves, has been bombarded by historic flooding and deadly landslides for the past three weeks, suffering damage government officials described as ""the worst in five years."" At least 130 people have been killed by floods and landslides between October 6 and 25.

Hoai urged provincial leaders to stay in contact with fishing boats, evacuate residents to safety, and make plans to limit storm damage.

There are still 65,000 fishing boats operating along the central coast, of which 45,000 have received official warnings.

""The storm is too strong,"" Hoai said, ordering localities to order boats to take shelter, ban residents from fishing activities, and close all public beaches by Tuesday night.

Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defense has called for the mobilization of more than 368,000 people - soldiers, members of the police force, and civilian volunteers, to assist residents in at-risk areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the meeting that localities must be on high alert and prepare their best flood prevention measures.

""If the storm comes as strong as forecast, damage from rains and floods will be extremely huge,"" Phuc said.

According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Storm Molave's strength is equivalent to Storm Damrey, which hit south central Vietnam in November 2017 and killed 106 people.

Hoang Tan Trong, watching over the family farm in Dong Hoi Town with his father and pregnant wife, witnessed floods tear through his home on the night of October 19. Dao, Trong’s wife, was sitting on their bed, suspended in the air thanks to four ropes connecting it to the roof. But with the walls damaged, the bed wobbled about two meters above ground, leaning to the side.

Seeing what happened, Trong's father, 64-year-old Hoang Tan Truong, immediately jumped into the water and tried securing the ropes, lest Dao fell into the water below.

""We can't just stay here and suffer like this. We need to find a safer house,"" Dao said. That night, Trong rented a motorboat and brought the whole family to the town center, about 2 km away.

Trong later returned to his old home to herd his 30 remaining chickens out of 200 into tree branches to avoid the flood. His three dogs were given to a relative the next day for safe keeping.

""This is the most severe flood since my birth,"" Trong, 44, remarked.

In Dong Hoi, Pham Thanh Hien, 66, frantically relocated his belongings as half-a-meter-deep floodwater swept through his home. A long time resident, Hien said the fact water could invade the house when hydropower plants have yet to discharge water was ""unprecedented.""

Since October 6, heavy rains have inundated the lowlands of Quang Binh. While not suffering fatal landslides like Thua Thien-Hue or Quang Tri provinces, Quang Binh has been the most severely flooded.

The October 19 flood managed to submerge thousands of houses, making even the most hardy residents shudder in fear.

From 1 a.m. on October 16 to 5 p.m. October 20, Quang Binh recorded rainfall of up to 1,380 mm in certain areas. The most heavily flooded was in Le Thuy District, with over 32,000 houses swamped. Throughout the entire province, around 105,000 homes have been similarly affected.

Tran Cong Thuat, chairman of Quang Binh, said: ""Floods this year have eclipsed the record peak in 1979 by up to 0.98 m."" The historic flood peak was recorded on Kien Giang River at 3.91 m. This year, however, the peak remained at 4.89 m for several consecutive days.

""The flood came at night so it was very powerful. The peak was too high, catching certain areas off guard,"" Thuat added. On the night of October 19 alone, thousands of people throughout Quang Binh have called out for help via their phones or social media.

""We still lack boats, but we are doing our best to help alleviate the suffering,"" he said.

Floods in Quang Binh this year not only set new records, but also receded very slowly. By the morning of October 21, traffic across the province remained crippled due to several flooded locations. Over the last fews days, people have confined themselves to their homes, with many of their pets, livestock and vegetables perishing in the water.

It would take a long time for Quang Binh to recover following this historic flood, according to Thuat. As Storm Saudel approaches Vietnamese shores, the province has prepared plans to support people with necessities and food for the coming days.

""During the first days when flood levels rose quickly, we were met with many challenges. But now that the water’s receding, we’ve been surveying heavily flooded and isolated houses so we could perform rescue operations and provide supplies more easily. We would not allow any family to be abandoned amid the flooding,"" said Thuat.

As of Thursday afternoon, at least 10 people have died in Quang Binh due to floods.

The field was the primary source of income to feed his family of three.

As he inspected the damage done by the prolonged flooding central Vietnam has had to suffer, he noted that some paddy sections had been swept away by floodwaters, while his tapioca field, cultivated over the past 10 months, was buried in rubble.

""We don’t know what to plant to make a living,"" said Rao, a 46-year-old resident of Huong Son Commune in Quang Tri’s Huong Hoa District. Two wet bags of grains they have are all that’s left for the next six months, he said, adding that on sunny days, he would put them out to dry.

The Huong Son Commune has over 192 ha of paddy fields, but around 90 ha were buried under rocks and wood rotting deposited by the floods, rendering them unusable and irrecoverable. Le Trong Tuong, chairman of the Huong Son People’s Committee, said residents were facing food shortages in the future for people.

In Quang Binh Province’s Bo Trach District, Le Xuan Uyen, 56, sees his field buried under mud and soil a meter deep, meaning he cannot plant new saplings for the winter-spring season without putting in significant time and efforts to clean the place up.

Worse still, the soil the fields are buried under has toxic properties that would kill paddy if they’re planted, he said. ""We are worried because we have missed the season for planting, and we don’t know what to plant anyway.""

The Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences said the top soil layer that covers several areas in Bo Trach District is actually heavy clay layers, which would make it difficult for cultivation if left as it is. Farmers should switch to different plants to adapt to the new layers, the academy has suggested.

Around 1,650 ha of fields in Quang Tri were inundated in the past month. Provincial authorities are now cooperating with the people to salvage the buried fields to prepare for the winter-spring planting season in just a month, said Ha Si Dong, deputy chairman of Quang Tri. But as the fields are large, ample time, it would take a lot of people and equipment to complete the job, he added.

Recovery efforts should be completed by mid-December so new saplings can be planted for the winter-spring season on time, Quang Tri authorities have said.

The chance of such events could increase five to 10 times by 2050, resulting in economic and infrastructural damage that could cost billions of dollars, according to a McKinsey report, dated April. The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.

Ho Chi Minh City, a historic flood area located some 1,000 miles south of the capital Hanoi, contributes about a quarter of the Vietnam’s gross domestic product. While the metropolis can cope with flood risks today that could hit 23% of its area, further urbanization is raising the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels. Those could cause about $8.4 billion of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact, McKinsey said.

The city still has time to adapt to avoid such risks by having better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas, McKinsey said. Investments and fund-raising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.

73,73,FL-2018-000074-VNM,Vietnam suffers through a “new normal” of extreme weather events - WSWS,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/28/viet-o28.html,"Vietnam is being pummelled by ongoing tropical storms causing major flooding and landslides in its central regions. As of Monday morning, the death toll had reached 130 with 18 people missing, according to government figures. This was up from 119 fatalities on Saturday, with most occurring in the central provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam.

Close to a million people have been severely affected, with many in desperate need of shelter, food, clean drinking water and income support. According to the UN, as of last Thursday, at least 178,000 homes were currently under water.

Flood levels eclipsed the 1979 record by 0.98 metres, hovering at 4.89 metres for several consecutive days in the province of Quang Binh. The amount of rain that fell between October 6 and 13 was two to six times higher than normal in some regions.

Most of the hardest hit have been poor farmers. Agricultural damage has been extensive, with 1,500 hectares of rice fields and 7,800 hectares of other crops being either flooded or damaged. Close to a million head of cattle and poultry have also been killed or swept away.

The government has stated that the damage caused has been “the worst in five years”. Several highways and local roads are blocked with rocks the size of cars, hampering rescue efforts.

About a third of deaths have been of military personnel.

In one instance, a team of 21 rescuers, most of them military officers, was sent to verify reports of 17 workers buried by a landslide at the Rao Trang 3 hydroelectric plant deep in the jungle. The workers were reportedly asleep when they were buried on October 12.

The rescue team stopped at a ranger station for the night and were buried in a rocky landslide. Of the 13 deaths, 11 were from the military. Only four of the 17 workers at the dam have been recovered thus far and authorities have deployed more rescue forces to the scene.

Days later, a barracks in Quang Tri was consumed by a mudslide in the early hours of the morning, killing 20 military personnel, likely the largest number of military casualties suffered in a period of peace, according to officials.

Scientists believe flooding in central Vietnam is the result of a “new normal” of weather patterns driven by complex processes.

On an international scale, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDDR) reported recently a 75 percent increase in natural disasters in the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, there were 4,212 major natural disasters. Between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded costing 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy USD$2.97 trillion.

The increase is largely attributed to climate related events such as floods, droughts and storms.

Speaking at a virtual conference, UNDDR chief Mami Mizutori accused governments of abandoning effective measures to deal with climate change, “It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction,” he said, “despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.”

In the Asia Pacific, the cyclical la Nina phenomenon is intensifying storms in the region, and is expected to continue until early next year. Cambodia has reported 39 deaths from flooding, with hundreds of thousands affected and 46,216 people evacuated to safer ground.

Vietnam has been hit by three tropical storms and a depression in the month of October. Typhoon Mojave, at present travelling westwards over the Philippines, is also likely to impact in the weeks ahead. It is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds of 130 kilometres per hour. About 9,000 people in the Philippines have fled their homes.

Professor of human ecology at Rutgers University, Pamela McElwee, told the New York Times that the sheer volume of rainfall in Vietnam was, “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it shattered the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in its central regions by the end of the century.

She also stated that the construction of hydroelectric dams and poor mountain roads had weakened the soil. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go.”

Christopher Rassi, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross, warned of the economic fallout: “We are seeing a deadly double disaster unfold before our eyes as these floods compound the difficulties caused by COVID-19. These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.”

The Vietnamese economy relies heavily on its tourism industry which has been drastically cut back during the pandemic. Borders were virtually closed in late March. Apart from an outbreak in Da Nang Hospital in late July, total cases have been kept low and contained at under 1,500, with 40 deaths.

The Asian Development Bank assessed in September that Vietnam’s economy would grow at around 1.8 percent in 2020, its slowest rate in 35 years and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.

The Stalinist regime in Vietnam has ruthlessly pursued a policy of capitalist restoration for decades. According to its own estimates, economic inequality is worsening. Between 2014 and 2018 the GINI index of Vietnam, a standard measure of income inequality, was 0.4 [where 0 represents absolute equality and 1 absolute inequality]. The figure is regarded as a tipping point with higher numbers frequently associated with social unrest and political instability.

Out of fear of social unrest, the regime has sought to suppress criticism from workers and the peasantry. According to the UN, hundreds of people have been interrogated so far over COVID-19 related Facebook posts. In the lead up to the congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in January 2021, the government has begun a campaign of censoring dissident and left-wing publications.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wsws.org/asset/64544160-f1d1-4d85-aecd-24bd939be1eb?rendition=image1280,"['vietnam', 'normal', 'storms', 'quang', 'according', 'extreme', 'workers', 'central', 'events', 'military', 'million', 'rescue', 'suffers', 'weather']", ,flood
74,74,FL-2018-000074-VNM,Flood relief necessary but post-disaster reconstruction vital - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/perspectives/flood-relief-necessary-but-post-disaster-reconstruction-vital-4182755.html,"Nguyen Thi Vung had to keep an eye on her sow for five days straight during the flooding in Thua Thien-Hue Province and lost three kilograms consequently.

Phan Duong

She was worried the 80-kilogram beast might be swept away or escape.

The resident of a village in Quang Dien District explains: ""Pigs can be really destructive if they escape. I did not dare sleep at night.""

Central Vietnam has been hit hard by tropical storms, torrential downpours, floods, and landslides for three weeks now.

The woman, who is in her 50s, took the sow and its litter of four to her brother’s house since it is on higher ground than hers, and never left them alone for a moment.

With a stick in one hand, she made sure the sow behaved. But the animal was spooked and attacked her more than once. Vung has a wound on her right thigh from a bite.

But importantly she has been able to safeguard the family’s most valuable asset.

She had spent a year raising the pig and saw it give birth to four piglets. If she manages to keep all of them safe, and the animal continues to have more litters, she can solve the problem she has been facing: that of paying her daughter’s tuition.

Her daughter is a freshman at a college in Da Nang City, and Vung has to send her VND1.5 million ($65) every month for living expenses besides paying VND6 million a year tuition for the two-year course.

Since her daughter was in 10th grade Vung had been telling her, ""I think you should drop out of school and work; I am not able to afford your schooling.""

But the girl would plead: ""Please let me stay in school so that I can have a proper career in future and build us a better life.""

Vung relented.

Their family consists of just the two of them. Vung does the best she can, growing rice on a 750-square-meter farm and doing agricultural labor and menial jobs for others.

Every year in October she travels to the Central Highlands to harvest coffee and cassava for farmers there. But this year she has been stuck in floods described as the worst in decades.

Earlier this year, along with many other localities across Vietnam, Thua Thien-Hue was also hit by the African swine fever, an incurable and fatal disease in pigs.

Vung worked for other farmers, burying pigs killed by the disease.

""God blessed me and kept my sow healthy.""

Now she has once again kept the sow safe through the floods.

But she has not been able to save a small flock of chickens and a cassava crop that had almost been ready for harvest.

All hopes for the mother and daughter’s future now rest on that one sow.

When meeting us in the courtyard of a government office to receive a donation of essential items from readers of VnExpress through FPT’s Hope Foundation, Vung cannot hold back her tears, and tells us all about her pigs and chickens.

The floodwaters have now started receding in several parts of the central region, including her Quang Dien District, and people are trying to pick up the pieces again after two weeks of living with the floods.

Vung is still at her brother’s house with her pigs since it is still not safe to return home.

Her 20-year-old single-storied house has deteriorated and its walls are cracked, and now after the floods Vung is afraid they could collapse at any time.

""More storms are coming, so I’d better stay here.""

Storm Molave is expected to reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning.

In Phong Dien, another district in Thua Thien Hue, we met Le Thi Sinh, 51.

Three years ago her son passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children. Her daughter-in-law works elsewhere and sends home money for Sinh and her husband to raise the two kids, one of whom is learning to talk while the other is in kindergarten. Sinh’s husband has a number of health problems and so she is the family’s breadwinner.

No one had foreseen such severe flooding. Like many other locals, Sinh and her husband did not have enough time to prepare for the disaster.

When the waters came, they packed off the children, belongings and grain to the first floor. They hung their six piglets, each weighing around 15 kg, from the ceiling, but one was swept away and another was killed.

The floods also swept away their flock of 200 chickens and destroyed their cassava and sweet potato crops.

Her grandchildren cried and asked for their mother. Then they asked for their father after seeing a man next door casting a net to catch fish. There was nothing Sinh could do except shed tears of grief.

Sinh still has a litany of problems to worry about like a loan she took to buy supplements for the pigs and chickens and buying formula and other essential items for the children.

She hopes to get relief from the authorities and plant a new crops and resume her livestock and poultry farming.

In the district’s Phong Xuan Commune, locals grow trees and paddy. In May Storm Noul destroyed grown paperbark and acacia trees, and now the floods have destroyed all the young ones.

In Phong Hien Commune 2,000 families have been living in the floodwaters. They have lost 250 hectares (620 acres) of cassava, 27 hectares of glittering chive, 25 hectares of sugarcane, and 15 hectares of other crops.

""There is nothing left,"" Nguyen Si Hiep, chairman of the commune Fatherland Front Committee, said. The front, an overarching public organization, is tasked with ""promoting national solidarity and unity of mind in political and spiritual matters,"" and conducting many of the government's social programs, especially those to mitigate poverty.

Hiep said the commune administration is advising farmers to switch to short-term crops after the floods recede so that they could earn some income before the new year arrives.

There is way too much attention on flood relief though it is just one part of the big picture when a natural disaster strikes. Reconstructing the livelihoods and rebuilding the lives of millions of people in the central region is now a serious challenge in what has already been a disastrous year.

A World Bank report released last week estimated that 12 million people living in coastal provinces face the threat of severe flooding and over 35 percent of people live on eroding coastlines.

Each year an average of $852 million and 316,000 jobs in key economic sectors are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding.

In this context, I reviewed the concept of social capital. Economists treat social capital as an important resource of the nation. It is understood as the two-way and multidimensional cooperation between members of the society, the power of connection between people in a community, a country, and transactions based on mutual trust that bring mutual benefit.

The fact that Vietnamese everywhere are pitching in to provide succor to people in the central region these days is an expression of social capital in Vietnam.

The World Bank believes that social capital helps the community coordinate voluntarily and effectively because it is based on a common goal to help solve collective problems. The natural disasters in the central region are a collective problem. To address this problem, the government can collaborate with the community and make use of the social capital that has been on display in recent days.

Dealing with the aftermath of the floods gives the government an opportunity to tweak its policies. Authorities should make appropriate decisions to remove unnecessary barriers, paving the way for an increase in tolerance and trust, which would help heal the wounds caused by natural disasters.

A timely and substantial reconstruction plan for people like Vung and Sinh will help soothe the gaping economic wounds suffered by the central region, sustain growth and lead to a sustainable development vision for the country.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

VnExpress’s Hope Foundation is soliciting emergency support for people in central Vietnam, whose lives have been impacted by severe floods and landslides since earlier this month.

When the floodwaters rose on October 12 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Hoang Thi Phuong, a textile worker in Phong Dien District, went into labor.

Her husband tried to take her to hospital, but their motorbike could not cross a flooded section of National Highway 1A. In desperation, he asked a person with a boat to take his wife to the other side.

But the boat capsized just 20 meters from safety. Both Phuong and her unborn baby died.

""I killed you,"" her husband sobbed inconsolably, down on his knees in front of the raging floods that had snatched away his loved ones.

They are not the only victims of the tragedy that has befallen central Vietnam in the last two weeks. Dozens of others, including at least two hydropower plant workers and 13 members of a rescue team, lost their lives to landslides in Thua Thien-Hue.

In the last 10 days nonstop rain and floods have submerged entire regions under a sea of water and triggered massive landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of thousands of houses have been engulfed, and the death toll has been rising relentlessly.

Thousands of families face food and water shortages, and the floods do not seem likely to recede any time soon.

As fighters on the frontlines in a battle against nature, soldiers, doctors, rescuers, and thousands of others have had to take on the harsh and unrelenting elements.

What they need right now are boats, medicines, food, clothes, rescue equipment, and other supplies.

The Hope Foundation by VnExpress and FPT is calling for emergency support for millions of people in central Vietnam. We are soliciting help from every person and every section of the community, and trying to find the quickest way to help those in need right now.

Highlights

From October 6th, the Central region observed prolonged heavy rains that caused severe and widespread flooding and landslides. Water levels have risen rapidly flooding large areas in the provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh. Hieu river (Quang Tri) and Bo river (Hue) reached historical high flood levels.

In response, the Government of Viet Nam: i) Conducted daily meetings of the Central Steering Committee of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (CCNDPC); ii) Sent missions to the affected provinces to provide concrete guidance, support and coordination; iii) Released a call for emergency relief and support, sent to international organizations; iv) Is planning to hold a meeting convening the Disaster Risk Reduction Partnership, on Monday 19th to discuss and coordinate international support.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539933-Flash%20Update%20No.%201%20-%20Viet%20Nam%20Floods.png?itok=aGT5G35x,"['storms', 'update', 'nam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'quang', 'viet', 'coordinator', 'provinces', 'issued', 'office', 'floods', 'river', 'sent', 'resident', 'support', 'tri']", ,none
78,78,FL-2018-000074-VNM,One million swamped by deadly floods as Viet Nam faces another major storm - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/one-million-swamped-deadly-floods-viet-nam-faces-another-major-storm,"Kuala Lumpur/Hanoi/Geneva, October 14, 2020 – Close to a million people have been severely affected by prolonged flooding in central Viet Nam as the country faces another major tropical storm and further dangerous floods.

Red Cross holds grave fears that deadly floods, which have submerged the country’s central provinces over recent days, will worsen as tropical storm Nangka makes landfall today, bringing destructive winds and dumping more rain on hard hit communities.

Since the floods began in early October, at least 28 people have been killed, more than 200,000 homes flooded and an estimated 84,000 hectares of crops damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people – many cut off by the floodwater – are now in desperate need of emergency relief.

As part of a coordinated relief effort, Viet Nam Red Cross staff and volunteers have been accessing isolated communities by boat to provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and other much needed supplies. More relief supplies are urgently being brought in from other parts of the country.

Mr Hoa Nguyen, Deputy Director of External Relations and Development, Viet Nam Red Cross, said: “Our volunteers and staff have been working in the affected areas since the floods began, providing relief supplies to thousands of people, but we need to reach many more as the rain continues and floods worsen. Every day we hear of more families who have lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods.”

Hung Ha Nguyen, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator said: “These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods.”

“Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities, especially on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need to help ensure families receive the relief they need in the coming days and weeks,” Mr Hung Ha said.

So far, at least 235 people have died or been listed missing after the floods and landslides triggered by storms and heavy rains in central Vietnam last month, the government informed the National Assembly Tuesday.

Among the casualties were 35 military officers and soldiers of two different military teams sent on search and rescue missions after landslides hit several districts in the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri.

The region suffered historic flooding, with the peak time falling between October 12 and 19. Floodwaters inundated the homes of 317,000 families with 1.2 million members from Nghe An to Quang Nam, with many areas being flooded for nearly two weeks.

Over 200,000 houses were seriously damaged. Many public construction projects also suffered heavy damage and roads were heavily eroded.

Of the total damage of VND17 trillion, VND10 trillion ($430.16 million) was caused by Molave, one of the most powerful storms to hit Vietnam, the government said.

The storm made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28, causing heavy rains and deadly landslides in the central region.

Earlier, the government granted over VND1 trillion, over 11,500 tons of rice and other essential items in relief support for the worst-hit central provinces.

Not over

The government said it would continue to mobilize all forces to search for the victims buried in several landslides and fishermen missing at sea. Among the missing are 12 hydropower plant workers in Thua Thien-Hue Province who were hit by a landslide on October 12, 19 residents in Quang Nam Province hit by two landslides as an impact of Storm Molave last week, and 23 fishermen from Binh Dinh Province whose boats sank in rough sea as the storm was near.

Priority in relief support will be given to those in worst-hit localities and isolated areas and to quickly repairing infrastructure and public construction works damaged by storms and floods, the parliament was told.

The government is also joining forces with local authorities to evacuate residents from high risk areas as storm Goni, the 10th storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, heads towards south-central Vietnam.

International forecasting agencies expect the storm to directly affect the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.

Natural disasters, predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

80,80,FL-2018-000074-VNM,Anguish as Mekong Delta’s annual floods continue to dry up - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/anguish-as-mekong-delta-s-annual-floods-continue-to-dry-up-4171382.html,"It is time for the annual floods in the Mekong Delta, but the flooding season these days is more a cherished memory than a practical phenomenon.

One day in mid-September Cao Van Bi, 50, was rowing a boat with his wife across a paddy field that had been partially flooded.

All over the field, in Phu Hoi, a rural commune in An Giang Province’s An Phu District, traps had been set up to catch fish.

That morning the catch was 2.5 kilograms of carp and five kilograms of other fish and shrimp.

In previous years, during the flooding season, Bi would have got dozens of kilograms worth of fish every day, but these days it never exceeds 10 kg.

Cao Van Bi and his wife collect the fish they catch in one morning in mid September, 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Nam.

The reason is that the annual flooding of Vietnam's Mekong Delta from the upstream Mekong before reaching the sea no longer occurs.

Not far away, in Vinh Hoi Dong Commune in An Phu, Phan Van Lang, 54, was standing in front of his house.

Since they live in an area hit by annual flooding, Lang and his neighbors have their houses built well above the ground. His house is nearly three meters in the air with a flight of the stairs leading up from the road. In 2000, for instance, the floodwater almost reached the house. But ever since the flooding levels have kept decreasing.

Pointing at the road in front of his house, he says the entire road would have been under one meter of water at this time of the year but this year, the water has not even reached the road.

Hung Dien Commune in Long An Province's Tan Hung District, 80 km (50 miles) away, has been witnessing the clearest change.

In the past its paddy fields would have waters reaching waist high and be filled with water lilies and boats would be the only means of getting around.

That scene now exists only in the memories of seniors.

Bay De, 53, who has been fishing for more than 30 years, recalls floods when catching up to 200 kg of various kinds of fish every day and earning a million dong ($40) was a ""piece of cake.""

For several weeks now he has not caught any fish. He spends almost every day drinking tea and chatting with neighbors in his thatched house.

Fifty kilometers away, Tran Van Thanh, 58, of Tan Lap Commune in Moc Hoa District is fixing traps for catching crabs.

He has been doing this for dozens of years, a job that has ensured a decent livelihood, but that has changed.

""I used to set up more than 600 traps during the flood season, but only a few tens of them these days because the flood waters are way too low and there are no crabs to catch.""

In the neighboring province of Dong Thap, Nguyen Van Phuong, 42, of Tan Thanh A Commune in Tan Hong District is watching the news on TV for possible information about the floods, something he has been looking forward to for several weeks now.

He has an eight-hectare rice field and has been waiting for the floods to come so that he could start sowing the winter-spring crop.

There was heavy rain a few weeks ago, and water had filled up canals and then reached the fields. Phuong, thinking the floods had finally arrived, hired people to till the soil.

But soon a scorching sun replaced the rains and water dropped, leaving the field dry and cracked once again.

He says: ""I had spent VND750,000 ($32.44) per hectare, but that has been a wasted effort. Now I have to wait for the floodwaters to come and do that all over again.""

In his neighborhood, farmers are now worried that if the floods do not come or are low, they would have to shell out money to pump water from canals into their fields.

Rice farmers in the delta have for generations depended on the floodwaters to come and inundate their fields before sow seeds directly.

The Plain of Reeds, a wetland straddling Long An and Dong Thap provinces, produces more than two million tons of rice a year.

The floods usually start coming in late July or early August and remain until November or even later to bless the region with extraordinary fertility as they typically deposit silt from upstream areas.

When they do not come or arrive late, cropping and fishing activities are disrupted.

For several years now they have been late or deficient, and experts have been blaming this on climate change and the construction of a series of dams in the upstream area.

According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, this year’s floodwater level in the delta will be only 55 percent of the long-term average, which translates into a shortfall of 130 billion cubic meters.

It will be 15 percent lower than last year’s level and the lowest in a decade, it has warned.

Late last year the highest water levels in the upstream areas of the delta were 1.12-2 meters lower than the long-term average and 1-1.65 meters lower than in the previous year.

The delta suffered the worst salinity levels and resultant freshwater shortage in 100 years but meteorologists warn things could get worse.

Tran Tan Tai, deputy head of the agriculture department of Long An’s Tan Hung District, says the water level in his hometown is currently 1.4 meters, or 80 centimeters lower than a year ago.

""If there are no floods, the fields will lack silt, and pathogens and wild grass seeds will not be washed away, and farmers will have to spend more on pesticide and fertilizers.""

Meteorologists expect the floods to come around the middle of this month, stay low and ebb away quickly.

Those were the days

Early one morning in late September, Muoi, 64, of Tan Lap rides a motorbike to a wet market two kilometers away from home. He returned after a while with a bag of barb.

""All my life I have seen fish all over the place every time it is the flooding season, but now I have to go buy them... Isn’t it weird?""

Not far from his home a neighbor had set up a lift net the previous night, but until around noon the next day, when Muoi returned from the market, it had only around two kilograms of fish.

Muoi can never forget what it was like one or two decades ago: Every year when the flood season arrived, water would be everywhere, covering the fields and even the streets. People would be rowing boats, picking water lilies and river hemp, both used to make specialty dishes of the region.

In the water, there would be so much fish that anyone could become a fisherman without having to learn any skills.

""Back then people did not weigh fish in kilograms but in a unit of around 20 kilograms. Normally, in one night a family could catch at least five to seven of that unit. Some would even feed the fish to their pigs.""

In years of heavy flooding fish moving down stream into the delta would breed along the way, and it would be extremely rare to see a field or waterway without fish in it.

Fishermen would enlarge the holes in their net to only catch adult fish, leaving the young ones untouched.

When the floods retreated, mud, algae and water lilies would be left in the paddy fields. The fields mud would be silt while the algae and flowers served as organic fertilizers, leaving the fields with all the nutrition they needed.

Besides, the floods would wash away the pathogens and wild grass seeds, and it was not common for farmers to use fertilizers or pesticides.

A kilometer away from Muoi’s place, Danh Van Minh, 62, asks his son to take him by motorbike to a house nearby. The house stands along a canal and in front is a concrete road around three meters wide.

""This used to be a small dirt road, and every year during this season it would be two or three meters under water,"" Minh says.

""The house used to be just a hut beside which I would anchor my boat after fishing.""

Minh’s life has been filled with tragedy. He lost his first wife and two of his children during two different flood seasons.

In the middle of the 1991 season his wife had twins, but both died at birth due to lack of medical care in that rural area.

Worse still the floods covered every inch of land that they could not find a place to bury the children. All he could do was put their bodies in a coffin, stick a bamboo pole in the water and hang the coffin up that.

Only a month after they passed away could he give them a proper burial.

Five years after they lost the twins, Minh’s wife suddenly fell sick and died. Once again he could not bury her immediately, and had to leave her body inside a coffin on the family boat and leave it anchored next to the hut.

In the past 20 years the delta has witnessed several floods that left a significant impact on its residents, especially in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2011.

The 2000 floods were the most severe in 70 years, with the water rising to 4.78 meters. They claimed 481 lives and caused losses of nearly VND4 trillion.

As told by Le Thanh Tam, party chief of Long An Province in 1999-2005, 20 years ago and further, the Plain of Reeds had heavy floods almost every year.

The region had not yet got an embankment system, and every time it flooded there was no way to tell where the road was and where the canal was. The only way people could move around was by boat.

""Back then we always had fish, shrimps and crabs in abundance, but we would lose lives every year, and of children in most cases.

""When the floods retreated, we had to expend a lot of effort to rebuild houses and roads.""

But a 2017 study by the Mekong River Commission estimated that the flooding provides $8-10 billion in annual economic benefits while causing losses of just $60-70 million.

The Mekong River flows through six countries, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before reaching the sea.

Many parts of the Mekong Delta were formed by sedimentation over eons.

When the Vietnamese expanded their nation to the south, they began to conquer the delta in the 18th century. For generations, no other place in the nation could compare with it as a agriculture and aquaculture hub.

In his book ‘Last days of the Mighty Mekong’ published in February last year, Brian Eyler, director of the Asia Program at U.S. think tank Stimson Center, writes: ""For the past 3,000 years, the Mekong carried about 150 million tons of sediment in its system to the delta each year.""

Without the sedimentation, the delta’s land would fall apart under natural conditions, which are worsened by intense groundwater extraction and sea level rise, he says.

He strongly condemns China’s dam building in the upstream areas of the Mekong for holding back floodwaters and, along with them, sediments.

Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent researcher into the ecology of the Mekong Delta, says the main cause of the low floods this year is the El Nino phenomenon that lasted from the year’s beginning to the end of August, resulting in scanty rain fall in the region.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the rainy season arrived late last year and was shorter than usual, with the result that rainfall was 8 percent below normal at 1,240 mm.

Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of Can Tho University’s Research Institute of Climate Change, says the calamity faced by the delta cannot be blamed just on nature or Chinese dams.

""Sea levels rise and the Earth gets warmer. Yes. But that happens just a little each year and it needs a long period for dramatic changes. It is humans who have accelerated that process.""

He cites one example of human action that changed the delta’s hydrological profile. Ever since the delta was formed, it has had several low-lying areas like the Long Xuyen quadrilateral in Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and Can Tho City and the Plain of Reeds that worked as natural reservoirs to store the seasonal floodwaters, he explains.

For generations farmers did not use them for cultivation, but due to the wars, the nation had to consider food security, and built embankments to keep the seasonal floodwaters from flowing into them and directed the water toward the sea, he says.

""Now in peace time, we still have the mindset of growing as much rice as we can, and many have treated the seasonal floods as a disaster for their paddy fields while in fact it is a blessing.

""With that thinking, many have continued to keep out the floods, going against nature, thus intensifying the lack of water once it took hold in the region.""

Minh, who has been a poor farmer his entire life and is haunted by a tragic past related to the floods, does not care much for the explanations experts like Tuan have to offer.

After his wife’s death, he took his son to another village, remarried and built a new life.

He now owns a 6,000 sq.m rice field and both his home and field are surrounded by embankments, allowing him and others in his neighborhood to go against nature and cultivate three instead of just two rice crops as in the past.

The field does not have any time to recover, and instead of getting floodwaters that wash it clean and deposit sediments, it has to do with plant protection chemicals instead.

With this method of growing rice, farmers remain mired in poverty since they have to spend money on fertilizers and pesticides for every crop and also lose out on an abundant source of fish, shrimp and crab and the plants that always grow in the flood season.

""My children and grandchildren have all taken turns to leave,"" Minh says, reflecting the trend of delta dwellers abandoning their hometown for Ho Chi Minh City and other industrial areas, where they work in factories or the service sector.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/05/lu-dong-thap-muoi-2300-1601345-2309-7479-1601885014_1200x0.jpg,"['continue', 'annual', 'field', 'water', 'dry', 'flooding', 'floods', 'delta', 'anguish', 'mekong', 'fields', 'season', 'away', 'fish', 'deltas']", ,flood

Highways in the provinces have also been severely damaged, with the total cost of repairs estimated at around VND 355 billion, state media said, citing figures provided by the Directorate of Roads of Vietnam on Oct. 21.

Also on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung and deputies of Vietnam’s National Assembly welcomed efforts by Vietnamese pop star Thuy Tien to collect more than VND 100 billion (U.S. $15,316,811) for relief work in flood-hit Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue.

Large-scale fundraising is normally restricted by law to state organizations or social associations to reduce the risk of personal gain, with penalties prescribed for violations. But National Assembly deputy Le Thanh Vanh voiced confidence in the work of Thuy Tien and her staff.

“They are ready to take responsibility before the sponsors who donated the funds,” Vanh said, quoted on Oct. 21 in state media reports. “I am sure they will be completely transparent,” he said.

Relief teams have poured for the last few days into central regions hit by floods and landslides that have destroyed roads and buried workers at a hydropower plant and soldiers at a military barracks, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told state media on Wednesday.

Many areas have already received help, while others remain cut off because of damaged roads, Dung said, calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to send more teams to reach remote areas and give further support to those already helped.

34 now killed in Cambodia

Relief work meanwhile continues in Cambodia, where 34 people have now been killed by floods to date, with Prime Minister Hun Sen urging local authorities to guard damaged homes to prevent looting and calling on banks and other lending institutions to delay or reduce payments owed to them by villagers impoverished by the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 has hit us hard for the last 10 months, and now we are facing floods that are destroying us,” Hun Sen said.

“We have not concluded our damage assessments yet. For now, we are just working to rescue people and take them to safer areas,” he said.

Around 10,000 families have already been safely evacuated from flood-hit areas, Cambodian media sources say.

Speaking to RFA, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha said that flood waters are now receding in several provinces, including Oddor Meanchey, Pursat, Takeo, Pailin, Kampong Speu, Stung Treng, and the two hardest-hit provinces of Banteay Meahchey and Battambang.

The 34 flood deaths reported so far reflect the inability of central government and local authorities to deal effectively with the disaster, said Kean Ponlok, secretary general of the Cambodia Intellectual Students Alliance.

“The authorities must look into the causes of these deaths and hold themselves responsible,” he said, adding that because of corruption in Cambodia, he is not convinced that all donations handed over to the government will be spent on victims of the floods.

Banteay Meanchey villager Nay Thoeun said she has now lost her home and job because of the floods and is debt after borrowing money from a bank to buy medicine to treat the tuberculosis to which she was exposed in her family.

“I am very worried. I’m living now under a shelter on a hill, but the water is still rising here, and I’m afraid of [venomous insects].”

“I’m urgently calling for aid to be delivered to this hill. There are many poor families here,” she said.

Flood begins to recede in Laos

In Laos, flood waters have begun to recede from eight districts in Savannakhet province, where 125 villages containing 5,134 families, or nearly 30,000 people, have been affected, Lao media sources say.

In the province’s Sepon district alone, 40 villages containing nearly a thousand households have been flooded, with many houses completely destroyed, sources said.

Sepon’s La Or and Vang Khot villages were hardest hit, with 44 houses swept away, and another 90 dwellings hit by fast-running floods and partly damaged, a district official said on Oct. 21.

“The district is still asking for help, but we will set up temporary refuges in the villages for people to live in,” the official said, adding that funds are being sought for building materials such as roofs and nails for the construction of temporary shelters.

Fast-rising water hit one village on Oct. 18 and swept away 28 or 29 houses, leaving nothing to come back to when villagers returned two days later, one villager said. “Now we have no place to stay in but the schools, and no one has any clothing. We are waiting to see how the authorities plan to handle this.”

“We are all in a very poor condition. We have no rice to eat, and all our rice fields are flooded. We will have to buy all the rice that we eat next year,” he said.

“The water is receding now, but the villagers’ houses are damaged beyond repair, and nothing can be restored. There is no thought of fixing them now,” a rescue team member said, adding that many residents of Sepon and other districts are still cut off because of damage to the roads.

Though Lao authorities had moved quickly to help victims of the floods, more help is needed, an NGO official said, asking that neither he nor his organization be named. “For a start, we urgently need dry food and drinking water, clothes, rice, and many other things, as so many houses have been swept away.”

“The authorities did go down to do everything they could, but there are just too many villagers to help,” he said.

Many residents in areas of Sepon and Phin districts are still out of reach, a Sepon district official said. “We are still unable to get to almost half of the areas affected by the floods because the roads have been cut off by landslides,” he said.

Losses in Savannakhet including houses damaged, livestock drowned, and paddy fields destroyed are still being calculated, the official Vientiane Times said on Oct. 21.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguy?n Thái H?p celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vu?t Lu C?ng Ð?ng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p, the bishop of Hà Tinh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghia, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Ngu?n N?y River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tinh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghia, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Ð?n.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_festaOK.JPG,"['tinh', 'h?p', 'centre', 'build', 'bishop', 'thái', 'hà', 'catholics', 'flood', 'work', 'nguy?n', 'local', 'community', 'paul', 'house', 'tiên', 'victims']", ,flood

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan donated US$400,000 on Friday (Oct. 23) to Vietnam in aid after the country suffered the severest floods and landslides in decades.

Richard Shih (???), Taiwan’s representative in Vietnam, said the Taiwanese business community in Vietnam, as well as non-governmental organizations from Taiwan, have mobilized themselves to send relief to the stricken areas in the country's central region. He said he hoped the victims will be able to reconstruct their homes and return to a normal life as soon as possible.

As of Friday, the series of floods and landslides have killed at least 114 people, and 20 people remain missing. Among those who lost their lives are dozens of military personnel who were deployed to search for those who had gone missing in previous disasters.

The Vietnamese military said it has suffered the most serious casualties in peacetime. In addition to the loss of lives, hundreds and thousands of houses were wiped out in central Vietnam, including Quang Tri and Thua Thien Huei provinces, and schools and other facilities have been forced to close.

Tran Quang Hoai, an official responsible for coordinating Vietnam’s rescue missions, accepted Taiwan's donation on behalf of the Vietnamese government at a ceremony on Friday. He remarked that the government is grateful for the generosity of the Taiwanese authorities and people, and that it will make the most appropriate arrangement for the donation so that relief and aid can be distributed to those in need soon, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

MOFA said via a statement that more than 320,000 Vietnamese migrant workers and new immigrants are living in Taiwan, and that the people of the two countries have been more than good partners. Taiwan looks forward to further strengthening bilateral collaboration to combat natural disasters in the future, it added.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/2020/AP/20201016/be8fe4b916764366af4b4d65ce1e386f.jpg,"['us400000', 'vietnam', 'donates', 'aid', 'taiwans', 'flood', 'suffered', 'oct', 'workers', 'central', 'taiwan', 'rescue', 'vietnamese', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

85,85,FL-2018-000074-VNM,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025.

The bodies of two people were recovered on Saturday evening, while one remains missing.

The Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Van Ban District reported that the sudden floods affected 25 households, with furniture, motorbikes and construction materials damaged.

Two houses were swept away and dozens of others were damaged.

Prime Minister Ph?m Minh Chính issued a dispatch asking localities to focus resources on dealing with the consequences of floods and heavy rain in the northern mountainous region since Friday.

In the dispatch to the people’s committees of the six northern mountainous provinces of Lai Chau, Yen Bai, Son La, Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang, the Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control, National Committee for Disaster Response and Search and Rescue, and relevant ministries and agencies, the PM extended his condolences to families of the victims, and asked the local authorities to help locals fix houses and clean the environment, and provide them with food and essential goods.

He also asked the localities to keep a close watch on developments of flooding and rain, and to review and assess the safety of homes, especially in areas at high risk of flash floods and landslides, while preparing forces, vehicles, and equipment to deal with any circumstances.

The media will continue to provide information on developments of the natural disaster, damage, and response efforts, according to the dispatch.

The recent, devastating floods highlight the fragility of the country's natural environment. Deforestation, expanded farming, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric dams are the main culprits. In four years, 7,300 hectares of forest have been lost. So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built with another 450 on their way.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) – Recent floods in Vietnam caused by typhoons and tropical storms have had a devastating impact in terms of lost human lives, environmental damage, and economic dislocations, highlighting the fragility of the Asian country's environment.

Frequent and violent weather events worry both environmentalists and the affected communities more and more.

According to Vietnam’s Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, the main factor is deforestation and the conversion of entire forests to farmland, timber harvesting, and the large dam and hydroelectric plant construction.

Among the most affected areas are the central coastal region and the central Highlands, scene of the recent devastations.

The General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control estimates that some 7,300 hectares of forest land were lost between 2016 and 2019, with an annual average of 1,800.

At the current rate of deforestation, if nothing is done to slow this down, the risk of floods and landslides will increase considerably, along with periods of drought and loss of mangroves.

Environmentalists and experts note that the life and survival of Highland communities are closely linked to local forests.

From the central part of the country to the Mekong River Delta in the south, forests play a leading role in regulating local ecosystems, biodiversity, water resources, and the climate of much of the country.

For Prof Nguy?n Ng?c Lung, forests are key to blocking winds, limiting soil erosion and containing the devastating force of storms. In addition, tree roots absorb excess water.

Deforestation contributes to climate change, global warming, drought, rising water levels, pollution, and famine.

In view of the situation, the General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, noting that the country has recently had to face between 10 and 15 floods.

The blame goes to extensive “legal and illegal” deforestation to expand farmland, harvest timber or build crucial hydro-electric plants to meet the country’s energy needs.

So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built and another 450 are in the planning phase with further devastating impact on the environment.

Some see these plants as ""water bombs"" ready to strike at the population. Their effects are visible in many parts of the country, including Da Lat, a city that is located about 1,500 metres above sea level and a major tourist destination, with its almost year-round cool and temperate climate.

Since 2012, the city has been hit by flooding with increasing frequency, to the extent that today, when rain is intense, many parts of the city and Lam Dong province ""end up submerged by water"".

Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc Thanh.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Vietnam has given $540,000 in immediate support to women and girls in six central provinces affected by flooding.

UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of hygiene items and maternal health equipment. It is also supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services.

The central region has suffered unprecedented flooding from prolonged downpours and successive typhoons since October 6, resulting in at least 230 people dead or missing. Storm Molave hit the region on October 28, reportedly one of the strongest in 20 years.

At least 5.5 million people in the region have been affected, including more than 1.3 million women of reproductive age, over 92,000 of them pregnant mothers, who need uninterrupted services for pregnancy and menstruation, UNFPA said.

According to joint rapid assessment led by UNFPA last week, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programs such as antenatal, delivery, post-natal care and family planning services have been disrupted.

As a result, local women are unable to manage their hygiene properly and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear needed to manage menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and places to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged, the organization explained.

On October 12, a 35-year-old pregnant mother living in Phong Dien District of Thua Thien-Hue Province died on her way to give birth.

She entered labor in the morning, with her husband hiring a boat to take her to a local medical center for delivery. However, the boat was upturned and she was swept away by floodwater.

Her husband and local residents tried to look for her, but failed because of the fast-flowing current. Her body was found in the afternoon.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA representative in Vietnam, said: ""When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousands of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable.

The National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on Monday afternoon that the low pressure out in the north of the South China Sea (known in Vietnam as the East Sea) had strengthened into a typhoon internationally known as Nangka.

Nangka is forecast to make landfall in the north-central part of Vietnam on Wednesday, while the accompanying rains could cover the central region already battered by torrential downpours over the last few days.

The centre forecast that central provinces would face heavy rains ranging from 150 to 300mm on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control issued an urgent letter on Monday asking the bureau to closely supervise the development of the low pressure system and issue warnings to localities and ships.

Authorities also instructed boats and ships to find safe habour and to take measures to ensure the safety of local people and tourists on islands and in coastal areas.

The Foreign Ministry was also asked to contact countries and territories to ask for shelter for Vietnamese fishermen.

The ongoing downpour, exacerbated by Typhoon Linfa which hit the central region on Sunday morning before weakening to a low pressure area, destroyed a total of 382 houses and flooded 109,034 others, and damaged 108 sections of national highways and 8.6km of provincial highways.

The disaster caused big losses to agricultural production by destroying 584ha of rice, 3,879ha of vegetable, 2,141ha of aquaculture, whilst killing about 150,700 cattle and poultry.

In Danang, many communes were submerged by rising floods worsened by water discharged from hydropower reservoirs.

As of 7am on Monday morning, the communes of Hòa Phong, Hòa Nhon, Hòa Liên, Hòa Khuong, Hòa Châu and Hòa Ti?n were badly submerged, affecting the lives of 3,000 local households in 38 hamlets.

In the mountainous districts of Hoà Vang, Liên Chi?u and C?m L?, there was high risk of flash floods and landslides.

At present, 882 households in typhoon-affected areas have been moved to safer areas.

Local people have been suffering from food shortages due to disrupted transport.

Hoàng Sinh, a resident of Phong Hi?n Commune, told Vietnam News Agency that his family’s food reserves were running due to the prolonged rain and flooding, and they were down to a few packs of instant noodles and rice.

Tr?n Ð?c Thi?n, chairman of Phong Hi?n Commune, said the local government was trying to reach local households to supply food, drink and medicine.

“The floods surged rapidly and people in low-lying areas could not keep up. Water spilled into their houses submerging them up to one metre,” said Tr?n Van Hoàn from Huong Trà Township.

“The whole family had to move to a neighbour's house. For several days, we only had instant noodles to survive,” said Hoàn.

“This is the worst flood since 2006. It has badly affected 70 per cent of local people,” said Ph?m Công Phu?c, vice chairman of Qu?ng Thái Commune.

The provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Rescue reported that as of 6pm on Sunday, three people had died, while seven were injured and another was missing.

Nineteen houses had, and 53,385 houses and 360ha of crops had been flooded.

More than 100km of coastline from Huong River across Huong Th? Commune and Huong Trà Township was severely damaged by erosion. About 300m of the dyke in Qu?ng Phú Commune, Qu?ng Ði?n District was also hit.

In Hu?, more than 50 per cent of roads in 27 wards and 2,560 houses were flooded as of Monday morning.

In Qu?ng Tr? Province, the flooding dramatically increased on Monday morning.

The downpour made the water in the Th?ch Hãn and Ô Lâu rivers reach alert levels.

The river water levels were forecast to continue rising today and next days.

To cope with the situation, Qu?ng Tr? authorities have asked the central Government to supply materials and rescue equipment, including two amphibious vehicles, 27 boats, rescue equipment and chemicals for disinfection.

The week-long rain killed six and injured two in the province, with a further six reported missing in the province.

Hue, Vietnam — Every day for the last four months, Duong Thi Mong has carried food, pots, dishes and other utensils on her shoulders to walk nearly 5 kilometers daily from her house to a nearby village, where she serves com hen (rice mixed with mussel, a popular traditional dish) to local people on streets of Thua Thien Hue province. Mong, a Buddhist from Hue's Vi Da ward in central Vietnam, which is famous for its mussels, said she usually takes her boat to carry food over the Huong River then walks only 600 meters to her destination. However, her boat was wiped out in severe flooding after six tropical storms hit the central provinces in October and November. The 56-year-old mother of two said she earns 80,000 to 100,000 dong ($3.50 to $4.30) per day to support her family, not enough money to buy a new boat. She said she had to work harder and sell food at night to get money to prepare food for the celebration of Tet, or Lunar New Year. Local markets closed for the weeklong traditional festival Feb. 10 ahead of the New Year, which starts Feb. 12. Thankfully, sisters across Vietnam have stepped in to help Mong and others like her.

""I am excited for the nuns who offered me 10 million dong [$435] on Jan. 28. I will use the money to buy a new boat for my work soon,"" Mong said cheerfully, adding that the boat is really a lifeboat that will help save her energy so she can work longer and earn more money to put food on the table. Sr. Maria Truong Thi Minh Yen of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate said her community provided boats for 12 people who lost their boats during the severe floods that left many people nothing in their wake. Yen, who serves Tan Thuy Parish, said she called on benefactors for donations. ""We do want to provide local flood victims with longer-term help so that they can stand on their own feet and return to normal life soon,"" she said. Many victims do not have enough money to be able to purchase basic means of doing their jobs. The 69-year-old nun said her convent gives clothes, blankets, rice and medicine to more than 100 street people, migrants, boat people and slum dwellers on a regular basis. Many live in makeshift shelters while others stay in low-rent, stuffy lodgings as their properties were washed away by flooding. ""They have suffered much from the last natural disasters and the chilly weather this year,"" Yen said. The temperature fell to 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January in the tropical area.

Yen, member of the Hue Archdiocese's committee representing local women religious orders, said some local congregations have built and repaired 40 victims' homes at a total cost of 1 billion dong ($43,000). Luong The Thien from Phu Hiep ward said he built a new house in January after he received 65 million dong from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. His old 40-square-meter house was damaged in the floods. Thien, a 54-year-old Buddhist, said he could not afford to rebuild his house as he works as a motorbike taxi driver to support his wife, who has lung cancer, and three children. ""We are happy to celebrate the Tet festival in the dream house. We are extremely grateful for the nuns' generous help that benefits our life long-term,"" he said, adding that according to tradition, people cannot be well-established in their careers until they have stable homes.

Thien said he has had a good relationship with the nuns since he took a nun from a local hospital to her convent in 2008. The nuns regularly visit his family, and his children receive a monthly scholarship from them. Nguyen The Thieu, a Buddhist from Cau Nhi village, said he is among seven local families who received money to repair their storm-damaged houses. His Catholic son-in-law introduced him to the nuns. ""We have received humanitarian aid seven times from sisters and Catholic benefactors, and we gradually overcame the hard times,"" the 78-year-old father of four said.

As of Wednesday morning, northern Vinh Phuc Province had reported two fatalities while Lao Cai, Son La, Lai Chau and Thai Nguyen claimed one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.

The committee said at least four others were injured.

Since last Sunday, northern provinces have been battered by torrential downpours due to the influence of a tropical convergence zone and effects from tropical storm Higos, which made landfall on China’s southern coast Wednesday morning.

Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Ha Giang and Tuyen Giang experienced heavy rainfall of up to 300 mm each downpour while Quang Ninh, home to world famous Ha Long Bay, and Hai Phong City received rainfall of between 200 and 350 mm each time. Levels of 180 mm a day are considered heavy.

At least 334 houses in the localities were damaged. Over 550 ha of rice and other crops were inundated while landslides blocked many roads leading to northern mountainous provinces like Lai Chau and Lao Cai, home to popular Sa Pa Town.

Weather forecasters warned northern provinces should expect heavy downpours with rainfall of between 100 and 250 mm from Thursday to Saturday due to the impacts of Higos.

Tran Quang Hoai, vice head of the committee, asked northern authorities to deploy rescue teams and evacuate residents in flood-prone areas.

Higos is the fourth storm formed in the East Sea this year.

The waters, known internationally as the South China Sea, could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, half of them directly affecting the country, meteorologists said.

Natural disasters, including drought, floods and landslides, killed 133 Vietnamese last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In the first half of this year, natural disasters killed 47 people and caused economic damages of VND3.3 trillion, according to official data.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/08/19/a9f5d4e442a7abf9f2b6-159782323-4253-6860-1597823279_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'flood', 'provinces', 'tropical', 'hit', 'heavy', 'rainfall', 'mm', 'committee', 'cai', 'killed', 'northern', 'ha']", ,flood

The United Nations Population Fund in Vietnam will provide an additional $800,000 to support women and girls affected by flooding in eight central provinces and cities.

It brings the UNFPA's total support to $1.34 million. In October it had given $540,000.

The support includes setting up mobile and outreach health care clinics and the distribution of dignity kits with essential hygiene items and vital maternal health equipment and supplies.

Between early October and mid-November the central region and parts of the Central Highlands were hit by a succession of storms that brought torrential rains, resulting in severe flooding and landslides.

At least 192 people were killed and 57 others are still listed missing, and losses amounted to VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), the government said.

Around 5.5 million people have been affected, including over 1.3 million women of reproductive age and more than 92,000 pregnant women, the UNFPA said.

The disaster forced women and girls into shelters without having the time to pack essential supplies, and many lack basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear that are needed to manage their menstrual periods, it said, adding that access to water and places to wash, dry reusable pads and clothes and dispose of used materials are lacking.

Routine public health programs such as antenatal, child birth, post-natal care, and family planning services have been disrupted.

The government provided VND770 billion for emergency relief.

Many international organizations and countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Australia also provided aid.","Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/08/huukhoaduadeolethuy51603180554-1148-5001-1607411128_1200x0.jpg,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'rains', 'health', 'girls', 'flooding', 'central', 'agency', '800000', 'women', 'pregnant', 'million', 'support', 'provided']", ,flood_and_drought

On the night of October 11, Le Trung Lam, a resident of the central town, braved the floods to go and pick up some migrant students who had been marooned in their inundated home for days. He took them to his company on Ngu Binh Street, An Tay Ward, where 30 people were already sheltering.

They cook in the kitchen and eat three meals a day, and also have blankets, mattresses and electricity.

Three days earlier, many students from other places now studying in Hue, had no idea where to shelter as the floodwaters rose relentlessly and inundated their homes. Then Lam's message arrived out of the blue.

He said: ""The company's headquarters, a five-floor building, is situated on Ngu Binh Mountain, and so the water has not reached it yet. Its two top floors have 10 rooms each that can accommodate 20-30 people.""

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential downpours in central Vietnam for a week now have killed 29 as of Tuesday morning. Among the deaths, six are from Thua Thien-Hue Province, home to Hue.

Lam, 33, decided to turn his company into a shelter on October 8 as the waters reached some major roads and were expected to rise further. Driving around the town to check on the flood situation and how people were coping, he passed by the studio apartment where he himself had lived 15 years ago as a migrant student from central Nghe An Province. He too had suffered during flooding.

Fearing for students who were possibly cut off, he posted an announcement that he was willing to shelter people.

In the last few days he has received hundreds of calls from people seeking help. Since the neighborhood still has access to electricity and the market remains open, Lam's employees have been able to buy food and cook meals.

Lam said he would take care of the students until the floods receded.

If the water level keeps rising, he plans to also use the main hall which can hold 500 people.

Le Thi Anh Ngoc, 19, from the central Quang Binh Province, said she walked on flooded streets for more than an hour to reach Lam's place on the morning of October 11.

""I arrived in Hue four days ago. I did not know who would help us before I learned about Lam.""

Six kilometers away from the company, on Tung Thien Vuong Street, Ngo Thi Kim Loan is busy making 500 banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich, with the help of a few others to send to people stranded on Hen Dune and Han Mac Tu Street.

Loan, who regularly does charity, always has instant noodles at home. Three days ago, seeing the rising water levels, she gave away 100 boxes of them to households in her neighborhood facing difficulties.

On October 12 she cooked 40 kilograms of rice for people living in areas where power has been turned off due to the floods.

The owner of a noodles restaurant also posted on her Facebook page that families with children or old people could command shelter at her home.

In the evening, when Loan sent 300 banh mi to households on Hen, Le Quoc Phong, Loan's neighbor, 40, was eating dinner under an oil lamp. The island in the middle of the Huong River was cut off by the rising waters.

Phong volunteered to help distribute food to those in need. Finishing his meal, he quickly got on a boat to take the banh mi to people before dinner time was over.

Distributing food and offering accommodation are Hue people’s way of supporting people affected by the floods.

Dozens of families living in higher places said they are ready to take in people whose houses are flooded and provide instant noodles to those who need them.

Free food distribution centers have been set up in downtown areas in the last few days, but are accessible only to people living nearby because of the situation.

People are also helping their fellows facing a threat of losing their livelihoods.

Over several days, strong winds and torrential rains caused huge damage, submerging homes, wiping out farmland, killing and sweeping away cattle. The Diocese of Hà Tinh, along with Caritas and the Catholic Business Association brought donations.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) - Strong winds and torrential rain over several days have caused flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 37 so far. Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên Hu? and Qu?ng Nam are the most affected provinces.

Heavy rains from 10 to 13 October inundated residential areas, farmland and roads, causing huge damages to people and property.

The General Department of Disaster Prevention reported that, in addition to the 37 deaths, at least 50,000 houses were flooded or wrecked whilst 250 hectares of rice fields and 2,500 hectares planted with vegetables were wiped out. Some 900 hectares dedicated to aquaculture were also damaged; at least 60,000 animals, mainly cows and poultry, were killed or swept away by the raging waters.

Bishop Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p of Hà Tinh (about 340 km south of the capital, near the coast), decided to visit the flooded areas to bring some help. On Saturday, he led a delegation from his diocese to Trung Quán parish.

The prelate tried to visit every family, one by one, to encourage them and leave them with some small gifts. For those who met him, “He is a true pastor. He did not just give us some gifts; he brought us God.”

Trung Quán parish, one of the hardest hit, saw homes submerged and streets turned into rivers.

Thanks Caritas and the Hà Tinh Catholic Business Association, the bishop was able to leave a package containing instant noodles, a bottle of oil and two packs of condiments for each family he visited.

He also brought more than 200 million dong (about US$ 8,600). The diocese donated 100 million; Caritas 50 million and the Catholic Business Association, another 50 million. Although not huge, the money will help with the emergency.

Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p encouraged the faithful to recite the rosary and pray for all the people living in the flooded area.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VN-_Evacuation.jpg,"['tinh', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'business', 'bishop', 'diocese', 'hà', 'left', 'hectares', 'catholic', 'caritas', 'central', 'floods', '37', 'huge', 'million', 'visits', 'dead']", ,flood

While foreign investors pulled about US$842mil (RM3.46bil) from the country’s shares so far this year, the tide could be turning.

Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR Global. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has raised more than US$350mil.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that – like in many others around the world – has attracted retail punters in droves.

Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

Worst hit is Hue province, some 700km (434 miles) away from the capital, Hanoi.

The benchmark index now includes 11 stocks exceeding $5 billion in market value, up from just two in 2015.

The stock exchange’s other heavy hitters include a smattering of state-backed behemoths -- Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, PetroVietnam Gas JSC -- as well as steelmaker Hoa Phat Group JSC and Vietnam Dairy Products JSC.

Vietnam’s stocks have been climbing amid optimism its export-oriented economy can maintain momentum after being one of the few in Asia to expand last year. Manufacturing activity jumped in April to the strongest since November 2018, according to a PMI report Tuesday. Equities retreated today, sending the VN Index down 1.1% as of 9:38 a.m. local time, after Vietnam’s capital city instructed school pupils to stay home in order to help contain an increase in local Covid-19 cases.

The country is well positioned as the U.S. and Chinese economies lead a global rebound from the pandemic. That’s because Vietnam benefited when U.S.-China trade tensions spurred companies to diversify supply chains out of its larger Asian neighbor.

“We’ve been positive on Vietnam for a number of years. They are a clear beneficiary of China-U.S. trade tensions and their handling of the pandemic has been among the best examples globally,” said Jeff Gill, who helped manage about $10.9 billion of assets at City of London Investment Management as of Dec. 31.

Waiting Room

Part of the problem may be that international investors overstretched when they splurged. Foreigners sold a net $876 million of Vietnamese stocks last year, similar to what’s been already sold so far this year. That’s in line with a wave of selling across Asian emerging markets. Those moves look to have simply swelled foreigners’ cash positions inside Vietnam, which are already substantially higher now than they were at the end of 2020, according to Vu Bang, former chairman of the State Securities Commission.

Vietnam’s stocks also faced a setback in March when FTSE Russell decided to maintain the country as a frontier market, instead of upgrading it to a secondary emerging market, citing settlement methodology issues. The State Securities Commission expects to resolve the issue later this year. Investors have also cited foreign ownership limits as a concern that could hamstring the market’s capacity to grow further.

Money managers from Sempione Sim SpA, to Asia Frontier Capital and City of London Investment Management Co. say they are busy looking for entry points. They cite solid economic prospects, relatively attractive valuations, rising foreign-direct investment flows and healthy earnings growth as reasons to be optimistic, while also showing faith in the government’s ability to contain the pandemic.

“I see Vietnam as a very nice compelling growth and stable story for the short, mid and long term,” said Federico Parenti, a fund manager at Sempione Sim in Milan.

Since the beginning of October, central Vietnam has been pounded by consecutive tropical storms and typhoons, which have brought widespread flooding and landslides to the region.

At least 1.5 million people have been affected by flooding and 235 people have died or are missing, according to the Vietnamese government.

On October 15, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink declared a national disaster for the Central Vietnam region as a result of the widespread devastation caused by flooding and landslides. This flooding has disrupted electricity and telecommunication networks, as well as destroying infrastructure, houses, livestock, and crops.

On October 28, Typhoon Molave made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Vietnam. It was the worst typhoon to hit the country in the last two decades.

Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are the two of the five central provinces that have been hardest hit by the recent flooding and landslides. The other three provinces that have been severely affected are Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, and Hue.

To make matters worse, the monsoon season is still ongoing and another powerful storm, Typhoon Vamco, made landfall last Sunday morning in central Vietnam, causing even greater damage. This is the third storm system to pummel Vietnam in November and the 13th to hit the country this year. The economic damage is now estimated to be close to $1 billion, according to the Vietnamese government.

International donations are starting to come in from various countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Japan. To date, the U.S. has donated $2.1 million toward the humanitarian relief effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Vietnam Red Cross Society to assist during the ongoing recovery period.

The financial backing also focuses on USAID’s longstanding investments in Vietnam to help minimize loss and destruction caused by natural disasters. Although the Vietnamese government has been quick to allocate disaster relief funds, its efforts and capacities have been strained also by the coronavirus pandemic. Donations from the outside world will be certainly needed and appreciated.

Local NGOs have been working tirelessly alongside the government to deliver aid to those who have been most affected by the catastrophic storms and their results. Pacific Links Foundation is an NGO that currently supports disadvantaged families in central Vietnam and it has been vigorously fundraising to support families in flood-affected Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Hue provinces.

“Our volunteers on the ground have delivered emergency packages, which included rice, food, life jackets, and flashlights, to students and their families,” said Hong Nguyen, the deputy director for SEEDS, a Pacific Links Foundation scholarship program which currently supports over 2,500 students.

SEEDS and the Pacific Links Foundation are now working on another round of support that will focus specifically on long-term recovery, allowing school children in all eight central Provinces to return to school and provide support for the families that suffered the most during the recent typhoons and floods.

“We will provide packages which will include books and school supplies, as well as computer tablets for students to continue learning through our online learning platform, especially when schooling is being disrupted,” said Nguyen.

Another non-profit charitable organization focused on philanthropic activities to benefit Vietnamese people in need throughout the Central Vietnam region is Da Nang Go. The organization uses fundraising events and direct donations to address the specific needs of Vietnamese people affected by natural disasters, poverty, and hunger.

Presently, the group consists of about 20 local and international volunteers who have been doing regular relief trips to some of the harder hit flood and landslide zones across the region. The NGO recently took a convoy of trucks and cars to Tay Giang district in Quang Nam province to provide much-needed supplies.

Tay Giang experienced heavy flooding and deadly landslides in October and November and is generally considered to be one of the more economically disadvantaged areas of Central Vietnam. The majority of the people who live there are from the Co Tu ethnic minority, a patriarchal rural society whose men raise livestock and whose women are well known for making high-quality traditional handicrafts.

The Co Tu live in small stilt huts which can be easily damaged by storms and landslides. At least 30 families had previously been evacuated from one village in Tay Giang due to the recent landslides.

“Before the last storm came, the government wanted to move them to a safer place but the problem is they don’t want to move anywhere because they are scared and if they die then they want to die in their hometown. They are used to yearly storms but they didn’t know this year’s storms would be so bad,” said Hannah Bui, one of the main directors of Da Nang Go and owner of Hannah’s Restaurant in Da Nang.

“I wish I had more money so I could do more to help these people,” she said.

Recently, the Da Nang Go team assembled 250 aid packages for children and 750 for adults in Tay Giang, as well as presenting some cash donations in envelopes at Hannah’s Restaurant.

The aid packages consisted of water, milk, noodles, dry food, oil, fish sauce, salt, blankets, and notebooks. The money was raised through a recent fundraising event and from various donations by local and expat members of the Da Nang community.

The aid was greeted with smiles by the local villagers and government officials. The team also delivered supplies to two elementary schools and to adults in the neediest villages of Tay Giang. In one of the poorest schools, students are so impoverished that they can’t afford basic school uniforms and some students walk up to four kilometers per day to attend classes.

“When I do charity and I do small things like give candy to poor kids they are happy and smile, and when I give old people clothes and they say ‘thank you,’ it warms my heart and makes me feel good knowing I’ve brightened their day,” said Bui.

Da Nang Go will continue its ongoing fundraising and aid missions to help people around central Vietnam affected by these historically devastating storms and typhoons. Both Pacific Links Foundation and Da Nang Go are continuing to deliver aid packages and funds in the aftermath of Typhoon Vamco.

As much as these local charities and NGOs have brought much-needed relief for affected communities, in terms of food, clothing, school supplies, and direct funding, what is really needed now in terms of the recovery effort is the rebuilding of infrastructure, houses, and technological networks, and a re-supply of livestock to get things back to normal.

Floodwaters that had killed scores across Vietnam were rising ominously around their village. At a washed-out railway overpass, he hired a man to ferry them in a small boat. But strong winds carried away some of the baby clothes the couple had packed, and Mr. Minh waded into the water to retrieve them.

Suddenly, the boat capsized in the fast-moving current. His wife, Hoang Thi Phuong, a 35-year-old cancer survivor, was just out of reach, and she was swept away by water turned brown by loosened sediment.

6,6,FL-2018-000121-VNM,We must not repeat the Vietnam refugee tragedy in Afghanistan - Military Times,https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2021/05/18/we-must-not-repeat-the-vietnam-refugee-tragedy-in-afghanistan/,"The parallel between the Vietnam War and Afghan War is troubling. In both cases, the U.S. became involved in a foreign war without having a clear picture of what our ultimate objective was. We largely took over the direction of each war from a corrupt host government. Many citizens of our host country placed reliance on the U.S. to provide for their safety, come what may. The war became unwinnable because of a series of unfortunate decisions. Losing interest in the endeavor, we shaped settlement terms the host government was required to accept, intimating we would be there to help if worse came to worst. Here, the similarity ends, for now.

In the case of Vietnam, even though we knew weeks beforehand that the fall of South Vietnam was imminent, we made no concerted effort to extract the Vietnamese who had steadfastly supported the U.S. When their government fell, many thousands who had helped, trusted and relied upon us were murdered or incarcerated to the great dishonor of our nation. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the south and, although we gave many of them sanctuary, our help was slow in coming. The final chapter in Afghanistan has yet to be written, but it must not end up with a betrayal of our friends.

During the long and tortured course of America’s war in Afghanistan, many Afghans stepped forward at their great peril to serve and help protect our military personnel. As we withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban have stepped up their violent attacks and the danger to our friends has dramatically increased. We are morally obligated to provide them sanctuary within our borders.

There are two special immigrant visa (SIV) programs in place to bring our Afghan friends to the U.S., but they are mired in red tape — it takes up to three years to process an application. There is a backlog of nearly 19,000 SIV applicants, with about 50,000 family members. They are waiting in line, living in fear of death. There are not enough slots to take care of the backlog. The vetting process is understaffed, underfunded and overly burdensome.

In this crisis situation, there are two feasible alternatives — either review existing documentation in the files and grant visas to those who U.S. personnel have credibly vouched for in the files, or extract the SIVs and families from Afghanistan and complete any necessary vetting in a safe location. We processed South Vietnamese refugees at U.S. military bases in the late 1980s.

We need, also, to consider the plight of Afghans who don’t qualify for SIV status. A Taliban take-over, which appears increasingly likely, will create a flood of refugees, fleeing for their very lives. Being partially responsible for their plight, we are honor bound to provide sanctuary for many of them, just as we eventually did for those fleeing Vietnam. We should plan to evacuate Afghans who will be targets of Taliban reprisal — uncorrupted government and military officials, women’s rights advocates, educators, democracy advocates and the like.

Like many troops who served in America’s wars, this issue is very personal for me. I lived and worked with South Vietnamese soldiers in 1968-1969. I trusted them with my life, while they relied on the U.S. government as a friend and ally. Most of my Vietnamese friends were Catholics who moved from North Vietnam to Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam in 1954 to escape persecution. They were fiercely anti-communist and pro-American. It broke my heart when the communists took over in April 1975, knowing that my friends would be killed or imprisoned, as were many thousands of their countrymen. We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate. We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us.

Today, while in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced the United States is providing an additional $2 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to Typhoon Molave and the ongoing severe flooding that has affected Central Vietnam since early October. This amount brings the total humanitarian assistance from the U.S. Government for people touched by the floods to $2.1 million.

With this new funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is ramping up efforts to meet emergency needs in communities affected by Vietnam’s historic typhoon season. Typhoon Molave, which made landfall in Central Vietnam on October 28, 2020, is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. Typhoon Molave follows weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1.5 million people and killed more than 130.

In response, USAID’s partners, including the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC), are addressing the immediate needs of the affected families for food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Because the floods have washed away livestock, farms, and infrastructure, USAID’s partners also will provide assistance to these families as they begin to restore their livelihoods.

This assistance builds on USAID’s long-term investments in Vietnam to reduce the risk and impact of disasters. With funding from USAID, for example, the VNRC has been on the front lines in responding to the impact of severe weather throughout this typhoon season.

The United States stands with the people of Vietnam during this difficult time.

8,8,FL-2018-000121-VNM,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

Vietnam’s flood death toll rose to at least 23 and authorities said the incoming storm Nangka would dump more heavy rain on the country in the coming days.

The floods also left at least 14 people missing in Vietnam’s central provinces, the government said in a statement on Monday.

Most of the victims were washed away by floodwaters, the national disaster management authority said, adding local authorities evacuated nearly 46,000 people from affected areas.

The floods have inundated more than 109,000 homes and 1,443 acres (584 hectares) of crops and damaged roads and bridges, the agency added.

According to weather forecasters, water levels will keep rising, swelling rivers and submerging more communities in the region, the state-owned Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.

The situation worsened over the weekend when Tropical Storm Linfa, which weakened to a depression when it hit the country, brought more rain to the region.

Torrential rains have flooded central Vietnam and killed dozens since last week [Ho Cau/Reuters] “We received a report saying that between 10 and 13 workers have been buried in a landslide and we don’t know if they are still alive,” a disaster management official in Thua Thien Hue province told Reuters news agency by telephone.

Soldiers were deployed to the area to rescue the workers, said the official, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

“We are concerned that the incoming storm will worsen the flood situation,” the official said.

Storm Nangka, which is forecast to make landfall in northern Vietnam on Wednesday, will trigger heavy rain of up to 400 millimetres (16 inches) in parts of northern and central Vietnam from Wednesday through Friday, the national weather agency said.

Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding because of its long coastline.

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) in Vietnam and local people’s generosity.Luu Thi Phuong, 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.“Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children,” she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.“I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDP’s 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.“Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam,” she said.“However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.”Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last year’s floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.”Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.“It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life,” he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: “I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).“In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households,” said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing. At least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or collapsed./.","Tue, 04 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://en.vietnamplus.vn/favicon.ico,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'receive', 'storms', 'nam', 'quang', 'residents', 'undp', 'nams', 'central', 'support', 'house', 'houses', 'safe']", ,flood
11,11,FL-2018-000121-VNM,How flood protection can paradoxically put people at risk - Horizon,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/how-flood-protection-can-paradoxically-put-people-risk.html,"Professor Jeroen Aerts, a hydrologist at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in The Netherlands, says that when a city builds a defensive wall or dyke, it can make its citizens feel so secure that they actually flock to live or to develop businesses in the protected area. What’s more, they don’t bother to install their own flood protection.

This means that when rare – but inevitable – extreme flooding occurs the damage can be colossal.

It is just one way in which flood protection modellers may be underestimating – and sometimes overestimating – the true consequences of sea level rise, says Prof. Aerts. And it is happening because physical scientists are failing to integrate human behaviour into their models.

Prof. Aerts leads a team that is trying to change this using the technique of agent-based modelling which attempts to reproduce complex phenomena like human behaviour. They use software that creates autonomous decision-making entities called agents, each of which assesses its situation and makes a decision based on a set of rules that have been drawn from survey data and decision theory.

Last year, they published a paper that underlined the problem of the safe development paradox. By modelling what is known about how humans behave when governments install flood protection where they live and work, the team demonstrated that ‘the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas.’

But the study went on to show that governments could ‘largely counteract’ this effect if they simultaneously promoted policies that encourage people to flood-proof their buildings.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’ Prof. Jeroen Aerts, Vrije University, The Netherlands

Migration

Prof. Aerts believes that the failure of physical scientists to take human behaviour into account may also have led them to misjudge the degree to which flooding will drive migration. What’s more, it means they are not identifying precisely where it would be best to target help, because the models don’t distinguish adequately between those who will manage to look after themselves and those who won’t.

Sea level rise will, it is commonly predicted, displace 187 million people by 2100. But the figure, which comes from a 2011 study, is controversial.

‘Most modelling studies that deal with flooding risk or sea level rise use a top-down approach,’ said Prof. Aerts. ‘You have long-term scenarios – like how many centimetres is sea level going to rise, and what will the exposed population be … and you try to estimate the impact.’ Then, he said, the models are rerun to include the effects of various adaptation measures, such as dykes or managed retreat, after which researchers do a cost-benefit analysis.

But, Prof. Aerts said, ‘they forget about (asking) what is the probability that this dyke will be built? Or what is the probability that people will retreat? So they do not take into account the human behavioural factor which determines whether or not this measure will be implemented.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’

Factors that get ignored include evidence that people’s decisions to migrate, or to stay and defend their land, vary with their wealth, age, risk perception, trust of government and attitudes to individual freedom.

Social scientists

Prof. Aerts says that his team is now turning the models on their head, in a new project known as COASTMOVE. They are integrating a global coastal flood risk model with an agent-based model to simulate how governments, private sector actors such as insurance companies, and individuals act and influence each other.

Another difference is that social scientists are feeding data into the project.

‘They provide me with the information about under what conditions are people going to implement a certain measure, from the individual level to the higher aggregate government level,’ said Prof. Aerts.

Some of this information is from pre-existing surveys on what drives people to migrate or otherwise respond to floods. The rest will be gathered from new surveys in six coastal areas in France, Ghana, the Marshall Islands, the United States, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Other, less traditional sources of information will come from data already collected via mobile phones, Twitter posts and even tax returns.

They will use data from Bangladesh, for example, where other researchers have been able to discover, from anonymised mobile phone data, how many people have fled from floods, where they travelled, and how soon they returned. They will also use data that Prof. Aerts has gathered over the last six years using algorithms to monitor tweets that mention the word ‘flood’, in 20 different languages. This provides daily flood maps that give ‘a pretty good idea of where we can expect most of the problems’, he said.

More data is coming from the United States where it has been possible to draw conclusions about migration after flooding from the location from which people have filed their annual tax returns.

Vulnerabilities

By simulating adaptive behaviour, the team hopes to provide more refined predictions about the degree to which sea level rise will cause migration – in the form of 1x1km2 global migration maps.

Dr Bina Desai, head of policy and research at the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, says that sea level rise will bring a variety of direct and indirect impacts, which will affect people differently depending on factors such as inequality and poverty, that are not adequately reflected in models.

‘What’s needed, if we think about risk of migration and displacement, is modelling with a less strong focus on the hazard and a stronger focus on underlying vulnerabilities and what exacerbates them,’ she said.

‘In principle, it’s the only way to do it,’ Dr Desai said of COASTMOVE’s approach. Even as a conceptual model, she adds, it will help to work out how the many factors interrelate.

‘The downside is to move beyond the conceptual model,’ she added. ‘If you want to translate that into numbers then (when we have tried it) we found we failed because all the inputs could not be populated with data.

‘But if they can find a way of doing it by (collecting enough data), using proxies and making assumptions and somehow modelling it out then I think that’s great.’

Just how are our seas changing and rising with climate change and the melting of Earth’s ice caps? This is the final story in a three-part series looking at the past, present and future of extreme sea level rise. In part one, we looked at what the last interglacial can tell us about extreme sea level rise and in part two we looked at rise of atmospheric ‘meteotsunamis’.

Promote the repair of key public service infrastructure in affected provinces, ensure food security, by restoring lost food stock, livestock and livelihoods, ensure access to sustainable drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene supplies, housing, replacement of productive assets and household items, and access to basic medical, social and public services to support the affected population transition to recovery and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

On 13 October, the Government of Viet Nam released a call for emergency relief and support following four tropical cyclones and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which combined have caused severe and widespread flooding, landslides, storm surge and strong winds since 6 October. As of 28 October, 214 people have reportedly been killed or are missing, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). An estimated 7.7 million people live in areas affected by flooding caused by the multiple storms, with some 1.5 million people in nine provinces directly affected and approximately 380,000 houses flooded, damaged or destroyed. Of those people directly affected by the current disaster, some 753,000 are women and girls, 134,000 are children under five, and 143,000 are over 65 years old.

On the morning of 11 October, Tropical Storm Linfa (Storm No. 6) made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Viet Nam, resulting in 150 to 300 mm of rain. This was followed on 14 October by Tropical Storm Nangka (Storm No. 7) which made landfall in northern Viet Nam, but also brought a further 150 mm of rain to the still flooded provinces of central Viet Nam. On 16 October, tropical depression INVEST 94W in the East Sea weakened into a low-pressure area and made landfall in the central provinces, and was subsequently followed by Tropical Storm Saudel (Storm No. 8) which made landfall in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces on 25 October. On 28 October, Tropical Cyclone Molave (Storm No. 9) made landfall in approximately the same area as Tropical Storm Linfa, with up to 700 mm of rain reported in Nghe An and Ha Thinh provinces and up to 400 mm of rain in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces.

In Quang Ngai province, some 17,000 people were evacuated because of the strong winds and rain. Between 5 and 20 October, VNDMA reported that many areas in central Viet Nam recorded a total rainfall of more than 2,400 mm, and in some locations, flood waters exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1979 and 1999.

As of 29 October, nine provinces have been affected by the cumulative impacts of the multiple storms including Tropical Cyclone Molave. These are, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Nghe An, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum provinces, with Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces most severely affected.

Following Tropical Cyclone Molave, more than 88,000 houses and 50 schools had their roofs blown off, the majority in Quang Ngai province, and some 375,000 people were evacuated to evacuation centres. Those in the evacuation centres are amongst the most vulnerable having had their houses damaged or destroyed and having lost key household items in the floods. Many of the evacuation centres are overcrowded, do not have access to sufficient basic facilities such as water and sanitation, and health care, and lack appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children.

As well as damage to houses, some 30,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged (including rice, other crops, and aquatic products) and more than 2 million cattle and poultry have been killed. This is likely to have severe impacts on food security and livelihoods, especially for those people who were already experiencing adverse economic impacts due to COVID19. Further, more than 360 schools have been flooded and damaged, with detrimental impacts on children’s ability to continue accessing education. In addition, more than 78 health centres and hospitals have also been damaged or flooded.

To date, the delivery of assistance has been hampered by extensive damage to public transportation infrastructure. VNDMA reports that more than 165 km of national highway, 140 km of local roads and three bridges have been heavily damaged. Rescue teams are accessing affected areas by boat to deliver relief items and to evacuate vulnerable people, prioritizing children, people with disabilities and elderly people. Communication has also been hampered by the loss of electricity in many affected areas.

The areas most severely affected by flooding are also those same provinces which experienced a second wave of COVID19 cases in July and August. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, a further thirty days of lockdown measures were implemented from 28 July to 5 September, with adverse socio-economic impacts for the region which already records higher than national average multidimensional poverty rates. As a consequence of COVID-19 related measures, the most vulnerable people had already had their coping capacities eroded prior to this current disaster and are thus in more acute need of immediate assistance to help them manage the current, compound crisis.

From 20 and 23 October, joint GovernmentUN-NGO assessments were undertaken in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai provinces. Key findings from the assessments include the need for emergency food assistance for 177,000 of the most vulnerable people, restoration of agricultural land, safe access to clean water and sanitation facilities including in health centres and schools, the provision of dignity kits for women and girls, provision of education supplies and alternative learning solutions to ensure continuity of learning, support for those people evacuated from their homes, repairs for damaged houses, replacement of basic household items, health support especially maternal and child health, risk communication activities, provision of micro nutrients and continuation of nutrition activities to prevent an increase in rates of malnutrition.

Protection has been identified as a key need in this response, including the immediate need to ensure protection and safeguards for women and children currently living in evacuation centres. Partners involved in the development of this plan have also highlighted the need to provide assistance in a gender-responsive manner that addresses the specific needs of women and girls. The Government has requested that all relief activities target the most vulnerable people, including poor, near poor, people living with disabilities, children, femaleheaded households and elderly people, which are the target populations for this response plan.","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/VNM-ResponsePlan-201031-051%20%281%29.jpg?itok=QHnLLURt,"['plan', 'response', 'nam', 'quang', 'provinces', '2020', 'viet', 'tropical', 'floods', 'affected', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'assistance', 'storm', 'including']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The lower Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam) experienced prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020 until early December 2020. This was due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka as well as tropical depression INVEST 94W. The three wind systems made landfall in Vietnam but brought along heavy rain to the rest of the lower Mekong region. Tropical storm Linfa made landfall on 11 October 2020, tropical storm Nangka made landfall on 14 October 2020 whilst tropical depression INVEST 94W made landfall on 16 October 2020.

The rainfall brought by the wind systems resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in southern Lao PDR. As of 20 October 2020, nine districts in three provinces of Salawan, Savannaket and Sekong were affected by the floods. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Based on an initial assessment on 20 October 2020, conducted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) with participation of Lao Red Cross, it was highlighted that 163 villages in the three provinces, with an estimated 15,305 households (97,514 people) were affected. Savannaket was the worst affected province with more than 10,000 households from 137 villages were reportedly affected in the province and two people had lost their lives. In Sekong province, around 3,000 people were affected, and two people had lost their lives. Salawan province reported more than 600 people affected with five deaths.

Cyclone Molave – the fourth tropical cyclone to threaten Vietnam this month – is barrelling towards the country’s central coast, worsening severe floods and landslides that have inundated parts of the region for weeks.

Vietnamese authorities are rushing to evacuate half a million people before Molave makes a projected 28 October landfall, packing wind speeds topping 110 kilometres per hour. The country is already struggling with intense floods and landslides that have killed at least 130 people and damaged a quarter of a million homes.

The Vietnamese Red Cross has already warned that 160,000 people may need food aid over the next six months, but that figure could rise after Molave makes landfall and its impact becomes more clear.

Aid groups say parts of Vietnam are seeing their worst floods and landslides in two decades. Disasters are common during Asia’s various monsoon seasons, but this month’s flurry of storms has aggravated conditions, with weeks of extended heavy rainfall.

Parts of Laos and Cambodia are also submerged. And Thailand is projecting that Molave's rains will hit the country’s north and northeast.

Before threatening Southeast Asia’s Mekong region, Cyclone Molave uprooted some 25,000 people in the Philippines earlier this week.

Hue, Vietnam – Before floodwater inundated half their living room one night during the storm season this year, the Trans put their most valuable possessions – their TV and refrigerator – in the attic and told their two daughters to take refuge there.

Tran Nhu Hong, 23, and her 18-year-old sister, who do not know how to swim, survived the storms – the worst her generation had ever experienced and the worst her parents had seen in decades.

A neighbour was not so fortunate. The 19-year-old student was swept away in the floods after the vehicle she was travelling in was tipped over by the force of the water – on the same route the two young women usually take.

“Shortly after the water retreated, I went on that route and the vehicle was still there and had not yet been pulled out (of the mud),” Hong said. “I don’t dare to go on that route late at night any more.”

Across central Vietnam, cascading floods from October onward inundated the living and the dead, as record rainfall submerged towns and cemeteries. Authorities said earlier this month that the typhoons, which they referred to as “abnormal”, cost the Southeast Asian country 30 trillion dong ($1.3bn) in damage and killed at least 192 people – a death toll more than five times higher than the 35 COVID-19 deaths Vietnam recorded this year.

A woman drives along a flooded road beside submerged rice fields [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “In general, it is well-established that rainfall from typhoons is increasing due to climate change, both from observations and from models,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead climate scientist at the Red Cross Climate Center and World Weather Attribution, whose team is conducting a study on the role of climate change in the recent floods and typhoons in central Vietnam.

Crops destroyed

With 70 percent of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas, Vietnam is highly exposed to riverine and coastal flooding and is also one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.

“There is even more damage after the floods,” Hong said, driving by rice fields made inlets because of the storms and floods in her hometown in Thua Thien Hue Province.

When the water retreated, it took crops with it, leaving behind scarred earth. Many farming families in central Vietnam count on rice, various other crops and cattle for income, especially as the Lunar New Year celebration, known as Tet, nears.

Tet is usually when Vietnamese shop for new clothes, gifts and appliances to welcome a new, fulfilling beginning; but with their homes and means of living ravaged by violent storms, severe floods and devastating landslides, Tet, which will take place in February, is likely to be tinged with sadness.

Hong’s parents are still recovering from the wounds and infections they got from wading through hip-high flood water for extended periods, and have yet to find jobs as construction workers due to the double burden of COVID-19 and the recent natural disasters.

Ichiro Sato, senior associate with the Climate Program and Sustainable Finance Center at US-based think tank World Resources Institute, says central Vietnam was battling extreme weather events long before climate change started to take effect.

“If governments have not been well-prepared even for the conventional risk of weather-related disasters that existed before climate change – and I am afraid that is the case for Central Vietnam – then there are so many things they have to work on before worrying about the additional risk of climate change,” Sato said, adding that unregulated urbanisation and economic growth may increase vulnerability to weather-related disasters in places like Vietnam.

The country typically endures between five and six storms and about three tropical depressions a year, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, but in 2020 a total of at least 14 ravaged the country. Seven consecutive tropical storms and cyclones hit the central region between October and mid-November.

Children at risk

According to the UN, an estimated 7.7 million people in nine provinces, including 2.5 million children, were affected – with hundreds of thousands of houses flooded, damaged or destroyed.

“There is no doubt that children are those most affected by natural disasters,” Rana Flowers, UNICEF representative in Vietnam, told Al Jazeera, adding that families’ ability to secure nutritious food for their children had already suffered as a result of the pandemic.

An estimated 375,000 people were sent to evacuation centres during the storms and floods, including about 90,000 children, according to Flowers.

“Many of the evacuation sites were overcrowded, did not have access to sufficient water and sanitation and healthcare, and lacked appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children,’’ Flowers said, adding that the situation severely affected the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children.

A study brief published in August by the US-based Society for Research in Child Development showed that children may suffer longer-term physical and psychological deficits than adults, including difficulty sleeping or concentrating and losing interest in their usual activities – chronic mental health symptoms have been observed among children as long as four years after a disaster.

A woman carries food through the submerged streets of Hue in central Vietnam [File: Manan Vatsyana/AFP] “In the long run, to be sustainable, the Vietnamese government should invest more to strengthen mental health services for children and their families, looking at the nationwide system and also building the workforce,’’ Flowers said.

Deforestation, which affects the ability of the land to retain water, also contributed to the flooding and a series of severe landslides during the stormy season, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said at a legislative National Assembly meeting last month.

Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam lost 657,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of primary forest – 23 percent of its total tree-cover loss according to data from international monitoring service Global Forest Watch. About 50 percent of all tree-cover loss between 2001 and 2019 took place in 11 of the country’s 63 provinces – eight of them in central Vietnam, it said.

The devastating landslides and flooding have prompted concerns about deforestation caused by the construction of hydropower plants in forests.

As of 2018, there were 385 dams in operation, with an additional 143 under construction, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Earlier this month, the minister acknowledged the increased evidence of the loss of watershed forests and vegetation, as well as a loss of soil adhesion, as a result of the developments.

The government has also announced sustainable and long-term missions to cope with storms in central Vietnam, including upgrading climate-change adaptation scenarios and relocating people in areas at risk of landslide and flooding.

No place like home

For those who have been living in the area for generations, like the parents of 21-year-old university student Le Thi Thuyen, leaving their storm-battered homes seems unfathomable.

“We can be accustomed to annual storms but whenever they come, we are still worried,” said Thuyen, a native of Quang Binh, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the central region.

Thuyen, who left for Ho Chi Minh City to study and is currently an intern at a non-governmental organisation in Vietnam’s biggest city, called her parents and siblings back home every day when the storms were pounding their commune, flooding and isolating homes in low-lying areas.

Tears welled up in her eyes when she thought of her 12-year-old brother who does not know how to swim.

Cemeteries were inundated as floodwaters rose in central Vietnam [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “I read news about kids who got swept away by the flood and I was really worried about my brother,” the 21-year-old said.

Thuyen’s parents, who make a living from agriculture and working on other people’s farms, have already been struggling this year because of the pandemic – and the storm season has created more problems, destroying their crops, and fish. It also meant weeks when there were no jobs to be found.

“Tet this year won’t be as fulfilling as others for us,” Thuyen said. “This time, it won’t be my parents supporting me, but I will be supporting them with what I can.”","Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/000_8V93XX-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'children', 'storms', 'water', 'change', 'pieces', 'central', 'relentless', 'floods', 'parents', 'living', 'pick', 'vietnamese', '2020s', 'climate']", ,flood

By Vatican News staff writer

Volunteers and workers of Caritas Vietnam are visiting and assisting people in the central provinces who have to face the brunt of 13 storms this year with some severe flooding.

The umpteenth storm

In just over a month, Vietnam's central region has seen 7 tropical storms and typhoons, causing floods and landslides that killed 235 people and caused an estimated $740,000 in damage in several provinces. The rain from the storms has caused the worst flooding in the region in more than 30 years.

The latest of these typhoons, Vamco, made landfall in Vietnam on Sunday with winds of up to 150 kph, after leaving 67 dead in the Philippines. The storm has damaged more than 400,000 homes, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. At least 150,000 people are at risk of going hungry.

According to Caritas, the social arm of the Catholic Church, rebuilding homes and recovering their livelihood are extremely important apart from immediate help and survival. Farming, such as growing vegetables, rice, raising livestock and poultry, which is the mainstay in the central provinces, has been devastated. Many families have lost everything in the floods and landslides.



Local Caritas in action

The new director of Caritas Vietnam, Father Joseph Ngo Si Dinh, led a delegation to the central provinces, Nov. 9-11, to survey the flooded areas. They first visited the Diocese of Hu? and its two adjoining provinces, talking to families and providing them material and spiritual support.

Father John Nguyen Huy Tuan, director of Caritas Ha Tinh, said priests were actively involved in bringing food and relief to the affected people and moving them to safer places.

Temporary shelters have been built to accommodate 25 families. A parish mobilised its young people to rescue families trapped in flooded homes.

No one excluded

Caritas Vietnam, in collaboration with dioceses and parishes, has been engaged in social outreach and charity works to help people after natural disasters.

The social arm of the Catholic Church assists people to rebuild their lives, repair damaged houses and build new homes for families who have lost theirs. It also provides people and families with seeds, livestock, water filtering systems, and finance for school children.

Caritas discussed ways to come up with concrete plans or projects to rebuild the lives of people regardless of their religion. Father Dinh has urged Catholics to help every person in need. “We hope that the people most affected by these storms, be they Catholic or not, will get some relief,” the Caritas director said.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/reuters/2020/10/13/14/1602592734645.JPG/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'storms', 'provinces', 'flood', 'caritas', 'social', 'homes', 'central', 'region', 'families', 'typhoons', 'storm', 'victims', 'assisting']", ,flood

On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.

The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.

The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.

On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh 400-500 mm, Quang Tri 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City 1,100 mm, Quang Nam 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai 600-800 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In this period, more than 130,000 houses, mostly in Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue provinces had been flooded, with some submerged by four meters.

Streak of tragedies

Around 3 a.m. on October 8, cargo vessel Vietship 01 of a Hanoi-based logistics firm was swept away by floods and rough seas as it docked at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri.

The ship had 12 male crew members on board when swept off. Four crew members who had fallen from the vessel made it safely to shore on October 9 and 10. One member, aged 45, had also jumped into the water but went missing before his body was retrieved on October 11.

Heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas derailed rescue efforts and the vessel sank to the bottom in shallow waters, leaving the rest of the crew and one fisherman, part of a rescue squad, stranded at sea.

It took rescue teams three days to reach the stranded vessel.

""It was difficult for modern vessels to reach the stranded ship so we had to rely on rudimentary boats and experienced fishermen for the mission,"" explained Colonel Le Van Phuong, head of Quang Tri Border Guard.

On the morning of October 11, the fisherman and a crew member jumped into the water and battled their way back through the rough seas and strong waves. Two teams of rescuers rushed to deliver them safely to shore.

Within the same day, a military helicopter was sent to the scene to rescue the remaining six crew members stuck on the vessel. Two days after he was rescued, however, ship captain Nguyen Van Bao, 51, passed away due to multiple organ failure and sepsis.

At midnight on October 12, a hill collapsed onto an operation center of Rao Trang 3 Hydropower Plant, located deep in a jungle of Phong Xuan Commune, Phong Dien District in Thua Thien-Hue.

The landslide buried 17 workers after 40 others escape to a nearby plant, called Rao Trang 4.

The story of the 17 workers is even more tragic since a 21-member rescue team that had set out to verify reports of their predicament got struck by the same calamity.

At midnight the next day, a landslide had buried the ranger station housing the entire rescue team. Only eight members managed to escape, with the remaining 13 confirmed dead, including Major General Nguyen Van Man, deputy commander of the 4th Military Region of Vietnam People's Army. The bodies of the 13 victims have all been found and identified, though only five of the 17 workers' bodies have been retrieved.

During funeral procedures for the 12 soldiers and their deputy commander, another landslide struck a barracks housing 27 personnel of Defense Economics Division 337, also managed by the 4th Military Region.

The division had been assigned to assist five remote communes in Huong Hoa District of Quang Tri, which borders Laos, in mitigating the impacts of prolonged flooding and landslides triggered by abnormally heavy downpours across the central region.

As the mountain collapsed onto their barracks in the first hours of October 19, the 27 division members were all sleeping, with only five managing to escape. Three more landslides buried the remaining 22.

By the afternoon of that day, all 22 bodies had been retrieved.

Luong Thi Ly, who lost her son Le The Linh to the landslide, said she could not believe he and his comrades had lost their lives during peace time.

New flood waves

And as mountainous areas reeled under repeated landslides, urban and coastal areas were hit by a new wave of flooding on October 18 and 20 due to the impact of tropical storms, the intertropical convergence zone and east winds in tandem with water discharged from dam projects.

On October 18, flood peaks recorded on the Hieu River of Quang Tri hit 5.36 m, passing the record level of 1983 by 0.78 m, while the peak on the Thach Han River rose to 7.4 m, 0.11 m higher than the 1999 record. In Quang Binh, floodwaters were measured at 4.88 m on October 19, or 0.97 m higher than the record in 1999.

For the second flood wave, more than 177,000 households in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri were inundated by floodwaters 1-4 m deep.

Many elderly people in Ha Tinh said for the past 40 years, they had never seen such severe flooding causing such serious damage.

In Quang Binh's Le Thuy District, a family who lost their 75-year-old grandmother, on October 17, had to hang her coffin from the roof of their house for nearly a week to avoid floodwaters.

More storms, floods and landslides

With heavy rains yet to show any signs of receding, Storm Saudel developed in the East Sea on October 20, though it had weakened and turned into a tropical depression as it reached the central coast on October 25.

Two days later, Molave entered the East Sea and headed straight to central Vietnam. It landed over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28 as the most powerful storm to have hit Vietnam in 20 years.

The storm had inflicted economic damage worth around VND10 trillion ($430.16 million), according to statistics from affected provinces. The loss was nearly 1.5 times higher than 2019’s total natural disaster-induced damage of VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), mostly ascribed to flooding, storms and landslides.

Subsequently, the storm triggered heavy rains that had led to more floods and landslides.

On October 28 alone, two different landslides struck Tra Leng and Tra Van communes in Quang Nam’s Nam Tra My District.

The Tra Van landslide buried 20, killing eight and injuring 12 while in Tra Leng, a mountain collapsed on 53 villagers, with 33 managing to escape, eight confirmed dead, and 12 still missing.

One day later in Phuoc Loc Commune, Phuoc Son District of Quang Nam, another landslide buried 11 victims. Seven have since been confirmed dead and four are still missing.

A survivor of the Tra Leng landslide, Nguyen Thanh Son, 56, had lost his wife to the accident. The bereaved husband cannot believe he has lost his family, house and entire village in the mere blink of an eye.

""Altogether, tumbling soil, mud, rocks, water and trees smashed in the roofs of our houses, sweeping everything away until hitting the foot of another mountain,"" Son recalled.

By the night of October 28, more than 4,000 families in Nghe An and Ha Tinh had been evacuated to safety after their neighborhoods had been submerged by up to two meters of water.

The third flood lasted until October 30 and by November 1, had receded.

A search operation has been launched for a missing rescue team as severe flooding and landslides battered central Vietnam, authorities said on Wednesday, as the country braced for further heavy rain.

Close to a million people have been impacted by heavy downpours and rising waters since mid last week, with more than 200,000 homes flooded, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Thirty-six people are now dead, Vietnam's disaster management authority said, while rescue workers have launched a search for around 30 people missing at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue province following landslides.

The missing include a team of soldiers and officials who had tried to find plant workers who disappeared days ago.

Images on state media showed helicopters and hundreds of soldiers struggling to access the site through thick mud and fallen trees.

Elsewhere across the central region, villages and rice fields were submerged, with relief workers resorting to makeshift boats and canoes to deliver food and bottled water to those stuck in flooded homes.

North central Vietnam was also hit by severe weather on Wednesday as Storm Nangka made landfall.

Forecasters said it could bring further rain in the coming days, while warning another storm was expected to form and make impact this weekend.

The IFRC said it had ""grave fears"" that the deadly floods would worsen as more rain was dumped on hard hit communities.

""These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods,"" said IFRC's Hung Ha Nguyen.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and is often affected by more than a dozen storms each year, regularly bringing flooding and landslides.

More then 130 people were reported dead or missing due to natural disasters in the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. “I wasn’t sad,” Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017’s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tay’s land. “That’s what I had to do.” He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldn’t be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasn’t wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. “Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them,” landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a “soft” levee girding the riverbank. She doesn’t view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. “The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and you’ve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made.” Dao’s mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, “a very sensitive and fragile area where ‘hard’ solutions [to erosion] won’t work”, said Dao, who has studied the region’s ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The “common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land”, Dao says. “Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down.” As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Dao’s words, “by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous”. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tay’s riverbank is like a pillow that doesn’t stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Dao’s green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses — a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, “people aren’t afraid of flooding”, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. “We have learnt to live with the floods,” he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. “Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive,” he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yen’s fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the island’s west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals’ trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the city’s famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes aren’t simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi An’s recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground. Dr Dao Ngo bought her own land in Triem Tay village to do her conservation work. Credit:Yen Duong “Now the ecological component is extremely important. In the past it was culture, now it’s ecology,” Hoi An’s vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local government’s development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. “Of course, it is difficult and it will take time,” says Hung. “Perhaps we won’t succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation.” As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemic’s wake, Hung doesn’t want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the city’s revenue. “We’ve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, there’ll be less to worry about.“

Ecology-based development, in Hung’s words, also means preserving the city’s forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. “If we achieve that, we’ll be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals’ life will definitely be improved.” Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. “You don’t see erosion here, but build-up [of land],” said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. “I’ve never seen these trees die because of flooding,” said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the river’s mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huong’s family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as “a fortune” on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river. Le Thi Huong, 59, a mangrove palm farmer, in her home made from the palms in Cam Thanh commune. Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. “The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; that’s why they protect it,” Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tay’s sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi An’s toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

The death toll from flooding and landslides in Vietnam continued to rise Tuesday, while those hit by the disasters triggered by tropical storms in the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos criticized government inaction and made urgent appeals for assistance.

In Vietnam, at least 104 people are dead in the country’s central region, with 49, 27, and 11 deaths reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam alone, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Control. Twenty-seven people are missing, including 15 workers from a hydropower plant in Quang Tri that was hit by a landslide on Oct. 12.

The committee said that some 90,000 residents of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Tri provinces have been evacuated to higher ground. Nearly 7,000 hectares of rice paddy and crop fields have been submerged, while more than 5,800 head of cattle and 685,000 poultry birds have been killed or carried away in floods.

Vietnamese state media on Tuesday reported that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved the allocation of 100 billion Vietnamese dong (U.S. $4.3 million) and 1,000 tons of rice to the five worst flood-hit provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Ha Tinh.

Meanwhile, the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre said a tropical depression in the Philippines has strengthened into what is being called Storm Saudel. Over the next 24 hours, Saudel is expected to enter the South China Sea—called the East Sea in Vietnam—and become the eighth storm to batter Vietnam’s central provinces since the start of the rainy season.

Tran Quang Nang, head of the weather forecasting department under the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre, rejected reports circulating on Facebook, allegedly citing Japanese forecasters, that Saudel is a super typhoon.

“All of these predictions about Typhoon Saudel are baseless and fake,” Nang said. “The Japanese weather forecasting center and other countries have said no such thing.”

Nang called on the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to “punish” those responsible for spreading inaccurate information on social networks, causing public confusion.

“This issue should be handled promptly to ensure people only access accurate information released by the authorities so they can respond to natural disasters, helping to mitigate the damage they cause,” he said.

In Cambodia, the death toll remained at 25 from a day earlier, with some 40,000 evacuated to temporary shelters, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha told RFA’s Khmer Service. More than 200,000 hectares of paddy field and nearly 80,000 farms have also been destroyed, with more than 500 school buildings and 79 garment factories damaged.

Roads, hospitals, and dams have also been affected, authorities said.

In a notice issued on Tuesday, the Poipet Administration of Banteay Meanchey province, along Cambodia’s border with Thailand, temporarily closed portions of National Road 5. Downtown Poipet saw flooding of homes and roads, which the notice attributed to rains in Thailand.

Sann Ratha, a resident of Kaun Damrei village, in Poipet’s Sangkat Nimith district, told RFA that water levels increased so rapidly that several hundred families were forced to leave their homes.

He said people are stranded and in desperate need of food and other supplies.

“We are under the attack from the flood—our village looks like a river now with water everywhere and houses submerged,” he said.

“The current situation is worse than during the [1967-1975] civil war. We need the authorities to help us immediately.”

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen traveled to affected areas visiting with victims and handing out food. He said in a post to his Facebook page that he plans to spend two days in hard-hit Banteay Meanchey province, where 13 of the country’s 25 deaths have occurred and an estimated 20,000 families have been affected.

Opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha is also traveling to Banteay Meanchey to provide assistance.

Din Puthy, head of the Poipet-based Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association, expressed skepticism over the government’s handling of the flooding Tuesday.

He voiced concerns that authorities appear to prefer taking selfies with small numbers of villagers and posting them on social media to pretend they are helping the victims.

“The victims are not receiving equal treatment,” he said. “Only a few people have received some assistance while many others have been left behind.”

More aid needed

In Laos, where storms have ravaged Savannakhet province in the country’s center, authorities remained unable to access many areas due to damaged roads and a lack of boats to transport aid and other supplies, Lao sources said.

More than 125 villages in eight districts have now been flooded, with many houses and over 10,000 hectares of paddy fields submerged, official sources in the province say. Nearly 30,000 people have been impacted in Savannakhet, according to official count.

An official from Savannakhet’s inundated Phin district told RFA Tuesday that people are in need of dry goods, drinking water, medicine, and other necessities. The official said that while most aid had been distributed it still is not enough.

“In Phin district, 45 villages are heavily flooded, but they have received some help already—they mostly need sticky rice and consumer goods,” he said.

He said villagers with boats had been using them to help one another and that there have been no accidents during rescue and supply operations.

A villager in Phin told RFA that the water level is so high that the local river had flooded homes along its banks and urged authorities to provide more assistance.

“They have helped a little, but it’s very difficult for us,” he said. “Higher-level authorities should take care of this. We’re asking for more rice—all houses need rice to eat.”

Authorities in Savannakhet’s Xonbury district said waters remain high and will rise in days to come, forcing villagers to stay in clubs, schools, and other places set up by the local government as temporary shelters until flooding recedes.

According to the Meteorology Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Laos will continue to endure heavy rains and strong winds throughout the country in coming days. It urged villagers to remain vigilant for flash floods and landslides.

Storm Molave, which made landfall at around 11 am local time on Wednesday, is one of the strongest storms to hit the southeast Asian nation in 20 years.

The resulting “extreme rainfall” could continue over the coming days, worsening the already precarious situation faced by many families, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a statement.

“For the affected populations, their homes remain severely damaged, their food stocks have been lost, they have no access to clean water for drinking, washing and cooking; and water and sanitation systems have been damaged,” said the agency.

Evacuation centres flooded

Thousands have been moved to evacuation centres, which are themselves flooded, resulting in difficult health and hygiene conditions for the displaced people, primarily women, children and elderly. Health centres have also been damaged, leaving without to access basic health care services.

“Added to this is the trauma of the violent storms and rushing waters, that for a population where many cannot swim, creates fear and impacts mental wellbeing,” UNICEF added.

The storm has also damaged vital infrastructure, including electricity and roads, leaving many communities cut off from assistance and protection.

Affected populations

An estimated 7.7 million people live in the affected areas, including as many as 1.5 million who have been “directly affected”, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam said in a humanitarian update late Wednesday.

Of these, some 177,000 people considered vulnerable (poor or near-poor), should be prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance, it added.

Response

According to the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UN agencies and partners are developing and will release a multi-sector response plan, within the coming days, to support emergency relief efforts.

In the immediate term, UNICEF has mobilized to provide emergency water, nutrition, sanitation, education and protection support, it said in the statement. It is also coordinating with Government agencies and humanitarian actors to reach the most vulnerable and those most affected.

Description of the disaster

The central region of Viet Nam was experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimetres of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 150 millimetres of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. Additionally, Tropical Storm Saudel hit Viet Nam on 25 October closely followed by Typhoon Molave on 28 October. Typhoon Molave was one of the most devastating typhoons making landfall in Vietnam in decades. The typhoon made landfall after a series of tropical storms hitting Viet Nam and had caused severe flooding and at least three landslides which tragically resulted in the loss of 40 lives. 44 people are still missing, and six people are severely injured. On 5 November, Typhoon Goni made landfall in Viet Nam and Tropical Storm Atsani made landfall on 7 November. Tropical storm Vamco, was the latest to hit central Viet Nam as it made landfall on 15 November 2020.

The recurrent storms bringing heavy rainfall have caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. The Viet Nam National Disaster Management Agency (VNDMA) has reported that many areas in central Vietnam recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 1,600 millimeters between 5 to 20 October 2020, with peaks of 2,400 millimeters in some locations over the same period. The Hieu River (Quang Tri), Bo River (Hue), Gianh River and Kien Giang River (Quang Binh) have reached historically high levels, and in some locations flood waters have exceeded the previous historical highs recorded in 1979 and 1999. In addition, hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs to prevent them from bursting.

Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Authorities estimate that a nearly eight million people have been exposed to the storms, and some 1.5 million people have been directly affected by the storms and floods. On 4 November, ahead of typhoon Goni’s landfall, 98,819 households (372,631 people) in six provinces (Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen) were evacuated to safe shelters. Similarly, evacuations took place on 7 November in anticipation of typhoon Atsani, and on the 15th November ahead of typhoon Vamco’s landfall additional evacuations have been carried out in seven provinces of central Viet Nam with a total of 93,795 households (324,780 people) evacuated to safer places (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai).

Most of the people who had been evacuated have now returned home after their local authorities’ approval. They are actively repairing their homes with the help of their relatives. However, according to the VNDMA 31,637 households must be urgently relocated because they lost their shelter or their houses which have collapsed or been too heavily damaged, and they are now living with host families. After the latest typhoon (Vamco), according to the VNDMA, at least 243 are reported to have been killed or are missing and over two million livestock have been killed or swept away. The floods have caused significant damage to infrastructure including roads, schools, health centres and community facilities. It is reported that 1,569 schools have been affected included 360 schools flooded or damaged, while 46,916 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people are now in desperate needs of emergency relief, such as safe shelter, safe drinking water, food and livelihood income support.","Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1546577-MDRVN020eu1.png?itok=7nf8va0m,"['vietnam', 'n', 'nam', 'update', 'mdrvn020', 'quang', 'provinces', 'viet', 'storms', 'emergency', 'tropical', 'typhoon', 'n1', 'floods', 'central', 'storm', 'operation', 'landfall']", ,flood

These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.

Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.

The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.

As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing.

In addition, 150,000 people have been evacuated and significant impacts on transportation networks and agricultural livelihoods have been reported.

USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance partner VNRC is on the frontline of the response and has mobilized rapid disaster response teams established and trained through ongoing USAID disaster risk reduction programs to support evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency response operations, said the ambassador.

""We stand together with the government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones, address the damage caused by this terrible flood, and move forward, as the people of Vietnam have always done. We pledge to assist you in your work to rebuild,"" he said.

""I would also like to express my concern for persons with disabilities in the provinces affected by the typhoon as they are amongst the most vulnerable populations in this disaster. They are often home-bound, have less access to information and cannot take full advantage of preparedness activities and evacuation protocols,"" he added.

It is estimated that the provinces impacted by storm Linfa are home to over 200,000 persons with disabilities, of whom 61,000 are directly affected by this disaster.

Since 2000, USAID, through the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, has provided over $26 million in disaster response, preparedness, and risk reduction assistance in Vietnam.

Through the Department of Defense, the U.S. government has also provided more than $28 million since 1998 to train military and civilian emergency responders and develop and equip disaster management centers, maritime response centers, and disaster shelters at community level.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/17/anh124581602340198-1602931391-3782-3057-1602931440_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'response', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'central', 'aids', 'floods', 'landslide', 'usaid', 'affected', 'linfa', '100000', 'cope', 'provided']", ,flood

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to bring them to safety beyond rising floodwater in Cambodia’s western province of Battambang, which is expected to worsen on Sunday.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces – Pursat, Battambang and Pailin – have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall heralding the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

“A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,” Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told the AFP news agency late on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to get worse.

In central Vietnam, almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking northern Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand’s Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to place sandbags and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial Governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Flooding also affected Vietnam’s old city of Hoi An following heavy rainfall in the Mekong region [Vietnam News Agency via AFP] Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

“The water is three metres deep in some parts,” he told reporters on Saturday.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

The campaign was organized by Ron Haeberle, the American photographer best known for capturing the My Lai Massacre in 1968, with assistance from Chuck Searcy, co-founder of Project RENEW, an organization that deals with unexploded ordnance left from the Vietnam War, according to a Thursday press release.

The funds would be distributed in Quang Tri Province by Project RENEW staff and in Quang Ngai Province by Quang Ngai Red Cross, it was added. Distribution in Quang Tri would begin on Jan. 25, while a check would be delivered by Project RENEW to Quang Ngai on Jan. 15, it said.

Last year, central Vietnam, particularly the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Quang Ngai and Quang Nam, were wrecked by a series of storms and tropical depressions.

The resulting floods and landslides killed at least 192 people and caused property losses of around VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion). More than 1,500 houses were destroyed and 240,000 others damaged. The daily lives of around 5.5 million people were severely disrupted.

The Vietnamese government has provided around VND770 billion to the region as emergency relief. Many international organizations and countries like the U.S., U.K. and Australia also provided aid to help residents resume normal life.","Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2021/01/14/taohoangdidanhienluong04160319-8967-6000-1610632024_1200x0.jpg,"['war', 'vietnam', 'renew', 'project', 'veterans', 'quang', 'water', 'flood', 'relief', 'central', 'villagers', 'donate', 'ngai', '28000', 'tri']", ,flood
31,31,FL-2018-000121-VNM,Guy Carpenter Launches Probabilistic Vietnam Flood Model - GC Capital Ideas,https://www.gccapitalideas.com/2020/11/09/guy-carpenter-launches-probabilistic-vietnam-flood-model/,"Guy Carpenter today announced the launch of its new Vietnam Flood Model. The fully probabilistic model provides countrywide coverage and enables insurers to assess their exposure to floods, which affect 70 percent of the country’s population.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue simulating both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding. The fluvial component of the hazard was developed using state-of-the-art hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate rainfall and river discharges across the river network in the country. Pluvial flooding is simulated using a proprietary, in-house methodology accounting for local climate conditions, soil type, land use and topography.

Offering enhanced flexibility, the model can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves, and average annual losses at virtually any level of aggregation. The model outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk® platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region. “The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon. These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.

Many parts of Hoi An, a famous tourist destination, are submerged.

Nguyen The Hung, vice chairman of the town, said the water level reached 1.3 meters on Thursday morning, 0.3 meters above flood danger level 1, prompting authorities to suspend all tourism-related activities.

Quang Tri, which has the historic Hien Luong Bridge and beautiful beaches, was hit by up to 409 mm of rain in the last two days.

Some residential areas in Lao Bao Town are under three meters of water.

Nguyen Khiem, a resident of Lao Bao, said: ""The floodwaters started to rise from Wednesday night. The water level is 0.5 m higher than during the historic floods of 2019.""

In Huong Hoa District 1,100 families have been evacuated to safer areas, but local authorities said four people were swept away and remain missing as of Thursday.

Many roads in Quang Tri have been blocked by severe landslides.

Quang Binh, home to Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and the world's largest cave Son Doong, received rainfall of up to 338 mm in a day. Many places are inundated and students have been told to stay at home to ensure their safety.

The national park in Bo Trach District has closed itself off to tourists since Wednesday due to rising water levels in some rivers.

Thua Thien-Hue Province, which boasts the popular tourist town Hue, got up to 500 mm of rainfall in the past day.

Prolonged downpours and heavy discharge by dams flooded thousands of homes in the province’s downstream areas.

Many streets in Da Nang, a popular tourist city, were under 40 cm of water on Wednesday.

Central localities from Ha Tinh to Quang Ngai provinces should expect heavy rains of 330-400 mm a day until Sunday, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

There could be 11-13 storms and tropical depressions forming over the East Sea this year, half of them hitting Vietnam, meteorologists have warned.

Its long coastline makes Vietnam particularly vulnerable to destructive storms and flooding.

The storm also set off landslides and knocked out power lines, leaving 1.7 million people in the dark.



Storm Molave, the ninth storm this year in the South China Sea and the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years, struck coastal provinces on Oct. 28 with heavy rainfall and winds as high as 115-135 km per hour, according to data provided by Vietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting on Wednesday.



Landslides in central provinces have killed at least 19 people and buried more than 40 others, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, adding that the bodies of 12 fishermen missing since the storm hit on Wednesday were recovered on Thursday, leaving another 14 still unaccounted for.



Around 56,000 houses were stripped of their roofs in Quang Ngai, where a massive blackout from downed power lines left more than a million people trapped in darkness as high winds tore through the province, according to state-controlled Vietnam News, AP said.



Wednesday’s storm hit central regions already devastated by weeks of heavy rains, floods, and landslides beginning Oct. 6 that left at least 130 dead and thousands displaced. The floods and landslides also wrecked highways and roads, blocking efforts to rescue and bring supplies to many cut off from help in remote areas.



Speaking to RFA on Thursday, residents in storm-hit provinces described fast-rising waters and devastated fields, with one saying that floodwaters had risen more quickly now than they had during the storms that battered the area earlier this month.



“During previous storms and floods, the water rose only to the height of my hand. But now the water rose so high that my house was submerged,” Hien Thao, a resident of Quang Tri province, speaking to RFA on Oct. 29.



“I lost 500 kg of paddy rice, and many of my household belongings were washed away,” he said.



“Yesterday, the water rose up to the yard of my house,” added 40-year-old Phan Quoc Vu of Truong Xa commune in Cam Lo district’s Cam Hieu village in Quang Tri. “But luckily it began to recede today,” he said.



“In the opinion of my 80-year-old father, this was the worst storm flooding that he can remember,” Vu said.



Calls for help



At the height of the flood, Vu called unsuccessfully to local authorities for help, and even posted calls for help on social media, but finally had to hire canoes to help evacuate elderly people and young children to safer ground, he said.



In Ninh Thuan province, villagers had made their living mainly through farming and raising shrimp, said Tran Thanh Truc, a resident of the province’s Hien Luong commune.



“But the floodwaters washed everything away—pigs, chickens, and shrimp,” she said. “We are glad to receive whatever help others can give us, but it will be difficult to make up for everything that was lost.”



In Quang Tri, supplies including large quantities of rice have been received so far only from volunteers, Hien Thao said, adding that the local People’s Committee has promised to bring relief goods soon.



“I also learned that the government will provide us with seeds for farming our next crop in the winter and spring.”



“We would like them to also give us boats and other equipment we need, along with rice that will help us while we wait for our next crop to be ready for harvest,” he said.



In Truong Xa commune, officials have cared so far only for their own relatives, though, Pham Quoc Vu said.



“They are not impartial, which is causing much suspicion,” he said.



Heavy rains, flooding in Laos



In Laos, heavy rains and flooding from Wednesday’s storm damaged or destroyed around 51,000 hectares of agricultural production, including more than 23,000 hectares of rice fields, across 13 districts of Savannakhet province, state media sources said on Friday.



Total losses in farm production and livestock from flooding in the storm are now estimated at 283 billion kip (U.S. $6,257,968.), Keoodom Souliya—an official from the province’s Agriculture and Forestry Department—said on Thursday.



In the southern province of Champassak, strong winds toppled power lines, while in Borikhamxay province, Khamkeut district’s Napae village was completely destroyed by floods, a video obtained by RFA showed on Friday, with a narrator on the video saying Napae had now become “a sea of water.”



The video also showed floods and landslides blocking the road leading from Napae to the Naphao International Border Checkpoint with Vietnam.



A rice paddy being harvested was also under water, Phetsamai Xayaathichak told local media. “We will announce the exact amount of local damage later, once we know what it is,” he said.



A total number of deaths in Laos resulting from the storm was not immediately available.

38,38,FL-2018-000121-VNM,Megaprojects threaten water justice for local communities - EurekAlert,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uoa-mtw051821.php,"Urban megaprojects tend to be the antithesis of good urban planning. They have a negative impact on local water systems, deprive local communities of water-related human rights, and their funders and sponsors have little accountability for their impact.

These are the findings of the University of Adelaide's Dr Scott Hawken from the School of Architecture and Built Environment who led a review of the impact of urban megaprojects on water justice in South East Asia.

""Urban megaprojects have severe implications for environmental processes,"" said Dr Hawken.

""They have a major impact on hydrological systems and during all phases of development affect water security and human rights.

""As well as interrupting urban water flows and waste removal, they cause biodiversity degradation and loss of arable landscapes, and increase pollution and change the flood regimes of rivers.""

The study, published in the journal Cities, focussed on the Phu My Hung project in Vietnam, the Amarapura project in Myanmar and Boeung Kak Lake in Cambodia, and is the result of Dr Hawken's engagement with recent calls from the United Nations for greater accountability in megaprojects globally.

Urban megaprojects have been a key mode of development in Southeast Asia since the 1980s. Between three and 14 per cent of GDP is invested in these kind of developments in SE Asia and eight per cent globally. They can include urban regeneration schemes, transport and energy infrastructure, industrial corridors, city clusters, new towns, innovation districts, science and technology parks and sports infrastructure.

""The projects we looked at are typical of most major cities in Southeast Asia in that they are located near coasts or major rivers which exposes people who live there to extreme weather events such as floods and erosion,"" said Dr Hawken.

""At every stage of these projects there needs to be a more systematic approach to sustainability especially when assessing their impact on water security. The community needs to be more involved and funders and sponsors need to be more accountable for the impact.

""Wealthier residents tend to benefit from these urban enclaves while they dramatically displace and disrupt existing economics and social relations. Poor socio-economic urban residents are disproportionately adversely affected.""

Megaprojects are often publicly positioned as economic benefactors for cities with governments and developers framing them as delivering wealth and new technologies to urban regions.

""Considering the prominence of this development model, it is unacceptable that there is so little information or recourse when these projects do not deliver on their promises,"" said Dr Hawken.

""Existing urban issues are rarely solved by these projects so a new approach is needed to better engage with communities and their socio-ecological relationships with natural water systems. Considering where they are built such projects also expose cities to future climate related disasters such as sea-level rise and flooding.

""Our findings and recommendations are relevant to cities around the world which are in semi-aquatic, delta environments and sensitive water catchment areas.

The government decided to grant VND500 billion ($21.52 million) to five central provinces worst hit by historic flooding for rescue and social welfare support.

The five provinces, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Nam, would receive VND100 billion each as part of the government’s efforts to help local communities overcome the consequences of devastating floods, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh sait at a meeting in Quang Tri on Thursday morning.

The government also provided each of the five provinces with 1,000 tons of rice alongside medicine and antiseptic chemicals.

Senior Lieutenant General Le Chiem, Deputy Minister of National Defense, said the ministry has provided 22 tons of dried food to flooded provinces. For Quang Tri, military forces also provided seven motorboats, 36 generators and three water pumps for after-flood clean-up work along with 1,000 life jackets.

Chiem suggested local authorities distribute dried food to victims in flood-prone areas immediately and properly.

In the past, the defense ministry found ""some local leaders had given dried food to officials as gifts because it was delicious,"" Chiem said. ""The dried food is meant for flood victims. They are in need.""

Binh said damage caused by floods in Quang Tri was ""very huge,"" especially in the two mountainous districts of Huong Hoa and Dak Rong where infrastructure has been heavily affected.

Therefore, the government has granted an additional VND40 billion for these two districts to cope with the flood impacts.

Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said floodwater started receding gradually, so it is necessary to focus on relief for flood victims, from Quang Nam to Ha Tinh.

Many international organizations have pledged donations of cash and disaster relief to help central Vietnam.

For more than two weeks, the central region has been swept by historic flooding and deadly landslides that caused damage described by government officials as worst in five years.

At least 114 people in central Vietnam were killed by severe flooding and landslides and more than 170,000 houses in flood-prone Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces have been submerged, with many areas currently isolated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/huukhoatangle21603267443-16033-3261-6190-1603358848_1200x0.jpg,"['floodhit', 'dried', 'vietnam', 'binh', 'mln', 'quang', 'aid', 'provinces', '21', 'disaster', 'minister', 'central', 'grants', 'food', 'victims', 'support', 'tri', 'provided']", ,flood

She said the UNDP plans to build an additional 4,000 houses next year, helping 20,000 people gain access to information on climate change and natural disasters, she said, adding that her agency would continue to support Vietnam in natural disaster management over the next decade.

Tran Quang Hoai, head of the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority, said the houses built by the UNDP in central Vietnam were still standing after the region’s historic storms and floods in October and November, which had demolished over 1,500 houses and damaged 240,000 others.

La Thi Kim Ngan, deputy head of the National Institute of Architecture, said that authorities and investors need to create a comprehensive model for housing complexes, complete with infrastructure like electricity, clean water and waste management systems.

Flood resilient houses can become homestay accommodations and help the region develop economically, she added.

Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said his ministry was cooperating with the architecture institute and the Ministry of Construction to develop appropriate and safe housing models to withstand natural disasters.

It is estimated that by 2025, Vietnam would have around 30 million people living in areas prone to natural disasters. Many of them are likely to be poverty stricken.

Rapid urbanization and economic development can intensify natural disaster risks for Vietnam's coastline and wipe billions of dollars off its economic growth over the next decade, a World Bank report warned in October.

Around 11.8 million people in coastal provinces face the threat of intense flooding, and over 35 percent of settlements are located on eroding coastlines. Each year, an average of $852 million, along with around 316,000 jobs in sectors like agriculture, aquaculture and tourism, are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding, the report said.","Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/17/img065481941608185336-16082067-5924-6541-1608206823_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'needs', 'proof', 'flood', 'disaster', 'undp', 'coast', 'management', 'development', 'natural', 'vietnams', 'million', '100000', 'houses', 'coastal']", ,flood

Another powerful storm is testing Southeast Asian disaster responders after Typhoon Goni crashed into the Philippines on 1 November, before veering towards flood-hit central Vietnam.

Goni, known as Rolly in the Philippines, made landfall on Sunday on Catanduanes Island in the country’s east, bringing violent winds and extensive flooding. The Red Cross says there’s “massive devastation” in some areas, including 90 percent of the homes in villages in one part of Catanduanes.

Philippine authorities are still assessing the total damage, but the government said 11 people had died as of 2 November, with numbers still rising.

The evacuation of at least 450,000 people and early response planning helped avoid a worse outcome, but aid groups warn that the combined hit from a barrage of recent storms and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will test communities for months to come.

The Philippines has been locked in disaster response mode for weeks after previous storms caused extensive flooding in parts of Luzon, the country’s main island. Typhoon Molave, known as Quinta in the Philippines, killed at least 23 people in October; Typhoon Saudel, known as Pepito, struck days earlier.

Attention now turns to Vietnam, which is preparing for a weakened Goni to strike its flood-hit central region around 5 November – the country’s fifth major storm since mid-October.

Typhoon Goni’s wind speeds slowed to around 90 kilometres per hour by 2 November, but successive storms over the past month have driven severe floods and landslides across central Vietnam.

Vietnam’s government says roughly 160 people have died, with dozens more missing in the worst flooding to hit the country in 20 years. The disasters have inundated more than a quarter of a million homes, and prompted a $40 million humanitarian appeal targeting 177,000 people.

The Philippines isn’t in the clear, either. Another storm, Atsani or Siony, could careen toward northern Luzon in the coming days, though forecasters say its current path is extremely erratic.

Floods are common during Asia’s various monsoon and cyclone seasons, but aid groups say the damage has been particularly severe this year.

Typhoon Goni was the strongest storm to hit the country since 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,300 people and led to a massive humanitarian response.

Climate change is fuelling more volatile extreme weather across the globe. The Philippines’ first typhoon of the season, Vongfong or Ambo, arrived relatively early in May; the storm season typically hits its peak in July.

Posting on Twitter, Yeb Saño, who was the Philippines’ climate negotiator when Haiyan struck in 2013, said Typhoon Goni and the burst of recent extreme weather is further proof of a crisis.

“The climate emergency persists and is wreaking havoc,” he said.

Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam.

The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.

The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.

The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.

As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.

Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light.""

Australia is already making ongoing efforts to support Vietnam’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $10.5 million assistance package in June.

Earlier this week the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management, the United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

""From 2 a.m. until now, there have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,"" local official Ha Ngoc Duong said, as reported by Vietnamese newspaper VnExpress, warning that the situation could worsen.

The bodies of some 22 soldiers from the army camp were recovered early on Sunday morning, according to local media reports. Ongoing rain has hampered rescue efforts. Days before, 13 rescue team members died trying to reach a group of 30 employees of a hydropower plant that had been buried by the landslides.

The rains have flooded nearly 200,000 houses in the region.

Widespread damage

Authorities also warned that river levels in the country had reached their highest in two decades, state media said.

The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides. Torrential downpours have flooded nearly 200,000 houses and 300 schools in the region.

Since storms began on October 6, some 72 people have died and a further 19 are still missing, Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said in a report.

Though Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, which often bring flooding and landslides, this month's disaster has been the worst the country has faced in years.

Neighboring Cambodia has also been affected by heavy flooding in the region. The death toll there jumped to 20 on Saturday, according to disaster management authorities.

Several areas of Vietnam hit by the worst floods in decades. In the last month, torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing, and created hardship for 240 thousand families. Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs mobilized. The strengthening of relations between the two countries can be linked to the US's anti-Beijing strategies.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) - Taiwan has donated 400,000 US dollars in aid to Vietnam to support the local population, hit by the worst floods and landslides in decades. In the past two weeks, storms no. 6 and 7 have caused serious damage in the central-northern provinces of Hà Tinh, Qu?ng Bình, Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên-Hu? and in the central-southern ones Ðà N?ng, Qu?ng Nam, Qu?ng Ngãi, Bình Ð?nh and Phú Yên.

The Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention reports that torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing since late September. River levels have risen rapidly in central areas of Vietnam, flooding 212 municipalities inhabited by 240 thousand families.

Many communities are isolated; at the moment in the devastated areas it is possible to move mostly with small boats. Victims are in immediate need of food, bottled water, medicine, clothing, blankets and books.

At the end of the emergency, money will be needed for reconstruction, especially seeds and agricultural machinery. Many Vietnamese have mobilized to support the flood victims. Groups of young people, including Catholics, brought rice, spaghetti (noodles) and drinking water to the most remote flooded areas.

Richard Shih, Taiwanese representative in Hanoi, said that Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs operating in Vietnam have mobilized and sent aid to disaster areas. He hopes the victims can rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon.

The aid delivery ceremony took place on 23 October in the presence of Tr?n Quang Hoài, director of the Vietnamese agency for the management of natural disasters. The Hanoi representative thanked the generosity of the government and the people of Taiwan, stressing that the distribution of aid will start as soon as possible.

The Taiwanese authorities highlighted the strong ties that unite their country to Vietnam. More than 320,000 Vietnamese migrants live and work in Taiwan; Taipei is Hanoi's seventh trading partner, with a turnover of 13.5 billion euros in 2019. The two nations also share fears about the growth of Chinese power, an aspect that links the strengthening of their relations with the United States anti-Beijing strategy in the region.","Mon, 26 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM-TAIWAN_-_1026_-_Aiuti_ter.jpg,"['areas', 'donates', 'vietnam', 'dollars', 'aid', 'flood', 'taiwan', 'qu?ng', 'mobilized', 'vietnamese', 'caused', '400000', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

Her parents waded around the house to salvage the family’s most valuable belongings like the refrigerator, TV and stove, and put them on a table that is reinforced with four blocks of wood.

Within a span of not even a day, Huong Toan turned from green paddy fields to muddy sea in the afternoon. With the electricity duly cut and dusk falling, the area, now flooded for dozens of kilometers along National Highway 1, slowly sank into darkness.

Also on October 9, in Huong Van Commune, about six kilometers away, Le Thi Thuc spent a sleepless night watching the water rise.

""I say ‘keeping watch,’ but the water will rise anyway even if I’m asleep. But my mind can be a little bit at rest if I watch it,"" she said.

The 54-year-old too has been confined at home for several days.

That night the entire family took refuge in the bedroom of her 85-year-old mother, whose room is situated farthest from the water. Thuc told her three children to go to sleep early, reminding them to turn off their phones to save the battery for the coming days without electricity.

Dung, her husband, shone the flashlight at the floor, sighing. The water was closing in. That night none of the three adults in the household slept a wink.

The local rice milling shop closed as soon as it started raining, catching Thuc off guard, leaving her no time to prepare enough food for the family.

Luckily her sister, who lives on higher ground, helped out, rowing a boat to Thuc’s house to deliver much-needed rice, bamboo shoot broth and boiled duck.

Seeing the family of six enjoying a meal sitting on a bed, surrounded by floodwater, Thuc could not help but weep.

For the next eight days the water ebbed and flowed. The children kept asking when the rain would stop, but the weather forecast kept getting gloomier.

The whole family had to shovel and sweep the mud and sludge entering the house. ""It was like walking in a swamp,"" they said.

Last Friday the water started to recede a little, going down to waist level, and Thuc took the opportunity to go out and buy some fish and vegetables. Looking around the neighborhood after being trapped inside the house for a week, she failed to recognize the place.

In Huong Toan, the situation has been grim. With the water showing no signs of receding, Hoang Trong Hieu, the commune chairman, other officials and police officers have not gone home for the last 10 days.

The group, which consists of over 20 people, has divided itself to take 24-hour shifts at the People’s Committee office to distribute supplies and respond to emergencies like transporting the injured and evacuating people.

Since the entire commune is under a meter of water, all travel is done by boat.

""It has been a long time since we saw our feet,"" a member of the group joked, carrying bags of rice on his shoulder in chest-deep water. The man had given Luong’s family two cartons of instant noodles the other day.

The day before electricity was cut, Luong’s had some vegetables, eggs and fish in the refrigerator, but only enough for two days for the family of three. So for the next eight days they had nothing to eat but rice and dry fish.

""I was given instant noodles but did not dare eat them because I did not want to urinate too much,"" he explained.

Luong’s wife, who had surgery just a month ago, stumbled in the dark and fell one night as she sought to go to the bathroom amid the sea of water. Since then he has been placing pots by the bed and replaces the candles twice every night.

""There are a lot of mosquitoes due to all the water.""

In Huong Van Commune, Nguyen Van Lieu, 63, has taken over the most dangerous task from his wife since the floods came: cooking. He dons his conical hat and raincoat every day to light the stove, standing in chest-deep water.

""If my wife gets into the water to cook, it will come up to her neck,"" he joked, patting his wife’s back with a smile.

Their house was almost completed earlier this year but the roof has not been finished. The family is among the luckier ones in the neighborhood since the water only comes up to the thighs even during the heaviest rains.

But the kitchen is a different story. There had been over 20 bags of rice, weighing over a ton, but everything was soaked the very first night. Vy, Lieu’s wife, had no choice but to give them away to her neighbors to feed their ducks and chickens. She has been borrowing rice from others.

They have not told their two eldest children, who are workers in the south, about their situation, not wanting to worry them.

Like many others, the couple have been trapped inside their home, situated just 100 m from the national highway, for more than a week. Every day Vy would cast her gaze on the other side of the highway to look at the paddy fields longingly despite realizing they must be submerged under water.

A few days before the rains came she had sold her first few gourds of the season. ""They sell well this year at VND10,000 (43 cents) per kilogram,"" she said. She was hoping to earn around VND10 million from selling them all over two months.

But that was before the storm came. She was only able to sell for two days, earning VND240,000, before she was forced to remain at home.

She and her husband have been reminiscing about the historic flood in Thua Thien Hue 21 years ago. The deluge in November 1999 had submerged thousands of houses and paralyzed all traffic and electrical and communication systems in the province. There had been rainfall of up to 2,300 mm in just the first three days. Several people had been swept away and killed during that disaster.

At that time the couple and their children stacked two beds on top of each other and waited for the floods to recede, the anguished voices of people who lost loved ones in the background.

Their son, seeing how his parents had to face flooding year after year, wanted to help them find a safer place to live in, but they cannot countenance moving out of their hometown.

More heavy rains are expected in central Vietnam regions at least until Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Rivers are expected to rise further, as is the risk of floods and landslides. Vehicles continue to line up along National Highway 1 and other roads on higher ground as people park their cars and motorbikes there to avoid the water.

But the people cannot do the same, they cannot just leave their houses. The only thing that Luong, Thuc and Lieu can do is to barricade themselves inside their homes and pray for the water to go away","Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/19/fbbdc0d9e2fe1ca045ef7172160297-3133-2038-1603105515_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'misery', 'rice', 'water', 'province', 'rain', 'thuc', 'floods', 'house', 'amid', 'days', 'wife', 'drowns', 'thua', 'night', 'family', 'continuing']", ,flood

Australia, Switzerland and Thailand have offered aid to victims of multiple storms and floods in central Vietnam last month.

The Australian embassy in Hanoi said on Friday its government will provide an additional AUD2 million ($1.45 million) to help Vietnam respond to the impacts of prolonged floods and landslides in the central region. The country had earlier provided AUD100,000 ($71,300).

The aid money will be used to meet urgent needs like providing clean water and sanitation and hygiene and dignity kits to affected people, and support the restoration of clean water supply to schools.

The Swiss embassy also announced grant of urgent aid worth CHF300,000 ($333,000) to help address the immediate needs of 160,000 people focusing on housing, livelihoods, healthcare, water, and hygiene.

In a phone call to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-o-cha, offered $30,000 toward relief efforts.

The central region was repeatedly hit by torrential rains, widespread flooding and landslides triggered by four storms in October.

So far 235 people have been killed or are missing, almost 390,000 houses were flooded and more than 300,000 families have been evacuated, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority.

Many people have lost almost all their household possessions or had their homes, food stocks, livestock, and crops badly damaged.

According to Tran Phuoc Anh, acting director of the city’s Foreign Department, the sustainable flood prevention project for Thu Duc City would have a total investment of more than $1bn, and would be implemented as a public–private project with the participation of the Dutch government.

Le Hoa Binh, deputy chair of HCMC, said he hoped the Netherlands would help create a city that was “sustainable and well adapted to climate change”.

Elizabeth Akkerman, the Dutch ambassador to Vietnam, said her government would help HCMC and Thu Duc City with advanced construction technologies.

Thu Duc will be based on advanced industries such as autonomous manufacturing, and will include the university precinct in Thu Duc as well as a new-build urban area and financial centre on the Thu Thiem Peninsula.

Thu Duc is the most elevated area in HCMC, but still suffers from seasonal flooding, and its residents suffer from inundation of streets and even houses every time there is heavy rain or a high tide.

In May 2019, HCMC sent a delegation to the Netherlands to study its urban development and flood management methods, and a number of memorandums of understanding were subsequently signed, including a $1bn anti-flooding project in Thu Duc City.

A tropical depression is projected to hit central Vietnam on Friday night, bringing heavy rains as the area struggles to recover from more than a week of flooding.

As of 10 a.m. Friday, the tropical depression was about 290 km to the east of Da Nang and Binh Dinh Province, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Its maximum wind speed was 50 kph.

Within the next 12 hours, the tropical depression would move west at about 30 kph, before making landfall in central Vietnam, then devolving into a low-pressure area over southern Laos.

By 10 p.m. Friday, the low-pressure area would be above the mountainous area of central Vietnam, with a maximum wind speed of 40 kph.

Rough seas and strong winds should be expected in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, within the next 24 hours.

Central Vietnam should expect particularly heavy rain from now until Wednesday next week, according to the center. Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and southern Nghe An should expect a total rainfall of up to 900 mm during the period, while Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and northern Nghe An should expect up to 500 mm.

Da Nang and its neighbor Quang Nam Province, home to popular ancient town Hoi An, should expect rainfall of up to 500 mm, while regions between Quang Ngai and Phu Yen should expect levels of up to 350 mm.

The Central Highlands should also expect heavy rain until Sunday, with rainfall of up to 250 mm.

Rains are expected to persist in central Vietnam even after Wednesday, the center noted.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Since last week, central Vietnam has been hit by torrential rains, floods and landslides after a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

On Sunday, Storm Linfa intensified from the turbulence and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. The next day, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

At least 56 people have been killed, including two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while coming to rescue the workers.

Thousands of homes in the region have been flooded.

Torrential downpours and discharge of water from hydropower dams have caused rivers in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces to swell and threaten severe flooding.

Storm Molave, said to be the strongest to hit Vietnam in the last two decades, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Wednesday morning before weakening into a tropical depression by 4 p.m.

The provinces have been hit by rains of up to 500 mm between Tuesday night and Wednesday night. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In Quang Ngai, the Tra Bong River was flowing above flood warning danger level 2 at Chau O station while the Tra Khuc, Ve and Tra Cau rivers had crossed the highest danger level of 3 by 4 p.m. Wednesday, according to the province's Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

They are forecast to continue rising quickly on Thursday, possibly triggering severe flooding in large parts of Quang Ngai Town, the capital, and several districts.

The release of water by local hydropower dams is worsening the situation.

Dak Drinh hydropower plant discharged up to 1,680 cubic meters of water a second on Wednesday and Nuoc Trong, the largest irrigation and hydroelectricity project in the central region, discharged 1,100 cubic meters.

Authorities hurriedly evacuated people living in low-lying areas and made emergency announcements about the water discharge via loudspeakers to warn local residents.

In Quang Nam Province, home to ancient town Hoi An, the water level in the Vu Gia River reached 9.41 meters by early morning Thursday, 0.41 meters above danger level 3, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, which warned rivers in the province would rise quickly in the next few hours.

Dak Mi 4 hydropower plant plans to discharge up to 11,400 cubic meters a second and the Vu Gia River is expected to rise to 11.2 meters, surpassing the historic flood level in 2009.

Nguyen Huu Vu, a local official, said authorities have evacuated over 4,000 families living along the river.

If the hydropower plant discharges over 5,000 cubic meters per second, 120,000 houses would be submerged under 0.5-1.5 meters of water, Vu said.

The National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said on Wednesday that Quang Nam could face severe flooding in the next one or two days.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung instructed provincial authorities to evacuate people from areas threatened by landslides and ensure the safety of reservoirs and hydropower plants.

The central region, including Quang Nam, was hit by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that caused at least 130 deaths.

Phnom Penh (AFP)

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to get them to safety from rising floodwater on Saturday in Cambodia's western province of Battambang.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces -- Pursat, Battambang and Pailin -- have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall ahead of the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

""A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,"" Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told AFP on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to worsen on Sunday.

In central Vietnam almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking north Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to sandbag and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

In Laos, rising floodwater has damaged villages and rice fields along the Xepon and Xebanghieng rivers in Savannakhet province with more rain on the way.

The probabilistic model will provide full national coverage and help re/insurers to assess their exposure to floods – a peril that affects 70% of the population in Vietnam.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue that simulates both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding.

It can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves and average annual losses at any level of aggregation.

Outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region.

“The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon,” Gallagher explained.

“These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flooded.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'model', 'reinsurance', 'population', 'flood', 'guy', 'help', 'launches', 'carpenter', 'vietnamthe', 'includes']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

When a northern cold spell entered the intertropical convergence zone over central Vietnam, it caused abnormally heavy rains and flooding in the region.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh got 400-500 mm, Quang Tri got 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue got 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City got 1,100 mm, Quang Nam got 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai got 600-800 mm.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

The entire central region suffered from severe flooding for days, more than 135,000 houses were submerged under 0.3-4 meters of water, and nearly 46,000 people had to be evacuated.

At least 36 people have died due to flooding and 12 are missing.

Nguyen Van Huong, head of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting’s Climate Forecast Office, said intertropical convergence zone stretches from the Bay of Bengal and across the center of Vietnam to the Philippines.

In these areas clouds and thunderstorms often develop, and when winds from the east meet them, there is an increase in moisture content, which means more thunderstorms, he said.

When the zone has favorable conditions such as the convergence of strong winds that moved over warm seawater, a tropical depression forms and then grows into a storm in the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea, he said.

Since October 6 two storms and a tropical depression have formed in this area.

On Sunday Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.

A day later Storm Nangka formed and hit the coast between the northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa Provinces on Wednesday.

""Storms and tropical depression already cause heavy rains. For instance, Storm Linfa caused rainfall of 500-700 mm,"" Huong said.

On Thursday morning another tropical depression formed over the sea and is heading straight for the central region also with a lot of moisture.

According to the center, more rains are expected in the region until Tuesday or later.

A cold spell coming down from the north and meeting winds from the east also caused heavy rains, Huong said.

The center said the root cause of all these phenomena was La Nina, which appeared in July and is expected to last until early next year. During this period, more storms would form over the East Sea and the rains would last longer than usual, it added.

Four to six more storms and tropical depressions are expected to brew this year with at least two making landfall over the central coast.

La Nina is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years as a result of variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It occurs as strong winds blow warm water on the ocean's surface from South America across the Pacific Ocean toward Indonesia.

The hospital is one of three biggest and most advanced general hospitals in Vietnam along with others in Hanoi and HCMC.

It said many of the patients came for treatment only after the disease had become serious, causing sepsis and multi-organ failure and threatening their life.

On November 14 a Quang Binh Province official died of the disease at the hospital.

Phan Thanh Mien, people’s committee chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trach District, had spent days in floodwaters in October managing relief efforts. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee, but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items in inundated areas.

The hospital had treated 83 people with the disease between 2014 and 2019 and 11 in the first nine months of this year.

It said the rise in the number of infections since early October is closely related to the floods that ravaged the central region throughout October and in November.

Various studies around the world have found that melioidosis occurs only in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, with outbreaks occurring after floods and typhoons.

In October central Vietnam was hit by floods thrice.

Melioidosis patients have symptoms like fever, pneumonia and abscesses in and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate is around 40 percent.

The disease was first diagnosed in Vietnam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country.

There are around 10,000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, around half of which prove fatal. There is no vaccine.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/17/muangapohue031602226049-160558-2074-9150-1605581241_1200x0.jpg,"['thienhue', 'infection', 'vietnam', 'patients', 'quang', 'province', 'outbreak', 'central', 'hospital', 'floods', 'cause', 'bacterial', 'floodwaters', 'thua', 'disease']", ,flood_and_drought

After devastating storms and floods, the airline worked to transport thousands of aid packages to help areas in central Vietnam.

Aid transportation

Vietnam Airlines flew over 24 tons of goods and more than 2,000 packages from organizations like the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee, the Red Cross, and individual donations, among others, to support operations in central Vietnam in cities like Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi.

This is just part of Vietnam Airlines’ aid operations. The airline is expecting to fly more than 100 tons of cargo to support relief operations.

Vietnam Airlines, along with its affiliates, is receiving and transporting goods to Central Vietnam free of charge.

For passengers, Vietnam Airlines is also giving people to Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi one extra free bag in addition to their class of service baggage allowance. This will allow passengers to also fly with additional relief items or essential items.

Vietnam Airlines is expecting to fly over 10,000 pieces of luggage free of charge. This will help those who are bringing relief items to the region.

Central Vietnam is facing awful flooding

Devastating floods, some of the most severe in decades, according to CNN, have claimed over 100 lives and led to immense destruction. Over 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and over 691,000 cattle and poultry have either been killed or swept away. Hundreds of thousands of meters of roadways have also been damaged.

In addition to the flooding, landslides have also caused deaths and damage. However, Vietnam, which is no stranger to rain and typhoons, became overwhelmed after facing a particularly fierce set of storms.

Relief agencies rely on airlines to help transport goods and people. Another set of storms is, including a tropical storm, made its way to Vietnam this last weekend as well.

For the flag carrier of Vietnam, it was now time to step up and fly relief. After facing some operational disruptions due to the storm, the carrier became one lifeline to bring much-needed supplies to the region.

Airlines and aid flights

Over the last few months, aid flights have become common when it came to transporting medical supplies. However, airlines are no strangers when it comes to running aid and relief flights.

Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines partnered to send 20,000 pounds of aid on a brand new Boeing 787. Emirates has flown tens of thousands of kilograms of aid to Lebanon since a blast rocked Beirut.

Flag carriers, in particular, tend to step up when the country needs airlines to fly in (or fly out) people and supplies. Vietnam Airlines has used aircraft, like the ATR 72, to fly in aid.

The European Union will provide €1.3 million ($1.52 million) for critical humanitarian assistance to families affected by severe flooding that wreaked havoc across central Vietnam.

The aid will focus on addressing the urgent needs of the most affected people in central Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces, European External Action Service said in a press release.

""This contribution underlines our solidarity with the people of Vietnam, many of whom have suffered the loss of homes, livelihoods and belongings in the wake of the devastating floods,"" said Olivier Brouant, who oversees the EU’s humanitarian response in the Mekong region.

The funding includes the distribution of hygiene kits and other essential relief items while ensuring access to drinking water, sanitation facilities and the promotion of good hygiene practices. Cash transfers will also be provided, allowing people to buy food or items of their choice.

Female-headed households and people with disabilities will be given priority for humanitarian assistance.

The central region was bombarded by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that resulted in at least 130 deaths.

The historic flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated and livestock killed, damage the government claimed to be ""the worst in the past five years.""

Some countries and international organizations recently pledged immediate humanitarian relief to help central Vietnam overcome the consequences of deadly floods.

Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

South Korea pledged relief worth $300,000 while the U.S. has promised $100,000.

With central Vietnam yet to recover from the historic flooding, Storm Molave, the ninth storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Provinces on Wednesday, triggering heavy rains and strong winds for the central region.

Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri.

At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnam’s Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.

A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.

They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.

For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.

At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday.

Saudel is the eighth storm in the East Sea this year, and follows Linfa and Nangka earlier this month.

Over 3,700 UNFPA Dignity Kits worth $180,000 would be provided to the elderly in central Vietnam following a series of storms and tropical depressions that hit the region last year.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) representative in Vietnam, handed over 3,704 kits containing essential items to Bui Quang Huy, standing secretary of the HCMC Communist Youth Union, to support the elderly in three central Vietnam provinces afflicted by floods last year: Ha Tinh, Quang Tri and Quang Ngai at a Wednesday ceremony.

Dignity Kits are a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, mitigate the risk of gender-based violence, and respond to and protect the dignity of women and girls adversely affected by a crisis. Kits meant for the elderly contain items like hand towels, sweaters, socks, wet tissues, toothbrushes, soap, underwear, blankets, flashlights and whistles.

The handover was made possible via financial contributions from U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), according to a UNFPA press release.

The elderly are among the most vulnerable when natural disasters strike, according to UNFPA. During floods and landslides in central Vietnam last year, health facilities were hard hit, causing routine public health programs to be disrupted, it added. The elderly are at risk since they do not always get the care they need, and their vulnerabilities can become a serious challenge to survival and wellbeing, it stated.

Last year, central Vietnam was struck by a series of storms and tropical depressions, triggering heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Over 200 people were killed and property losses amounted to around VND30 trillion ($1.3 trillion). Hundreds of thousands of homes were either destroyed or damaged, affecting the lives of at least 7.7 million residents.

The Vietnamese government has provided around VND770 billion to the region as emergency relief.

With Storm Molave set to make landfall in central Vietnam in the next few days, Vietnamese authorities are preparing to evacuate 1.2 million coast residents to safety.

At 1 p.m. Monday, the storm lay centered around 560 km east-northeast of Southwest Cay islet, with winds of 135 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

Over the next 24 hours, it will move west at 20-25 kph and gradually intensify. At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, it will be 280 km to the north of Southwest Cay with winds of up to 150 kph.

Mai Van Khiem, director of the national forecast center, said at a meeting Monday both the agency and its Japanese counterpart predict the rapidly moving storm would make landfall in central Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces.

The agencies forecast the storm would reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning, before making landfall in the coming hours.

On Wednesday morning, the storm's center would be around 200 km from the coast of Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh with a maximum wind speed of 135 kph, causing waves of up to 10 m.

Storm circulation combined with a cold spell would cause heavy rains on a large scale, and localities stretching over 1,000 km from Nghe An to Phu Yen will be battered by torrential downpours and strong winds from Tuesday until Thursday, with rainfall of between 200-400 mm.

Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh are told to brace for prolonged downpours until Saturday with total rainfall of up to 700 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Mountainous areas will be at high risk of landslides.

Mass evacuation

Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, said with Molave’s strength level, the committee is ready to evacuate over 1.2 million residents in seven central provinces Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

The region, home to popular ancient towns, beautiful beaches and world famous caves, has been bombarded by historic flooding and deadly landslides for the past three weeks, suffering damage government officials described as ""the worst in five years."" At least 130 people have been killed by floods and landslides between October 6 and 25.

Hoai urged provincial leaders to stay in contact with fishing boats, evacuate residents to safety, and make plans to limit storm damage.

There are still 65,000 fishing boats operating along the central coast, of which 45,000 have received official warnings.

""The storm is too strong,"" Hoai said, ordering localities to order boats to take shelter, ban residents from fishing activities, and close all public beaches by Tuesday night.

Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defense has called for the mobilization of more than 368,000 people - soldiers, members of the police force, and civilian volunteers, to assist residents in at-risk areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the meeting that localities must be on high alert and prepare their best flood prevention measures.

""If the storm comes as strong as forecast, damage from rains and floods will be extremely huge,"" Phuc said.

According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Storm Molave's strength is equivalent to Storm Damrey, which hit south central Vietnam in November 2017 and killed 106 people.

Hoang Tan Trong, watching over the family farm in Dong Hoi Town with his father and pregnant wife, witnessed floods tear through his home on the night of October 19. Dao, Trong’s wife, was sitting on their bed, suspended in the air thanks to four ropes connecting it to the roof. But with the walls damaged, the bed wobbled about two meters above ground, leaning to the side.

Seeing what happened, Trong's father, 64-year-old Hoang Tan Truong, immediately jumped into the water and tried securing the ropes, lest Dao fell into the water below.

""We can't just stay here and suffer like this. We need to find a safer house,"" Dao said. That night, Trong rented a motorboat and brought the whole family to the town center, about 2 km away.

Trong later returned to his old home to herd his 30 remaining chickens out of 200 into tree branches to avoid the flood. His three dogs were given to a relative the next day for safe keeping.

""This is the most severe flood since my birth,"" Trong, 44, remarked.

Since October 6, heavy rains have inundated the lowlands of Quang Binh. While not suffering fatal landslides like Thua Thien-Hue or Quang Tri provinces, Quang Binh has been the most severely flooded.

The October 19 flood managed to submerge thousands of houses, making even the most hardy residents shudder in fear.

From 1 a.m. on October 16 to 5 p.m. October 20, Quang Binh recorded rainfall of up to 1,380 mm in certain areas. The most heavily flooded was in Le Thuy District, with over 32,000 houses swamped. Throughout the entire province, around 105,000 homes have been similarly affected.

Tran Cong Thuat, chairman of Quang Binh, said: ""Floods this year have eclipsed the record peak in 1979 by up to 0.98 m."" The historic flood peak was recorded on Kien Giang River at 3.91 m. This year, however, the peak remained at 4.89 m for several consecutive days.

""The flood came at night so it was very powerful. The peak was too high, catching certain areas off guard,"" Thuat added. On the night of October 19 alone, thousands of people throughout Quang Binh have called out for help via their phones or social media.

""We still lack boats, but we are doing our best to help alleviate the suffering,"" he said.

Floods in Quang Binh this year not only set new records, but also receded very slowly. By the morning of October 21, traffic across the province remained crippled due to several flooded locations. Over the last fews days, people have confined themselves to their homes, with many of their pets, livestock and vegetables perishing in the water.

It would take a long time for Quang Binh to recover following this historic flood, according to Thuat. As Storm Saudel approaches Vietnamese shores, the province has prepared plans to support people with necessities and food for the coming days.

""During the first days when flood levels rose quickly, we were met with many challenges. But now that the water’s receding, we’ve been surveying heavily flooded and isolated houses so we could perform rescue operations and provide supplies more easily. We would not allow any family to be abandoned amid the flooding,"" said Thuat.

As of Thursday afternoon, at least 10 people have died in Quang Binh due to floods.

The field was the primary source of income to feed his family of three.

As he inspected the damage done by the prolonged flooding central Vietnam has had to suffer, he noted that some paddy sections had been swept away by floodwaters, while his tapioca field, cultivated over the past 10 months, was buried in rubble.

""We don’t know what to plant to make a living,"" said Rao, a 46-year-old resident of Huong Son Commune in Quang Tri’s Huong Hoa District. Two wet bags of grains they have are all that’s left for the next six months, he said, adding that on sunny days, he would put them out to dry.

The Huong Son Commune has over 192 ha of paddy fields, but around 90 ha were buried under rocks and wood rotting deposited by the floods, rendering them unusable and irrecoverable. Le Trong Tuong, chairman of the Huong Son People’s Committee, said residents were facing food shortages in the future for people.

In Quang Binh Province’s Bo Trach District, Le Xuan Uyen, 56, sees his field buried under mud and soil a meter deep, meaning he cannot plant new saplings for the winter-spring season without putting in significant time and efforts to clean the place up.

Worse still, the soil the fields are buried under has toxic properties that would kill paddy if they’re planted, he said. ""We are worried because we have missed the season for planting, and we don’t know what to plant anyway.""

The Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences said the top soil layer that covers several areas in Bo Trach District is actually heavy clay layers, which would make it difficult for cultivation if left as it is. Farmers should switch to different plants to adapt to the new layers, the academy has suggested.

Around 1,650 ha of fields in Quang Tri were inundated in the past month. Provincial authorities are now cooperating with the people to salvage the buried fields to prepare for the winter-spring planting season in just a month, said Ha Si Dong, deputy chairman of Quang Tri. But as the fields are large, ample time, it would take a lot of people and equipment to complete the job, he added.

Recovery efforts should be completed by mid-December so new saplings can be planted for the winter-spring season on time, Quang Tri authorities have said.

The chance of such events could increase five to 10 times by 2050, resulting in economic and infrastructural damage that could cost billions of dollars, according to a McKinsey report, dated April. The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.

Ho Chi Minh City, a historic flood area located some 1,000 miles south of the capital Hanoi, contributes about a quarter of the Vietnam’s gross domestic product. While the metropolis can cope with flood risks today that could hit 23% of its area, further urbanization is raising the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels. Those could cause about $8.4 billion of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact, McKinsey said.

The city still has time to adapt to avoid such risks by having better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas, McKinsey said. Investments and fund-raising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in four central provinces, according to the disaster management authority, while state media said hundreds of thousands more may have to flee.

“This is a very strong typhoon,” Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said, warning provinces in Vamco’s projected path to prepare for its impact.

‘No respite’

A series of storms have hit central Vietnam over the past six weeks, causing flooding and landslides that have killed at least 159 people, authorities said, while 70 others are missing.

The severe weather has also damaged or destroyed more than 400,000 homes, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Roads and bridges have been washed away, power supplies disrupted, and crucial food crops destroyed, leaving at least 150,000 people at immediate risk of food shortages, it added.

“There has been no respite for more than eight million people living in central Vietnam,” said Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, Vietnam Red Cross Society president.

“Each time they start rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, they are pummeled by yet another storm.”

Philippine coastguards conduct rescue operations after Typhoon Vamco resulted in severe flooding in the Cagayan Valley region [Reuters] Typhoon Vamco has already caused devastation in the Philippines.

Emergency response teams were dispatched to the northeast on Saturday where more than 340,000 people have been affected by severe flooding following Vamco, which killed at least 53 people across the country, disaster agencies said.

Twenty of the deaths were recorded in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya, which have become the focus of rescue efforts.

Hundreds of people were trapped on rooftops in the hardest-hit areas along the Cagayan river with rescuers unable to reach them because of strong currents, said the spokesman for the regional Office of Civil Defense.

Vast swaths of the region were underwater in what officials have described as the worst flooding in living memory. The release of water from the Magat dam has exacerbated the impact.","Sat, 14 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-14T085834Z_1080446966_RC2W2K9H4DAS_RTRMADP_3_ASIA-STORM-PHILIPPINES.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'red', 'flee', 'severe', 'provinces', 'nears', 'homes', 'typhoon', 'central', 'flooding', 'thousands', 'vamco', 'cagayan']", ,flood
74,74,FL-2018-000121-VNM,Vietnam suffers through a “new normal” of extreme weather events - WSWS,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/28/viet-o28.html,"Vietnam is being pummelled by ongoing tropical storms causing major flooding and landslides in its central regions. As of Monday morning, the death toll had reached 130 with 18 people missing, according to government figures. This was up from 119 fatalities on Saturday, with most occurring in the central provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam.

Close to a million people have been severely affected, with many in desperate need of shelter, food, clean drinking water and income support. According to the UN, as of last Thursday, at least 178,000 homes were currently under water.

Flood levels eclipsed the 1979 record by 0.98 metres, hovering at 4.89 metres for several consecutive days in the province of Quang Binh. The amount of rain that fell between October 6 and 13 was two to six times higher than normal in some regions.

Most of the hardest hit have been poor farmers. Agricultural damage has been extensive, with 1,500 hectares of rice fields and 7,800 hectares of other crops being either flooded or damaged. Close to a million head of cattle and poultry have also been killed or swept away.

The government has stated that the damage caused has been “the worst in five years”. Several highways and local roads are blocked with rocks the size of cars, hampering rescue efforts.

About a third of deaths have been of military personnel.

In one instance, a team of 21 rescuers, most of them military officers, was sent to verify reports of 17 workers buried by a landslide at the Rao Trang 3 hydroelectric plant deep in the jungle. The workers were reportedly asleep when they were buried on October 12.

The rescue team stopped at a ranger station for the night and were buried in a rocky landslide. Of the 13 deaths, 11 were from the military. Only four of the 17 workers at the dam have been recovered thus far and authorities have deployed more rescue forces to the scene.

Days later, a barracks in Quang Tri was consumed by a mudslide in the early hours of the morning, killing 20 military personnel, likely the largest number of military casualties suffered in a period of peace, according to officials.

Scientists believe flooding in central Vietnam is the result of a “new normal” of weather patterns driven by complex processes.

On an international scale, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDDR) reported recently a 75 percent increase in natural disasters in the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, there were 4,212 major natural disasters. Between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded costing 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy USD$2.97 trillion.

The increase is largely attributed to climate related events such as floods, droughts and storms.

Speaking at a virtual conference, UNDDR chief Mami Mizutori accused governments of abandoning effective measures to deal with climate change, “It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction,” he said, “despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.”

In the Asia Pacific, the cyclical la Nina phenomenon is intensifying storms in the region, and is expected to continue until early next year. Cambodia has reported 39 deaths from flooding, with hundreds of thousands affected and 46,216 people evacuated to safer ground.

Vietnam has been hit by three tropical storms and a depression in the month of October. Typhoon Mojave, at present travelling westwards over the Philippines, is also likely to impact in the weeks ahead. It is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds of 130 kilometres per hour. About 9,000 people in the Philippines have fled their homes.

Professor of human ecology at Rutgers University, Pamela McElwee, told the New York Times that the sheer volume of rainfall in Vietnam was, “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it shattered the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in its central regions by the end of the century.

She also stated that the construction of hydroelectric dams and poor mountain roads had weakened the soil. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go.”

Christopher Rassi, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross, warned of the economic fallout: “We are seeing a deadly double disaster unfold before our eyes as these floods compound the difficulties caused by COVID-19. These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.”

The Vietnamese economy relies heavily on its tourism industry which has been drastically cut back during the pandemic. Borders were virtually closed in late March. Apart from an outbreak in Da Nang Hospital in late July, total cases have been kept low and contained at under 1,500, with 40 deaths.

The Asian Development Bank assessed in September that Vietnam’s economy would grow at around 1.8 percent in 2020, its slowest rate in 35 years and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.

The Stalinist regime in Vietnam has ruthlessly pursued a policy of capitalist restoration for decades. According to its own estimates, economic inequality is worsening. Between 2014 and 2018 the GINI index of Vietnam, a standard measure of income inequality, was 0.4 [where 0 represents absolute equality and 1 absolute inequality]. The figure is regarded as a tipping point with higher numbers frequently associated with social unrest and political instability.

Out of fear of social unrest, the regime has sought to suppress criticism from workers and the peasantry. According to the UN, hundreds of people have been interrogated so far over COVID-19 related Facebook posts. In the lead up to the congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in January 2021, the government has begun a campaign of censoring dissident and left-wing publications.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wsws.org/asset/64544160-f1d1-4d85-aecd-24bd939be1eb?rendition=image1280,"['vietnam', 'normal', 'storms', 'quang', 'according', 'extreme', 'workers', 'central', 'events', 'military', 'million', 'rescue', 'suffers', 'weather']", ,flood
75,75,FL-2018-000121-VNM,Flood relief necessary but post-disaster reconstruction vital - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/perspectives/flood-relief-necessary-but-post-disaster-reconstruction-vital-4182755.html,"Nguyen Thi Vung had to keep an eye on her sow for five days straight during the flooding in Thua Thien-Hue Province and lost three kilograms consequently.

Phan Duong

She was worried the 80-kilogram beast might be swept away or escape.

The resident of a village in Quang Dien District explains: ""Pigs can be really destructive if they escape. I did not dare sleep at night.""

Central Vietnam has been hit hard by tropical storms, torrential downpours, floods, and landslides for three weeks now.

The woman, who is in her 50s, took the sow and its litter of four to her brother’s house since it is on higher ground than hers, and never left them alone for a moment.

With a stick in one hand, she made sure the sow behaved. But the animal was spooked and attacked her more than once. Vung has a wound on her right thigh from a bite.

But importantly she has been able to safeguard the family’s most valuable asset.

She had spent a year raising the pig and saw it give birth to four piglets. If she manages to keep all of them safe, and the animal continues to have more litters, she can solve the problem she has been facing: that of paying her daughter’s tuition.

Her daughter is a freshman at a college in Da Nang City, and Vung has to send her VND1.5 million ($65) every month for living expenses besides paying VND6 million a year tuition for the two-year course.

Since her daughter was in 10th grade Vung had been telling her, ""I think you should drop out of school and work; I am not able to afford your schooling.""

But the girl would plead: ""Please let me stay in school so that I can have a proper career in future and build us a better life.""

Vung relented.

Their family consists of just the two of them. Vung does the best she can, growing rice on a 750-square-meter farm and doing agricultural labor and menial jobs for others.

Every year in October she travels to the Central Highlands to harvest coffee and cassava for farmers there. But this year she has been stuck in floods described as the worst in decades.

Earlier this year, along with many other localities across Vietnam, Thua Thien-Hue was also hit by the African swine fever, an incurable and fatal disease in pigs.

Vung worked for other farmers, burying pigs killed by the disease.

""God blessed me and kept my sow healthy.""

Now she has once again kept the sow safe through the floods.

But she has not been able to save a small flock of chickens and a cassava crop that had almost been ready for harvest.

All hopes for the mother and daughter’s future now rest on that one sow.

When meeting us in the courtyard of a government office to receive a donation of essential items from readers of VnExpress through FPT’s Hope Foundation, Vung cannot hold back her tears, and tells us all about her pigs and chickens.

The floodwaters have now started receding in several parts of the central region, including her Quang Dien District, and people are trying to pick up the pieces again after two weeks of living with the floods.

Vung is still at her brother’s house with her pigs since it is still not safe to return home.

Her 20-year-old single-storied house has deteriorated and its walls are cracked, and now after the floods Vung is afraid they could collapse at any time.

""More storms are coming, so I’d better stay here.""

Storm Molave is expected to reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning.

In Phong Dien, another district in Thua Thien Hue, we met Le Thi Sinh, 51.

Three years ago her son passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children. Her daughter-in-law works elsewhere and sends home money for Sinh and her husband to raise the two kids, one of whom is learning to talk while the other is in kindergarten. Sinh’s husband has a number of health problems and so she is the family’s breadwinner.

No one had foreseen such severe flooding. Like many other locals, Sinh and her husband did not have enough time to prepare for the disaster.

When the waters came, they packed off the children, belongings and grain to the first floor. They hung their six piglets, each weighing around 15 kg, from the ceiling, but one was swept away and another was killed.

The floods also swept away their flock of 200 chickens and destroyed their cassava and sweet potato crops.

Her grandchildren cried and asked for their mother. Then they asked for their father after seeing a man next door casting a net to catch fish. There was nothing Sinh could do except shed tears of grief.

Sinh still has a litany of problems to worry about like a loan she took to buy supplements for the pigs and chickens and buying formula and other essential items for the children.

She hopes to get relief from the authorities and plant a new crops and resume her livestock and poultry farming.

In the district’s Phong Xuan Commune, locals grow trees and paddy. In May Storm Noul destroyed grown paperbark and acacia trees, and now the floods have destroyed all the young ones.

In Phong Hien Commune 2,000 families have been living in the floodwaters. They have lost 250 hectares (620 acres) of cassava, 27 hectares of glittering chive, 25 hectares of sugarcane, and 15 hectares of other crops.

""There is nothing left,"" Nguyen Si Hiep, chairman of the commune Fatherland Front Committee, said. The front, an overarching public organization, is tasked with ""promoting national solidarity and unity of mind in political and spiritual matters,"" and conducting many of the government's social programs, especially those to mitigate poverty.

Hiep said the commune administration is advising farmers to switch to short-term crops after the floods recede so that they could earn some income before the new year arrives.

There is way too much attention on flood relief though it is just one part of the big picture when a natural disaster strikes. Reconstructing the livelihoods and rebuilding the lives of millions of people in the central region is now a serious challenge in what has already been a disastrous year.

A World Bank report released last week estimated that 12 million people living in coastal provinces face the threat of severe flooding and over 35 percent of people live on eroding coastlines.

Each year an average of $852 million and 316,000 jobs in key economic sectors are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding.

In this context, I reviewed the concept of social capital. Economists treat social capital as an important resource of the nation. It is understood as the two-way and multidimensional cooperation between members of the society, the power of connection between people in a community, a country, and transactions based on mutual trust that bring mutual benefit.

The fact that Vietnamese everywhere are pitching in to provide succor to people in the central region these days is an expression of social capital in Vietnam.

The World Bank believes that social capital helps the community coordinate voluntarily and effectively because it is based on a common goal to help solve collective problems. The natural disasters in the central region are a collective problem. To address this problem, the government can collaborate with the community and make use of the social capital that has been on display in recent days.

Dealing with the aftermath of the floods gives the government an opportunity to tweak its policies. Authorities should make appropriate decisions to remove unnecessary barriers, paving the way for an increase in tolerance and trust, which would help heal the wounds caused by natural disasters.

A timely and substantial reconstruction plan for people like Vung and Sinh will help soothe the gaping economic wounds suffered by the central region, sustain growth and lead to a sustainable development vision for the country.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

VnExpress’s Hope Foundation is soliciting emergency support for people in central Vietnam, whose lives have been impacted by severe floods and landslides since earlier this month.

When the floodwaters rose on October 12 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Hoang Thi Phuong, a textile worker in Phong Dien District, went into labor.

Her husband tried to take her to hospital, but their motorbike could not cross a flooded section of National Highway 1A. In desperation, he asked a person with a boat to take his wife to the other side.

But the boat capsized just 20 meters from safety. Both Phuong and her unborn baby died.

""I killed you,"" her husband sobbed inconsolably, down on his knees in front of the raging floods that had snatched away his loved ones.

They are not the only victims of the tragedy that has befallen central Vietnam in the last two weeks. Dozens of others, including at least two hydropower plant workers and 13 members of a rescue team, lost their lives to landslides in Thua Thien-Hue.

In the last 10 days nonstop rain and floods have submerged entire regions under a sea of water and triggered massive landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of thousands of houses have been engulfed, and the death toll has been rising relentlessly.

Thousands of families face food and water shortages, and the floods do not seem likely to recede any time soon.

As fighters on the frontlines in a battle against nature, soldiers, doctors, rescuers, and thousands of others have had to take on the harsh and unrelenting elements.

What they need right now are boats, medicines, food, clothes, rescue equipment, and other supplies.

The Hope Foundation by VnExpress and FPT is calling for emergency support for millions of people in central Vietnam. We are soliciting help from every person and every section of the community, and trying to find the quickest way to help those in need right now.

Highlights

From October 6th, the Central region observed prolonged heavy rains that caused severe and widespread flooding and landslides. Water levels have risen rapidly flooding large areas in the provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh. Hieu river (Quang Tri) and Bo river (Hue) reached historical high flood levels.

In response, the Government of Viet Nam: i) Conducted daily meetings of the Central Steering Committee of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (CCNDPC); ii) Sent missions to the affected provinces to provide concrete guidance, support and coordination; iii) Released a call for emergency relief and support, sent to international organizations; iv) Is planning to hold a meeting convening the Disaster Risk Reduction Partnership, on Monday 19th to discuss and coordinate international support.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539933-Flash%20Update%20No.%201%20-%20Viet%20Nam%20Floods.png?itok=aGT5G35x,"['storms', 'update', 'nam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'quang', 'viet', 'coordinator', 'provinces', 'issued', 'office', 'floods', 'river', 'sent', 'resident', 'support', 'tri']", ,flood
79,79,FL-2018-000121-VNM,One million swamped by deadly floods as Viet Nam faces another major storm - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/one-million-swamped-deadly-floods-viet-nam-faces-another-major-storm,"Kuala Lumpur/Hanoi/Geneva, October 14, 2020 – Close to a million people have been severely affected by prolonged flooding in central Viet Nam as the country faces another major tropical storm and further dangerous floods.

Red Cross holds grave fears that deadly floods, which have submerged the country’s central provinces over recent days, will worsen as tropical storm Nangka makes landfall today, bringing destructive winds and dumping more rain on hard hit communities.

Since the floods began in early October, at least 28 people have been killed, more than 200,000 homes flooded and an estimated 84,000 hectares of crops damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people – many cut off by the floodwater – are now in desperate need of emergency relief.

As part of a coordinated relief effort, Viet Nam Red Cross staff and volunteers have been accessing isolated communities by boat to provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and other much needed supplies. More relief supplies are urgently being brought in from other parts of the country.

Mr Hoa Nguyen, Deputy Director of External Relations and Development, Viet Nam Red Cross, said: “Our volunteers and staff have been working in the affected areas since the floods began, providing relief supplies to thousands of people, but we need to reach many more as the rain continues and floods worsen. Every day we hear of more families who have lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods.”

Hung Ha Nguyen, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator said: “These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods.”

“Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities, especially on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need to help ensure families receive the relief they need in the coming days and weeks,” Mr Hung Ha said.

So far, at least 235 people have died or been listed missing after the floods and landslides triggered by storms and heavy rains in central Vietnam last month, the government informed the National Assembly Tuesday.

Among the casualties were 35 military officers and soldiers of two different military teams sent on search and rescue missions after landslides hit several districts in the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri.

The region suffered historic flooding, with the peak time falling between October 12 and 19. Floodwaters inundated the homes of 317,000 families with 1.2 million members from Nghe An to Quang Nam, with many areas being flooded for nearly two weeks.

Over 200,000 houses were seriously damaged. Many public construction projects also suffered heavy damage and roads were heavily eroded.

Of the total damage of VND17 trillion, VND10 trillion ($430.16 million) was caused by Molave, one of the most powerful storms to hit Vietnam, the government said.

The storm made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28, causing heavy rains and deadly landslides in the central region.

Earlier, the government granted over VND1 trillion, over 11,500 tons of rice and other essential items in relief support for the worst-hit central provinces.

Not over

The government said it would continue to mobilize all forces to search for the victims buried in several landslides and fishermen missing at sea. Among the missing are 12 hydropower plant workers in Thua Thien-Hue Province who were hit by a landslide on October 12, 19 residents in Quang Nam Province hit by two landslides as an impact of Storm Molave last week, and 23 fishermen from Binh Dinh Province whose boats sank in rough sea as the storm was near.

Priority in relief support will be given to those in worst-hit localities and isolated areas and to quickly repairing infrastructure and public construction works damaged by storms and floods, the parliament was told.

The government is also joining forces with local authorities to evacuate residents from high risk areas as storm Goni, the 10th storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, heads towards south-central Vietnam.

International forecasting agencies expect the storm to directly affect the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.

Natural disasters, predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

81,81,FL-2018-000121-VNM,Anguish as Mekong Delta’s annual floods continue to dry up - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/anguish-as-mekong-delta-s-annual-floods-continue-to-dry-up-4171382.html,"It is time for the annual floods in the Mekong Delta, but the flooding season these days is more a cherished memory than a practical phenomenon.

One day in mid-September Cao Van Bi, 50, was rowing a boat with his wife across a paddy field that had been partially flooded.

All over the field, in Phu Hoi, a rural commune in An Giang Province’s An Phu District, traps had been set up to catch fish.

That morning the catch was 2.5 kilograms of carp and five kilograms of other fish and shrimp.

In previous years, during the flooding season, Bi would have got dozens of kilograms worth of fish every day, but these days it never exceeds 10 kg.

Cao Van Bi and his wife collect the fish they catch in one morning in mid September, 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Nam.

The reason is that the annual flooding of Vietnam's Mekong Delta from the upstream Mekong before reaching the sea no longer occurs.

Not far away, in Vinh Hoi Dong Commune in An Phu, Phan Van Lang, 54, was standing in front of his house.

Since they live in an area hit by annual flooding, Lang and his neighbors have their houses built well above the ground. His house is nearly three meters in the air with a flight of the stairs leading up from the road. In 2000, for instance, the floodwater almost reached the house. But ever since the flooding levels have kept decreasing.

Pointing at the road in front of his house, he says the entire road would have been under one meter of water at this time of the year but this year, the water has not even reached the road.

Hung Dien Commune in Long An Province's Tan Hung District, 80 km (50 miles) away, has been witnessing the clearest change.

In the past its paddy fields would have waters reaching waist high and be filled with water lilies and boats would be the only means of getting around.

That scene now exists only in the memories of seniors.

Bay De, 53, who has been fishing for more than 30 years, recalls floods when catching up to 200 kg of various kinds of fish every day and earning a million dong ($40) was a ""piece of cake.""

For several weeks now he has not caught any fish. He spends almost every day drinking tea and chatting with neighbors in his thatched house.

Fifty kilometers away, Tran Van Thanh, 58, of Tan Lap Commune in Moc Hoa District is fixing traps for catching crabs.

He has been doing this for dozens of years, a job that has ensured a decent livelihood, but that has changed.

""I used to set up more than 600 traps during the flood season, but only a few tens of them these days because the flood waters are way too low and there are no crabs to catch.""

In the neighboring province of Dong Thap, Nguyen Van Phuong, 42, of Tan Thanh A Commune in Tan Hong District is watching the news on TV for possible information about the floods, something he has been looking forward to for several weeks now.

He has an eight-hectare rice field and has been waiting for the floods to come so that he could start sowing the winter-spring crop.

There was heavy rain a few weeks ago, and water had filled up canals and then reached the fields. Phuong, thinking the floods had finally arrived, hired people to till the soil.

But soon a scorching sun replaced the rains and water dropped, leaving the field dry and cracked once again.

He says: ""I had spent VND750,000 ($32.44) per hectare, but that has been a wasted effort. Now I have to wait for the floodwaters to come and do that all over again.""

In his neighborhood, farmers are now worried that if the floods do not come or are low, they would have to shell out money to pump water from canals into their fields.

Rice farmers in the delta have for generations depended on the floodwaters to come and inundate their fields before sow seeds directly.

The Plain of Reeds, a wetland straddling Long An and Dong Thap provinces, produces more than two million tons of rice a year.

The floods usually start coming in late July or early August and remain until November or even later to bless the region with extraordinary fertility as they typically deposit silt from upstream areas.

When they do not come or arrive late, cropping and fishing activities are disrupted.

For several years now they have been late or deficient, and experts have been blaming this on climate change and the construction of a series of dams in the upstream area.

According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, this year’s floodwater level in the delta will be only 55 percent of the long-term average, which translates into a shortfall of 130 billion cubic meters.

It will be 15 percent lower than last year’s level and the lowest in a decade, it has warned.

Late last year the highest water levels in the upstream areas of the delta were 1.12-2 meters lower than the long-term average and 1-1.65 meters lower than in the previous year.

The delta suffered the worst salinity levels and resultant freshwater shortage in 100 years but meteorologists warn things could get worse.

Tran Tan Tai, deputy head of the agriculture department of Long An’s Tan Hung District, says the water level in his hometown is currently 1.4 meters, or 80 centimeters lower than a year ago.

""If there are no floods, the fields will lack silt, and pathogens and wild grass seeds will not be washed away, and farmers will have to spend more on pesticide and fertilizers.""

Meteorologists expect the floods to come around the middle of this month, stay low and ebb away quickly.

Those were the days

Early one morning in late September, Muoi, 64, of Tan Lap rides a motorbike to a wet market two kilometers away from home. He returned after a while with a bag of barb.

""All my life I have seen fish all over the place every time it is the flooding season, but now I have to go buy them... Isn’t it weird?""

Not far from his home a neighbor had set up a lift net the previous night, but until around noon the next day, when Muoi returned from the market, it had only around two kilograms of fish.

Muoi can never forget what it was like one or two decades ago: Every year when the flood season arrived, water would be everywhere, covering the fields and even the streets. People would be rowing boats, picking water lilies and river hemp, both used to make specialty dishes of the region.

In the water, there would be so much fish that anyone could become a fisherman without having to learn any skills.

""Back then people did not weigh fish in kilograms but in a unit of around 20 kilograms. Normally, in one night a family could catch at least five to seven of that unit. Some would even feed the fish to their pigs.""

In years of heavy flooding fish moving down stream into the delta would breed along the way, and it would be extremely rare to see a field or waterway without fish in it.

Fishermen would enlarge the holes in their net to only catch adult fish, leaving the young ones untouched.

When the floods retreated, mud, algae and water lilies would be left in the paddy fields. The fields mud would be silt while the algae and flowers served as organic fertilizers, leaving the fields with all the nutrition they needed.

Besides, the floods would wash away the pathogens and wild grass seeds, and it was not common for farmers to use fertilizers or pesticides.

A kilometer away from Muoi’s place, Danh Van Minh, 62, asks his son to take him by motorbike to a house nearby. The house stands along a canal and in front is a concrete road around three meters wide.

""This used to be a small dirt road, and every year during this season it would be two or three meters under water,"" Minh says.

""The house used to be just a hut beside which I would anchor my boat after fishing.""

Minh’s life has been filled with tragedy. He lost his first wife and two of his children during two different flood seasons.

In the middle of the 1991 season his wife had twins, but both died at birth due to lack of medical care in that rural area.

Worse still the floods covered every inch of land that they could not find a place to bury the children. All he could do was put their bodies in a coffin, stick a bamboo pole in the water and hang the coffin up that.

Only a month after they passed away could he give them a proper burial.

Five years after they lost the twins, Minh’s wife suddenly fell sick and died. Once again he could not bury her immediately, and had to leave her body inside a coffin on the family boat and leave it anchored next to the hut.

In the past 20 years the delta has witnessed several floods that left a significant impact on its residents, especially in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2011.

The 2000 floods were the most severe in 70 years, with the water rising to 4.78 meters. They claimed 481 lives and caused losses of nearly VND4 trillion.

As told by Le Thanh Tam, party chief of Long An Province in 1999-2005, 20 years ago and further, the Plain of Reeds had heavy floods almost every year.

The region had not yet got an embankment system, and every time it flooded there was no way to tell where the road was and where the canal was. The only way people could move around was by boat.

""Back then we always had fish, shrimps and crabs in abundance, but we would lose lives every year, and of children in most cases.

""When the floods retreated, we had to expend a lot of effort to rebuild houses and roads.""

But a 2017 study by the Mekong River Commission estimated that the flooding provides $8-10 billion in annual economic benefits while causing losses of just $60-70 million.

The Mekong River flows through six countries, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before reaching the sea.

Many parts of the Mekong Delta were formed by sedimentation over eons.

When the Vietnamese expanded their nation to the south, they began to conquer the delta in the 18th century. For generations, no other place in the nation could compare with it as a agriculture and aquaculture hub.

In his book ‘Last days of the Mighty Mekong’ published in February last year, Brian Eyler, director of the Asia Program at U.S. think tank Stimson Center, writes: ""For the past 3,000 years, the Mekong carried about 150 million tons of sediment in its system to the delta each year.""

Without the sedimentation, the delta’s land would fall apart under natural conditions, which are worsened by intense groundwater extraction and sea level rise, he says.

He strongly condemns China’s dam building in the upstream areas of the Mekong for holding back floodwaters and, along with them, sediments.

Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent researcher into the ecology of the Mekong Delta, says the main cause of the low floods this year is the El Nino phenomenon that lasted from the year’s beginning to the end of August, resulting in scanty rain fall in the region.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the rainy season arrived late last year and was shorter than usual, with the result that rainfall was 8 percent below normal at 1,240 mm.

Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of Can Tho University’s Research Institute of Climate Change, says the calamity faced by the delta cannot be blamed just on nature or Chinese dams.

""Sea levels rise and the Earth gets warmer. Yes. But that happens just a little each year and it needs a long period for dramatic changes. It is humans who have accelerated that process.""

He cites one example of human action that changed the delta’s hydrological profile. Ever since the delta was formed, it has had several low-lying areas like the Long Xuyen quadrilateral in Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and Can Tho City and the Plain of Reeds that worked as natural reservoirs to store the seasonal floodwaters, he explains.

For generations farmers did not use them for cultivation, but due to the wars, the nation had to consider food security, and built embankments to keep the seasonal floodwaters from flowing into them and directed the water toward the sea, he says.

""Now in peace time, we still have the mindset of growing as much rice as we can, and many have treated the seasonal floods as a disaster for their paddy fields while in fact it is a blessing.

""With that thinking, many have continued to keep out the floods, going against nature, thus intensifying the lack of water once it took hold in the region.""

Minh, who has been a poor farmer his entire life and is haunted by a tragic past related to the floods, does not care much for the explanations experts like Tuan have to offer.

After his wife’s death, he took his son to another village, remarried and built a new life.

He now owns a 6,000 sq.m rice field and both his home and field are surrounded by embankments, allowing him and others in his neighborhood to go against nature and cultivate three instead of just two rice crops as in the past.

The field does not have any time to recover, and instead of getting floodwaters that wash it clean and deposit sediments, it has to do with plant protection chemicals instead.

With this method of growing rice, farmers remain mired in poverty since they have to spend money on fertilizers and pesticides for every crop and also lose out on an abundant source of fish, shrimp and crab and the plants that always grow in the flood season.

""My children and grandchildren have all taken turns to leave,"" Minh says, reflecting the trend of delta dwellers abandoning their hometown for Ho Chi Minh City and other industrial areas, where they work in factories or the service sector.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/05/lu-dong-thap-muoi-2300-1601345-2309-7479-1601885014_1200x0.jpg,"['continue', 'annual', 'field', 'water', 'dry', 'flooding', 'floods', 'delta', 'anguish', 'mekong', 'fields', 'season', 'away', 'fish', 'deltas']", ,flood

Highways in the provinces have also been severely damaged, with the total cost of repairs estimated at around VND 355 billion, state media said, citing figures provided by the Directorate of Roads of Vietnam on Oct. 21.

Also on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung and deputies of Vietnam’s National Assembly welcomed efforts by Vietnamese pop star Thuy Tien to collect more than VND 100 billion (U.S. $15,316,811) for relief work in flood-hit Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue.

Large-scale fundraising is normally restricted by law to state organizations or social associations to reduce the risk of personal gain, with penalties prescribed for violations. But National Assembly deputy Le Thanh Vanh voiced confidence in the work of Thuy Tien and her staff.

“They are ready to take responsibility before the sponsors who donated the funds,” Vanh said, quoted on Oct. 21 in state media reports. “I am sure they will be completely transparent,” he said.

Relief teams have poured for the last few days into central regions hit by floods and landslides that have destroyed roads and buried workers at a hydropower plant and soldiers at a military barracks, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told state media on Wednesday.

Many areas have already received help, while others remain cut off because of damaged roads, Dung said, calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to send more teams to reach remote areas and give further support to those already helped.

34 now killed in Cambodia

Relief work meanwhile continues in Cambodia, where 34 people have now been killed by floods to date, with Prime Minister Hun Sen urging local authorities to guard damaged homes to prevent looting and calling on banks and other lending institutions to delay or reduce payments owed to them by villagers impoverished by the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 has hit us hard for the last 10 months, and now we are facing floods that are destroying us,” Hun Sen said.

“We have not concluded our damage assessments yet. For now, we are just working to rescue people and take them to safer areas,” he said.

Around 10,000 families have already been safely evacuated from flood-hit areas, Cambodian media sources say.

Speaking to RFA, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha said that flood waters are now receding in several provinces, including Oddor Meanchey, Pursat, Takeo, Pailin, Kampong Speu, Stung Treng, and the two hardest-hit provinces of Banteay Meahchey and Battambang.

The 34 flood deaths reported so far reflect the inability of central government and local authorities to deal effectively with the disaster, said Kean Ponlok, secretary general of the Cambodia Intellectual Students Alliance.

“The authorities must look into the causes of these deaths and hold themselves responsible,” he said, adding that because of corruption in Cambodia, he is not convinced that all donations handed over to the government will be spent on victims of the floods.

Banteay Meanchey villager Nay Thoeun said she has now lost her home and job because of the floods and is debt after borrowing money from a bank to buy medicine to treat the tuberculosis to which she was exposed in her family.

“I am very worried. I’m living now under a shelter on a hill, but the water is still rising here, and I’m afraid of [venomous insects].”

“I’m urgently calling for aid to be delivered to this hill. There are many poor families here,” she said.

Flood begins to recede in Laos

In Laos, flood waters have begun to recede from eight districts in Savannakhet province, where 125 villages containing 5,134 families, or nearly 30,000 people, have been affected, Lao media sources say.

In the province’s Sepon district alone, 40 villages containing nearly a thousand households have been flooded, with many houses completely destroyed, sources said.

Sepon’s La Or and Vang Khot villages were hardest hit, with 44 houses swept away, and another 90 dwellings hit by fast-running floods and partly damaged, a district official said on Oct. 21.

“The district is still asking for help, but we will set up temporary refuges in the villages for people to live in,” the official said, adding that funds are being sought for building materials such as roofs and nails for the construction of temporary shelters.

Fast-rising water hit one village on Oct. 18 and swept away 28 or 29 houses, leaving nothing to come back to when villagers returned two days later, one villager said. “Now we have no place to stay in but the schools, and no one has any clothing. We are waiting to see how the authorities plan to handle this.”

“We are all in a very poor condition. We have no rice to eat, and all our rice fields are flooded. We will have to buy all the rice that we eat next year,” he said.

“The water is receding now, but the villagers’ houses are damaged beyond repair, and nothing can be restored. There is no thought of fixing them now,” a rescue team member said, adding that many residents of Sepon and other districts are still cut off because of damage to the roads.

Though Lao authorities had moved quickly to help victims of the floods, more help is needed, an NGO official said, asking that neither he nor his organization be named. “For a start, we urgently need dry food and drinking water, clothes, rice, and many other things, as so many houses have been swept away.”

“The authorities did go down to do everything they could, but there are just too many villagers to help,” he said.

Many residents in areas of Sepon and Phin districts are still out of reach, a Sepon district official said. “We are still unable to get to almost half of the areas affected by the floods because the roads have been cut off by landslides,” he said.

Losses in Savannakhet including houses damaged, livestock drowned, and paddy fields destroyed are still being calculated, the official Vientiane Times said on Oct. 21.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguy?n Thái H?p celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vu?t Lu C?ng Ð?ng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p, the bishop of Hà Tinh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghia, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Ngu?n N?y River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tinh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghia, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Ð?n.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",,[], ,flood

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan donated US$400,000 on Friday (Oct. 23) to Vietnam in aid after the country suffered the severest floods and landslides in decades.

Richard Shih (???), Taiwan’s representative in Vietnam, said the Taiwanese business community in Vietnam, as well as non-governmental organizations from Taiwan, have mobilized themselves to send relief to the stricken areas in the country's central region. He said he hoped the victims will be able to reconstruct their homes and return to a normal life as soon as possible.

As of Friday, the series of floods and landslides have killed at least 114 people, and 20 people remain missing. Among those who lost their lives are dozens of military personnel who were deployed to search for those who had gone missing in previous disasters.

The Vietnamese military said it has suffered the most serious casualties in peacetime. In addition to the loss of lives, hundreds and thousands of houses were wiped out in central Vietnam, including Quang Tri and Thua Thien Huei provinces, and schools and other facilities have been forced to close.

Tran Quang Hoai, an official responsible for coordinating Vietnam’s rescue missions, accepted Taiwan's donation on behalf of the Vietnamese government at a ceremony on Friday. He remarked that the government is grateful for the generosity of the Taiwanese authorities and people, and that it will make the most appropriate arrangement for the donation so that relief and aid can be distributed to those in need soon, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

MOFA said via a statement that more than 320,000 Vietnamese migrant workers and new immigrants are living in Taiwan, and that the people of the two countries have been more than good partners.

86,86,FL-2018-000121-VNM,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hardest', 'flooded', 'water', 'change', 'infrastructure', 'flood', 'flooding', 'region', 'floods', 'global', 'risk', 'river', 'hits', 'asia', 'climate']", ,flood

The bodies of two people were recovered on Saturday evening, while one remains missing.

The Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Van Ban District reported that the sudden floods affected 25 households, with furniture, motorbikes and construction materials damaged.

Two houses were swept away and dozens of others were damaged.

Prime Minister Ph?m Minh Chính issued a dispatch asking localities to focus resources on dealing with the consequences of floods and heavy rain in the northern mountainous region since Friday.

In the dispatch to the people’s committees of the six northern mountainous provinces of Lai Chau, Yen Bai, Son La, Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang, the Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control, National Committee for Disaster Response and Search and Rescue, and relevant ministries and agencies, the PM extended his condolences to families of the victims, and asked the local authorities to help locals fix houses and clean the environment, and provide them with food and essential goods.

He also asked the localities to keep a close watch on developments of flooding and rain, and to review and assess the safety of homes, especially in areas at high risk of flash floods and landslides, while preparing forces, vehicles, and equipment to deal with any circumstances.

The media will continue to provide information on developments of the natural disaster, damage, and response efforts, according to the dispatch.

The recent, devastating floods highlight the fragility of the country's natural environment. Deforestation, expanded farming, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric dams are the main culprits. In four years, 7,300 hectares of forest have been lost. So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built with another 450 on their way.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) – Recent floods in Vietnam caused by typhoons and tropical storms have had a devastating impact in terms of lost human lives, environmental damage, and economic dislocations, highlighting the fragility of the Asian country's environment.

Frequent and violent weather events worry both environmentalists and the affected communities more and more.

According to Vietnam’s Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, the main factor is deforestation and the conversion of entire forests to farmland, timber harvesting, and the large dam and hydroelectric plant construction.

Among the most affected areas are the central coastal region and the central Highlands, scene of the recent devastations.

The General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control estimates that some 7,300 hectares of forest land were lost between 2016 and 2019, with an annual average of 1,800.

At the current rate of deforestation, if nothing is done to slow this down, the risk of floods and landslides will increase considerably, along with periods of drought and loss of mangroves.

Environmentalists and experts note that the life and survival of Highland communities are closely linked to local forests.

From the central part of the country to the Mekong River Delta in the south, forests play a leading role in regulating local ecosystems, biodiversity, water resources, and the climate of much of the country.

For Prof Nguy?n Ng?c Lung, forests are key to blocking winds, limiting soil erosion and containing the devastating force of storms. In addition, tree roots absorb excess water.

Deforestation contributes to climate change, global warming, drought, rising water levels, pollution, and famine.

In view of the situation, the General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, noting that the country has recently had to face between 10 and 15 floods.

The blame goes to extensive “legal and illegal” deforestation to expand farmland, harvest timber or build crucial hydro-electric plants to meet the country’s energy needs.

So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built and another 450 are in the planning phase with further devastating impact on the environment.

Some see these plants as ""water bombs"" ready to strike at the population. Their effects are visible in many parts of the country, including Da Lat, a city that is located about 1,500 metres above sea level and a major tourist destination, with its almost year-round cool and temperate climate.

Since 2012, the city has been hit by flooding with increasing frequency, to the extent that today, when rain is intense, many parts of the city and Lam Dong province ""end up submerged by water"".

Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc Thanh.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Vietnam has given $540,000 in immediate support to women and girls in six central provinces affected by flooding.

UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of hygiene items and maternal health equipment. It is also supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services.

The central region has suffered unprecedented flooding from prolonged downpours and successive typhoons since October 6, resulting in at least 230 people dead or missing. Storm Molave hit the region on October 28, reportedly one of the strongest in 20 years.

At least 5.5 million people in the region have been affected, including more than 1.3 million women of reproductive age, over 92,000 of them pregnant mothers, who need uninterrupted services for pregnancy and menstruation, UNFPA said.

According to joint rapid assessment led by UNFPA last week, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programs such as antenatal, delivery, post-natal care and family planning services have been disrupted.

As a result, local women are unable to manage their hygiene properly and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear needed to manage menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and places to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged, the organization explained.

On October 12, a 35-year-old pregnant mother living in Phong Dien District of Thua Thien-Hue Province died on her way to give birth.

She entered labor in the morning, with her husband hiring a boat to take her to a local medical center for delivery. However, the boat was upturned and she was swept away by floodwater.

Her husband and local residents tried to look for her, but failed because of the fast-flowing current. Her body was found in the afternoon.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA representative in Vietnam, said: ""When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousands of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable. Women do not need to die giving birth, and this must hold true even in emergencies.

The National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on Monday afternoon that the low pressure out in the north of the South China Sea (known in Vietnam as the East Sea) had strengthened into a typhoon internationally known as Nangka.

Nangka is forecast to make landfall in the north-central part of Vietnam on Wednesday, while the accompanying rains could cover the central region already battered by torrential downpours over the last few days.

The centre forecast that central provinces would face heavy rains ranging from 150 to 300mm on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control issued an urgent letter on Monday asking the bureau to closely supervise the development of the low pressure system and issue warnings to localities and ships.

Authorities also instructed boats and ships to find safe habour and to take measures to ensure the safety of local people and tourists on islands and in coastal areas.

The Foreign Ministry was also asked to contact countries and territories to ask for shelter for Vietnamese fishermen.

The ongoing downpour, exacerbated by Typhoon Linfa which hit the central region on Sunday morning before weakening to a low pressure area, destroyed a total of 382 houses and flooded 109,034 others, and damaged 108 sections of national highways and 8.6km of provincial highways.

The disaster caused big losses to agricultural production by destroying 584ha of rice, 3,879ha of vegetable, 2,141ha of aquaculture, whilst killing about 150,700 cattle and poultry.

In Danang, many communes were submerged by rising floods worsened by water discharged from hydropower reservoirs.

As of 7am on Monday morning, the communes of Hòa Phong, Hòa Nhon, Hòa Liên, Hòa Khuong, Hòa Châu and Hòa Ti?n were badly submerged, affecting the lives of 3,000 local households in 38 hamlets.

In the mountainous districts of Hoà Vang, Liên Chi?u and C?m L?, there was high risk of flash floods and landslides.

At present, 882 households in typhoon-affected areas have been moved to safer areas.

Meanwhile, people in the central province of Th?a Thiên-Hu? are entering their fifth day of flooding and heavy rain.

Rainfall of over 1,000mm flooded areas near the B? River, badly affecting to districts of Phong Ði?n and Qu?ng Ði?n, as well as Huong Trà Township.

Local people have been suffering from food shortages due to disrupted transport.

Hoàng Sinh, a resident of Phong Hi?n Commune, told Vietnam News Agency that his family’s food reserves were running due to the prolonged rain and flooding, and they were down to a few packs of instant noodles and rice.

Tr?n Ð?c Thi?n, chairman of Phong Hi?n Commune, said the local government was trying to reach local households to supply food, drink and medicine.

“The floods surged rapidly and people in low-lying areas could not keep up. Water spilled into their houses submerging them up to one metre,” said Tr?n Van Hoàn from Huong Trà Township.

“The whole family had to move to a neighbour's house. For several days, we only had instant noodles to survive,” said Hoàn.

“This is the worst flood since 2006. It has badly affected 70 per cent of local people,” said Ph?m Công Phu?c, vice chairman of Qu?ng Thái Commune.

The provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Rescue reported that as of 6pm on Sunday, three people had died, while seven were injured and another was missing.

Nineteen houses had, and 53,385 houses and 360ha of crops had been flooded.

More than 100km of coastline from Huong River across Huong Th? Commune and Huong Trà Township was severely damaged by erosion. About 300m of the dyke in Qu?ng Phú Commune, Qu?ng Ði?n District was also hit.

In Hu?, more than 50 per cent of roads in 27 wards and 2,560 houses were flooded as of Monday morning.

In Qu?ng Tr? Province, the flooding dramatically increased on Monday morning.

The downpour made the water in the Th?ch Hãn and Ô Lâu rivers reach alert levels.

The river water levels were forecast to continue rising today and next days.

To cope with the situation, Qu?ng Tr? authorities have asked the central Government to supply materials and rescue equipment, including two amphibious vehicles, 27 boats, rescue equipment and chemicals for disinfection.

The week-long rain killed six and injured two in the province, with a further six reported missing in the province.

Hue, Vietnam — Every day for the last four months, Duong Thi Mong has carried food, pots, dishes and other utensils on her shoulders to walk nearly 5 kilometers daily from her house to a nearby village, where she serves com hen (rice mixed with mussel, a popular traditional dish) to local people on streets of Thua Thien Hue province. Mong, a Buddhist from Hue's Vi Da ward in central Vietnam, which is famous for its mussels, said she usually takes her boat to carry food over the Huong River then walks only 600 meters to her destination. However, her boat was wiped out in severe flooding after six tropical storms hit the central provinces in October and November. The 56-year-old mother of two said she earns 80,000 to 100,000 dong ($3.50 to $4.30) per day to support her family, not enough money to buy a new boat. She said she had to work harder and sell food at night to get money to prepare food for the celebration of Tet, or Lunar New Year. Local markets closed for the weeklong traditional festival Feb. 10 ahead of the New Year, which starts Feb. 12. Thankfully, sisters across Vietnam have stepped in to help Mong and others like her.

""I am excited for the nuns who offered me 10 million dong [$435] on Jan. 28. I will use the money to buy a new boat for my work soon,"" Mong said cheerfully, adding that the boat is really a lifeboat that will help save her energy so she can work longer and earn more money to put food on the table. Sr. Maria Truong Thi Minh Yen of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate said her community provided boats for 12 people who lost their boats during the severe floods that left many people nothing in their wake. Yen, who serves Tan Thuy Parish, said she called on benefactors for donations. ""We do want to provide local flood victims with longer-term help so that they can stand on their own feet and return to normal life soon,"" she said. Many victims do not have enough money to be able to purchase basic means of doing their jobs. The 69-year-old nun said her convent gives clothes, blankets, rice and medicine to more than 100 street people, migrants, boat people and slum dwellers on a regular basis. Many live in makeshift shelters while others stay in low-rent, stuffy lodgings as their properties were washed away by flooding. ""They have suffered much from the last natural disasters and the chilly weather this year,"" Yen said. The temperature fell to 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January in the tropical area.

Yen, member of the Hue Archdiocese's committee representing local women religious orders, said some local congregations have built and repaired 40 victims' homes at a total cost of 1 billion dong ($43,000). Luong The Thien from Phu Hiep ward said he built a new house in January after he received 65 million dong from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. His old 40-square-meter house was damaged in the floods. Thien, a 54-year-old Buddhist, said he could not afford to rebuild his house as he works as a motorbike taxi driver to support his wife, who has lung cancer, and three children. ""We are happy to celebrate the Tet festival in the dream house. We are extremely grateful for the nuns' generous help that benefits our life long-term,"" he said, adding that according to tradition, people cannot be well-established in their careers until they have stable homes.

Thien said he has had a good relationship with the nuns since he took a nun from a local hospital to her convent in 2008. The nuns regularly visit his family, and his children receive a monthly scholarship from them. Nguyen The Thieu, a Buddhist from Cau Nhi village, said he is among seven local families who received money to repair their storm-damaged houses. His Catholic son-in-law introduced him to the nuns.

At least 334 houses in the localities were damaged. Over 550 ha of rice and other crops were inundated while landslides blocked many roads leading to northern mountainous provinces like Lai Chau and Lao Cai, home to popular Sa Pa Town.

Weather forecasters warned northern provinces should expect heavy downpours with rainfall of between 100 and 250 mm from Thursday to Saturday due to the impacts of Higos.

Tran Quang Hoai, vice head of the committee, asked northern authorities to deploy rescue teams and evacuate residents in flood-prone areas.

Higos is the fourth storm formed in the East Sea this year.

The waters, known internationally as the South China Sea, could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, half of them directly affecting the country, meteorologists said.

Natural disasters, including drought, floods and landslides, killed 133 Vietnamese last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In the first half of this year, natural disasters killed 47 people and caused economic damages of VND3.3 trillion, according to official data.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/08/19/a9f5d4e442a7abf9f2b6-159782323-4253-6860-1597823279_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'flood', 'provinces', 'tropical', 'hit', 'heavy', 'rainfall', 'mm', 'committee', 'cai', 'killed', 'northern', 'ha']", ,flood

The United Nations Population Fund in Vietnam will provide an additional $800,000 to support women and girls affected by flooding in eight central provinces and cities.

It brings the UNFPA's total support to $1.34 million. In October it had given $540,000.

The support includes setting up mobile and outreach health care clinics and the distribution of dignity kits with essential hygiene items and vital maternal health equipment and supplies.

Between early October and mid-November the central region and parts of the Central Highlands were hit by a succession of storms that brought torrential rains, resulting in severe flooding and landslides.

At least 192 people were killed and 57 others are still listed missing, and losses amounted to VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), the government said.

Around 5.5 million people have been affected, including over 1.3 million women of reproductive age and more than 92,000 pregnant women, the UNFPA said.

The disaster forced women and girls into shelters without having the time to pack essential supplies, and many lack basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear that are needed to manage their menstrual periods, it said, adding that access to water and places to wash, dry reusable pads and clothes and dispose of used materials are lacking.

Routine public health programs such as antenatal, child birth, post-natal care, and family planning services have been disrupted.

The government provided VND770 billion for emergency relief.

Many international organizations and countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Australia also provided aid.","Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/08/huukhoaduadeolethuy51603180554-1148-5001-1607411128_1200x0.jpg,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'rains', 'health', 'girls', 'flooding', 'central', 'agency', '800000', 'women', 'pregnant', 'million', 'support', 'provided']", ,flood_and_drought

On the night of October 11, Le Trung Lam, a resident of the central town, braved the floods to go and pick up some migrant students who had been marooned in their inundated home for days. He took them to his company on Ngu Binh Street, An Tay Ward, where 30 people were already sheltering.

They cook in the kitchen and eat three meals a day, and also have blankets, mattresses and electricity.

Three days earlier, many students from other places now studying in Hue, had no idea where to shelter as the floodwaters rose relentlessly and inundated their homes. Then Lam's message arrived out of the blue.

He said: ""The company's headquarters, a five-floor building, is situated on Ngu Binh Mountain, and so the water has not reached it yet. Its two top floors have 10 rooms each that can accommodate 20-30 people.""

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential downpours in central Vietnam for a week now have killed 29 as of Tuesday morning. Among the deaths, six are from Thua Thien-Hue Province, home to Hue.

Lam, 33, decided to turn his company into a shelter on October 8 as the waters reached some major roads and were expected to rise further. Driving around the town to check on the flood situation and how people were coping, he passed by the studio apartment where he himself had lived 15 years ago as a migrant student from central Nghe An Province. He too had suffered during flooding.

Fearing for students who were possibly cut off, he posted an announcement that he was willing to shelter people.

In the last few days he has received hundreds of calls from people seeking help. Since the neighborhood still has access to electricity and the market remains open, Lam's employees have been able to buy food and cook meals.

Lam said he would take care of the students until the floods receded.

If the water level keeps rising, he plans to also use the main hall which can hold 500 people.

Le Thi Anh Ngoc, 19, from the central Quang Binh Province, said she walked on flooded streets for more than an hour to reach Lam's place on the morning of October 11.

""I arrived in Hue four days ago. I did not know who would help us before I learned about Lam.""

Six kilometers away from the company, on Tung Thien Vuong Street, Ngo Thi Kim Loan is busy making 500 banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich, with the help of a few others to send to people stranded on Hen Dune and Han Mac Tu Street.

Loan, who regularly does charity, always has instant noodles at home. Three days ago, seeing the rising water levels, she gave away 100 boxes of them to households in her neighborhood facing difficulties.

On October 12 she cooked 40 kilograms of rice for people living in areas where power has been turned off due to the floods.

The owner of a noodles restaurant also posted on her Facebook page that families with children or old people could command shelter at her home.

In the evening, when Loan sent 300 banh mi to households on Hen, Le Quoc Phong, Loan's neighbor, 40, was eating dinner under an oil lamp. The island in the middle of the Huong River was cut off by the rising waters.

Phong volunteered to help distribute food to those in need. Finishing his meal, he quickly got on a boat to take the banh mi to people before dinner time was over.

Distributing food and offering accommodation are Hue people’s way of supporting people affected by the floods.

Dozens of families living in higher places said they are ready to take in people whose houses are flooded and provide instant noodles to those who need them.

Free food distribution centers have been set up in downtown areas in the last few days, but are accessible only to people living nearby because of the situation.

People are also helping their fellows facing a threat of losing their livelihoods.

Over several days, strong winds and torrential rains caused huge damage, submerging homes, wiping out farmland, killing and sweeping away cattle. The Diocese of Hà Tinh, along with Caritas and the Catholic Business Association brought donations.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) - Strong winds and torrential rain over several days have caused flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 37 so far. Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên Hu? and Qu?ng Nam are the most affected provinces.

Heavy rains from 10 to 13 October inundated residential areas, farmland and roads, causing huge damages to people and property.

The General Department of Disaster Prevention reported that, in addition to the 37 deaths, at least 50,000 houses were flooded or wrecked whilst 250 hectares of rice fields and 2,500 hectares planted with vegetables were wiped out. Some 900 hectares dedicated to aquaculture were also damaged; at least 60,000 animals, mainly cows and poultry, were killed or swept away by the raging waters.

Bishop Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p of Hà Tinh (about 340 km south of the capital, near the coast), decided to visit the flooded areas to bring some help. On Saturday, he led a delegation from his diocese to Trung Quán parish.

The prelate tried to visit every family, one by one, to encourage them and leave them with some small gifts. For those who met him, “He is a true pastor. He did not just give us some gifts; he brought us God.”

Trung Quán parish, one of the hardest hit, saw homes submerged and streets turned into rivers.

Thanks Caritas and the Hà Tinh Catholic Business Association, the bishop was able to leave a package containing instant noodles, a bottle of oil and two packs of condiments for each family he visited.

He also brought more than 200 million dong (about US$ 8,600). The diocese donated 100 million; Caritas 50 million and the Catholic Business Association, another 50 million. Although not huge, the money will help with the emergency.

Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p encouraged the faithful to recite the rosary and pray for all the people living in the flooded area.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VN-_Evacuation.jpg,"['tinh', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'business', 'bishop', 'diocese', 'hà', 'left', 'hectares', 'catholic', 'caritas', 'central', 'floods', '37', 'huge', 'million', 'visits', 'dead']", ,flood

While foreign investors pulled about US$842mil (RM3.46bil) from the country’s shares so far this year, the tide could be turning.

Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR Global. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has raised more than US$350mil.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that – like in many others around the world – has attracted retail punters in droves.

Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

The benchmark index now includes 11 stocks exceeding $5 billion in market value, up from just two in 2015.

The stock exchange’s other heavy hitters include a smattering of state-backed behemoths -- Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, PetroVietnam Gas JSC -- as well as steelmaker Hoa Phat Group JSC and Vietnam Dairy Products JSC.

Vietnam’s stocks have been climbing amid optimism its export-oriented economy can maintain momentum after being one of the few in Asia to expand last year. Manufacturing activity jumped in April to the strongest since November 2018, according to a PMI report Tuesday. Equities retreated today, sending the VN Index down 1.1% as of 9:38 a.m. local time, after Vietnam’s capital city instructed school pupils to stay home in order to help contain an increase in local Covid-19 cases.

The country is well positioned as the U.S. and Chinese economies lead a global rebound from the pandemic. That’s because Vietnam benefited when U.S.-China trade tensions spurred companies to diversify supply chains out of its larger Asian neighbor.

“We’ve been positive on Vietnam for a number of years. They are a clear beneficiary of China-U.S. trade tensions and their handling of the pandemic has been among the best examples globally,” said Jeff Gill, who helped manage about $10.9 billion of assets at City of London Investment Management as of Dec. 31.

Waiting Room

Part of the problem may be that international investors overstretched when they splurged. Foreigners sold a net $876 million of Vietnamese stocks last year, similar to what’s been already sold so far this year. That’s in line with a wave of selling across Asian emerging markets. Those moves look to have simply swelled foreigners’ cash positions inside Vietnam, which are already substantially higher now than they were at the end of 2020, according to Vu Bang, former chairman of the State Securities Commission.

Vietnam’s stocks also faced a setback in March when FTSE Russell decided to maintain the country as a frontier market, instead of upgrading it to a secondary emerging market, citing settlement methodology issues. The State Securities Commission expects to resolve the issue later this year. Investors have also cited foreign ownership limits as a concern that could hamstring the market’s capacity to grow further.

Money managers from Sempione Sim SpA, to Asia Frontier Capital and City of London Investment Management Co. say they are busy looking for entry points. They cite solid economic prospects, relatively attractive valuations, rising foreign-direct investment flows and healthy earnings growth as reasons to be optimistic, while also showing faith in the government’s ability to contain the pandemic.

“I see Vietnam as a very nice compelling growth and stable story for the short, mid and long term,” said Federico Parenti, a fund manager at Sempione Sim in Milan.

Since the beginning of October, central Vietnam has been pounded by consecutive tropical storms and typhoons, which have brought widespread flooding and landslides to the region.

At least 1.5 million people have been affected by flooding and 235 people have died or are missing, according to the Vietnamese government.

On October 15, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink declared a national disaster for the Central Vietnam region as a result of the widespread devastation caused by flooding and landslides. This flooding has disrupted electricity and telecommunication networks, as well as destroying infrastructure, houses, livestock, and crops.

On October 28, Typhoon Molave made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Vietnam. It was the worst typhoon to hit the country in the last two decades.

Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are the two of the five central provinces that have been hardest hit by the recent flooding and landslides. The other three provinces that have been severely affected are Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, and Hue.

To make matters worse, the monsoon season is still ongoing and another powerful storm, Typhoon Vamco, made landfall last Sunday morning in central Vietnam, causing even greater damage. This is the third storm system to pummel Vietnam in November and the 13th to hit the country this year. The economic damage is now estimated to be close to $1 billion, according to the Vietnamese government.

International donations are starting to come in from various countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Japan. To date, the U.S. has donated $2.1 million toward the humanitarian relief effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Vietnam Red Cross Society to assist during the ongoing recovery period.

The financial backing also focuses on USAID’s longstanding investments in Vietnam to help minimize loss and destruction caused by natural disasters. Although the Vietnamese government has been quick to allocate disaster relief funds, its efforts and capacities have been strained also by the coronavirus pandemic. Donations from the outside world will be certainly needed and appreciated.

Local NGOs have been working tirelessly alongside the government to deliver aid to those who have been most affected by the catastrophic storms and their results. Pacific Links Foundation is an NGO that currently supports disadvantaged families in central Vietnam and it has been vigorously fundraising to support families in flood-affected Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Hue provinces.

“Our volunteers on the ground have delivered emergency packages, which included rice, food, life jackets, and flashlights, to students and their families,” said Hong Nguyen, the deputy director for SEEDS, a Pacific Links Foundation scholarship program which currently supports over 2,500 students.

SEEDS and the Pacific Links Foundation are now working on another round of support that will focus specifically on long-term recovery, allowing school children in all eight central Provinces to return to school and provide support for the families that suffered the most during the recent typhoons and floods.

“We will provide packages which will include books and school supplies, as well as computer tablets for students to continue learning through our online learning platform, especially when schooling is being disrupted,” said Nguyen.

Another non-profit charitable organization focused on philanthropic activities to benefit Vietnamese people in need throughout the Central Vietnam region is Da Nang Go. The organization uses fundraising events and direct donations to address the specific needs of Vietnamese people affected by natural disasters, poverty, and hunger.

Presently, the group consists of about 20 local and international volunteers who have been doing regular relief trips to some of the harder hit flood and landslide zones across the region. The NGO recently took a convoy of trucks and cars to Tay Giang district in Quang Nam province to provide much-needed supplies.

Tay Giang experienced heavy flooding and deadly landslides in October and November and is generally considered to be one of the more economically disadvantaged areas of Central Vietnam. The majority of the people who live there are from the Co Tu ethnic minority, a patriarchal rural society whose men raise livestock and whose women are well known for making high-quality traditional handicrafts.

The Co Tu live in small stilt huts which can be easily damaged by storms and landslides. At least 30 families had previously been evacuated from one village in Tay Giang due to the recent landslides.

“Before the last storm came, the government wanted to move them to a safer place but the problem is they don’t want to move anywhere because they are scared and if they die then they want to die in their hometown. They are used to yearly storms but they didn’t know this year’s storms would be so bad,” said Hannah Bui, one of the main directors of Da Nang Go and owner of Hannah’s Restaurant in Da Nang.

“I wish I had more money so I could do more to help these people,” she said.

Recently, the Da Nang Go team assembled 250 aid packages for children and 750 for adults in Tay Giang, as well as presenting some cash donations in envelopes at Hannah’s Restaurant.

The aid packages consisted of water, milk, noodles, dry food, oil, fish sauce, salt, blankets, and notebooks. The money was raised through a recent fundraising event and from various donations by local and expat members of the Da Nang community.

The aid was greeted with smiles by the local villagers and government officials. The team also delivered supplies to two elementary schools and to adults in the neediest villages of Tay Giang. In one of the poorest schools, students are so impoverished that they can’t afford basic school uniforms and some students walk up to four kilometers per day to attend classes.

“When I do charity and I do small things like give candy to poor kids they are happy and smile, and when I give old people clothes and they say ‘thank you,’ it warms my heart and makes me feel good knowing I’ve brightened their day,” said Bui.

Da Nang Go will continue its ongoing fundraising and aid missions to help people around central Vietnam affected by these historically devastating storms and typhoons. Both Pacific Links Foundation and Da Nang Go are continuing to deliver aid packages and funds in the aftermath of Typhoon Vamco.

As much as these local charities and NGOs have brought much-needed relief for affected communities, in terms of food, clothing, school supplies, and direct funding, what is really needed now in terms of the recovery effort is the rebuilding of infrastructure, houses, and technological networks, and a re-supply of livestock to get things back to normal.

Floodwaters that had killed scores across Vietnam were rising ominously around their village. At a washed-out railway overpass, he hired a man to ferry them in a small boat. But strong winds carried away some of the baby clothes the couple had packed, and Mr. Minh waded into the water to retrieve them.

Suddenly, the boat capsized in the fast-moving current. His wife, Hoang Thi Phuong, a 35-year-old cancer survivor, was just out of reach, and she was swept away by water turned brown by loosened sediment.

6,6,FL-2019-000092-VNM,We must not repeat the Vietnam refugee tragedy in Afghanistan - Military Times,https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2021/05/18/we-must-not-repeat-the-vietnam-refugee-tragedy-in-afghanistan/,"The parallel between the Vietnam War and Afghan War is troubling. In both cases, the U.S. became involved in a foreign war without having a clear picture of what our ultimate objective was. We largely took over the direction of each war from a corrupt host government. Many citizens of our host country placed reliance on the U.S. to provide for their safety, come what may. The war became unwinnable because of a series of unfortunate decisions. Losing interest in the endeavor, we shaped settlement terms the host government was required to accept, intimating we would be there to help if worse came to worst. Here, the similarity ends, for now.

In the case of Vietnam, even though we knew weeks beforehand that the fall of South Vietnam was imminent, we made no concerted effort to extract the Vietnamese who had steadfastly supported the U.S. When their government fell, many thousands who had helped, trusted and relied upon us were murdered or incarcerated to the great dishonor of our nation. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the south and, although we gave many of them sanctuary, our help was slow in coming. The final chapter in Afghanistan has yet to be written, but it must not end up with a betrayal of our friends.

During the long and tortured course of America’s war in Afghanistan, many Afghans stepped forward at their great peril to serve and help protect our military personnel. As we withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban have stepped up their violent attacks and the danger to our friends has dramatically increased. We are morally obligated to provide them sanctuary within our borders.

There are two special immigrant visa (SIV) programs in place to bring our Afghan friends to the U.S., but they are mired in red tape — it takes up to three years to process an application. There is a backlog of nearly 19,000 SIV applicants, with about 50,000 family members. They are waiting in line, living in fear of death. There are not enough slots to take care of the backlog. The vetting process is understaffed, underfunded and overly burdensome.

In this crisis situation, there are two feasible alternatives — either review existing documentation in the files and grant visas to those who U.S. personnel have credibly vouched for in the files, or extract the SIVs and families from Afghanistan and complete any necessary vetting in a safe location. We processed South Vietnamese refugees at U.S. military bases in the late 1980s.

We need, also, to consider the plight of Afghans who don’t qualify for SIV status. A Taliban take-over, which appears increasingly likely, will create a flood of refugees, fleeing for their very lives. Being partially responsible for their plight, we are honor bound to provide sanctuary for many of them, just as we eventually did for those fleeing Vietnam. We should plan to evacuate Afghans who will be targets of Taliban reprisal — uncorrupted government and military officials, women’s rights advocates, educators, democracy advocates and the like.

Like many troops who served in America’s wars, this issue is very personal for me. I lived and worked with South Vietnamese soldiers in 1968-1969. I trusted them with my life, while they relied on the U.S. government as a friend and ally. Most of my Vietnamese friends were Catholics who moved from North Vietnam to Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam in 1954 to escape persecution. They were fiercely anti-communist and pro-American. It broke my heart when the communists took over in April 1975, knowing that my friends would be killed or imprisoned, as were many thousands of their countrymen. We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate. We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us.

7,7,FL-2019-000092-VNM,United States announces additional humanitarian assistance in response to flooding in Vietnam - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-assistance-response-flooding-vietnam,"Friday, October 30, 2020

Today, while in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced the United States is providing an additional $2 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to Typhoon Molave and the ongoing severe flooding that has affected Central Vietnam since early October. This amount brings the total humanitarian assistance from the U.S. Government for people touched by the floods to $2.1 million.

With this new funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is ramping up efforts to meet emergency needs in communities affected by Vietnam’s historic typhoon season. Typhoon Molave, which made landfall in Central Vietnam on October 28, 2020, is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. Typhoon Molave follows weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1.5 million people and killed more than 130.

In response, USAID’s partners, including the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC), are addressing the immediate needs of the affected families for food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Because the floods have washed away livestock, farms, and infrastructure, USAID’s partners also will provide assistance to these families as they begin to restore their livelihoods.

This assistance builds on USAID’s long-term investments in Vietnam to reduce the risk and impact of disasters. With funding from USAID, for example, the VNRC has been on the front lines in responding to the impact of severe weather throughout this typhoon season.

The United States stands with the people of Vietnam during this difficult time.

8,8,FL-2019-000092-VNM,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

Vietnam’s flood death toll rose to at least 23 and authorities said the incoming storm Nangka would dump more heavy rain on the country in the coming days.

The floods also left at least 14 people missing in Vietnam’s central provinces, the government said in a statement on Monday.

Most of the victims were washed away by floodwaters, the national disaster management authority said, adding local authorities evacuated nearly 46,000 people from affected areas.

The floods have inundated more than 109,000 homes and 1,443 acres (584 hectares) of crops and damaged roads and bridges, the agency added.

According to weather forecasters, water levels will keep rising, swelling rivers and submerging more communities in the region, the state-owned Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.

The situation worsened over the weekend when Tropical Storm Linfa, which weakened to a depression when it hit the country, brought more rain to the region.

Torrential rains have flooded central Vietnam and killed dozens since last week [Ho Cau/Reuters] “We received a report saying that between 10 and 13 workers have been buried in a landslide and we don’t know if they are still alive,” a disaster management official in Thua Thien Hue province told Reuters news agency by telephone.

Soldiers were deployed to the area to rescue the workers, said the official, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

“We are concerned that the incoming storm will worsen the flood situation,” the official said.

Storm Nangka, which is forecast to make landfall in northern Vietnam on Wednesday, will trigger heavy rain of up to 400 millimetres (16 inches) in parts of northern and central Vietnam from Wednesday through Friday, the national weather agency said.

Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding because of its long coastline.

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Vietnam and local people’s generosity. Luu Thi Phuong , 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.“Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children,” she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.“I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDP’s 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.“Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam,” she said.“However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.”Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last year’s floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.”Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.“It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life,” he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: “I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).“In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households,” said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing.

11,11,FL-2019-000092-VNM,How flood protection can paradoxically put people at risk - Horizon,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/how-flood-protection-can-paradoxically-put-people-risk.html,"Professor Jeroen Aerts, a hydrologist at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in The Netherlands, says that when a city builds a defensive wall or dyke, it can make its citizens feel so secure that they actually flock to live or to develop businesses in the protected area. What’s more, they don’t bother to install their own flood protection.

This means that when rare – but inevitable – extreme flooding occurs the damage can be colossal.

It is just one way in which flood protection modellers may be underestimating – and sometimes overestimating – the true consequences of sea level rise, says Prof. Aerts. And it is happening because physical scientists are failing to integrate human behaviour into their models.

Prof. Aerts leads a team that is trying to change this using the technique of agent-based modelling which attempts to reproduce complex phenomena like human behaviour. They use software that creates autonomous decision-making entities called agents, each of which assesses its situation and makes a decision based on a set of rules that have been drawn from survey data and decision theory.

Last year, they published a paper that underlined the problem of the safe development paradox. By modelling what is known about how humans behave when governments install flood protection where they live and work, the team demonstrated that ‘the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas.’

But the study went on to show that governments could ‘largely counteract’ this effect if they simultaneously promoted policies that encourage people to flood-proof their buildings.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’ Prof. Jeroen Aerts, Vrije University, The Netherlands

Migration

Prof. Aerts believes that the failure of physical scientists to take human behaviour into account may also have led them to misjudge the degree to which flooding will drive migration. What’s more, it means they are not identifying precisely where it would be best to target help, because the models don’t distinguish adequately between those who will manage to look after themselves and those who won’t.

Sea level rise will, it is commonly predicted, displace 187 million people by 2100. But the figure, which comes from a 2011 study, is controversial.

‘Most modelling studies that deal with flooding risk or sea level rise use a top-down approach,’ said Prof. Aerts. ‘You have long-term scenarios – like how many centimetres is sea level going to rise, and what will the exposed population be … and you try to estimate the impact.’ Then, he said, the models are rerun to include the effects of various adaptation measures, such as dykes or managed retreat, after which researchers do a cost-benefit analysis.

But, Prof. Aerts said, ‘they forget about (asking) what is the probability that this dyke will be built? Or what is the probability that people will retreat? So they do not take into account the human behavioural factor which determines whether or not this measure will be implemented.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’

Factors that get ignored include evidence that people’s decisions to migrate, or to stay and defend their land, vary with their wealth, age, risk perception, trust of government and attitudes to individual freedom.

Social scientists

Prof. Aerts says that his team is now turning the models on their head, in a new project known as COASTMOVE. They are integrating a global coastal flood risk model with an agent-based model to simulate how governments, private sector actors such as insurance companies, and individuals act and influence each other.

Another difference is that social scientists are feeding data into the project.

‘They provide me with the information about under what conditions are people going to implement a certain measure, from the individual level to the higher aggregate government level,’ said Prof. Aerts.

Some of this information is from pre-existing surveys on what drives people to migrate or otherwise respond to floods. The rest will be gathered from new surveys in six coastal areas in France, Ghana, the Marshall Islands, the United States, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Other, less traditional sources of information will come from data already collected via mobile phones, Twitter posts and even tax returns.

They will use data from Bangladesh, for example, where other researchers have been able to discover, from anonymised mobile phone data, how many people have fled from floods, where they travelled, and how soon they returned. They will also use data that Prof. Aerts has gathered over the last six years using algorithms to monitor tweets that mention the word ‘flood’, in 20 different languages. This provides daily flood maps that give ‘a pretty good idea of where we can expect most of the problems’, he said.

More data is coming from the United States where it has been possible to draw conclusions about migration after flooding from the location from which people have filed their annual tax returns.

Vulnerabilities

By simulating adaptive behaviour, the team hopes to provide more refined predictions about the degree to which sea level rise will cause migration – in the form of 1x1km2 global migration maps.

Dr Bina Desai, head of policy and research at the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, says that sea level rise will bring a variety of direct and indirect impacts, which will affect people differently depending on factors such as inequality and poverty, that are not adequately reflected in models.

‘What’s needed, if we think about risk of migration and displacement, is modelling with a less strong focus on the hazard and a stronger focus on underlying vulnerabilities and what exacerbates them,’ she said.

‘In principle, it’s the only way to do it,’ Dr Desai said of COASTMOVE’s approach. Even as a conceptual model, she adds, it will help to work out how the many factors interrelate.

‘The downside is to move beyond the conceptual model,’ she added. ‘If you want to translate that into numbers then (when we have tried it) we found we failed because all the inputs could not be populated with data.

‘But if they can find a way of doing it by (collecting enough data), using proxies and making assumptions and somehow modelling it out then I think that’s great.’

Just how are our seas changing and rising with climate change and the melting of Earth’s ice caps? This is the final story in a three-part series looking at the past, present and future of extreme sea level rise. In part one, we looked at what the last interglacial can tell us about extreme sea level rise and in part two we looked at rise of atmospheric ‘meteotsunamis’.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

i. Deliver immediate, life-saving assistance to those in the most urgent need, in support of the Government response and in line with Government requests for assistance.

ii. Ensure the most vulnerable people, including women and children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and LGBTIQ persons, are protected against violence and have equal access to humanitarian assistance and services without discrimination.

iii. Prevent the outbreak of communicable diseases and effectively monitor risks to the health of the affected population, including the nutrition status of vulnerable people such as pregnant and lactating women and children under five years of age. Deliver assistance in a manner that minimises the risk of COVID-19 for disaster-affected people.

iv. Ensure access to multi sectoral assistance and re-establish critical services. Promote the repair of key public service infrastructure in affected provinces, ensure food security, by restoring lost food stock, livestock and livelihoods, ensure access to sustainable drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene supplies, housing, replacement of productive assets and household items, and access to basic medical, social and public services to support the affected population transition to recovery and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

On 13 October, the Government of Viet Nam released a call for emergency relief and support following four tropical cyclones and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which combined have caused severe and widespread flooding, landslides, storm surge and strong winds since 6 October. As of 28 October, 214 people have reportedly been killed or are missing, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). An estimated 7.7 million people live in areas affected by flooding caused by the multiple storms, with some 1.5 million people in nine provinces directly affected and approximately 380,000 houses flooded, damaged or destroyed. Of those people directly affected by the current disaster, some 753,000 are women and girls, 134,000 are children under five, and 143,000 are over 65 years old.

On the morning of 11 October, Tropical Storm Linfa (Storm No. 6) made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Viet Nam, resulting in 150 to 300 mm of rain. This was followed on 14 October by Tropical Storm Nangka (Storm No. 7) which made landfall in northern Viet Nam, but also brought a further 150 mm of rain to the still flooded provinces of central Viet Nam. On 16 October, tropical depression INVEST 94W in the East Sea weakened into a low-pressure area and made landfall in the central provinces, and was subsequently followed by Tropical Storm Saudel (Storm No. 8) which made landfall in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces on 25 October. On 28 October, Tropical Cyclone Molave (Storm No. 9) made landfall in approximately the same area as Tropical Storm Linfa, with up to 700 mm of rain reported in Nghe An and Ha Thinh provinces and up to 400 mm of rain in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces.

In Quang Ngai province, some 17,000 people were evacuated because of the strong winds and rain. Between 5 and 20 October, VNDMA reported that many areas in central Viet Nam recorded a total rainfall of more than 2,400 mm, and in some locations, flood waters exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1979 and 1999.

As of 29 October, nine provinces have been affected by the cumulative impacts of the multiple storms including Tropical Cyclone Molave. These are, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Nghe An, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum provinces, with Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces most severely affected.

Following Tropical Cyclone Molave, more than 88,000 houses and 50 schools had their roofs blown off, the majority in Quang Ngai province, and some 375,000 people were evacuated to evacuation centres. Those in the evacuation centres are amongst the most vulnerable having had their houses damaged or destroyed and having lost key household items in the floods. Many of the evacuation centres are overcrowded, do not have access to sufficient basic facilities such as water and sanitation, and health care, and lack appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children.

As well as damage to houses, some 30,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged (including rice, other crops, and aquatic products) and more than 2 million cattle and poultry have been killed. This is likely to have severe impacts on food security and livelihoods, especially for those people who were already experiencing adverse economic impacts due to COVID19. Further, more than 360 schools have been flooded and damaged, with detrimental impacts on children’s ability to continue accessing education. In addition, more than 78 health centres and hospitals have also been damaged or flooded.

To date, the delivery of assistance has been hampered by extensive damage to public transportation infrastructure. VNDMA reports that more than 165 km of national highway, 140 km of local roads and three bridges have been heavily damaged. Rescue teams are accessing affected areas by boat to deliver relief items and to evacuate vulnerable people, prioritizing children, people with disabilities and elderly people. Communication has also been hampered by the loss of electricity in many affected areas.

The areas most severely affected by flooding are also those same provinces which experienced a second wave of COVID19 cases in July and August. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, a further thirty days of lockdown measures were implemented from 28 July to 5 September, with adverse socio-economic impacts for the region which already records higher than national average multidimensional poverty rates. As a consequence of COVID-19 related measures, the most vulnerable people had already had their coping capacities eroded prior to this current disaster and are thus in more acute need of immediate assistance to help them manage the current, compound crisis.

From 20 and 23 October, joint GovernmentUN-NGO assessments were undertaken in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai provinces. Key findings from the assessments include the need for emergency food assistance for 177,000 of the most vulnerable people, restoration of agricultural land, safe access to clean water and sanitation facilities including in health centres and schools, the provision of dignity kits for women and girls, provision of education supplies and alternative learning solutions to ensure continuity of learning, support for those people evacuated from their homes, repairs for damaged houses, replacement of basic household items, health support especially maternal and child health, risk communication activities, provision of micro nutrients and continuation of nutrition activities to prevent an increase in rates of malnutrition.

Protection has been identified as a key need in this response, including the immediate need to ensure protection and safeguards for women and children currently living in evacuation centres. Partners involved in the development of this plan have also highlighted the need to provide assistance in a gender-responsive manner that addresses the specific needs of women and girls. The Government has requested that all relief activities target the most vulnerable people, including poor, near poor, people living with disabilities, children, femaleheaded households and elderly people, which are the target populations for this response plan.","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/VNM-ResponsePlan-201031-051%20%281%29.jpg?itok=QHnLLURt,"['plan', 'response', 'nam', 'quang', 'provinces', '2020', 'viet', 'tropical', 'floods', 'affected', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'assistance', 'storm', 'including']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The lower Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam) experienced prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020 until early December 2020. This was due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka as well as tropical depression INVEST 94W. The three wind systems made landfall in Vietnam but brought along heavy rain to the rest of the lower Mekong region. Tropical storm Linfa made landfall on 11 October 2020, tropical storm Nangka made landfall on 14 October 2020 whilst tropical depression INVEST 94W made landfall on 16 October 2020.

The rainfall brought by the wind systems resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in southern Lao PDR. As of 20 October 2020, nine districts in three provinces of Salawan, Savannaket and Sekong were affected by the floods. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Based on an initial assessment on 20 October 2020, conducted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) with participation of Lao Red Cross, it was highlighted that 163 villages in the three provinces, with an estimated 15,305 households (97,514 people) were affected. Savannaket was the worst affected province with more than 10,000 households from 137 villages were reportedly affected in the province and two people had lost their lives. In Sekong province, around 3,000 people were affected, and two people had lost their lives. Salawan province reported more than 600 people affected with five deaths.

Cyclone Molave – the fourth tropical cyclone to threaten Vietnam this month – is barrelling towards the country’s central coast, worsening severe floods and landslides that have inundated parts of the region for weeks.

Vietnamese authorities are rushing to evacuate half a million people before Molave makes a projected 28 October landfall, packing wind speeds topping 110 kilometres per hour. The country is already struggling with intense floods and landslides that have killed at least 130 people and damaged a quarter of a million homes.

The Vietnamese Red Cross has already warned that 160,000 people may need food aid over the next six months, but that figure could rise after Molave makes landfall and its impact becomes more clear.

Aid groups say parts of Vietnam are seeing their worst floods and landslides in two decades. Disasters are common during Asia’s various monsoon seasons, but this month’s flurry of storms has aggravated conditions, with weeks of extended heavy rainfall.

Parts of Laos and Cambodia are also submerged. And Thailand is projecting that Molave's rains will hit the country’s north and northeast.

Before threatening Southeast Asia’s Mekong region, Cyclone Molave uprooted some 25,000 people in the Philippines earlier this week.

Hue, Vietnam – Before floodwater inundated half their living room one night during the storm season this year, the Trans put their most valuable possessions – their TV and refrigerator – in the attic and told their two daughters to take refuge there.

Tran Nhu Hong, 23, and her 18-year-old sister, who do not know how to swim, survived the storms – the worst her generation had ever experienced and the worst her parents had seen in decades.

A neighbour was not so fortunate. The 19-year-old student was swept away in the floods after the vehicle she was travelling in was tipped over by the force of the water – on the same route the two young women usually take.

“Shortly after the water retreated, I went on that route and the vehicle was still there and had not yet been pulled out (of the mud),” Hong said. “I don’t dare to go on that route late at night any more.”

Across central Vietnam, cascading floods from October onward inundated the living and the dead, as record rainfall submerged towns and cemeteries. Authorities said earlier this month that the typhoons, which they referred to as “abnormal”, cost the Southeast Asian country 30 trillion dong ($1.3bn) in damage and killed at least 192 people – a death toll more than five times higher than the 35 COVID-19 deaths Vietnam recorded this year.

A woman drives along a flooded road beside submerged rice fields [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “In general, it is well-established that rainfall from typhoons is increasing due to climate change, both from observations and from models,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead climate scientist at the Red Cross Climate Center and World Weather Attribution, whose team is conducting a study on the role of climate change in the recent floods and typhoons in central Vietnam.

Crops destroyed

With 70 percent of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas, Vietnam is highly exposed to riverine and coastal flooding and is also one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.

“There is even more damage after the floods,” Hong said, driving by rice fields made inlets because of the storms and floods in her hometown in Thua Thien Hue Province.

When the water retreated, it took crops with it, leaving behind scarred earth. Many farming families in central Vietnam count on rice, various other crops and cattle for income, especially as the Lunar New Year celebration, known as Tet, nears.

Tet is usually when Vietnamese shop for new clothes, gifts and appliances to welcome a new, fulfilling beginning; but with their homes and means of living ravaged by violent storms, severe floods and devastating landslides, Tet, which will take place in February, is likely to be tinged with sadness.

Hong’s parents are still recovering from the wounds and infections they got from wading through hip-high flood water for extended periods, and have yet to find jobs as construction workers due to the double burden of COVID-19 and the recent natural disasters.

Ichiro Sato, senior associate with the Climate Program and Sustainable Finance Center at US-based think tank World Resources Institute, says central Vietnam was battling extreme weather events long before climate change started to take effect.

“If governments have not been well-prepared even for the conventional risk of weather-related disasters that existed before climate change – and I am afraid that is the case for Central Vietnam – then there are so many things they have to work on before worrying about the additional risk of climate change,” Sato said, adding that unregulated urbanisation and economic growth may increase vulnerability to weather-related disasters in places like Vietnam.

The country typically endures between five and six storms and about three tropical depressions a year, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, but in 2020 a total of at least 14 ravaged the country. Seven consecutive tropical storms and cyclones hit the central region between October and mid-November.

Children at risk

According to the UN, an estimated 7.7 million people in nine provinces, including 2.5 million children, were affected – with hundreds of thousands of houses flooded, damaged or destroyed.

“There is no doubt that children are those most affected by natural disasters,” Rana Flowers, UNICEF representative in Vietnam, told Al Jazeera, adding that families’ ability to secure nutritious food for their children had already suffered as a result of the pandemic.

An estimated 375,000 people were sent to evacuation centres during the storms and floods, including about 90,000 children, according to Flowers.

“Many of the evacuation sites were overcrowded, did not have access to sufficient water and sanitation and healthcare, and lacked appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children,’’ Flowers said, adding that the situation severely affected the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children.

A study brief published in August by the US-based Society for Research in Child Development showed that children may suffer longer-term physical and psychological deficits than adults, including difficulty sleeping or concentrating and losing interest in their usual activities – chronic mental health symptoms have been observed among children as long as four years after a disaster.

A woman carries food through the submerged streets of Hue in central Vietnam [File: Manan Vatsyana/AFP] “In the long run, to be sustainable, the Vietnamese government should invest more to strengthen mental health services for children and their families, looking at the nationwide system and also building the workforce,’’ Flowers said.

Deforestation, which affects the ability of the land to retain water, also contributed to the flooding and a series of severe landslides during the stormy season, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said at a legislative National Assembly meeting last month.

Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam lost 657,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of primary forest – 23 percent of its total tree-cover loss according to data from international monitoring service Global Forest Watch. About 50 percent of all tree-cover loss between 2001 and 2019 took place in 11 of the country’s 63 provinces – eight of them in central Vietnam, it said.

The devastating landslides and flooding have prompted concerns about deforestation caused by the construction of hydropower plants in forests.

As of 2018, there were 385 dams in operation, with an additional 143 under construction, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Earlier this month, the minister acknowledged the increased evidence of the loss of watershed forests and vegetation, as well as a loss of soil adhesion, as a result of the developments.

The government has also announced sustainable and long-term missions to cope with storms in central Vietnam, including upgrading climate-change adaptation scenarios and relocating people in areas at risk of landslide and flooding.

No place like home

For those who have been living in the area for generations, like the parents of 21-year-old university student Le Thi Thuyen, leaving their storm-battered homes seems unfathomable.

“We can be accustomed to annual storms but whenever they come, we are still worried,” said Thuyen, a native of Quang Binh, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the central region.

Thuyen, who left for Ho Chi Minh City to study and is currently an intern at a non-governmental organisation in Vietnam’s biggest city, called her parents and siblings back home every day when the storms were pounding their commune, flooding and isolating homes in low-lying areas.

Tears welled up in her eyes when she thought of her 12-year-old brother who does not know how to swim.

Cemeteries were inundated as floodwaters rose in central Vietnam [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “I read news about kids who got swept away by the flood and I was really worried about my brother,” the 21-year-old said.

Thuyen’s parents, who make a living from agriculture and working on other people’s farms, have already been struggling this year because of the pandemic – and the storm season has created more problems, destroying their crops, and fish. It also meant weeks when there were no jobs to be found.

“Tet this year won’t be as fulfilling as others for us,” Thuyen said. “This time, it won’t be my parents supporting me, but I will be supporting them with what I can.”","Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/000_8V93XX-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'children', 'storms', 'water', 'change', 'pieces', 'central', 'relentless', 'floods', 'parents', 'living', 'pick', 'vietnamese', '2020s', 'climate']", ,flood

By Vatican News staff writer

Volunteers and workers of Caritas Vietnam are visiting and assisting people in the central provinces who have to face the brunt of 13 storms this year with some severe flooding.

The umpteenth storm

In just over a month, Vietnam's central region has seen 7 tropical storms and typhoons, causing floods and landslides that killed 235 people and caused an estimated $740,000 in damage in several provinces. The rain from the storms has caused the worst flooding in the region in more than 30 years.

The latest of these typhoons, Vamco, made landfall in Vietnam on Sunday with winds of up to 150 kph, after leaving 67 dead in the Philippines. The storm has damaged more than 400,000 homes, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. At least 150,000 people are at risk of going hungry.

According to Caritas, the social arm of the Catholic Church, rebuilding homes and recovering their livelihood are extremely important apart from immediate help and survival. Farming, such as growing vegetables, rice, raising livestock and poultry, which is the mainstay in the central provinces, has been devastated. Many families have lost everything in the floods and landslides.



Local Caritas in action

The new director of Caritas Vietnam, Father Joseph Ngo Si Dinh, led a delegation to the central provinces, Nov. 9-11, to survey the flooded areas. They first visited the Diocese of Hu? and its two adjoining provinces, talking to families and providing them material and spiritual support.

Father John Nguyen Huy Tuan, director of Caritas Ha Tinh, said priests were actively involved in bringing food and relief to the affected people and moving them to safer places.

Temporary shelters have been built to accommodate 25 families. A parish mobilised its young people to rescue families trapped in flooded homes.

No one excluded

Caritas Vietnam, in collaboration with dioceses and parishes, has been engaged in social outreach and charity works to help people after natural disasters.

The social arm of the Catholic Church assists people to rebuild their lives, repair damaged houses and build new homes for families who have lost theirs. It also provides people and families with seeds, livestock, water filtering systems, and finance for school children.

Caritas discussed ways to come up with concrete plans or projects to rebuild the lives of people regardless of their religion. Father Dinh has urged Catholics to help every person in need. “We hope that the people most affected by these storms, be they Catholic or not, will get some relief,” the Caritas director said.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/reuters/2020/10/13/14/1602592734645.JPG/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'storms', 'provinces', 'flood', 'caritas', 'social', 'homes', 'central', 'region', 'families', 'typhoons', 'storm', 'victims', 'assisting']", ,flood

On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.

The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.

The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.

On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh 400-500 mm, Quang Tri 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City 1,100 mm, Quang Nam 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai 600-800 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In this period, more than 130,000 houses, mostly in Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue provinces had been flooded, with some submerged by four meters.

Streak of tragedies

Around 3 a.m. on October 8, cargo vessel Vietship 01 of a Hanoi-based logistics firm was swept away by floods and rough seas as it docked at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri.

The ship had 12 male crew members on board when swept off. Four crew members who had fallen from the vessel made it safely to shore on October 9 and 10. One member, aged 45, had also jumped into the water but went missing before his body was retrieved on October 11.

Heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas derailed rescue efforts and the vessel sank to the bottom in shallow waters, leaving the rest of the crew and one fisherman, part of a rescue squad, stranded at sea.

It took rescue teams three days to reach the stranded vessel.

""It was difficult for modern vessels to reach the stranded ship so we had to rely on rudimentary boats and experienced fishermen for the mission,"" explained Colonel Le Van Phuong, head of Quang Tri Border Guard.

On the morning of October 11, the fisherman and a crew member jumped into the water and battled their way back through the rough seas and strong waves. Two teams of rescuers rushed to deliver them safely to shore.

Within the same day, a military helicopter was sent to the scene to rescue the remaining six crew members stuck on the vessel. Two days after he was rescued, however, ship captain Nguyen Van Bao, 51, passed away due to multiple organ failure and sepsis.

At midnight on October 12, a hill collapsed onto an operation center of Rao Trang 3 Hydropower Plant, located deep in a jungle of Phong Xuan Commune, Phong Dien District in Thua Thien-Hue.

The landslide buried 17 workers after 40 others escape to a nearby plant, called Rao Trang 4.

The story of the 17 workers is even more tragic since a 21-member rescue team that had set out to verify reports of their predicament got struck by the same calamity.

At midnight the next day, a landslide had buried the ranger station housing the entire rescue team. Only eight members managed to escape, with the remaining 13 confirmed dead, including Major General Nguyen Van Man, deputy commander of the 4th Military Region of Vietnam People's Army. The bodies of the 13 victims have all been found and identified, though only five of the 17 workers' bodies have been retrieved.

During funeral procedures for the 12 soldiers and their deputy commander, another landslide struck a barracks housing 27 personnel of Defense Economics Division 337, also managed by the 4th Military Region.

The division had been assigned to assist five remote communes in Huong Hoa District of Quang Tri, which borders Laos, in mitigating the impacts of prolonged flooding and landslides triggered by abnormally heavy downpours across the central region.

As the mountain collapsed onto their barracks in the first hours of October 19, the 27 division members were all sleeping, with only five managing to escape. Three more landslides buried the remaining 22.

By the afternoon of that day, all 22 bodies had been retrieved.

Luong Thi Ly, who lost her son Le The Linh to the landslide, said she could not believe he and his comrades had lost their lives during peace time.

New flood waves

And as mountainous areas reeled under repeated landslides, urban and coastal areas were hit by a new wave of flooding on October 18 and 20 due to the impact of tropical storms, the intertropical convergence zone and east winds in tandem with water discharged from dam projects.

On October 18, flood peaks recorded on the Hieu River of Quang Tri hit 5.36 m, passing the record level of 1983 by 0.78 m, while the peak on the Thach Han River rose to 7.4 m, 0.11 m higher than the 1999 record. In Quang Binh, floodwaters were measured at 4.88 m on October 19, or 0.97 m higher than the record in 1999.

For the second flood wave, more than 177,000 households in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri were inundated by floodwaters 1-4 m deep.

Many elderly people in Ha Tinh said for the past 40 years, they had never seen such severe flooding causing such serious damage.

In Quang Binh's Le Thuy District, a family who lost their 75-year-old grandmother, on October 17, had to hang her coffin from the roof of their house for nearly a week to avoid floodwaters.

More storms, floods and landslides

With heavy rains yet to show any signs of receding, Storm Saudel developed in the East Sea on October 20, though it had weakened and turned into a tropical depression as it reached the central coast on October 25.

Two days later, Molave entered the East Sea and headed straight to central Vietnam. It landed over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28 as the most powerful storm to have hit Vietnam in 20 years.

The storm had inflicted economic damage worth around VND10 trillion ($430.16 million), according to statistics from affected provinces. The loss was nearly 1.5 times higher than 2019’s total natural disaster-induced damage of VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), mostly ascribed to flooding, storms and landslides.

Subsequently, the storm triggered heavy rains that had led to more floods and landslides.

On October 28 alone, two different landslides struck Tra Leng and Tra Van communes in Quang Nam’s Nam Tra My District.

The Tra Van landslide buried 20, killing eight and injuring 12 while in Tra Leng, a mountain collapsed on 53 villagers, with 33 managing to escape, eight confirmed dead, and 12 still missing.

One day later in Phuoc Loc Commune, Phuoc Son District of Quang Nam, another landslide buried 11 victims. Seven have since been confirmed dead and four are still missing.

A survivor of the Tra Leng landslide, Nguyen Thanh Son, 56, had lost his wife to the accident. The bereaved husband cannot believe he has lost his family, house and entire village in the mere blink of an eye.

""Altogether, tumbling soil, mud, rocks, water and trees smashed in the roofs of our houses, sweeping everything away until hitting the foot of another mountain,"" Son recalled.

By the night of October 28, more than 4,000 families in Nghe An and Ha Tinh had been evacuated to safety after their neighborhoods had been submerged by up to two meters of water.

The third flood lasted until October 30 and by November 1, had receded.

While central Vietnam residents recuperate from Storm Molave and prior flooding, Storm Goni entered the East Sea on Monday morning, forecast to strike central areas from Da Nang to Phu Yen in the next few days.","Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/02/huu-khoa-tang-le-1-1603267441-7792-8579-1604304150_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'quang', 'central', 'landslide', 'month', 'tragedies', 'mm', 'crew', 'storm', 'rescue', 'day', 'm']", ,flood

A search operation has been launched for a missing rescue team as severe flooding and landslides battered central Vietnam, authorities said on Wednesday, as the country braced for further heavy rain.

Close to a million people have been impacted by heavy downpours and rising waters since mid last week, with more than 200,000 homes flooded, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Thirty-six people are now dead, Vietnam's disaster management authority said, while rescue workers have launched a search for around 30 people missing at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue province following landslides.

The missing include a team of soldiers and officials who had tried to find plant workers who disappeared days ago.

Images on state media showed helicopters and hundreds of soldiers struggling to access the site through thick mud and fallen trees.

Elsewhere across the central region, villages and rice fields were submerged, with relief workers resorting to makeshift boats and canoes to deliver food and bottled water to those stuck in flooded homes.

North central Vietnam was also hit by severe weather on Wednesday as Storm Nangka made landfall.

Forecasters said it could bring further rain in the coming days, while warning another storm was expected to form and make impact this weekend.

The IFRC said it had ""grave fears"" that the deadly floods would worsen as more rain was dumped on hard hit communities.

""These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods,"" said IFRC's Hung Ha Nguyen.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and is often affected by more than a dozen storms each year, regularly bringing flooding and landslides.

More then 130 people were reported dead or missing due to natural disasters in the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. “I wasn’t sad,” Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017’s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tay’s land. “That’s what I had to do.” He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldn’t be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasn’t wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. “Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them,” landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a “soft” levee girding the riverbank. She doesn’t view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. “The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and you’ve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made.” Dao’s mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, “a very sensitive and fragile area where ‘hard’ solutions [to erosion] won’t work”, said Dao, who has studied the region’s ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The “common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land”, Dao says. “Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down.” As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Dao’s words, “by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous”. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tay’s riverbank is like a pillow that doesn’t stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Dao’s green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses — a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, “people aren’t afraid of flooding”, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. “We have learnt to live with the floods,” he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. “Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive,” he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yen’s fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the island’s west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals’ trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the city’s famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes aren’t simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi An’s recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground. Dr Dao Ngo bought her own land in Triem Tay village to do her conservation work. Credit:Yen Duong “Now the ecological component is extremely important. In the past it was culture, now it’s ecology,” Hoi An’s vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local government’s development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. “Of course, it is difficult and it will take time,” says Hung. “Perhaps we won’t succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation.” As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemic’s wake, Hung doesn’t want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the city’s revenue. “We’ve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, there’ll be less to worry about.“

Ecology-based development, in Hung’s words, also means preserving the city’s forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. “If we achieve that, we’ll be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals’ life will definitely be improved.” Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. “You don’t see erosion here, but build-up [of land],” said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. “I’ve never seen these trees die because of flooding,” said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the river’s mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huong’s family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as “a fortune” on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river. Le Thi Huong, 59, a mangrove palm farmer, in her home made from the palms in Cam Thanh commune. Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. “The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; that’s why they protect it,” Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tay’s sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi An’s toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

The death toll from flooding and landslides in Vietnam continued to rise Tuesday, while those hit by the disasters triggered by tropical storms in the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos criticized government inaction and made urgent appeals for assistance.

In Vietnam, at least 104 people are dead in the country’s central region, with 49, 27, and 11 deaths reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam alone, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Control. Twenty-seven people are missing, including 15 workers from a hydropower plant in Quang Tri that was hit by a landslide on Oct. 12.

The committee said that some 90,000 residents of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Tri provinces have been evacuated to higher ground. Nearly 7,000 hectares of rice paddy and crop fields have been submerged, while more than 5,800 head of cattle and 685,000 poultry birds have been killed or carried away in floods.

Vietnamese state media on Tuesday reported that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved the allocation of 100 billion Vietnamese dong (U.S. $4.3 million) and 1,000 tons of rice to the five worst flood-hit provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Ha Tinh.

Meanwhile, the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre said a tropical depression in the Philippines has strengthened into what is being called Storm Saudel. Over the next 24 hours, Saudel is expected to enter the South China Sea—called the East Sea in Vietnam—and become the eighth storm to batter Vietnam’s central provinces since the start of the rainy season.

Tran Quang Nang, head of the weather forecasting department under the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre, rejected reports circulating on Facebook, allegedly citing Japanese forecasters, that Saudel is a super typhoon.

“All of these predictions about Typhoon Saudel are baseless and fake,” Nang said. “The Japanese weather forecasting center and other countries have said no such thing.”

Nang called on the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to “punish” those responsible for spreading inaccurate information on social networks, causing public confusion.

“This issue should be handled promptly to ensure people only access accurate information released by the authorities so they can respond to natural disasters, helping to mitigate the damage they cause,” he said.

In Cambodia, the death toll remained at 25 from a day earlier, with some 40,000 evacuated to temporary shelters, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha told RFA’s Khmer Service. More than 200,000 hectares of paddy field and nearly 80,000 farms have also been destroyed, with more than 500 school buildings and 79 garment factories damaged.

Roads, hospitals, and dams have also been affected, authorities said.

In a notice issued on Tuesday, the Poipet Administration of Banteay Meanchey province, along Cambodia’s border with Thailand, temporarily closed portions of National Road 5. Downtown Poipet saw flooding of homes and roads, which the notice attributed to rains in Thailand.

Sann Ratha, a resident of Kaun Damrei village, in Poipet’s Sangkat Nimith district, told RFA that water levels increased so rapidly that several hundred families were forced to leave their homes.

He said people are stranded and in desperate need of food and other supplies.

“We are under the attack from the flood—our village looks like a river now with water everywhere and houses submerged,” he said.

“The current situation is worse than during the [1967-1975] civil war. We need the authorities to help us immediately.”

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen traveled to affected areas visiting with victims and handing out food. He said in a post to his Facebook page that he plans to spend two days in hard-hit Banteay Meanchey province, where 13 of the country’s 25 deaths have occurred and an estimated 20,000 families have been affected.

Opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha is also traveling to Banteay Meanchey to provide assistance.

Din Puthy, head of the Poipet-based Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association, expressed skepticism over the government’s handling of the flooding Tuesday.

He voiced concerns that authorities appear to prefer taking selfies with small numbers of villagers and posting them on social media to pretend they are helping the victims.

“The victims are not receiving equal treatment,” he said. “Only a few people have received some assistance while many others have been left behind.”

More aid needed

In Laos, where storms have ravaged Savannakhet province in the country’s center, authorities remained unable to access many areas due to damaged roads and a lack of boats to transport aid and other supplies, Lao sources said.

More than 125 villages in eight districts have now been flooded, with many houses and over 10,000 hectares of paddy fields submerged, official sources in the province say. Nearly 30,000 people have been impacted in Savannakhet, according to official count.

An official from Savannakhet’s inundated Phin district told RFA Tuesday that people are in need of dry goods, drinking water, medicine, and other necessities. The official said that while most aid had been distributed it still is not enough.

“In Phin district, 45 villages are heavily flooded, but they have received some help already—they mostly need sticky rice and consumer goods,” he said.

He said villagers with boats had been using them to help one another and that there have been no accidents during rescue and supply operations.

A villager in Phin told RFA that the water level is so high that the local river had flooded homes along its banks and urged authorities to provide more assistance.

“They have helped a little, but it’s very difficult for us,” he said. “Higher-level authorities should take care of this. We’re asking for more rice—all houses need rice to eat.”

Authorities in Savannakhet’s Xonbury district said waters remain high and will rise in days to come, forcing villagers to stay in clubs, schools, and other places set up by the local government as temporary shelters until flooding recedes.

According to the Meteorology Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Laos will continue to endure heavy rains and strong winds throughout the country in coming days. It urged villagers to remain vigilant for flash floods and landslides.

Storm Molave, which made landfall at around 11 am local time on Wednesday, is one of the strongest storms to hit the southeast Asian nation in 20 years.

The resulting “extreme rainfall” could continue over the coming days, worsening the already precarious situation faced by many families, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a statement.

“For the affected populations, their homes remain severely damaged, their food stocks have been lost, they have no access to clean water for drinking, washing and cooking; and water and sanitation systems have been damaged,” said the agency.

Evacuation centres flooded

Thousands have been moved to evacuation centres, which are themselves flooded, resulting in difficult health and hygiene conditions for the displaced people, primarily women, children and elderly. Health centres have also been damaged, leaving without to access basic health care services.

“Added to this is the trauma of the violent storms and rushing waters, that for a population where many cannot swim, creates fear and impacts mental wellbeing,” UNICEF added.

The storm has also damaged vital infrastructure, including electricity and roads, leaving many communities cut off from assistance and protection.

Affected populations

An estimated 7.7 million people live in the affected areas, including as many as 1.5 million who have been “directly affected”, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam said in a humanitarian update late Wednesday.

Of these, some 177,000 people considered vulnerable (poor or near-poor), should be prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance, it added.

Response

According to the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UN agencies and partners are developing and will release a multi-sector response plan, within the coming days, to support emergency relief efforts.

Description of the disaster

The central region of Viet Nam was experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimetres of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 150 millimetres of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. Additionally, Tropical Storm Saudel hit Viet Nam on 25 October closely followed by Typhoon Molave on 28 October. Typhoon Molave was one of the most devastating typhoons making landfall in Vietnam in decades. The typhoon made landfall after a series of tropical storms hitting Viet Nam and had caused severe flooding and at least three landslides which tragically resulted in the loss of 40 lives. 44 people are still missing, and six people are severely injured. On 5 November, Typhoon Goni made landfall in Viet Nam and Tropical Storm Atsani made landfall on 7 November. Tropical storm Vamco, was the latest to hit central Viet Nam as it made landfall on 15 November 2020.

The recurrent storms bringing heavy rainfall have caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. The Viet Nam National Disaster Management Agency (VNDMA) has reported that many areas in central Vietnam recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 1,600 millimeters between 5 to 20 October 2020, with peaks of 2,400 millimeters in some locations over the same period. The Hieu River (Quang Tri), Bo River (Hue), Gianh River and Kien Giang River (Quang Binh) have reached historically high levels, and in some locations flood waters have exceeded the previous historical highs recorded in 1979 and 1999. In addition, hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs to prevent them from bursting.

Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Authorities estimate that a nearly eight million people have been exposed to the storms, and some 1.5 million people have been directly affected by the storms and floods. On 4 November, ahead of typhoon Goni’s landfall, 98,819 households (372,631 people) in six provinces (Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen) were evacuated to safe shelters. Similarly, evacuations took place on 7 November in anticipation of typhoon Atsani, and on the 15th November ahead of typhoon Vamco’s landfall additional evacuations have been carried out in seven provinces of central Viet Nam with a total of 93,795 households (324,780 people) evacuated to safer places (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai).

Most of the people who had been evacuated have now returned home after their local authorities’ approval. They are actively repairing their homes with the help of their relatives. However, according to the VNDMA 31,637 households must be urgently relocated because they lost their shelter or their houses which have collapsed or been too heavily damaged, and they are now living with host families. After the latest typhoon (Vamco), according to the VNDMA, at least 243 are reported to have been killed or are missing and over two million livestock have been killed or swept away. The floods have caused significant damage to infrastructure including roads, schools, health centres and community facilities. It is reported that 1,569 schools have been affected included 360 schools flooded or damaged, while 46,916 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people are now in desperate needs of emergency relief, such as safe shelter, safe drinking water, food and livelihood income support.","Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1546577-MDRVN020eu1.png?itok=7nf8va0m,"['vietnam', 'n', 'nam', 'update', 'mdrvn020', 'quang', 'provinces', 'viet', 'storms', 'emergency', 'tropical', 'typhoon', 'n1', 'floods', 'central', 'storm', 'operation', 'landfall']", ,flood

These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.

Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.

The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.

As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing.

In addition, 150,000 people have been evacuated and significant impacts on transportation networks and agricultural livelihoods have been reported.

USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance partner VNRC is on the frontline of the response and has mobilized rapid disaster response teams established and trained through ongoing USAID disaster risk reduction programs to support evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency response operations, said the ambassador.

""We stand together with the government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones, address the damage caused by this terrible flood, and move forward, as the people of Vietnam have always done. We pledge to assist you in your work to rebuild,"" he said.

""I would also like to express my concern for persons with disabilities in the provinces affected by the typhoon as they are amongst the most vulnerable populations in this disaster. They are often home-bound, have less access to information and cannot take full advantage of preparedness activities and evacuation protocols,"" he added.

It is estimated that the provinces impacted by storm Linfa are home to over 200,000 persons with disabilities, of whom 61,000 are directly affected by this disaster.

Since 2000, USAID, through the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, has provided over $26 million in disaster response, preparedness, and risk reduction assistance in Vietnam.

Through the Department of Defense, the U.S. government has also provided more than $28 million since 1998 to train military and civilian emergency responders and develop and equip disaster management centers, maritime response centers, and disaster shelters at community level.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/17/anh124581602340198-1602931391-3782-3057-1602931440_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'response', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'central', 'aids', 'floods', 'landslide', 'usaid', 'affected', 'linfa', '100000', 'cope', 'provided']", ,flood

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to bring them to safety beyond rising floodwater in Cambodia’s western province of Battambang, which is expected to worsen on Sunday.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces – Pursat, Battambang and Pailin – have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall heralding the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

“A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,” Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told the AFP news agency late on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to get worse.

In central Vietnam, almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking northern Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand’s Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to place sandbags and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial Governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

The campaign was organized by Ron Haeberle, the American photographer best known for capturing the My Lai Massacre in 1968, with assistance from Chuck Searcy, co-founder of Project RENEW, an organization that deals with unexploded ordnance left from the Vietnam War, according to a Thursday press release.

The funds would be distributed in Quang Tri Province by Project RENEW staff and in Quang Ngai Province by Quang Ngai Red Cross, it was added. Distribution in Quang Tri would begin on Jan. 25, while a check would be delivered by Project RENEW to Quang Ngai on Jan. 15, it said.

Last year, central Vietnam, particularly the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Quang Ngai and Quang Nam, were wrecked by a series of storms and tropical depressions.

The resulting floods and landslides killed at least 192 people and caused property losses of around VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion). More than 1,500 houses were destroyed and 240,000 others damaged. The daily lives of around 5.5 million people were severely disrupted.

The Vietnamese government has provided around VND770 billion to the region as emergency relief.

The fully probabilistic model provides countrywide coverage and enables insurers to assess their exposure to floods, which affect 70 percent of the country’s population.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue simulating both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding. The fluvial component of the hazard was developed using state-of-the-art hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate rainfall and river discharges across the river network in the country. Pluvial flooding is simulated using a proprietary, in-house methodology accounting for local climate conditions, soil type, land use and topography.

Offering enhanced flexibility, the model can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves, and average annual losses at virtually any level of aggregation. The model outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk® platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region. “The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon. These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.

The entire central region has been battered by downpours since Tuesday as a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

Quang Nam, home to the ancient town of Hoi An and the My Son Sanctuary, received 188 mm of rain in the past day. Rainfall of 180 mm in a day is considered heavy.

Many parts of Hoi An, a famous tourist destination, are submerged.

Nguyen The Hung, vice chairman of the town, said the water level reached 1.3 meters on Thursday morning, 0.3 meters above flood danger level 1, prompting authorities to suspend all tourism-related activities.

Quang Tri, which has the historic Hien Luong Bridge and beautiful beaches, was hit by up to 409 mm of rain in the last two days.

Some residential areas in Lao Bao Town are under three meters of water.

Nguyen Khiem, a resident of Lao Bao, said: ""The floodwaters started to rise from Wednesday night. The water level is 0.5 m higher than during the historic floods of 2019.""

In Huong Hoa District 1,100 families have been evacuated to safer areas, but local authorities said four people were swept away and remain missing as of Thursday.

Many roads in Quang Tri have been blocked by severe landslides.

Quang Binh, home to Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and the world's largest cave Son Doong, received rainfall of up to 338 mm in a day. Many places are inundated and students have been told to stay at home to ensure their safety.

The national park in Bo Trach District has closed itself off to tourists since Wednesday due to rising water levels in some rivers.

Thua Thien-Hue Province, which boasts the popular tourist town Hue, got up to 500 mm of rainfall in the past day.

Prolonged downpours and heavy discharge by dams flooded thousands of homes in the province’s downstream areas.

Many streets in Da Nang, a popular tourist city, were under 40 cm of water on Wednesday.

The storm also set off landslides and knocked out power lines, leaving 1.7 million people in the dark.



Storm Molave, the ninth storm this year in the South China Sea and the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years, struck coastal provinces on Oct. 28 with heavy rainfall and winds as high as 115-135 km per hour, according to data provided by Vietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting on Wednesday.



Landslides in central provinces have killed at least 19 people and buried more than 40 others, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, adding that the bodies of 12 fishermen missing since the storm hit on Wednesday were recovered on Thursday, leaving another 14 still unaccounted for.



Around 56,000 houses were stripped of their roofs in Quang Ngai, where a massive blackout from downed power lines left more than a million people trapped in darkness as high winds tore through the province, according to state-controlled Vietnam News, AP said.



Wednesday’s storm hit central regions already devastated by weeks of heavy rains, floods, and landslides beginning Oct. 6 that left at least 130 dead and thousands displaced. The floods and landslides also wrecked highways and roads, blocking efforts to rescue and bring supplies to many cut off from help in remote areas.



Speaking to RFA on Thursday, residents in storm-hit provinces described fast-rising waters and devastated fields, with one saying that floodwaters had risen more quickly now than they had during the storms that battered the area earlier this month.



“During previous storms and floods, the water rose only to the height of my hand. But now the water rose so high that my house was submerged,” Hien Thao, a resident of Quang Tri province, speaking to RFA on Oct. 29.



“I lost 500 kg of paddy rice, and many of my household belongings were washed away,” he said.



“Yesterday, the water rose up to the yard of my house,” added 40-year-old Phan Quoc Vu of Truong Xa commune in Cam Lo district’s Cam Hieu village in Quang Tri. “But luckily it began to recede today,” he said.



“In the opinion of my 80-year-old father, this was the worst storm flooding that he can remember,” Vu said.



Calls for help



At the height of the flood, Vu called unsuccessfully to local authorities for help, and even posted calls for help on social media, but finally had to hire canoes to help evacuate elderly people and young children to safer ground, he said.



In Ninh Thuan province, villagers had made their living mainly through farming and raising shrimp, said Tran Thanh Truc, a resident of the province’s Hien Luong commune.



“But the floodwaters washed everything away—pigs, chickens, and shrimp,” she said. “We are glad to receive whatever help others can give us, but it will be difficult to make up for everything that was lost.”



In Quang Tri, supplies including large quantities of rice have been received so far only from volunteers, Hien Thao said, adding that the local People’s Committee has promised to bring relief goods soon.



“I also learned that the government will provide us with seeds for farming our next crop in the winter and spring.”



“We would like them to also give us boats and other equipment we need, along with rice that will help us while we wait for our next crop to be ready for harvest,” he said.



In Truong Xa commune, officials have cared so far only for their own relatives, though, Pham Quoc Vu said.



“They are not impartial, which is causing much suspicion,” he said.



Heavy rains, flooding in Laos



In Laos, heavy rains and flooding from Wednesday’s storm damaged or destroyed around 51,000 hectares of agricultural production, including more than 23,000 hectares of rice fields, across 13 districts of Savannakhet province, state media sources said on Friday.



Total losses in farm production and livestock from flooding in the storm are now estimated at 283 billion kip (U.S. $6,257,968.), Keoodom Souliya—an official from the province’s Agriculture and Forestry Department—said on Thursday.



In the southern province of Champassak, strong winds toppled power lines, while in Borikhamxay province, Khamkeut district’s Napae village was completely destroyed by floods, a video obtained by RFA showed on Friday, with a narrator on the video saying Napae had now become “a sea of water.”



The video also showed floods and landslides blocking the road leading from Napae to the Naphao International Border Checkpoint with Vietnam.



A rice paddy being harvested was also under water, Phetsamai Xayaathichak told local media. “We will announce the exact amount of local damage later, once we know what it is,” he said.



A total number of deaths in Laos resulting from the storm was not immediately available.

The five provinces, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Nam, would receive VND100 billion each as part of the government’s efforts to help local communities overcome the consequences of devastating floods, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh sait at a meeting in Quang Tri on Thursday morning.

The government also provided each of the five provinces with 1,000 tons of rice alongside medicine and antiseptic chemicals.

Senior Lieutenant General Le Chiem, Deputy Minister of National Defense, said the ministry has provided 22 tons of dried food to flooded provinces. For Quang Tri, military forces also provided seven motorboats, 36 generators and three water pumps for after-flood clean-up work along with 1,000 life jackets.

Chiem suggested local authorities distribute dried food to victims in flood-prone areas immediately and properly.

In the past, the defense ministry found ""some local leaders had given dried food to officials as gifts because it was delicious,"" Chiem said. ""The dried food is meant for flood victims. They are in need.""

Binh said damage caused by floods in Quang Tri was ""very huge,"" especially in the two mountainous districts of Huong Hoa and Dak Rong where infrastructure has been heavily affected.

Therefore, the government has granted an additional VND40 billion for these two districts to cope with the flood impacts.

Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said floodwater started receding gradually, so it is necessary to focus on relief for flood victims, from Quang Nam to Ha Tinh.

Many international organizations have pledged donations of cash and disaster relief to help central Vietnam.

For more than two weeks, the central region has been swept by historic flooding and deadly landslides that caused damage described by government officials as worst in five years.

At least 114 people in central Vietnam were killed by severe flooding and landslides and more than 170,000 houses in flood-prone Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces have been submerged, with many areas currently isolated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/huukhoatangle21603267443-16033-3261-6190-1603358848_1200x0.jpg,"['floodhit', 'dried', 'vietnam', 'binh', 'mln', 'quang', 'aid', 'provinces', '21', 'disaster', 'minister', 'central', 'grants', 'food', 'victims', 'support', 'tri', 'provided']", ,flood

She said the UNDP plans to build an additional 4,000 houses next year, helping 20,000 people gain access to information on climate change and natural disasters, she said, adding that her agency would continue to support Vietnam in natural disaster management over the next decade.

Tran Quang Hoai, head of the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority, said the houses built by the UNDP in central Vietnam were still standing after the region’s historic storms and floods in October and November, which had demolished over 1,500 houses and damaged 240,000 others.

La Thi Kim Ngan, deputy head of the National Institute of Architecture, said that authorities and investors need to create a comprehensive model for housing complexes, complete with infrastructure like electricity, clean water and waste management systems.

Flood resilient houses can become homestay accommodations and help the region develop economically, she added.

Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said his ministry was cooperating with the architecture institute and the Ministry of Construction to develop appropriate and safe housing models to withstand natural disasters.

It is estimated that by 2025, Vietnam would have around 30 million people living in areas prone to natural disasters. Many of them are likely to be poverty stricken.

Rapid urbanization and economic development can intensify natural disaster risks for Vietnam's coastline and wipe billions of dollars off its economic growth over the next decade, a World Bank report warned in October.

Around 11.8 million people in coastal provinces face the threat of intense flooding, and over 35 percent of settlements are located on eroding coastlines. Each year, an average of $852 million, along with around 316,000 jobs in sectors like agriculture, aquaculture and tourism, are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding, the report said.","Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/17/img065481941608185336-16082067-5924-6541-1608206823_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'needs', 'proof', 'flood', 'disaster', 'undp', 'coast', 'management', 'development', 'natural', 'vietnams', 'million', '100000', 'houses', 'coastal']", ,flood

Another powerful storm is testing Southeast Asian disaster responders after Typhoon Goni crashed into the Philippines on 1 November, before veering towards flood-hit central Vietnam.

Goni, known as Rolly in the Philippines, made landfall on Sunday on Catanduanes Island in the country’s east, bringing violent winds and extensive flooding. The Red Cross says there’s “massive devastation” in some areas, including 90 percent of the homes in villages in one part of Catanduanes.

Philippine authorities are still assessing the total damage, but the government said 11 people had died as of 2 November, with numbers still rising.

The evacuation of at least 450,000 people and early response planning helped avoid a worse outcome, but aid groups warn that the combined hit from a barrage of recent storms and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will test communities for months to come.

The Philippines has been locked in disaster response mode for weeks after previous storms caused extensive flooding in parts of Luzon, the country’s main island. Typhoon Molave, known as Quinta in the Philippines, killed at least 23 people in October; Typhoon Saudel, known as Pepito, struck days earlier.

Attention now turns to Vietnam, which is preparing for a weakened Goni to strike its flood-hit central region around 5 November – the country’s fifth major storm since mid-October.

Typhoon Goni’s wind speeds slowed to around 90 kilometres per hour by 2 November, but successive storms over the past month have driven severe floods and landslides across central Vietnam.

Vietnam’s government says roughly 160 people have died, with dozens more missing in the worst flooding to hit the country in 20 years. The disasters have inundated more than a quarter of a million homes, and prompted a $40 million humanitarian appeal targeting 177,000 people.

The Philippines isn’t in the clear, either. Another storm, Atsani or Siony, could careen toward northern Luzon in the coming days, though forecasters say its current path is extremely erratic.

Floods are common during Asia’s various monsoon and cyclone seasons, but aid groups say the damage has been particularly severe this year.

Typhoon Goni was the strongest storm to hit the country since 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,300 people and led to a massive humanitarian response.

Climate change is fuelling more volatile extreme weather across the globe. The Philippines’ first typhoon of the season, Vongfong or Ambo, arrived relatively early in May; the storm season typically hits its peak in July.

Posting on Twitter, Yeb Saño, who was the Philippines’ climate negotiator when Haiyan struck in 2013, said Typhoon Goni and the burst of recent extreme weather is further proof of a crisis.

“The climate emergency persists and is wreaking havoc,” he said.

Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam.

The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.

The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.

The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.

As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.

Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light.""

Australia is already making ongoing efforts to support Vietnam’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $10.5 million assistance package in June.

Earlier this week the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management, the United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

""From 2 a.m. until now, there have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,"" local official Ha Ngoc Duong said, as reported by Vietnamese newspaper VnExpress, warning that the situation could worsen.

The bodies of some 22 soldiers from the army camp were recovered early on Sunday morning, according to local media reports. Ongoing rain has hampered rescue efforts. Days before, 13 rescue team members died trying to reach a group of 30 employees of a hydropower plant that had been buried by the landslides.

The rains have flooded nearly 200,000 houses in the region.

Widespread damage

Authorities also warned that river levels in the country had reached their highest in two decades, state media said.

The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides. Torrential downpours have flooded nearly 200,000 houses and 300 schools in the region.

Since storms began on October 6, some 72 people have died and a further 19 are still missing, Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said in a report.

Though Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, which often bring flooding and landslides, this month's disaster has been the worst the country has faced in years.

Neighboring Cambodia has also been affected by heavy flooding in the region. The death toll there jumped to 20 on Saturday, according to disaster management authorities.

Several areas of Vietnam hit by the worst floods in decades. In the last month, torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing, and created hardship for 240 thousand families. Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs mobilized. The strengthening of relations between the two countries can be linked to the US's anti-Beijing strategies.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) - Taiwan has donated 400,000 US dollars in aid to Vietnam to support the local population, hit by the worst floods and landslides in decades. In the past two weeks, storms no. 6 and 7 have caused serious damage in the central-northern provinces of Hà Tinh, Qu?ng Bình, Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên-Hu? and in the central-southern ones Ðà N?ng, Qu?ng Nam, Qu?ng Ngãi, Bình Ð?nh and Phú Yên.

The Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention reports that torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing since late September. River levels have risen rapidly in central areas of Vietnam, flooding 212 municipalities inhabited by 240 thousand families.

Many communities are isolated; at the moment in the devastated areas it is possible to move mostly with small boats. Victims are in immediate need of food, bottled water, medicine, clothing, blankets and books.

At the end of the emergency, money will be needed for reconstruction, especially seeds and agricultural machinery. Many Vietnamese have mobilized to support the flood victims. Groups of young people, including Catholics, brought rice, spaghetti (noodles) and drinking water to the most remote flooded areas.

Richard Shih, Taiwanese representative in Hanoi, said that Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs operating in Vietnam have mobilized and sent aid to disaster areas. He hopes the victims can rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon.

The aid delivery ceremony took place on 23 October in the presence of Tr?n Quang Hoài, director of the Vietnamese agency for the management of natural disasters. The Hanoi representative thanked the generosity of the government and the people of Taiwan, stressing that the distribution of aid will start as soon as possible.

The Taiwanese authorities highlighted the strong ties that unite their country to Vietnam. More than 320,000 Vietnamese migrants live and work in Taiwan; Taipei is Hanoi's seventh trading partner, with a turnover of 13.5 billion euros in 2019. The two nations also share fears about the growth of Chinese power, an aspect that links the strengthening of their relations with the United States anti-Beijing strategy in the region.","Mon, 26 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM-TAIWAN_-_1026_-_Aiuti_ter.jpg,"['areas', 'donates', 'vietnam', 'dollars', 'aid', 'flood', 'taiwan', 'qu?ng', 'mobilized', 'vietnamese', 'caused', '400000', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

""It has been 21 years since I saw such a flood,"" he said.

For the past 10 days the 60-year-old farmer and his family of three have barely stepped outside. In their Huong Toan Commune in Thua Thien-Hue, floods triggered by heavy rains have inundated over 2,000 homes. The only sounds they hear these days are the thump of rain falling on the roof, the clattering of windows in the wind, and distant hums of motorboats moving through the sea of water.

Like many people in central Vietnam, Luong and his wife Hoa were proud of their ability to live with floods. Since the beginning of this month, Hoa has been stocking up rice, dry fish and peanut on warnings of coming storms and rains. They knew not to stock up on meat since electricity is always cut when a storm hits. They were right.

On the morning of October 9 Luong opened his front door only to see the water almost reaching the threshold following heavy rain the previous night. As the hours passed and the rain showed no signs of relenting, the water started to come inside the house. Everywhere in the neighborhood, people were yelling that the floods had come.

Their eldest daughter, who is in her final year of high school, began to put all her books into plastic bags. Her parents waded around the house to salvage the family’s most valuable belongings like the refrigerator, TV and stove, and put them on a table that is reinforced with four blocks of wood.

Within a span of not even a day, Huong Toan turned from green paddy fields to muddy sea in the afternoon. With the electricity duly cut and dusk falling, the area, now flooded for dozens of kilometers along National Highway 1, slowly sank into darkness.

""I say ‘keeping watch,’ but the water will rise anyway even if I’m asleep. But my mind can be a little bit at rest if I watch it,"" she said.

The 54-year-old too has been confined at home for several days.

That night the entire family took refuge in the bedroom of her 85-year-old mother, whose room is situated farthest from the water. Thuc told her three children to go to sleep early, reminding them to turn off their phones to save the battery for the coming days without electricity.

Dung, her husband, shone the flashlight at the floor, sighing. The water was closing in. That night none of the three adults in the household slept a wink.

The local rice milling shop closed as soon as it started raining, catching Thuc off guard, leaving her no time to prepare enough food for the family.

Luckily her sister, who lives on higher ground, helped out, rowing a boat to Thuc’s house to deliver much-needed rice, bamboo shoot broth and boiled duck.

Seeing the family of six enjoying a meal sitting on a bed, surrounded by floodwater, Thuc could not help but weep.

For the next eight days the water ebbed and flowed. The children kept asking when the rain would stop, but the weather forecast kept getting gloomier.

The whole family had to shovel and sweep the mud and sludge entering the house. ""It was like walking in a swamp,"" they said.

Last Friday the water started to recede a little, going down to waist level, and Thuc took the opportunity to go out and buy some fish and vegetables. Looking around the neighborhood after being trapped inside the house for a week, she failed to recognize the place.

In Huong Toan, the situation has been grim. With the water showing no signs of receding, Hoang Trong Hieu, the commune chairman, other officials and police officers have not gone home for the last 10 days.

The group, which consists of over 20 people, has divided itself to take 24-hour shifts at the People’s Committee office to distribute supplies and respond to emergencies like transporting the injured and evacuating people.

Since the entire commune is under a meter of water, all travel is done by boat.

""It has been a long time since we saw our feet,"" a member of the group joked, carrying bags of rice on his shoulder in chest-deep water. The man had given Luong’s family two cartons of instant noodles the other day.

The day before electricity was cut, Luong’s had some vegetables, eggs and fish in the refrigerator, but only enough for two days for the family of three. So for the next eight days they had nothing to eat but rice and dry fish.

""I was given instant noodles but did not dare eat them because I did not want to urinate too much,"" he explained.

Luong’s wife, who had surgery just a month ago, stumbled in the dark and fell one night as she sought to go to the bathroom amid the sea of water. Since then he has been placing pots by the bed and replaces the candles twice every night.

""There are a lot of mosquitoes due to all the water.""

In Huong Van Commune, Nguyen Van Lieu, 63, has taken over the most dangerous task from his wife since the floods came: cooking. He dons his conical hat and raincoat every day to light the stove, standing in chest-deep water.

""If my wife gets into the water to cook, it will come up to her neck,"" he joked, patting his wife’s back with a smile.

Their house was almost completed earlier this year but the roof has not been finished. The family is among the luckier ones in the neighborhood since the water only comes up to the thighs even during the heaviest rains.

But the kitchen is a different story. There had been over 20 bags of rice, weighing over a ton, but everything was soaked the very first night. Vy, Lieu’s wife, had no choice but to give them away to her neighbors to feed their ducks and chickens. She has been borrowing rice from others.

They have not told their two eldest children, who are workers in the south, about their situation, not wanting to worry them.

Like many others, the couple have been trapped inside their home, situated just 100 m from the national highway, for more than a week. Every day Vy would cast her gaze on the other side of the highway to look at the paddy fields longingly despite realizing they must be submerged under water.

A few days before the rains came she had sold her first few gourds of the season. ""They sell well this year at VND10,000 (43 cents) per kilogram,"" she said. She was hoping to earn around VND10 million from selling them all over two months.

But that was before the storm came. She was only able to sell for two days, earning VND240,000, before she was forced to remain at home.

She and her husband have been reminiscing about the historic flood in Thua Thien Hue 21 years ago. The deluge in November 1999 had submerged thousands of houses and paralyzed all traffic and electrical and communication systems in the province. There had been rainfall of up to 2,300 mm in just the first three days. Several people had been swept away and killed during that disaster.

At that time the couple and their children stacked two beds on top of each other and waited for the floods to recede, the anguished voices of people who lost loved ones in the background.

Their son, seeing how his parents had to face flooding year after year, wanted to help them find a safer place to live in, but they cannot countenance moving out of their hometown.

More heavy rains are expected in central Vietnam regions at least until Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Rivers are expected to rise further, as is the risk of floods and landslides. Vehicles continue to line up along National Highway 1 and other roads on higher ground as people park their cars and motorbikes there to avoid the water.

But the people cannot do the same, they cannot just leave their houses. The only thing that Luong, Thuc and Lieu can do is to barricade themselves inside their homes and pray for the water to go away","Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/19/fbbdc0d9e2fe1ca045ef7172160297-3133-2038-1603105515_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'misery', 'rice', 'water', 'province', 'rain', 'thuc', 'floods', 'house', 'amid', 'days', 'wife', 'drowns', 'thua', 'night', 'family', 'continuing']", ,flood

Australia, Switzerland and Thailand have offered aid to victims of multiple storms and floods in central Vietnam last month.

The Australian embassy in Hanoi said on Friday its government will provide an additional AUD2 million ($1.45 million) to help Vietnam respond to the impacts of prolonged floods and landslides in the central region. The country had earlier provided AUD100,000 ($71,300).

The aid money will be used to meet urgent needs like providing clean water and sanitation and hygiene and dignity kits to affected people, and support the restoration of clean water supply to schools.

The Swiss embassy also announced grant of urgent aid worth CHF300,000 ($333,000) to help address the immediate needs of 160,000 people focusing on housing, livelihoods, healthcare, water, and hygiene.

In a phone call to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-o-cha, offered $30,000 toward relief efforts.

The central region was repeatedly hit by torrential rains, widespread flooding and landslides triggered by four storms in October.

So far 235 people have been killed or are missing, almost 390,000 houses were flooded and more than 300,000 families have been evacuated, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority.

Many people have lost almost all their household possessions or had their homes, food stocks, livestock, and crops badly damaged.

According to Tran Phuoc Anh, acting director of the city’s Foreign Department, the sustainable flood prevention project for Thu Duc City would have a total investment of more than $1bn, and would be implemented as a public–private project with the participation of the Dutch government.

Le Hoa Binh, deputy chair of HCMC, said he hoped the Netherlands would help create a city that was “sustainable and well adapted to climate change”.

Elizabeth Akkerman, the Dutch ambassador to Vietnam, said her government would help HCMC and Thu Duc City with advanced construction technologies.

Thu Duc will be based on advanced industries such as autonomous manufacturing, and will include the university precinct in Thu Duc as well as a new-build urban area and financial centre on the Thu Thiem Peninsula.

Thu Duc is the most elevated area in HCMC, but still suffers from seasonal flooding, and its residents suffer from inundation of streets and even houses every time there is heavy rain or a high tide.

In May 2019, HCMC sent a delegation to the Netherlands to study its urban development and flood management methods, and a number of memorandums of understanding were subsequently signed, including a $1bn anti-flooding project in Thu Duc City.

A tropical depression is projected to hit central Vietnam on Friday night, bringing heavy rains as the area struggles to recover from more than a week of flooding.

As of 10 a.m. Friday, the tropical depression was about 290 km to the east of Da Nang and Binh Dinh Province, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Its maximum wind speed was 50 kph.

Within the next 12 hours, the tropical depression would move west at about 30 kph, before making landfall in central Vietnam, then devolving into a low-pressure area over southern Laos.

By 10 p.m. Friday, the low-pressure area would be above the mountainous area of central Vietnam, with a maximum wind speed of 40 kph.

Rough seas and strong winds should be expected in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, within the next 24 hours.

Central Vietnam should expect particularly heavy rain from now until Wednesday next week, according to the center. Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and southern Nghe An should expect a total rainfall of up to 900 mm during the period, while Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and northern Nghe An should expect up to 500 mm.

Da Nang and its neighbor Quang Nam Province, home to popular ancient town Hoi An, should expect rainfall of up to 500 mm, while regions between Quang Ngai and Phu Yen should expect levels of up to 350 mm.

The Central Highlands should also expect heavy rain until Sunday, with rainfall of up to 250 mm.

Rains are expected to persist in central Vietnam even after Wednesday, the center noted.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Since last week, central Vietnam has been hit by torrential rains, floods and landslides after a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

On Sunday, Storm Linfa intensified from the turbulence and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. The next day, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

At least 56 people have been killed, including two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while coming to rescue the workers.

Thousands of homes in the region have been flooded.

Torrential downpours and discharge of water from hydropower dams have caused rivers in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces to swell and threaten severe flooding.

Storm Molave, said to be the strongest to hit Vietnam in the last two decades, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Wednesday morning before weakening into a tropical depression by 4 p.m.

The provinces have been hit by rains of up to 500 mm between Tuesday night and Wednesday night. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In Quang Ngai, the Tra Bong River was flowing above flood warning danger level 2 at Chau O station while the Tra Khuc, Ve and Tra Cau rivers had crossed the highest danger level of 3 by 4 p.m. Wednesday, according to the province's Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

They are forecast to continue rising quickly on Thursday, possibly triggering severe flooding in large parts of Quang Ngai Town, the capital, and several districts.

The release of water by local hydropower dams is worsening the situation.

Dak Drinh hydropower plant discharged up to 1,680 cubic meters of water a second on Wednesday and Nuoc Trong, the largest irrigation and hydroelectricity project in the central region, discharged 1,100 cubic meters.

Authorities hurriedly evacuated people living in low-lying areas and made emergency announcements about the water discharge via loudspeakers to warn local residents.

In Quang Nam Province, home to ancient town Hoi An, the water level in the Vu Gia River reached 9.41 meters by early morning Thursday, 0.41 meters above danger level 3, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, which warned rivers in the province would rise quickly in the next few hours.

Dak Mi 4 hydropower plant plans to discharge up to 11,400 cubic meters a second and the Vu Gia River is expected to rise to 11.2 meters, surpassing the historic flood level in 2009.

Nguyen Huu Vu, a local official, said authorities have evacuated over 4,000 families living along the river.

If the hydropower plant discharges over 5,000 cubic meters per second, 120,000 houses would be submerged under 0.5-1.5 meters of water, Vu said.

The National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said on Wednesday that Quang Nam could face severe flooding in the next one or two days.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung instructed provincial authorities to evacuate people from areas threatened by landslides and ensure the safety of reservoirs and hydropower plants.

The central region, including Quang Nam, was hit by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that caused at least 130 deaths.

Phnom Penh (AFP)

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to get them to safety from rising floodwater on Saturday in Cambodia's western province of Battambang.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces -- Pursat, Battambang and Pailin -- have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall ahead of the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

""A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,"" Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told AFP on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to worsen on Sunday.

In central Vietnam almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking north Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to sandbag and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

In Laos, rising floodwater has damaged villages and rice fields along the Xepon and Xebanghieng rivers in Savannakhet province with more rain on the way.

The probabilistic model will provide full national coverage and help re/insurers to assess their exposure to floods – a peril that affects 70% of the population in Vietnam.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue that simulates both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding.

It can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves and average annual losses at any level of aggregation.

Outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region.

“The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon,” Gallagher explained.

“These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flooded.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'model', 'reinsurance', 'population', 'flood', 'guy', 'help', 'launches', 'carpenter', 'vietnamthe', 'includes']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

When a northern cold spell entered the intertropical convergence zone over central Vietnam, it caused abnormally heavy rains and flooding in the region.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh got 400-500 mm, Quang Tri got 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue got 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City got 1,100 mm, Quang Nam got 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai got 600-800 mm.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

The entire central region suffered from severe flooding for days, more than 135,000 houses were submerged under 0.3-4 meters of water, and nearly 46,000 people had to be evacuated.

At least 36 people have died due to flooding and 12 are missing.

Nguyen Van Huong, head of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting’s Climate Forecast Office, said intertropical convergence zone stretches from the Bay of Bengal and across the center of Vietnam to the Philippines.

In these areas clouds and thunderstorms often develop, and when winds from the east meet them, there is an increase in moisture content, which means more thunderstorms, he said.

When the zone has favorable conditions such as the convergence of strong winds that moved over warm seawater, a tropical depression forms and then grows into a storm in the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea, he said.

Since October 6 two storms and a tropical depression have formed in this area.

On Sunday Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.

A day later Storm Nangka formed and hit the coast between the northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa Provinces on Wednesday.

""Storms and tropical depression already cause heavy rains. For instance, Storm Linfa caused rainfall of 500-700 mm,"" Huong said.

On Thursday morning another tropical depression formed over the sea and is heading straight for the central region also with a lot of moisture.

According to the center, more rains are expected in the region until Tuesday or later.

A cold spell coming down from the north and meeting winds from the east also caused heavy rains, Huong said.

The center said the root cause of all these phenomena was La Nina, which appeared in July and is expected to last until early next year. During this period, more storms would form over the East Sea and the rains would last longer than usual, it added.

Four to six more storms and tropical depressions are expected to brew this year with at least two making landfall over the central coast.

La Nina is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years as a result of variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It occurs as strong winds blow warm water on the ocean's surface from South America across the Pacific Ocean toward Indonesia.

The number of patients with melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, has increased sharply at a major hospital in the central region following the prolonged flooding.

Since early October Hue Central Hospital in Thua Thien-Hue Province has admitted 28 people with the disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia Pseudomallei, which infects both humans and animals.

Around half the patients are from Thua Thien-Hue and the rest are from other central provinces like Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri, the province's news website reported.

The hospital is one of three biggest and most advanced general hospitals in Vietnam along with others in Hanoi and HCMC.

It said many of the patients came for treatment only after the disease had become serious, causing sepsis and multi-organ failure and threatening their life.

On November 14 a Quang Binh Province official died of the disease at the hospital.

Phan Thanh Mien, people’s committee chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trach District, had spent days in floodwaters in October managing relief efforts. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee, but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items in inundated areas.

The hospital had treated 83 people with the disease between 2014 and 2019 and 11 in the first nine months of this year.

It said the rise in the number of infections since early October is closely related to the floods that ravaged the central region throughout October and in November.

Various studies around the world have found that melioidosis occurs only in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, with outbreaks occurring after floods and typhoons.

In October central Vietnam was hit by floods thrice.

Melioidosis patients have symptoms like fever, pneumonia and abscesses in and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate is around 40 percent.

The disease was first diagnosed in Vietnam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country.

There are around 10,000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, around half of which prove fatal. There is no vaccine.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/17/muangapohue031602226049-160558-2074-9150-1605581241_1200x0.jpg,"['thienhue', 'infection', 'vietnam', 'patients', 'quang', 'province', 'outbreak', 'central', 'hospital', 'floods', 'cause', 'bacterial', 'floodwaters', 'thua', 'disease']", ,flood

After devastating storms and floods, the airline worked to transport thousands of aid packages to help areas in central Vietnam.

Aid transportation

Vietnam Airlines flew over 24 tons of goods and more than 2,000 packages from organizations like the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee, the Red Cross, and individual donations, among others, to support operations in central Vietnam in cities like Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi.

This is just part of Vietnam Airlines’ aid operations. The airline is expecting to fly more than 100 tons of cargo to support relief operations.

Vietnam Airlines, along with its affiliates, is receiving and transporting goods to Central Vietnam free of charge.

For passengers, Vietnam Airlines is also giving people to Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi one extra free bag in addition to their class of service baggage allowance. This will allow passengers to also fly with additional relief items or essential items.

Vietnam Airlines is expecting to fly over 10,000 pieces of luggage free of charge. This will help those who are bringing relief items to the region.

Central Vietnam is facing awful flooding

Devastating floods, some of the most severe in decades, according to CNN, have claimed over 100 lives and led to immense destruction. Over 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and over 691,000 cattle and poultry have either been killed or swept away. Hundreds of thousands of meters of roadways have also been damaged.

In addition to the flooding, landslides have also caused deaths and damage. However, Vietnam, which is no stranger to rain and typhoons, became overwhelmed after facing a particularly fierce set of storms.

Relief agencies rely on airlines to help transport goods and people. Another set of storms is, including a tropical storm, made its way to Vietnam this last weekend as well.

For the flag carrier of Vietnam, it was now time to step up and fly relief. After facing some operational disruptions due to the storm, the carrier became one lifeline to bring much-needed supplies to the region.

Airlines and aid flights

Over the last few months, aid flights have become common when it came to transporting medical supplies. However, airlines are no strangers when it comes to running aid and relief flights.

Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines partnered to send 20,000 pounds of aid on a brand new Boeing 787. Emirates has flown tens of thousands of kilograms of aid to Lebanon since a blast rocked Beirut.

Flag carriers, in particular, tend to step up when the country needs airlines to fly in (or fly out) people and supplies. Vietnam Airlines has used aircraft, like the ATR 72, to fly in aid.

The European Union will provide €1.3 million ($1.52 million) for critical humanitarian assistance to families affected by severe flooding that wreaked havoc across central Vietnam.

The aid will focus on addressing the urgent needs of the most affected people in central Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces, European External Action Service said in a press release.

""This contribution underlines our solidarity with the people of Vietnam, many of whom have suffered the loss of homes, livelihoods and belongings in the wake of the devastating floods,"" said Olivier Brouant, who oversees the EU’s humanitarian response in the Mekong region.

The funding includes the distribution of hygiene kits and other essential relief items while ensuring access to drinking water, sanitation facilities and the promotion of good hygiene practices. Cash transfers will also be provided, allowing people to buy food or items of their choice.

Female-headed households and people with disabilities will be given priority for humanitarian assistance.

The central region was bombarded by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that resulted in at least 130 deaths.

The historic flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated and livestock killed, damage the government claimed to be ""the worst in the past five years.""

Some countries and international organizations recently pledged immediate humanitarian relief to help central Vietnam overcome the consequences of deadly floods.

Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

South Korea pledged relief worth $300,000 while the U.S. has promised $100,000.

With central Vietnam yet to recover from the historic flooding, Storm Molave, the ninth storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Provinces on Wednesday, triggering heavy rains and strong winds for the central region.

Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri.

At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnam’s Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.

A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.

They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.

For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.

At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday.

Saudel is the eighth storm in the East Sea this year, and follows Linfa and Nangka earlier this month.

Over 3,700 UNFPA Dignity Kits worth $180,000 would be provided to the elderly in central Vietnam following a series of storms and tropical depressions that hit the region last year.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) representative in Vietnam, handed over 3,704 kits containing essential items to Bui Quang Huy, standing secretary of the HCMC Communist Youth Union, to support the elderly in three central Vietnam provinces afflicted by floods last year: Ha Tinh, Quang Tri and Quang Ngai at a Wednesday ceremony.

Dignity Kits are a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, mitigate the risk of gender-based violence, and respond to and protect the dignity of women and girls adversely affected by a crisis. Kits meant for the elderly contain items like hand towels, sweaters, socks, wet tissues, toothbrushes, soap, underwear, blankets, flashlights and whistles.

The handover was made possible via financial contributions from U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), according to a UNFPA press release.

The elderly are among the most vulnerable when natural disasters strike, according to UNFPA. During floods and landslides in central Vietnam last year, health facilities were hard hit, causing routine public health programs to be disrupted, it added. The elderly are at risk since they do not always get the care they need, and their vulnerabilities can become a serious challenge to survival and wellbeing, it stated.

Last year, central Vietnam was struck by a series of storms and tropical depressions, triggering heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Over 200 people were killed and property losses amounted to around VND30 trillion ($1.3 trillion). Hundreds of thousands of homes were either destroyed or damaged, affecting the lives of at least 7.7 million residents.

With Storm Molave set to make landfall in central Vietnam in the next few days, Vietnamese authorities are preparing to evacuate 1.2 million coast residents to safety.

At 1 p.m. Monday, the storm lay centered around 560 km east-northeast of Southwest Cay islet, with winds of 135 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

Over the next 24 hours, it will move west at 20-25 kph and gradually intensify. At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, it will be 280 km to the north of Southwest Cay with winds of up to 150 kph.

Mai Van Khiem, director of the national forecast center, said at a meeting Monday both the agency and its Japanese counterpart predict the rapidly moving storm would make landfall in central Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces.

The agencies forecast the storm would reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning, before making landfall in the coming hours.

On Wednesday morning, the storm's center would be around 200 km from the coast of Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh with a maximum wind speed of 135 kph, causing waves of up to 10 m.

Storm circulation combined with a cold spell would cause heavy rains on a large scale, and localities stretching over 1,000 km from Nghe An to Phu Yen will be battered by torrential downpours and strong winds from Tuesday until Thursday, with rainfall of between 200-400 mm.

Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh are told to brace for prolonged downpours until Saturday with total rainfall of up to 700 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Mountainous areas will be at high risk of landslides.

Mass evacuation

Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, said with Molave’s strength level, the committee is ready to evacuate over 1.2 million residents in seven central provinces Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

The region, home to popular ancient towns, beautiful beaches and world famous caves, has been bombarded by historic flooding and deadly landslides for the past three weeks, suffering damage government officials described as ""the worst in five years."" At least 130 people have been killed by floods and landslides between October 6 and 25.

Hoai urged provincial leaders to stay in contact with fishing boats, evacuate residents to safety, and make plans to limit storm damage.

There are still 65,000 fishing boats operating along the central coast, of which 45,000 have received official warnings.

""The storm is too strong,"" Hoai said, ordering localities to order boats to take shelter, ban residents from fishing activities, and close all public beaches by Tuesday night.

Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defense has called for the mobilization of more than 368,000 people - soldiers, members of the police force, and civilian volunteers, to assist residents in at-risk areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the meeting that localities must be on high alert and prepare their best flood prevention measures.

""If the storm comes as strong as forecast, damage from rains and floods will be extremely huge,"" Phuc said.

According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Storm Molave's strength is equivalent to Storm Damrey, which hit south central Vietnam in November 2017 and killed 106 people.

Hoang Tan Trong, watching over the family farm in Dong Hoi Town with his father and pregnant wife, witnessed floods tear through his home on the night of October 19. Dao, Trong’s wife, was sitting on their bed, suspended in the air thanks to four ropes connecting it to the roof. But with the walls damaged, the bed wobbled about two meters above ground, leaning to the side.

Seeing what happened, Trong's father, 64-year-old Hoang Tan Truong, immediately jumped into the water and tried securing the ropes, lest Dao fell into the water below.

""We can't just stay here and suffer like this. We need to find a safer house,"" Dao said. That night, Trong rented a motorboat and brought the whole family to the town center, about 2 km away.

Trong later returned to his old home to herd his 30 remaining chickens out of 200 into tree branches to avoid the flood. His three dogs were given to a relative the next day for safe keeping.

""This is the most severe flood since my birth,"" Trong, 44, remarked.

Since October 6, heavy rains have inundated the lowlands of Quang Binh. While not suffering fatal landslides like Thua Thien-Hue or Quang Tri provinces, Quang Binh has been the most severely flooded.

The October 19 flood managed to submerge thousands of houses, making even the most hardy residents shudder in fear.

From 1 a.m. on October 16 to 5 p.m. October 20, Quang Binh recorded rainfall of up to 1,380 mm in certain areas. The most heavily flooded was in Le Thuy District, with over 32,000 houses swamped. Throughout the entire province, around 105,000 homes have been similarly affected.

Tran Cong Thuat, chairman of Quang Binh, said: ""Floods this year have eclipsed the record peak in 1979 by up to 0.98 m."" The historic flood peak was recorded on Kien Giang River at 3.91 m. This year, however, the peak remained at 4.89 m for several consecutive days.

""The flood came at night so it was very powerful. The peak was too high, catching certain areas off guard,"" Thuat added. On the night of October 19 alone, thousands of people throughout Quang Binh have called out for help via their phones or social media.

""We still lack boats, but we are doing our best to help alleviate the suffering,"" he said.

Floods in Quang Binh this year not only set new records, but also receded very slowly. By the morning of October 21, traffic across the province remained crippled due to several flooded locations. Over the last fews days, people have confined themselves to their homes, with many of their pets, livestock and vegetables perishing in the water.

It would take a long time for Quang Binh to recover following this historic flood, according to Thuat. As Storm Saudel approaches Vietnamese shores, the province has prepared plans to support people with necessities and food for the coming days.

""During the first days when flood levels rose quickly, we were met with many challenges. But now that the water’s receding, we’ve been surveying heavily flooded and isolated houses so we could perform rescue operations and provide supplies more easily. We would not allow any family to be abandoned amid the flooding,"" said Thuat.

As of Thursday afternoon, at least 10 people have died in Quang Binh due to floods.

The field was the primary source of income to feed his family of three.

As he inspected the damage done by the prolonged flooding central Vietnam has had to suffer, he noted that some paddy sections had been swept away by floodwaters, while his tapioca field, cultivated over the past 10 months, was buried in rubble.

""We don’t know what to plant to make a living,"" said Rao, a 46-year-old resident of Huong Son Commune in Quang Tri’s Huong Hoa District. Two wet bags of grains they have are all that’s left for the next six months, he said, adding that on sunny days, he would put them out to dry.

The Huong Son Commune has over 192 ha of paddy fields, but around 90 ha were buried under rocks and wood rotting deposited by the floods, rendering them unusable and irrecoverable. Le Trong Tuong, chairman of the Huong Son People’s Committee, said residents were facing food shortages in the future for people.

In Quang Binh Province’s Bo Trach District, Le Xuan Uyen, 56, sees his field buried under mud and soil a meter deep, meaning he cannot plant new saplings for the winter-spring season without putting in significant time and efforts to clean the place up.

Worse still, the soil the fields are buried under has toxic properties that would kill paddy if they’re planted, he said. ""We are worried because we have missed the season for planting, and we don’t know what to plant anyway.""

The Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences said the top soil layer that covers several areas in Bo Trach District is actually heavy clay layers, which would make it difficult for cultivation if left as it is. Farmers should switch to different plants to adapt to the new layers, the academy has suggested.

Around 1,650 ha of fields in Quang Tri were inundated in the past month. Provincial authorities are now cooperating with the people to salvage the buried fields to prepare for the winter-spring planting season in just a month, said Ha Si Dong, deputy chairman of Quang Tri. But as the fields are large, ample time, it would take a lot of people and equipment to complete the job, he added.

Recovery efforts should be completed by mid-December so new saplings can be planted for the winter-spring season on time, Quang Tri authorities have said.

The chance of such events could increase five to 10 times by 2050, resulting in economic and infrastructural damage that could cost billions of dollars, according to a McKinsey report, dated April. The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.

Ho Chi Minh City, a historic flood area located some 1,000 miles south of the capital Hanoi, contributes about a quarter of the Vietnam’s gross domestic product. While the metropolis can cope with flood risks today that could hit 23% of its area, further urbanization is raising the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels. Those could cause about $8.4 billion of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact, McKinsey said.

The city still has time to adapt to avoid such risks by having better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas, McKinsey said. Investments and fund-raising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.

Emergency response teams were dispatched to the northeast on Saturday where more than 340,000 people have been affected by severe flooding following Vamco, which killed at least 53 people across the country, disaster agencies said.

Twenty of the deaths were recorded in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya, which have become the focus of rescue efforts.

Hundreds of people were trapped on rooftops in the hardest-hit areas along the Cagayan river with rescuers unable to reach them because of strong currents, said the spokesman for the regional Office of Civil Defense.

Vast swaths of the region were underwater in what officials have described as the worst flooding in living memory. The release of water from the Magat dam has exacerbated the impact.","Sat, 14 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-14T085834Z_1080446966_RC2W2K9H4DAS_RTRMADP_3_ASIA-STORM-PHILIPPINES.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'red', 'flee', 'severe', 'provinces', 'nears', 'homes', 'typhoon', 'central', 'flooding', 'thousands', 'vamco', 'cagayan']", ,flood
73,73,FL-2019-000092-VNM,Vietnam suffers through a “new normal” of extreme weather events - WSWS,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/28/viet-o28.html,"Vietnam is being pummelled by ongoing tropical storms causing major flooding and landslides in its central regions. As of Monday morning, the death toll had reached 130 with 18 people missing, according to government figures. This was up from 119 fatalities on Saturday, with most occurring in the central provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam.

Close to a million people have been severely affected, with many in desperate need of shelter, food, clean drinking water and income support. According to the UN, as of last Thursday, at least 178,000 homes were currently under water.

Flood levels eclipsed the 1979 record by 0.98 metres, hovering at 4.89 metres for several consecutive days in the province of Quang Binh. The amount of rain that fell between October 6 and 13 was two to six times higher than normal in some regions.

Most of the hardest hit have been poor farmers. Agricultural damage has been extensive, with 1,500 hectares of rice fields and 7,800 hectares of other crops being either flooded or damaged. Close to a million head of cattle and poultry have also been killed or swept away.

The government has stated that the damage caused has been “the worst in five years”. Several highways and local roads are blocked with rocks the size of cars, hampering rescue efforts.

About a third of deaths have been of military personnel.

In one instance, a team of 21 rescuers, most of them military officers, was sent to verify reports of 17 workers buried by a landslide at the Rao Trang 3 hydroelectric plant deep in the jungle. The workers were reportedly asleep when they were buried on October 12.

The rescue team stopped at a ranger station for the night and were buried in a rocky landslide. Of the 13 deaths, 11 were from the military. Only four of the 17 workers at the dam have been recovered thus far and authorities have deployed more rescue forces to the scene.

Days later, a barracks in Quang Tri was consumed by a mudslide in the early hours of the morning, killing 20 military personnel, likely the largest number of military casualties suffered in a period of peace, according to officials.

Scientists believe flooding in central Vietnam is the result of a “new normal” of weather patterns driven by complex processes.

On an international scale, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDDR) reported recently a 75 percent increase in natural disasters in the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, there were 4,212 major natural disasters. Between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded costing 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy USD$2.97 trillion.

The increase is largely attributed to climate related events such as floods, droughts and storms.

Speaking at a virtual conference, UNDDR chief Mami Mizutori accused governments of abandoning effective measures to deal with climate change, “It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction,” he said, “despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.”

In the Asia Pacific, the cyclical la Nina phenomenon is intensifying storms in the region, and is expected to continue until early next year. Cambodia has reported 39 deaths from flooding, with hundreds of thousands affected and 46,216 people evacuated to safer ground.

Vietnam has been hit by three tropical storms and a depression in the month of October. Typhoon Mojave, at present travelling westwards over the Philippines, is also likely to impact in the weeks ahead. It is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds of 130 kilometres per hour. About 9,000 people in the Philippines have fled their homes.

Professor of human ecology at Rutgers University, Pamela McElwee, told the New York Times that the sheer volume of rainfall in Vietnam was, “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it shattered the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in its central regions by the end of the century.

She also stated that the construction of hydroelectric dams and poor mountain roads had weakened the soil. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go.”

Christopher Rassi, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross, warned of the economic fallout: “We are seeing a deadly double disaster unfold before our eyes as these floods compound the difficulties caused by COVID-19. These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.”

The Vietnamese economy relies heavily on its tourism industry which has been drastically cut back during the pandemic. Borders were virtually closed in late March. Apart from an outbreak in Da Nang Hospital in late July, total cases have been kept low and contained at under 1,500, with 40 deaths.

The Asian Development Bank assessed in September that Vietnam’s economy would grow at around 1.8 percent in 2020, its slowest rate in 35 years and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.

The Stalinist regime in Vietnam has ruthlessly pursued a policy of capitalist restoration for decades. According to its own estimates, economic inequality is worsening. Between 2014 and 2018 the GINI index of Vietnam, a standard measure of income inequality, was 0.4 [where 0 represents absolute equality and 1 absolute inequality]. The figure is regarded as a tipping point with higher numbers frequently associated with social unrest and political instability.

Out of fear of social unrest, the regime has sought to suppress criticism from workers and the peasantry. According to the UN, hundreds of people have been interrogated so far over COVID-19 related Facebook posts. In the lead up to the congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in January 2021, the government has begun a campaign of censoring dissident and left-wing publications.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wsws.org/asset/64544160-f1d1-4d85-aecd-24bd939be1eb?rendition=image1280,"['vietnam', 'normal', 'storms', 'quang', 'according', 'extreme', 'workers', 'central', 'events', 'military', 'million', 'rescue', 'suffers', 'weather']", ,flood
74,74,FL-2019-000092-VNM,Flood relief necessary but post-disaster reconstruction vital - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/perspectives/flood-relief-necessary-but-post-disaster-reconstruction-vital-4182755.html,"Nguyen Thi Vung had to keep an eye on her sow for five days straight during the flooding in Thua Thien-Hue Province and lost three kilograms consequently.

Phan Duong

She was worried the 80-kilogram beast might be swept away or escape.

The resident of a village in Quang Dien District explains: ""Pigs can be really destructive if they escape. I did not dare sleep at night.""

Central Vietnam has been hit hard by tropical storms, torrential downpours, floods, and landslides for three weeks now.

The woman, who is in her 50s, took the sow and its litter of four to her brother’s house since it is on higher ground than hers, and never left them alone for a moment.

With a stick in one hand, she made sure the sow behaved. But the animal was spooked and attacked her more than once. Vung has a wound on her right thigh from a bite.

But importantly she has been able to safeguard the family’s most valuable asset.

She had spent a year raising the pig and saw it give birth to four piglets. If she manages to keep all of them safe, and the animal continues to have more litters, she can solve the problem she has been facing: that of paying her daughter’s tuition.

Her daughter is a freshman at a college in Da Nang City, and Vung has to send her VND1.5 million ($65) every month for living expenses besides paying VND6 million a year tuition for the two-year course.

Since her daughter was in 10th grade Vung had been telling her, ""I think you should drop out of school and work; I am not able to afford your schooling.""

But the girl would plead: ""Please let me stay in school so that I can have a proper career in future and build us a better life.""

Vung relented.

Their family consists of just the two of them. Vung does the best she can, growing rice on a 750-square-meter farm and doing agricultural labor and menial jobs for others.

Every year in October she travels to the Central Highlands to harvest coffee and cassava for farmers there. But this year she has been stuck in floods described as the worst in decades.

Earlier this year, along with many other localities across Vietnam, Thua Thien-Hue was also hit by the African swine fever, an incurable and fatal disease in pigs.

Vung worked for other farmers, burying pigs killed by the disease.

""God blessed me and kept my sow healthy.""

Now she has once again kept the sow safe through the floods.

But she has not been able to save a small flock of chickens and a cassava crop that had almost been ready for harvest.

All hopes for the mother and daughter’s future now rest on that one sow.

When meeting us in the courtyard of a government office to receive a donation of essential items from readers of VnExpress through FPT’s Hope Foundation, Vung cannot hold back her tears, and tells us all about her pigs and chickens.

The floodwaters have now started receding in several parts of the central region, including her Quang Dien District, and people are trying to pick up the pieces again after two weeks of living with the floods.

Vung is still at her brother’s house with her pigs since it is still not safe to return home.

Her 20-year-old single-storied house has deteriorated and its walls are cracked, and now after the floods Vung is afraid they could collapse at any time.

""More storms are coming, so I’d better stay here.""

Storm Molave is expected to reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning.

In Phong Dien, another district in Thua Thien Hue, we met Le Thi Sinh, 51.

Three years ago her son passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children. Her daughter-in-law works elsewhere and sends home money for Sinh and her husband to raise the two kids, one of whom is learning to talk while the other is in kindergarten. Sinh’s husband has a number of health problems and so she is the family’s breadwinner.

No one had foreseen such severe flooding. Like many other locals, Sinh and her husband did not have enough time to prepare for the disaster.

When the waters came, they packed off the children, belongings and grain to the first floor. They hung their six piglets, each weighing around 15 kg, from the ceiling, but one was swept away and another was killed.

The floods also swept away their flock of 200 chickens and destroyed their cassava and sweet potato crops.

Her grandchildren cried and asked for their mother. Then they asked for their father after seeing a man next door casting a net to catch fish. There was nothing Sinh could do except shed tears of grief.

Sinh still has a litany of problems to worry about like a loan she took to buy supplements for the pigs and chickens and buying formula and other essential items for the children.

She hopes to get relief from the authorities and plant a new crops and resume her livestock and poultry farming.

In the district’s Phong Xuan Commune, locals grow trees and paddy. In May Storm Noul destroyed grown paperbark and acacia trees, and now the floods have destroyed all the young ones.

In Phong Hien Commune 2,000 families have been living in the floodwaters. They have lost 250 hectares (620 acres) of cassava, 27 hectares of glittering chive, 25 hectares of sugarcane, and 15 hectares of other crops.

""There is nothing left,"" Nguyen Si Hiep, chairman of the commune Fatherland Front Committee, said. The front, an overarching public organization, is tasked with ""promoting national solidarity and unity of mind in political and spiritual matters,"" and conducting many of the government's social programs, especially those to mitigate poverty.

Hiep said the commune administration is advising farmers to switch to short-term crops after the floods recede so that they could earn some income before the new year arrives.

There is way too much attention on flood relief though it is just one part of the big picture when a natural disaster strikes. Reconstructing the livelihoods and rebuilding the lives of millions of people in the central region is now a serious challenge in what has already been a disastrous year.

A World Bank report released last week estimated that 12 million people living in coastal provinces face the threat of severe flooding and over 35 percent of people live on eroding coastlines.

Each year an average of $852 million and 316,000 jobs in key economic sectors are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding.

In this context, I reviewed the concept of social capital. Economists treat social capital as an important resource of the nation. It is understood as the two-way and multidimensional cooperation between members of the society, the power of connection between people in a community, a country, and transactions based on mutual trust that bring mutual benefit.

The fact that Vietnamese everywhere are pitching in to provide succor to people in the central region these days is an expression of social capital in Vietnam.

The World Bank believes that social capital helps the community coordinate voluntarily and effectively because it is based on a common goal to help solve collective problems. The natural disasters in the central region are a collective problem. To address this problem, the government can collaborate with the community and make use of the social capital that has been on display in recent days.

Dealing with the aftermath of the floods gives the government an opportunity to tweak its policies. Authorities should make appropriate decisions to remove unnecessary barriers, paving the way for an increase in tolerance and trust, which would help heal the wounds caused by natural disasters.

A timely and substantial reconstruction plan for people like Vung and Sinh will help soothe the gaping economic wounds suffered by the central region, sustain growth and lead to a sustainable development vision for the country.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

VnExpress’s Hope Foundation is soliciting emergency support for people in central Vietnam, whose lives have been impacted by severe floods and landslides since earlier this month.

When the floodwaters rose on October 12 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Hoang Thi Phuong, a textile worker in Phong Dien District, went into labor.

Her husband tried to take her to hospital, but their motorbike could not cross a flooded section of National Highway 1A. In desperation, he asked a person with a boat to take his wife to the other side.

But the boat capsized just 20 meters from safety. Both Phuong and her unborn baby died.

""I killed you,"" her husband sobbed inconsolably, down on his knees in front of the raging floods that had snatched away his loved ones.

They are not the only victims of the tragedy that has befallen central Vietnam in the last two weeks. Dozens of others, including at least two hydropower plant workers and 13 members of a rescue team, lost their lives to landslides in Thua Thien-Hue.

In the last 10 days nonstop rain and floods have submerged entire regions under a sea of water and triggered massive landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of thousands of houses have been engulfed, and the death toll has been rising relentlessly.

Thousands of families face food and water shortages, and the floods do not seem likely to recede any time soon.

As fighters on the frontlines in a battle against nature, soldiers, doctors, rescuers, and thousands of others have had to take on the harsh and unrelenting elements.

What they need right now are boats, medicines, food, clothes, rescue equipment, and other supplies.

The Hope Foundation by VnExpress and FPT is calling for emergency support for millions of people in central Vietnam. We are soliciting help from every person and every section of the community, and trying to find the quickest way to help those in need right now.

Highlights

From October 6th, the Central region observed prolonged heavy rains that caused severe and widespread flooding and landslides. Water levels have risen rapidly flooding large areas in the provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh. Hieu river (Quang Tri) and Bo river (Hue) reached historical high flood levels.

In response, the Government of Viet Nam: i) Conducted daily meetings of the Central Steering Committee of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (CCNDPC); ii) Sent missions to the affected provinces to provide concrete guidance, support and coordination; iii) Released a call for emergency relief and support, sent to international organizations; iv) Is planning to hold a meeting convening the Disaster Risk Reduction Partnership, on Monday 19th to discuss and coordinate international support.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539933-Flash%20Update%20No.%201%20-%20Viet%20Nam%20Floods.png?itok=aGT5G35x,"['storms', 'update', 'nam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'quang', 'viet', 'coordinator', 'provinces', 'issued', 'office', 'floods', 'river', 'sent', 'resident', 'support', 'tri']", ,none
78,78,FL-2019-000092-VNM,One million swamped by deadly floods as Viet Nam faces another major storm - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/one-million-swamped-deadly-floods-viet-nam-faces-another-major-storm,"Kuala Lumpur/Hanoi/Geneva, October 14, 2020 – Close to a million people have been severely affected by prolonged flooding in central Viet Nam as the country faces another major tropical storm and further dangerous floods.

Red Cross holds grave fears that deadly floods, which have submerged the country’s central provinces over recent days, will worsen as tropical storm Nangka makes landfall today, bringing destructive winds and dumping more rain on hard hit communities.

Since the floods began in early October, at least 28 people have been killed, more than 200,000 homes flooded and an estimated 84,000 hectares of crops damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people – many cut off by the floodwater – are now in desperate need of emergency relief.

As part of a coordinated relief effort, Viet Nam Red Cross staff and volunteers have been accessing isolated communities by boat to provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and other much needed supplies. More relief supplies are urgently being brought in from other parts of the country.

Mr Hoa Nguyen, Deputy Director of External Relations and Development, Viet Nam Red Cross, said: “Our volunteers and staff have been working in the affected areas since the floods began, providing relief supplies to thousands of people, but we need to reach many more as the rain continues and floods worsen. Every day we hear of more families who have lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods.”

Hung Ha Nguyen, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator said: “These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods.”

“Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities, especially on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need to help ensure families receive the relief they need in the coming days and weeks,” Mr Hung Ha said.

So far, at least 235 people have died or been listed missing after the floods and landslides triggered by storms and heavy rains in central Vietnam last month, the government informed the National Assembly Tuesday.

Among the casualties were 35 military officers and soldiers of two different military teams sent on search and rescue missions after landslides hit several districts in the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri.

The region suffered historic flooding, with the peak time falling between October 12 and 19. Floodwaters inundated the homes of 317,000 families with 1.2 million members from Nghe An to Quang Nam, with many areas being flooded for nearly two weeks.

Over 200,000 houses were seriously damaged. Many public construction projects also suffered heavy damage and roads were heavily eroded.

Of the total damage of VND17 trillion, VND10 trillion ($430.16 million) was caused by Molave, one of the most powerful storms to hit Vietnam, the government said.

The storm made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28, causing heavy rains and deadly landslides in the central region.

Earlier, the government granted over VND1 trillion, over 11,500 tons of rice and other essential items in relief support for the worst-hit central provinces.

Not over

The government said it would continue to mobilize all forces to search for the victims buried in several landslides and fishermen missing at sea. Among the missing are 12 hydropower plant workers in Thua Thien-Hue Province who were hit by a landslide on October 12, 19 residents in Quang Nam Province hit by two landslides as an impact of Storm Molave last week, and 23 fishermen from Binh Dinh Province whose boats sank in rough sea as the storm was near.

Priority in relief support will be given to those in worst-hit localities and isolated areas and to quickly repairing infrastructure and public construction works damaged by storms and floods, the parliament was told.

The government is also joining forces with local authorities to evacuate residents from high risk areas as storm Goni, the 10th storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, heads towards south-central Vietnam.

International forecasting agencies expect the storm to directly affect the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.

Natural disasters, predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

80,80,FL-2019-000092-VNM,Anguish as Mekong Delta’s annual floods continue to dry up - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/anguish-as-mekong-delta-s-annual-floods-continue-to-dry-up-4171382.html,"It is time for the annual floods in the Mekong Delta, but the flooding season these days is more a cherished memory than a practical phenomenon.

One day in mid-September Cao Van Bi, 50, was rowing a boat with his wife across a paddy field that had been partially flooded.

All over the field, in Phu Hoi, a rural commune in An Giang Province’s An Phu District, traps had been set up to catch fish.

That morning the catch was 2.5 kilograms of carp and five kilograms of other fish and shrimp.

In previous years, during the flooding season, Bi would have got dozens of kilograms worth of fish every day, but these days it never exceeds 10 kg.

Cao Van Bi and his wife collect the fish they catch in one morning in mid September, 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Nam.

The reason is that the annual flooding of Vietnam's Mekong Delta from the upstream Mekong before reaching the sea no longer occurs.

Not far away, in Vinh Hoi Dong Commune in An Phu, Phan Van Lang, 54, was standing in front of his house.

Since they live in an area hit by annual flooding, Lang and his neighbors have their houses built well above the ground. His house is nearly three meters in the air with a flight of the stairs leading up from the road. In 2000, for instance, the floodwater almost reached the house. But ever since the flooding levels have kept decreasing.

Pointing at the road in front of his house, he says the entire road would have been under one meter of water at this time of the year but this year, the water has not even reached the road.

Hung Dien Commune in Long An Province's Tan Hung District, 80 km (50 miles) away, has been witnessing the clearest change.

In the past its paddy fields would have waters reaching waist high and be filled with water lilies and boats would be the only means of getting around.

That scene now exists only in the memories of seniors.

Bay De, 53, who has been fishing for more than 30 years, recalls floods when catching up to 200 kg of various kinds of fish every day and earning a million dong ($40) was a ""piece of cake.""

For several weeks now he has not caught any fish. He spends almost every day drinking tea and chatting with neighbors in his thatched house.

Fifty kilometers away, Tran Van Thanh, 58, of Tan Lap Commune in Moc Hoa District is fixing traps for catching crabs.

He has been doing this for dozens of years, a job that has ensured a decent livelihood, but that has changed.

""I used to set up more than 600 traps during the flood season, but only a few tens of them these days because the flood waters are way too low and there are no crabs to catch.""

In the neighboring province of Dong Thap, Nguyen Van Phuong, 42, of Tan Thanh A Commune in Tan Hong District is watching the news on TV for possible information about the floods, something he has been looking forward to for several weeks now.

He has an eight-hectare rice field and has been waiting for the floods to come so that he could start sowing the winter-spring crop.

There was heavy rain a few weeks ago, and water had filled up canals and then reached the fields. Phuong, thinking the floods had finally arrived, hired people to till the soil.

But soon a scorching sun replaced the rains and water dropped, leaving the field dry and cracked once again.

He says: ""I had spent VND750,000 ($32.44) per hectare, but that has been a wasted effort. Now I have to wait for the floodwaters to come and do that all over again.""

In his neighborhood, farmers are now worried that if the floods do not come or are low, they would have to shell out money to pump water from canals into their fields.

Rice farmers in the delta have for generations depended on the floodwaters to come and inundate their fields before sow seeds directly.

The Plain of Reeds, a wetland straddling Long An and Dong Thap provinces, produces more than two million tons of rice a year.

The floods usually start coming in late July or early August and remain until November or even later to bless the region with extraordinary fertility as they typically deposit silt from upstream areas.

When they do not come or arrive late, cropping and fishing activities are disrupted.

For several years now they have been late or deficient, and experts have been blaming this on climate change and the construction of a series of dams in the upstream area.

According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, this year’s floodwater level in the delta will be only 55 percent of the long-term average, which translates into a shortfall of 130 billion cubic meters.

It will be 15 percent lower than last year’s level and the lowest in a decade, it has warned.

Late last year the highest water levels in the upstream areas of the delta were 1.12-2 meters lower than the long-term average and 1-1.65 meters lower than in the previous year.

The delta suffered the worst salinity levels and resultant freshwater shortage in 100 years but meteorologists warn things could get worse.

Tran Tan Tai, deputy head of the agriculture department of Long An’s Tan Hung District, says the water level in his hometown is currently 1.4 meters, or 80 centimeters lower than a year ago.

""If there are no floods, the fields will lack silt, and pathogens and wild grass seeds will not be washed away, and farmers will have to spend more on pesticide and fertilizers.""

Meteorologists expect the floods to come around the middle of this month, stay low and ebb away quickly.

Those were the days

Early one morning in late September, Muoi, 64, of Tan Lap rides a motorbike to a wet market two kilometers away from home. He returned after a while with a bag of barb.

""All my life I have seen fish all over the place every time it is the flooding season, but now I have to go buy them... Isn’t it weird?""

Not far from his home a neighbor had set up a lift net the previous night, but until around noon the next day, when Muoi returned from the market, it had only around two kilograms of fish.

Muoi can never forget what it was like one or two decades ago: Every year when the flood season arrived, water would be everywhere, covering the fields and even the streets. People would be rowing boats, picking water lilies and river hemp, both used to make specialty dishes of the region.

In the water, there would be so much fish that anyone could become a fisherman without having to learn any skills.

""Back then people did not weigh fish in kilograms but in a unit of around 20 kilograms. Normally, in one night a family could catch at least five to seven of that unit. Some would even feed the fish to their pigs.""

In years of heavy flooding fish moving down stream into the delta would breed along the way, and it would be extremely rare to see a field or waterway without fish in it.

Fishermen would enlarge the holes in their net to only catch adult fish, leaving the young ones untouched.

When the floods retreated, mud, algae and water lilies would be left in the paddy fields. The fields mud would be silt while the algae and flowers served as organic fertilizers, leaving the fields with all the nutrition they needed.

Besides, the floods would wash away the pathogens and wild grass seeds, and it was not common for farmers to use fertilizers or pesticides.

A kilometer away from Muoi’s place, Danh Van Minh, 62, asks his son to take him by motorbike to a house nearby. The house stands along a canal and in front is a concrete road around three meters wide.

""This used to be a small dirt road, and every year during this season it would be two or three meters under water,"" Minh says.

""The house used to be just a hut beside which I would anchor my boat after fishing.""

Minh’s life has been filled with tragedy. He lost his first wife and two of his children during two different flood seasons.

In the middle of the 1991 season his wife had twins, but both died at birth due to lack of medical care in that rural area.

Worse still the floods covered every inch of land that they could not find a place to bury the children. All he could do was put their bodies in a coffin, stick a bamboo pole in the water and hang the coffin up that.

Only a month after they passed away could he give them a proper burial.

Five years after they lost the twins, Minh’s wife suddenly fell sick and died. Once again he could not bury her immediately, and had to leave her body inside a coffin on the family boat and leave it anchored next to the hut.

In the past 20 years the delta has witnessed several floods that left a significant impact on its residents, especially in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2011.

The 2000 floods were the most severe in 70 years, with the water rising to 4.78 meters. They claimed 481 lives and caused losses of nearly VND4 trillion.

As told by Le Thanh Tam, party chief of Long An Province in 1999-2005, 20 years ago and further, the Plain of Reeds had heavy floods almost every year.

The region had not yet got an embankment system, and every time it flooded there was no way to tell where the road was and where the canal was. The only way people could move around was by boat.

""Back then we always had fish, shrimps and crabs in abundance, but we would lose lives every year, and of children in most cases.

""When the floods retreated, we had to expend a lot of effort to rebuild houses and roads.""

But a 2017 study by the Mekong River Commission estimated that the flooding provides $8-10 billion in annual economic benefits while causing losses of just $60-70 million.

The Mekong River flows through six countries, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before reaching the sea.

Many parts of the Mekong Delta were formed by sedimentation over eons.

When the Vietnamese expanded their nation to the south, they began to conquer the delta in the 18th century. For generations, no other place in the nation could compare with it as a agriculture and aquaculture hub.

In his book ‘Last days of the Mighty Mekong’ published in February last year, Brian Eyler, director of the Asia Program at U.S. think tank Stimson Center, writes: ""For the past 3,000 years, the Mekong carried about 150 million tons of sediment in its system to the delta each year.""

Without the sedimentation, the delta’s land would fall apart under natural conditions, which are worsened by intense groundwater extraction and sea level rise, he says.

He strongly condemns China’s dam building in the upstream areas of the Mekong for holding back floodwaters and, along with them, sediments.

Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent researcher into the ecology of the Mekong Delta, says the main cause of the low floods this year is the El Nino phenomenon that lasted from the year’s beginning to the end of August, resulting in scanty rain fall in the region.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the rainy season arrived late last year and was shorter than usual, with the result that rainfall was 8 percent below normal at 1,240 mm.

Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of Can Tho University’s Research Institute of Climate Change, says the calamity faced by the delta cannot be blamed just on nature or Chinese dams.

""Sea levels rise and the Earth gets warmer. Yes. But that happens just a little each year and it needs a long period for dramatic changes. It is humans who have accelerated that process.""

He cites one example of human action that changed the delta’s hydrological profile. Ever since the delta was formed, it has had several low-lying areas like the Long Xuyen quadrilateral in Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and Can Tho City and the Plain of Reeds that worked as natural reservoirs to store the seasonal floodwaters, he explains.

For generations farmers did not use them for cultivation, but due to the wars, the nation had to consider food security, and built embankments to keep the seasonal floodwaters from flowing into them and directed the water toward the sea, he says.

""Now in peace time, we still have the mindset of growing as much rice as we can, and many have treated the seasonal floods as a disaster for their paddy fields while in fact it is a blessing.

""With that thinking, many have continued to keep out the floods, going against nature, thus intensifying the lack of water once it took hold in the region.""

Minh, who has been a poor farmer his entire life and is haunted by a tragic past related to the floods, does not care much for the explanations experts like Tuan have to offer.

After his wife’s death, he took his son to another village, remarried and built a new life.

He now owns a 6,000 sq.m rice field and both his home and field are surrounded by embankments, allowing him and others in his neighborhood to go against nature and cultivate three instead of just two rice crops as in the past.

The field does not have any time to recover, and instead of getting floodwaters that wash it clean and deposit sediments, it has to do with plant protection chemicals instead.

With this method of growing rice, farmers remain mired in poverty since they have to spend money on fertilizers and pesticides for every crop and also lose out on an abundant source of fish, shrimp and crab and the plants that always grow in the flood season.

""My children and grandchildren have all taken turns to leave,"" Minh says, reflecting the trend of delta dwellers abandoning their hometown for Ho Chi Minh City and other industrial areas, where they work in factories or the service sector.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/05/lu-dong-thap-muoi-2300-1601345-2309-7479-1601885014_1200x0.jpg,"['continue', 'annual', 'field', 'water', 'dry', 'flooding', 'floods', 'delta', 'anguish', 'mekong', 'fields', 'season', 'away', 'fish', 'deltas']", ,flood

Highways in the provinces have also been severely damaged, with the total cost of repairs estimated at around VND 355 billion, state media said, citing figures provided by the Directorate of Roads of Vietnam on Oct. 21.

Also on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung and deputies of Vietnam’s National Assembly welcomed efforts by Vietnamese pop star Thuy Tien to collect more than VND 100 billion (U.S. $15,316,811) for relief work in flood-hit Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue.

Large-scale fundraising is normally restricted by law to state organizations or social associations to reduce the risk of personal gain, with penalties prescribed for violations. But National Assembly deputy Le Thanh Vanh voiced confidence in the work of Thuy Tien and her staff.

“They are ready to take responsibility before the sponsors who donated the funds,” Vanh said, quoted on Oct. 21 in state media reports. “I am sure they will be completely transparent,” he said.

Relief teams have poured for the last few days into central regions hit by floods and landslides that have destroyed roads and buried workers at a hydropower plant and soldiers at a military barracks, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told state media on Wednesday.

Many areas have already received help, while others remain cut off because of damaged roads, Dung said, calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to send more teams to reach remote areas and give further support to those already helped.

34 now killed in Cambodia

Relief work meanwhile continues in Cambodia, where 34 people have now been killed by floods to date, with Prime Minister Hun Sen urging local authorities to guard damaged homes to prevent looting and calling on banks and other lending institutions to delay or reduce payments owed to them by villagers impoverished by the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 has hit us hard for the last 10 months, and now we are facing floods that are destroying us,” Hun Sen said.

“We have not concluded our damage assessments yet. For now, we are just working to rescue people and take them to safer areas,” he said.

Around 10,000 families have already been safely evacuated from flood-hit areas, Cambodian media sources say.

Speaking to RFA, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha said that flood waters are now receding in several provinces, including Oddor Meanchey, Pursat, Takeo, Pailin, Kampong Speu, Stung Treng, and the two hardest-hit provinces of Banteay Meahchey and Battambang.

The 34 flood deaths reported so far reflect the inability of central government and local authorities to deal effectively with the disaster, said Kean Ponlok, secretary general of the Cambodia Intellectual Students Alliance.

“The authorities must look into the causes of these deaths and hold themselves responsible,” he said, adding that because of corruption in Cambodia, he is not convinced that all donations handed over to the government will be spent on victims of the floods.

Banteay Meanchey villager Nay Thoeun said she has now lost her home and job because of the floods and is debt after borrowing money from a bank to buy medicine to treat the tuberculosis to which she was exposed in her family.

“I am very worried. I’m living now under a shelter on a hill, but the water is still rising here, and I’m afraid of [venomous insects].”

“I’m urgently calling for aid to be delivered to this hill. There are many poor families here,” she said.

Flood begins to recede in Laos

In Laos, flood waters have begun to recede from eight districts in Savannakhet province, where 125 villages containing 5,134 families, or nearly 30,000 people, have been affected, Lao media sources say.

In the province’s Sepon district alone, 40 villages containing nearly a thousand households have been flooded, with many houses completely destroyed, sources said.

Sepon’s La Or and Vang Khot villages were hardest hit, with 44 houses swept away, and another 90 dwellings hit by fast-running floods and partly damaged, a district official said on Oct. 21.

“The district is still asking for help, but we will set up temporary refuges in the villages for people to live in,” the official said, adding that funds are being sought for building materials such as roofs and nails for the construction of temporary shelters.

Fast-rising water hit one village on Oct. 18 and swept away 28 or 29 houses, leaving nothing to come back to when villagers returned two days later, one villager said. “Now we have no place to stay in but the schools, and no one has any clothing. We are waiting to see how the authorities plan to handle this.”

“We are all in a very poor condition. We have no rice to eat, and all our rice fields are flooded. We will have to buy all the rice that we eat next year,” he said.

“The water is receding now, but the villagers’ houses are damaged beyond repair, and nothing can be restored. There is no thought of fixing them now,” a rescue team member said, adding that many residents of Sepon and other districts are still cut off because of damage to the roads.

Though Lao authorities had moved quickly to help victims of the floods, more help is needed, an NGO official said, asking that neither he nor his organization be named. “For a start, we urgently need dry food and drinking water, clothes, rice, and many other things, as so many houses have been swept away.”

“The authorities did go down to do everything they could, but there are just too many villagers to help,” he said.

Many residents in areas of Sepon and Phin districts are still out of reach, a Sepon district official said. “We are still unable to get to almost half of the areas affected by the floods because the roads have been cut off by landslides,” he said.

Losses in Savannakhet including houses damaged, livestock drowned, and paddy fields destroyed are still being calculated, the official Vientiane Times said on Oct. 21.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguy?n Thái H?p celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vu?t Lu C?ng Ð?ng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p, the bishop of Hà Tinh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghia, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Ngu?n N?y River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tinh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghia, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Ð?n.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_festaOK.JPG,"['tinh', 'h?p', 'centre', 'build', 'bishop', 'thái', 'hà', 'catholics', 'flood', 'work', 'nguy?n', 'local', 'community', 'paul', 'house', 'tiên', 'victims']", ,flood

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan donated US$400,000 on Friday (Oct. 23) to Vietnam in aid after the country suffered the severest floods and landslides in decades.

Richard Shih (???), Taiwan’s representative in Vietnam, said the Taiwanese business community in Vietnam, as well as non-governmental organizations from Taiwan, have mobilized themselves to send relief to the stricken areas in the country's central region. He said he hoped the victims will be able to reconstruct their homes and return to a normal life as soon as possible.

As of Friday, the series of floods and landslides have killed at least 114 people, and 20 people remain missing. Among those who lost their lives are dozens of military personnel who were deployed to search for those who had gone missing in previous disasters.

The Vietnamese military said it has suffered the most serious casualties in peacetime. In addition to the loss of lives, hundreds and thousands of houses were wiped out in central Vietnam, including Quang Tri and Thua Thien Huei provinces, and schools and other facilities have been forced to close.

Tran Quang Hoai, an official responsible for coordinating Vietnam’s rescue missions, accepted Taiwan's donation on behalf of the Vietnamese government at a ceremony on Friday. He remarked that the government is grateful for the generosity of the Taiwanese authorities and people, and that it will make the most appropriate arrangement for the donation so that relief and aid can be distributed to those in need soon, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

MOFA said via a statement that more than 320,000 Vietnamese migrant workers and new immigrants are living in Taiwan, and that the people of the two countries have been more than good partners. Taiwan looks forward to further strengthening bilateral collaboration to combat natural disasters in the future, it added.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/2020/AP/20201016/be8fe4b916764366af4b4d65ce1e386f.jpg,"['us400000', 'vietnam', 'donates', 'aid', 'taiwans', 'flood', 'suffered', 'oct', 'workers', 'central', 'taiwan', 'rescue', 'vietnamese', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

85,85,FL-2019-000092-VNM,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

The bodies of two people were recovered on Saturday evening, while one remains missing.

The Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Van Ban District reported that the sudden floods affected 25 households, with furniture, motorbikes and construction materials damaged.

Two houses were swept away and dozens of others were damaged.

Prime Minister Ph?m Minh Chính issued a dispatch asking localities to focus resources on dealing with the consequences of floods and heavy rain in the northern mountainous region since Friday.

In the dispatch to the people’s committees of the six northern mountainous provinces of Lai Chau, Yen Bai, Son La, Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang, the Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control, National Committee for Disaster Response and Search and Rescue, and relevant ministries and agencies, the PM extended his condolences to families of the victims, and asked the local authorities to help locals fix houses and clean the environment, and provide them with food and essential goods.

He also asked the localities to keep a close watch on developments of flooding and rain, and to review and assess the safety of homes, especially in areas at high risk of flash floods and landslides, while preparing forces, vehicles, and equipment to deal with any circumstances.

The media will continue to provide information on developments of the natural disaster, damage, and response efforts, according to the dispatch.

The recent, devastating floods highlight the fragility of the country's natural environment. Deforestation, expanded farming, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric dams are the main culprits. In four years, 7,300 hectares of forest have been lost. So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built with another 450 on their way.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) – Recent floods in Vietnam caused by typhoons and tropical storms have had a devastating impact in terms of lost human lives, environmental damage, and economic dislocations, highlighting the fragility of the Asian country's environment.

Frequent and violent weather events worry both environmentalists and the affected communities more and more.

According to Vietnam’s Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, the main factor is deforestation and the conversion of entire forests to farmland, timber harvesting, and the large dam and hydroelectric plant construction.

Among the most affected areas are the central coastal region and the central Highlands, scene of the recent devastations.

The General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control estimates that some 7,300 hectares of forest land were lost between 2016 and 2019, with an annual average of 1,800.

At the current rate of deforestation, if nothing is done to slow this down, the risk of floods and landslides will increase considerably, along with periods of drought and loss of mangroves.

Environmentalists and experts note that the life and survival of Highland communities are closely linked to local forests.

From the central part of the country to the Mekong River Delta in the south, forests play a leading role in regulating local ecosystems, biodiversity, water resources, and the climate of much of the country.

For Prof Nguy?n Ng?c Lung, forests are key to blocking winds, limiting soil erosion and containing the devastating force of storms. In addition, tree roots absorb excess water.

Deforestation contributes to climate change, global warming, drought, rising water levels, pollution, and famine.

In view of the situation, the General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, noting that the country has recently had to face between 10 and 15 floods.

The blame goes to extensive “legal and illegal” deforestation to expand farmland, harvest timber or build crucial hydro-electric plants to meet the country’s energy needs.

So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built and another 450 are in the planning phase with further devastating impact on the environment.

Some see these plants as ""water bombs"" ready to strike at the population. Their effects are visible in many parts of the country, including Da Lat, a city that is located about 1,500 metres above sea level and a major tourist destination, with its almost year-round cool and temperate climate.

Since 2012, the city has been hit by flooding with increasing frequency, to the extent that today, when rain is intense, many parts of the city and Lam Dong province ""end up submerged by water"".

Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc Thanh.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Vietnam has given $540,000 in immediate support to women and girls in six central provinces affected by flooding.

UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of hygiene items and maternal health equipment. It is also supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services.

The central region has suffered unprecedented flooding from prolonged downpours and successive typhoons since October 6, resulting in at least 230 people dead or missing. Storm Molave hit the region on October 28, reportedly one of the strongest in 20 years.

At least 5.5 million people in the region have been affected, including more than 1.3 million women of reproductive age, over 92,000 of them pregnant mothers, who need uninterrupted services for pregnancy and menstruation, UNFPA said.

According to joint rapid assessment led by UNFPA last week, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programs such as antenatal, delivery, post-natal care and family planning services have been disrupted.

As a result, local women are unable to manage their hygiene properly and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear needed to manage menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and places to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged, the organization explained.

On October 12, a 35-year-old pregnant mother living in Phong Dien District of Thua Thien-Hue Province died on her way to give birth.

She entered labor in the morning, with her husband hiring a boat to take her to a local medical center for delivery. However, the boat was upturned and she was swept away by floodwater.

Her husband and local residents tried to look for her, but failed because of the fast-flowing current. Her body was found in the afternoon.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA representative in Vietnam, said: ""When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousands of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable. Women do not need to die giving birth, and this must hold true even in emergencies.

The National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on Monday afternoon that the low pressure out in the north of the South China Sea (known in Vietnam as the East Sea) had strengthened into a typhoon internationally known as Nangka.

Nangka is forecast to make landfall in the north-central part of Vietnam on Wednesday, while the accompanying rains could cover the central region already battered by torrential downpours over the last few days.

The centre forecast that central provinces would face heavy rains ranging from 150 to 300mm on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control issued an urgent letter on Monday asking the bureau to closely supervise the development of the low pressure system and issue warnings to localities and ships.

Authorities also instructed boats and ships to find safe habour and to take measures to ensure the safety of local people and tourists on islands and in coastal areas.

The Foreign Ministry was also asked to contact countries and territories to ask for shelter for Vietnamese fishermen.

The ongoing downpour, exacerbated by Typhoon Linfa which hit the central region on Sunday morning before weakening to a low pressure area, destroyed a total of 382 houses and flooded 109,034 others, and damaged 108 sections of national highways and 8.6km of provincial highways.

The disaster caused big losses to agricultural production by destroying 584ha of rice, 3,879ha of vegetable, 2,141ha of aquaculture, whilst killing about 150,700 cattle and poultry.

In Danang, many communes were submerged by rising floods worsened by water discharged from hydropower reservoirs.

As of 7am on Monday morning, the communes of Hòa Phong, Hòa Nhon, Hòa Liên, Hòa Khuong, Hòa Châu and Hòa Ti?n were badly submerged, affecting the lives of 3,000 local households in 38 hamlets.

In the mountainous districts of Hoà Vang, Liên Chi?u and C?m L?, there was high risk of flash floods and landslides.

At present, 882 households in typhoon-affected areas have been moved to safer areas.

Meanwhile, people in the central province of Th?a Thiên-Hu? are entering their fifth day of flooding and heavy rain.

Rainfall of over 1,000mm flooded areas near the B? River, badly affecting to districts of Phong Ði?n and Qu?ng Ði?n, as well as Huong Trà Township.

Local people have been suffering from food shortages due to disrupted transport.

Hoàng Sinh, a resident of Phong Hi?n Commune, told Vietnam News Agency that his family’s food reserves were running due to the prolonged rain and flooding, and they were down to a few packs of instant noodles and rice.

Tr?n Ð?c Thi?n, chairman of Phong Hi?n Commune, said the local government was trying to reach local households to supply food, drink and medicine.

“The floods surged rapidly and people in low-lying areas could not keep up. Water spilled into their houses submerging them up to one metre,” said Tr?n Van Hoàn from Huong Trà Township.

“The whole family had to move to a neighbour's house. For several days, we only had instant noodles to survive,” said Hoàn.

“This is the worst flood since 2006. It has badly affected 70 per cent of local people,” said Ph?m Công Phu?c, vice chairman of Qu?ng Thái Commune.

The provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Rescue reported that as of 6pm on Sunday, three people had died, while seven were injured and another was missing.

Nineteen houses had, and 53,385 houses and 360ha of crops had been flooded.

More than 100km of coastline from Huong River across Huong Th? Commune and Huong Trà Township was severely damaged by erosion. About 300m of the dyke in Qu?ng Phú Commune, Qu?ng Ði?n District was also hit.

In Hu?, more than 50 per cent of roads in 27 wards and 2,560 houses were flooded as of Monday morning.

In Qu?ng Tr? Province, the flooding dramatically increased on Monday morning.

The downpour made the water in the Th?ch Hãn and Ô Lâu rivers reach alert levels.

The river water levels were forecast to continue rising today and next days.

To cope with the situation, Qu?ng Tr? authorities have asked the central Government to supply materials and rescue equipment, including two amphibious vehicles, 27 boats, rescue equipment and chemicals for disinfection.

The week-long rain killed six and injured two in the province, with a further six reported missing in the province.

Hue, Vietnam — Every day for the last four months, Duong Thi Mong has carried food, pots, dishes and other utensils on her shoulders to walk nearly 5 kilometers daily from her house to a nearby village, where she serves com hen (rice mixed with mussel, a popular traditional dish) to local people on streets of Thua Thien Hue province. Mong, a Buddhist from Hue's Vi Da ward in central Vietnam, which is famous for its mussels, said she usually takes her boat to carry food over the Huong River then walks only 600 meters to her destination. However, her boat was wiped out in severe flooding after six tropical storms hit the central provinces in October and November. The 56-year-old mother of two said she earns 80,000 to 100,000 dong ($3.50 to $4.30) per day to support her family, not enough money to buy a new boat. She said she had to work harder and sell food at night to get money to prepare food for the celebration of Tet, or Lunar New Year. Local markets closed for the weeklong traditional festival Feb. 10 ahead of the New Year, which starts Feb. 12. Thankfully, sisters across Vietnam have stepped in to help Mong and others like her.

""I am excited for the nuns who offered me 10 million dong [$435] on Jan. 28. I will use the money to buy a new boat for my work soon,"" Mong said cheerfully, adding that the boat is really a lifeboat that will help save her energy so she can work longer and earn more money to put food on the table. Sr. Maria Truong Thi Minh Yen of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate said her community provided boats for 12 people who lost their boats during the severe floods that left many people nothing in their wake. Yen, who serves Tan Thuy Parish, said she called on benefactors for donations. ""We do want to provide local flood victims with longer-term help so that they can stand on their own feet and return to normal life soon,"" she said. Many victims do not have enough money to be able to purchase basic means of doing their jobs. The 69-year-old nun said her convent gives clothes, blankets, rice and medicine to more than 100 street people, migrants, boat people and slum dwellers on a regular basis. Many live in makeshift shelters while others stay in low-rent, stuffy lodgings as their properties were washed away by flooding. ""They have suffered much from the last natural disasters and the chilly weather this year,"" Yen said. The temperature fell to 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January in the tropical area.

Yen, member of the Hue Archdiocese's committee representing local women religious orders, said some local congregations have built and repaired 40 victims' homes at a total cost of 1 billion dong ($43,000). Luong The Thien from Phu Hiep ward said he built a new house in January after he received 65 million dong from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. His old 40-square-meter house was damaged in the floods. Thien, a 54-year-old Buddhist, said he could not afford to rebuild his house as he works as a motorbike taxi driver to support his wife, who has lung cancer, and three children. ""We are happy to celebrate the Tet festival in the dream house. We are extremely grateful for the nuns' generous help that benefits our life long-term,"" he said, adding that according to tradition, people cannot be well-established in their careers until they have stable homes.

Thien said he has had a good relationship with the nuns since he took a nun from a local hospital to her convent in 2008. The nuns regularly visit his family, and his children receive a monthly scholarship from them. Nguyen The Thieu, a Buddhist from Cau Nhi village, said he is among seven local families who received money to repair their storm-damaged houses. His Catholic son-in-law introduced him to the nuns.

As of Wednesday morning, northern Vinh Phuc Province had reported two fatalities while Lao Cai, Son La, Lai Chau and Thai Nguyen claimed one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.

The committee said at least four others were injured.

Since last Sunday, northern provinces have been battered by torrential downpours due to the influence of a tropical convergence zone and effects from tropical storm Higos, which made landfall on China’s southern coast Wednesday morning.

Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Ha Giang and Tuyen Giang experienced heavy rainfall of up to 300 mm each downpour while Quang Ninh, home to world famous Ha Long Bay, and Hai Phong City received rainfall of between 200 and 350 mm each time. Levels of 180 mm a day are considered heavy.

At least 334 houses in the localities were damaged. Over 550 ha of rice and other crops were inundated while landslides blocked many roads leading to northern mountainous provinces like Lai Chau and Lao Cai, home to popular Sa Pa Town.

Weather forecasters warned northern provinces should expect heavy downpours with rainfall of between 100 and 250 mm from Thursday to Saturday due to the impacts of Higos.

Tran Quang Hoai, vice head of the committee, asked northern authorities to deploy rescue teams and evacuate residents in flood-prone areas.

Higos is the fourth storm formed in the East Sea this year.

The waters, known internationally as the South China Sea, could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, half of them directly affecting the country, meteorologists said.

Natural disasters, including drought, floods and landslides, killed 133 Vietnamese last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In the first half of this year, natural disasters killed 47 people and caused economic damages of VND3.3 trillion, according to official data.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/08/19/a9f5d4e442a7abf9f2b6-159782323-4253-6860-1597823279_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'flood', 'provinces', 'tropical', 'hit', 'heavy', 'rainfall', 'mm', 'committee', 'cai', 'killed', 'northern', 'ha']", ,flood

The United Nations Population Fund in Vietnam will provide an additional $800,000 to support women and girls affected by flooding in eight central provinces and cities.

It brings the UNFPA's total support to $1.34 million. In October it had given $540,000.

The support includes setting up mobile and outreach health care clinics and the distribution of dignity kits with essential hygiene items and vital maternal health equipment and supplies.

Between early October and mid-November the central region and parts of the Central Highlands were hit by a succession of storms that brought torrential rains, resulting in severe flooding and landslides.

At least 192 people were killed and 57 others are still listed missing, and losses amounted to VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), the government said.

Around 5.5 million people have been affected, including over 1.3 million women of reproductive age and more than 92,000 pregnant women, the UNFPA said.

The disaster forced women and girls into shelters without having the time to pack essential supplies, and many lack basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear that are needed to manage their menstrual periods, it said, adding that access to water and places to wash, dry reusable pads and clothes and dispose of used materials are lacking.

Routine public health programs such as antenatal, child birth, post-natal care, and family planning services have been disrupted.

The government provided VND770 billion for emergency relief.

Many international organizations and countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Australia also provided aid.","Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/08/huukhoaduadeolethuy51603180554-1148-5001-1607411128_1200x0.jpg,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'rains', 'health', 'girls', 'flooding', 'central', 'agency', '800000', 'women', 'pregnant', 'million', 'support', 'provided']", ,flood

On the night of October 11, Le Trung Lam, a resident of the central town, braved the floods to go and pick up some migrant students who had been marooned in their inundated home for days. He took them to his company on Ngu Binh Street, An Tay Ward, where 30 people were already sheltering.

They cook in the kitchen and eat three meals a day, and also have blankets, mattresses and electricity.

Three days earlier, many students from other places now studying in Hue, had no idea where to shelter as the floodwaters rose relentlessly and inundated their homes. Then Lam's message arrived out of the blue.

He said: ""The company's headquarters, a five-floor building, is situated on Ngu Binh Mountain, and so the water has not reached it yet. Its two top floors have 10 rooms each that can accommodate 20-30 people.""

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential downpours in central Vietnam for a week now have killed 29 as of Tuesday morning. Among the deaths, six are from Thua Thien-Hue Province, home to Hue.

Lam, 33, decided to turn his company into a shelter on October 8 as the waters reached some major roads and were expected to rise further. Driving around the town to check on the flood situation and how people were coping, he passed by the studio apartment where he himself had lived 15 years ago as a migrant student from central Nghe An Province. He too had suffered during flooding.

Fearing for students who were possibly cut off, he posted an announcement that he was willing to shelter people.

In the last few days he has received hundreds of calls from people seeking help. Since the neighborhood still has access to electricity and the market remains open, Lam's employees have been able to buy food and cook meals.

Lam said he would take care of the students until the floods receded.

If the water level keeps rising, he plans to also use the main hall which can hold 500 people.

Le Thi Anh Ngoc, 19, from the central Quang Binh Province, said she walked on flooded streets for more than an hour to reach Lam's place on the morning of October 11.

""I arrived in Hue four days ago. I did not know who would help us before I learned about Lam.""

Six kilometers away from the company, on Tung Thien Vuong Street, Ngo Thi Kim Loan is busy making 500 banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich, with the help of a few others to send to people stranded on Hen Dune and Han Mac Tu Street.

Loan, who regularly does charity, always has instant noodles at home. Three days ago, seeing the rising water levels, she gave away 100 boxes of them to households in her neighborhood facing difficulties.

On October 12 she cooked 40 kilograms of rice for people living in areas where power has been turned off due to the floods.

The owner of a noodles restaurant also posted on her Facebook page that families with children or old people could command shelter at her home.

In the evening, when Loan sent 300 banh mi to households on Hen, Le Quoc Phong, Loan's neighbor, 40, was eating dinner under an oil lamp. The island in the middle of the Huong River was cut off by the rising waters.

Phong volunteered to help distribute food to those in need. Finishing his meal, he quickly got on a boat to take the banh mi to people before dinner time was over.

Distributing food and offering accommodation are Hue people’s way of supporting people affected by the floods.

Dozens of families living in higher places said they are ready to take in people whose houses are flooded and provide instant noodles to those who need them.

Free food distribution centers have been set up in downtown areas in the last few days, but are accessible only to people living nearby because of the situation.

People are also helping their fellows facing a threat of losing their livelihoods.

Over several days, strong winds and torrential rains caused huge damage, submerging homes, wiping out farmland, killing and sweeping away cattle. The Diocese of Hà Tinh, along with Caritas and the Catholic Business Association brought donations.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) - Strong winds and torrential rain over several days have caused flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 37 so far. Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên Hu? and Qu?ng Nam are the most affected provinces.

Heavy rains from 10 to 13 October inundated residential areas, farmland and roads, causing huge damages to people and property.

The General Department of Disaster Prevention reported that, in addition to the 37 deaths, at least 50,000 houses were flooded or wrecked whilst 250 hectares of rice fields and 2,500 hectares planted with vegetables were wiped out. Some 900 hectares dedicated to aquaculture were also damaged; at least 60,000 animals, mainly cows and poultry, were killed or swept away by the raging waters.

Bishop Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p of Hà Tinh (about 340 km south of the capital, near the coast), decided to visit the flooded areas to bring some help. On Saturday, he led a delegation from his diocese to Trung Quán parish.

The prelate tried to visit every family, one by one, to encourage them and leave them with some small gifts. For those who met him, “He is a true pastor. He did not just give us some gifts; he brought us God.”

Trung Quán parish, one of the hardest hit, saw homes submerged and streets turned into rivers.

Thanks Caritas and the Hà Tinh Catholic Business Association, the bishop was able to leave a package containing instant noodles, a bottle of oil and two packs of condiments for each family he visited.

He also brought more than 200 million dong (about US$ 8,600). The diocese donated 100 million; Caritas 50 million and the Catholic Business Association, another 50 million. Although not huge, the money will help with the emergency.

Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p encouraged the faithful to recite the rosary and pray for all the people living in the flooded area.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VN-_Evacuation.jpg,"['tinh', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'business', 'bishop', 'diocese', 'hà', 'left', 'hectares', 'catholic', 'caritas', 'central', 'floods', '37', 'huge', 'million', 'visits', 'dead']", ,floood

The situation

Several provinces in the center, central highlands and south of Vietnam have been impacted by floods following torrential rain over a number of days. The worst affected provinces are Kien Giang followed by Lam Dong. Other provinces affected include Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Kon Tum, Dong Nai, Binh Thuan and Binh Phuoc. Re

According to a report issued by the National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (NCDPC), as of 10 August 2019, 10 deaths have been reported while four people injured and over 1,985 people evacuated. In total 12,141 houses are affected by the floods. In addition, households have lost livestock, gardens and other assets.

Flooding of the Cam Ly river in Lam Dong peaked on the evening of 8 August 2019 at 834.25m, exceeding all previous records by 0.28m. While the river level dropped slightly to 830.41m on the following day, it remains at dangerous levels. Flooding of the Dong Nai river at peaked on 9 August 2019 at 114.10m.

Typhoon Molave, packing winds of 125kmh, is the fourth big storm to hit the country's central provinces this month, further immiserating the 800,000 people already affected by flooding in the region, as well as in Cambodia and Laos.

In such emergencies, teams of logistics and communications specialists would normally be dispatched from neighbouring countries to help pave the way for the delivery of supplies, and search and rescue missions. This time, owing to the pandemic, Vietnamese officials have declined such offers of help.

""Vietnam made clear that no personnel could come - only items,"" said Ms Adelina Kamal, executive director of the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, better known as the AHA Centre.

To be sure, Vietnam has seen worse and may be able to manage the disaster itself, with or without a pandemic. In 2017, more than a dozen storms triggered floods and landslides that claimed nearly 400 lives and caused the equivalent of $3.5 billion in damage.

Last week, the AHA Centre arranged the airlift of 1,300 kitchen sets, consisting of utensils for cooking and eating, from Subang, Malaysia, the location of one of three Asean regional stockpiles.

But none of the more than 320-strong Emergency Rapid Assessment Team who were already outside Vietnam were permitted to enter.

As Covid-19 threatens to drag on for many more months, emergency response officials will need to rely more on local talent if the pandemic deters the arrival of help from overseas.

There could be a repeat of recent years that saw multiple large-scale disasters, at a time when disaster mitigation officials may already be distracted with Covid-19.

Damage caused by storms and typhoons in the western Pacific in 2018, including Typhoon Mangkhut which claimed more than 130 lives in the Philippines and China, set a record of US$30.2 billion (S$41.2 billion) that year, only to be bested by the figure the following year which topped US$34 billion.

More than 4,300 lost their lives in earthquakes and tsunamis that stuck Indonesia's Central Sulawesi in September 2018. Ms Adelina recalls daily morning meetings in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan to plan airlifts using military aircraft to ferry supplies to victims of that tragedy.

""Without physical coordination, if we have multiple disasters like in 2018, it's going to be difficult,"" Ms Adelina said.

Flooding in Vietnam notwithstanding, this year has been quiet. The airlift to Vietnam this month was AHA Centre's first for a natural disaster since the onset of the pandemic in March, Ms Adelina said

The AHA Centre was established in 2011. By now, teams there have notched up sufficient experience and familiarity to cope with limitations stemming from the pandemic, said Ms Adelina, stressing the need for preparation to deal with disasters.

""We have to start the planning from now on,"" she said. ""People may have been clouded by Covid-19. Maybe they are praying that there won't be a disaster. But we are a disaster-prone region.""

Dr Raditya Jati, head of data, information and disaster communication at Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), said the central government is pushing local governments to identify populated areas prone to flooding and landslides, and temporary shelters that can minimise crowding.

Floods in West Jakarta last month were something of a dress rehearsal for a large-scale disaster, with officials handing out masks and enforcing social distancing, which Dr Raditya said prevented clusters of Covid-19 infections.

Decisions to admit foreign emergency workers remain on a case-by-case basis, Dr Raditya said.

""We are a big country,"" he said. ""There is a challenge to access the whole country.""","Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/10/28/yq-vietflood-28102020.jpg?itok=jWXcl7KJ,"['vietnam', 'officials', 'response', 'deadly', 'covid19', 'shows', 'disaster', 'lives', 'pandemic', 'adelina', 'floods', 'handling', 'month', 'vietnams', 'slow', 'ms', 'aha']", ,flood

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that – like in many others around the world – has attracted retail punters in droves.

Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

Bulking Up

Vietnam is an “investable market,” according to HSBC Holdings Plc. The flood of local cash has seen trading volumes more than quadruple since the end of 2019, based on 50-day moving averages. The benchmark index now includes 11 stocks exceeding $5 billion in market value, up from just two in 2015. Vingroup JSC has been leading the charge, and the conglomerate is now launching an ambitious plan to sell electric vehicles to the U.S. Vingroup was founded by the country’s richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine. The company started out focusing on property development but it now also makes cars and smartphones.

The stock exchange’s other heavy hitters include a smattering of state-backed behemoths -- Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, PetroVietnam Gas JSC -- as well as steelmaker Hoa Phat Group JSC and Vietnam Dairy Products JSC.

Vietnam’s stocks have been climbing amid optimism its export-oriented economy can maintain momentum after being one of the few in Asia to expand last year. Manufacturing activity jumped in April to the strongest since November 2018, according to a PMI report Tuesday. Equities retreated today, sending the VN Index down 1.1% as of 9:38 a.m. local time, after Vietnam’s capital city instructed school pupils to stay home in order to help contain an increase in local Covid-19 cases.

The country is well positioned as the U.S. and Chinese economies lead a global rebound from the pandemic. That’s because Vietnam benefited when U.S.-China trade tensions spurred companies to diversify supply chains out of its larger Asian neighbor.

“We’ve been positive on Vietnam for a number of years. They are a clear beneficiary of China-U.S. trade tensions and their handling of the pandemic has been among the best examples globally,” said Jeff Gill, who helped manage about $10.9 billion of assets at City of London Investment Management as of Dec. 31.

Waiting Room

Part of the problem may be that international investors overstretched when they splurged. Foreigners sold a net $876 million of Vietnamese stocks last year, similar to what’s been already sold so far this year. That’s in line with a wave of selling across Asian emerging markets. Those moves look to have simply swelled foreigners’ cash positions inside Vietnam, which are already substantially higher now than they were at the end of 2020, according to Vu Bang, former chairman of the State Securities Commission.

Vietnam’s stocks also faced a setback in March when FTSE Russell decided to maintain the country as a frontier market, instead of upgrading it to a secondary emerging market, citing settlement methodology issues. The State Securities Commission expects to resolve the issue later this year. Investors have also cited foreign ownership limits as a concern that could hamstring the market’s capacity to grow further.

Money managers from Sempione Sim SpA, to Asia Frontier Capital and City of London Investment Management Co. say they are busy looking for entry points. They cite solid economic prospects, relatively attractive valuations, rising foreign-direct investment flows and healthy earnings growth as reasons to be optimistic, while also showing faith in the government’s ability to contain the pandemic.

“I see Vietnam as a very nice compelling growth and stable story for the short, mid and long term,” said Federico Parenti, a fund manager at Sempione Sim in Milan.

Vietnamese like Quy, a 33-year-old swimming teacher, are all too willing to keep investing in the nation’s stocks. He never thought of buying shares until the pandemic kept on shutting down the pool where the Hanoi resident usually teaches his students, slashing his income.

Since the beginning of October, central Vietnam has been pounded by consecutive tropical storms and typhoons, which have brought widespread flooding and landslides to the region.

At least 1.5 million people have been affected by flooding and 235 people have died or are missing, according to the Vietnamese government.

On October 15, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink declared a national disaster for the Central Vietnam region as a result of the widespread devastation caused by flooding and landslides. This flooding has disrupted electricity and telecommunication networks, as well as destroying infrastructure, houses, livestock, and crops.

On October 28, Typhoon Molave made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Vietnam. It was the worst typhoon to hit the country in the last two decades.

Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are the two of the five central provinces that have been hardest hit by the recent flooding and landslides. The other three provinces that have been severely affected are Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, and Hue.

To make matters worse, the monsoon season is still ongoing and another powerful storm, Typhoon Vamco, made landfall last Sunday morning in central Vietnam, causing even greater damage. This is the third storm system to pummel Vietnam in November and the 13th to hit the country this year. The economic damage is now estimated to be close to $1 billion, according to the Vietnamese government.

International donations are starting to come in from various countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Japan. To date, the U.S. has donated $2.1 million toward the humanitarian relief effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Vietnam Red Cross Society to assist during the ongoing recovery period.

The financial backing also focuses on USAID’s longstanding investments in Vietnam to help minimize loss and destruction caused by natural disasters. Although the Vietnamese government has been quick to allocate disaster relief funds, its efforts and capacities have been strained also by the coronavirus pandemic. Donations from the outside world will be certainly needed and appreciated.

Local NGOs have been working tirelessly alongside the government to deliver aid to those who have been most affected by the catastrophic storms and their results. Pacific Links Foundation is an NGO that currently supports disadvantaged families in central Vietnam and it has been vigorously fundraising to support families in flood-affected Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Hue provinces.

“Our volunteers on the ground have delivered emergency packages, which included rice, food, life jackets, and flashlights, to students and their families,” said Hong Nguyen, the deputy director for SEEDS, a Pacific Links Foundation scholarship program which currently supports over 2,500 students.

SEEDS and the Pacific Links Foundation are now working on another round of support that will focus specifically on long-term recovery, allowing school children in all eight central Provinces to return to school and provide support for the families that suffered the most during the recent typhoons and floods.

“We will provide packages which will include books and school supplies, as well as computer tablets for students to continue learning through our online learning platform, especially when schooling is being disrupted,” said Nguyen.

Another non-profit charitable organization focused on philanthropic activities to benefit Vietnamese people in need throughout the Central Vietnam region is Da Nang Go. The organization uses fundraising events and direct donations to address the specific needs of Vietnamese people affected by natural disasters, poverty, and hunger.

Presently, the group consists of about 20 local and international volunteers who have been doing regular relief trips to some of the harder hit flood and landslide zones across the region. The NGO recently took a convoy of trucks and cars to Tay Giang district in Quang Nam province to provide much-needed supplies.

Tay Giang experienced heavy flooding and deadly landslides in October and November and is generally considered to be one of the more economically disadvantaged areas of Central Vietnam. The majority of the people who live there are from the Co Tu ethnic minority, a patriarchal rural society whose men raise livestock and whose women are well known for making high-quality traditional handicrafts.

The Co Tu live in small stilt huts which can be easily damaged by storms and landslides. At least 30 families had previously been evacuated from one village in Tay Giang due to the recent landslides.

“Before the last storm came, the government wanted to move them to a safer place but the problem is they don’t want to move anywhere because they are scared and if they die then they want to die in their hometown. They are used to yearly storms but they didn’t know this year’s storms would be so bad,” said Hannah Bui, one of the main directors of Da Nang Go and owner of Hannah’s Restaurant in Da Nang.

“I wish I had more money so I could do more to help these people,” she said.

Recently, the Da Nang Go team assembled 250 aid packages for children and 750 for adults in Tay Giang, as well as presenting some cash donations in envelopes at Hannah’s Restaurant.

The aid packages consisted of water, milk, noodles, dry food, oil, fish sauce, salt, blankets, and notebooks. The money was raised through a recent fundraising event and from various donations by local and expat members of the Da Nang community.

The aid was greeted with smiles by the local villagers and government officials. The team also delivered supplies to two elementary schools and to adults in the neediest villages of Tay Giang. In one of the poorest schools, students are so impoverished that they can’t afford basic school uniforms and some students walk up to four kilometers per day to attend classes.

“When I do charity and I do small things like give candy to poor kids they are happy and smile, and when I give old people clothes and they say ‘thank you,’ it warms my heart and makes me feel good knowing I’ve brightened their day,” said Bui.

Da Nang Go will continue its ongoing fundraising and aid missions to help people around central Vietnam affected by these historically devastating storms and typhoons. Both Pacific Links Foundation and Da Nang Go are continuing to deliver aid packages and funds in the aftermath of Typhoon Vamco.

As much as these local charities and NGOs have brought much-needed relief for affected communities, in terms of food, clothing, school supplies, and direct funding, what is really needed now in terms of the recovery effort is the rebuilding of infrastructure, houses, and technological networks, and a re-supply of livestock to get things back to normal.

Suddenly, the boat capsized in the fast-moving current. His wife, Hoang Thi Phuong, a 35-year-old cancer survivor, was just out of reach, and she was swept away by water turned brown by loosened sediment.

In both cases, the U.S. became involved in a foreign war without having a clear picture of what our ultimate objective was. We largely took over the direction of each war from a corrupt host government. Many citizens of our host country placed reliance on the U.S. to provide for their safety, come what may. The war became unwinnable because of a series of unfortunate decisions. Losing interest in the endeavor, we shaped settlement terms the host government was required to accept, intimating we would be there to help if worse came to worst. Here, the similarity ends, for now.

In the case of Vietnam, even though we knew weeks beforehand that the fall of South Vietnam was imminent, we made no concerted effort to extract the Vietnamese who had steadfastly supported the U.S. When their government fell, many thousands who had helped, trusted and relied upon us were murdered or incarcerated to the great dishonor of our nation. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the south and, although we gave many of them sanctuary, our help was slow in coming. The final chapter in Afghanistan has yet to be written, but it must not end up with a betrayal of our friends.

During the long and tortured course of America’s war in Afghanistan, many Afghans stepped forward at their great peril to serve and help protect our military personnel. As we withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban have stepped up their violent attacks and the danger to our friends has dramatically increased. We are morally obligated to provide them sanctuary within our borders.

There are two special immigrant visa (SIV) programs in place to bring our Afghan friends to the U.S., but they are mired in red tape — it takes up to three years to process an application. There is a backlog of nearly 19,000 SIV applicants, with about 50,000 family members. They are waiting in line, living in fear of death. There are not enough slots to take care of the backlog. The vetting process is understaffed, underfunded and overly burdensome.

In this crisis situation, there are two feasible alternatives — either review existing documentation in the files and grant visas to those who U.S. personnel have credibly vouched for in the files, or extract the SIVs and families from Afghanistan and complete any necessary vetting in a safe location. We processed South Vietnamese refugees at U.S. military bases in the late 1980s.

We need, also, to consider the plight of Afghans who don’t qualify for SIV status. A Taliban take-over, which appears increasingly likely, will create a flood of refugees, fleeing for their very lives. Being partially responsible for their plight, we are honor bound to provide sanctuary for many of them, just as we eventually did for those fleeing Vietnam. We should plan to evacuate Afghans who will be targets of Taliban reprisal — uncorrupted government and military officials, women’s rights advocates, educators, democracy advocates and the like.

Like many troops who served in America’s wars, this issue is very personal for me. I lived and worked with South Vietnamese soldiers in 1968-1969. I trusted them with my life, while they relied on the U.S. government as a friend and ally. Most of my Vietnamese friends were Catholics who moved from North Vietnam to Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam in 1954 to escape persecution. They were fiercely anti-communist and pro-American. It broke my heart when the communists took over in April 1975, knowing that my friends would be killed or imprisoned, as were many thousands of their countrymen. We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate. We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us.

7,7,FL-2020-000211-VNM,United States announces additional humanitarian assistance in response to flooding in Vietnam - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-assistance-response-flooding-vietnam,"Friday, October 30, 2020

press@usaid.gov

Today, while in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced the United States is providing an additional $2 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to Typhoon Molave and the ongoing severe flooding that has affected Central Vietnam since early October. This amount brings the total humanitarian assistance from the U.S. Government for people touched by the floods to $2.1 million.

With this new funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is ramping up efforts to meet emergency needs in communities affected by Vietnam’s historic typhoon season. Typhoon Molave, which made landfall in Central Vietnam on October 28, 2020, is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. Typhoon Molave follows weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1.5 million people and killed more than 130.

In response, USAID’s partners, including the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC), are addressing the immediate needs of the affected families for food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Because the floods have washed away livestock, farms, and infrastructure, USAID’s partners also will provide assistance to these families as they begin to restore their livelihoods.

This assistance builds on USAID’s long-term investments in Vietnam to reduce the risk and impact of disasters. With funding from USAID, for example, the VNRC has been on the front lines in responding to the impact of severe weather throughout this typhoon season.

The United States stands with the people of Vietnam during this difficult time.

8,8,FL-2020-000211-VNM,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

Vietnam’s flood death toll rose to at least 23 and authorities said the incoming storm Nangka would dump more heavy rain on the country in the coming days.

The floods also left at least 14 people missing in Vietnam’s central provinces, the government said in a statement on Monday.

Most of the victims were washed away by floodwaters, the national disaster management authority said, adding local authorities evacuated nearly 46,000 people from affected areas.

The floods have inundated more than 109,000 homes and 1,443 acres (584 hectares) of crops and damaged roads and bridges, the agency added.

A military helicopter rescues sailors from a submerged ship at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri province [Ho Cau/Reuters] Separately, a landslide on Monday reportedly buried 13 construction workers at a hydropower dam in the central province of Thua Thien Hue.

According to weather forecasters, water levels will keep rising, swelling rivers and submerging more communities in the region, the state-owned Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.

The situation worsened over the weekend when Tropical Storm Linfa, which weakened to a depression when it hit the country, brought more rain to the region.

Torrential rains have flooded central Vietnam and killed dozens since last week [Ho Cau/Reuters] “We received a report saying that between 10 and 13 workers have been buried in a landslide and we don’t know if they are still alive,” a disaster management official in Thua Thien Hue province told Reuters news agency by telephone.

Soldiers were deployed to the area to rescue the workers, said the official, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

“We are concerned that the incoming storm will worsen the flood situation,” the official said.

Storm Nangka, which is forecast to make landfall in northern Vietnam on Wednesday, will trigger heavy rain of up to 400 millimetres (16 inches) in parts of northern and central Vietnam from Wednesday through Friday, the national weather agency said.

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Vietnam and local people’s generosity. Luu Thi Phuong , 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.“Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children,” she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.“I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDP’s 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.“Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam,” she said.“However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.”Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last year’s floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.”Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.“It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life,” he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: “I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).“In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households,” said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing.

11,11,FL-2020-000211-VNM,How flood protection can paradoxically put people at risk - Horizon,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/how-flood-protection-can-paradoxically-put-people-risk.html,"Professor Jeroen Aerts, a hydrologist at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in The Netherlands, says that when a city builds a defensive wall or dyke, it can make its citizens feel so secure that they actually flock to live or to develop businesses in the protected area. What’s more, they don’t bother to install their own flood protection.

This means that when rare – but inevitable – extreme flooding occurs the damage can be colossal.

It is just one way in which flood protection modellers may be underestimating – and sometimes overestimating – the true consequences of sea level rise, says Prof. Aerts. And it is happening because physical scientists are failing to integrate human behaviour into their models.

Prof. Aerts leads a team that is trying to change this using the technique of agent-based modelling which attempts to reproduce complex phenomena like human behaviour. They use software that creates autonomous decision-making entities called agents, each of which assesses its situation and makes a decision based on a set of rules that have been drawn from survey data and decision theory.

Last year, they published a paper that underlined the problem of the safe development paradox. By modelling what is known about how humans behave when governments install flood protection where they live and work, the team demonstrated that ‘the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas.’

But the study went on to show that governments could ‘largely counteract’ this effect if they simultaneously promoted policies that encourage people to flood-proof their buildings.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’ Prof. Jeroen Aerts, Vrije University, The Netherlands

Migration

Prof. Aerts believes that the failure of physical scientists to take human behaviour into account may also have led them to misjudge the degree to which flooding will drive migration. What’s more, it means they are not identifying precisely where it would be best to target help, because the models don’t distinguish adequately between those who will manage to look after themselves and those who won’t.

Sea level rise will, it is commonly predicted, displace 187 million people by 2100. But the figure, which comes from a 2011 study, is controversial.

‘Most modelling studies that deal with flooding risk or sea level rise use a top-down approach,’ said Prof. Aerts. ‘You have long-term scenarios – like how many centimetres is sea level going to rise, and what will the exposed population be … and you try to estimate the impact.’ Then, he said, the models are rerun to include the effects of various adaptation measures, such as dykes or managed retreat, after which researchers do a cost-benefit analysis.

But, Prof. Aerts said, ‘they forget about (asking) what is the probability that this dyke will be built? Or what is the probability that people will retreat? So they do not take into account the human behavioural factor which determines whether or not this measure will be implemented.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’

Factors that get ignored include evidence that people’s decisions to migrate, or to stay and defend their land, vary with their wealth, age, risk perception, trust of government and attitudes to individual freedom.

Social scientists

Prof. Aerts says that his team is now turning the models on their head, in a new project known as COASTMOVE. They are integrating a global coastal flood risk model with an agent-based model to simulate how governments, private sector actors such as insurance companies, and individuals act and influence each other.

Another difference is that social scientists are feeding data into the project.

‘They provide me with the information about under what conditions are people going to implement a certain measure, from the individual level to the higher aggregate government level,’ said Prof. Aerts.

Some of this information is from pre-existing surveys on what drives people to migrate or otherwise respond to floods. The rest will be gathered from new surveys in six coastal areas in France, Ghana, the Marshall Islands, the United States, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Other, less traditional sources of information will come from data already collected via mobile phones, Twitter posts and even tax returns.

They will use data from Bangladesh, for example, where other researchers have been able to discover, from anonymised mobile phone data, how many people have fled from floods, where they travelled, and how soon they returned. They will also use data that Prof. Aerts has gathered over the last six years using algorithms to monitor tweets that mention the word ‘flood’, in 20 different languages. This provides daily flood maps that give ‘a pretty good idea of where we can expect most of the problems’, he said.

More data is coming from the United States where it has been possible to draw conclusions about migration after flooding from the location from which people have filed their annual tax returns.

Vulnerabilities

By simulating adaptive behaviour, the team hopes to provide more refined predictions about the degree to which sea level rise will cause migration – in the form of 1x1km2 global migration maps.

Dr Bina Desai, head of policy and research at the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, says that sea level rise will bring a variety of direct and indirect impacts, which will affect people differently depending on factors such as inequality and poverty, that are not adequately reflected in models.

‘What’s needed, if we think about risk of migration and displacement, is modelling with a less strong focus on the hazard and a stronger focus on underlying vulnerabilities and what exacerbates them,’ she said.

‘In principle, it’s the only way to do it,’ Dr Desai said of COASTMOVE’s approach. Even as a conceptual model, she adds, it will help to work out how the many factors interrelate.

‘The downside is to move beyond the conceptual model,’ she added. ‘If you want to translate that into numbers then (when we have tried it) we found we failed because all the inputs could not be populated with data.

‘But if they can find a way of doing it by (collecting enough data), using proxies and making assumptions and somehow modelling it out then I think that’s great.’

Just how are our seas changing and rising with climate change and the melting of Earth’s ice caps? This is the final story in a three-part series looking at the past, present and future of extreme sea level rise. In part one, we looked at what the last interglacial can tell us about extreme sea level rise and in part two we looked at rise of atmospheric ‘meteotsunamis’.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

i. Deliver immediate, life-saving assistance to those in the most urgent need, in support of the Government response and in line with Government requests for assistance.

ii. Ensure the most vulnerable people, including women and children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and LGBTIQ persons, are protected against violence and have equal access to humanitarian assistance and services without discrimination.

iii. Prevent the outbreak of communicable diseases and effectively monitor risks to the health of the affected population, including the nutrition status of vulnerable people such as pregnant and lactating women and children under five years of age. Deliver assistance in a manner that minimises the risk of COVID-19 for disaster-affected people.

iv. Ensure access to multi sectoral assistance and re-establish critical services. Promote the repair of key public service infrastructure in affected provinces, ensure food security, by restoring lost food stock, livestock and livelihoods, ensure access to sustainable drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene supplies, housing, replacement of productive assets and household items, and access to basic medical, social and public services to support the affected population transition to recovery and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

On 13 October, the Government of Viet Nam released a call for emergency relief and support following four tropical cyclones and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which combined have caused severe and widespread flooding, landslides, storm surge and strong winds since 6 October. As of 28 October, 214 people have reportedly been killed or are missing, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). An estimated 7.7 million people live in areas affected by flooding caused by the multiple storms, with some 1.5 million people in nine provinces directly affected and approximately 380,000 houses flooded, damaged or destroyed. Of those people directly affected by the current disaster, some 753,000 are women and girls, 134,000 are children under five, and 143,000 are over 65 years old.

On the morning of 11 October, Tropical Storm Linfa (Storm No. 6) made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Viet Nam, resulting in 150 to 300 mm of rain. This was followed on 14 October by Tropical Storm Nangka (Storm No. 7) which made landfall in northern Viet Nam, but also brought a further 150 mm of rain to the still flooded provinces of central Viet Nam. On 16 October, tropical depression INVEST 94W in the East Sea weakened into a low-pressure area and made landfall in the central provinces, and was subsequently followed by Tropical Storm Saudel (Storm No. 8) which made landfall in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces on 25 October. On 28 October, Tropical Cyclone Molave (Storm No. 9) made landfall in approximately the same area as Tropical Storm Linfa, with up to 700 mm of rain reported in Nghe An and Ha Thinh provinces and up to 400 mm of rain in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces.

In Quang Ngai province, some 17,000 people were evacuated because of the strong winds and rain. Between 5 and 20 October, VNDMA reported that many areas in central Viet Nam recorded a total rainfall of more than 2,400 mm, and in some locations, flood waters exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1979 and 1999.

As of 29 October, nine provinces have been affected by the cumulative impacts of the multiple storms including Tropical Cyclone Molave. These are, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Nghe An, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum provinces, with Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces most severely affected.

Following Tropical Cyclone Molave, more than 88,000 houses and 50 schools had their roofs blown off, the majority in Quang Ngai province, and some 375,000 people were evacuated to evacuation centres. Those in the evacuation centres are amongst the most vulnerable having had their houses damaged or destroyed and having lost key household items in the floods. Many of the evacuation centres are overcrowded, do not have access to sufficient basic facilities such as water and sanitation, and health care, and lack appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children.

As well as damage to houses, some 30,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged (including rice, other crops, and aquatic products) and more than 2 million cattle and poultry have been killed. This is likely to have severe impacts on food security and livelihoods, especially for those people who were already experiencing adverse economic impacts due to COVID19. Further, more than 360 schools have been flooded and damaged, with detrimental impacts on children’s ability to continue accessing education. In addition, more than 78 health centres and hospitals have also been damaged or flooded.

To date, the delivery of assistance has been hampered by extensive damage to public transportation infrastructure. VNDMA reports that more than 165 km of national highway, 140 km of local roads and three bridges have been heavily damaged. Rescue teams are accessing affected areas by boat to deliver relief items and to evacuate vulnerable people, prioritizing children, people with disabilities and elderly people. Communication has also been hampered by the loss of electricity in many affected areas.

The areas most severely affected by flooding are also those same provinces which experienced a second wave of COVID19 cases in July and August. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, a further thirty days of lockdown measures were implemented from 28 July to 5 September, with adverse socio-economic impacts for the region which already records higher than national average multidimensional poverty rates. As a consequence of COVID-19 related measures, the most vulnerable people had already had their coping capacities eroded prior to this current disaster and are thus in more acute need of immediate assistance to help them manage the current, compound crisis.

From 20 and 23 October, joint GovernmentUN-NGO assessments were undertaken in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai provinces. Key findings from the assessments include the need for emergency food assistance for 177,000 of the most vulnerable people, restoration of agricultural land, safe access to clean water and sanitation facilities including in health centres and schools, the provision of dignity kits for women and girls, provision of education supplies and alternative learning solutions to ensure continuity of learning, support for those people evacuated from their homes, repairs for damaged houses, replacement of basic household items, health support especially maternal and child health, risk communication activities, provision of micro nutrients and continuation of nutrition activities to prevent an increase in rates of malnutrition.

Protection has been identified as a key need in this response, including the immediate need to ensure protection and safeguards for women and children currently living in evacuation centres. Partners involved in the development of this plan have also highlighted the need to provide assistance in a gender-responsive manner that addresses the specific needs of women and girls. The Government has requested that all relief activities target the most vulnerable people, including poor, near poor, people living with disabilities, children, femaleheaded households and elderly people, which are the target populations for this response plan.","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/VNM-ResponsePlan-201031-051%20%281%29.jpg?itok=QHnLLURt,"['plan', 'response', 'nam', 'quang', 'provinces', '2020', 'viet', 'tropical', 'floods', 'affected', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'assistance', 'storm', 'including']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The lower Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam) experienced prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020 until early December 2020. This was due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka as well as tropical depression INVEST 94W. The three wind systems made landfall in Vietnam but brought along heavy rain to the rest of the lower Mekong region. Tropical storm Linfa made landfall on 11 October 2020, tropical storm Nangka made landfall on 14 October 2020 whilst tropical depression INVEST 94W made landfall on 16 October 2020.

The rainfall brought by the wind systems resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in southern Lao PDR. As of 20 October 2020, nine districts in three provinces of Salawan, Savannaket and Sekong were affected by the floods. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Based on an initial assessment on 20 October 2020, conducted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) with participation of Lao Red Cross, it was highlighted that 163 villages in the three provinces, with an estimated 15,305 households (97,514 people) were affected. Savannaket was the worst affected province with more than 10,000 households from 137 villages were reportedly affected in the province and two people had lost their lives. In Sekong province, around 3,000 people were affected, and two people had lost their lives. Salawan province reported more than 600 people affected with five deaths.

Cyclone Molave – the fourth tropical cyclone to threaten Vietnam this month – is barrelling towards the country’s central coast, worsening severe floods and landslides that have inundated parts of the region for weeks.

Vietnamese authorities are rushing to evacuate half a million people before Molave makes a projected 28 October landfall, packing wind speeds topping 110 kilometres per hour. The country is already struggling with intense floods and landslides that have killed at least 130 people and damaged a quarter of a million homes.

The Vietnamese Red Cross has already warned that 160,000 people may need food aid over the next six months, but that figure could rise after Molave makes landfall and its impact becomes more clear.

Aid groups say parts of Vietnam are seeing their worst floods and landslides in two decades. Disasters are common during Asia’s various monsoon seasons, but this month’s flurry of storms has aggravated conditions, with weeks of extended heavy rainfall.

Parts of Laos and Cambodia are also submerged. And Thailand is projecting that Molave's rains will hit the country’s north and northeast.

Before threatening Southeast Asia’s Mekong region, Cyclone Molave uprooted some 25,000 people in the Philippines earlier this week.

Hue, Vietnam – Before floodwater inundated half their living room one night during the storm season this year, the Trans put their most valuable possessions – their TV and refrigerator – in the attic and told their two daughters to take refuge there.

Tran Nhu Hong, 23, and her 18-year-old sister, who do not know how to swim, survived the storms – the worst her generation had ever experienced and the worst her parents had seen in decades.

A neighbour was not so fortunate. The 19-year-old student was swept away in the floods after the vehicle she was travelling in was tipped over by the force of the water – on the same route the two young women usually take.

“Shortly after the water retreated, I went on that route and the vehicle was still there and had not yet been pulled out (of the mud),” Hong said. “I don’t dare to go on that route late at night any more.”

Across central Vietnam, cascading floods from October onward inundated the living and the dead, as record rainfall submerged towns and cemeteries. Authorities said earlier this month that the typhoons, which they referred to as “abnormal”, cost the Southeast Asian country 30 trillion dong ($1.3bn) in damage and killed at least 192 people – a death toll more than five times higher than the 35 COVID-19 deaths Vietnam recorded this year.

A woman drives along a flooded road beside submerged rice fields [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “In general, it is well-established that rainfall from typhoons is increasing due to climate change, both from observations and from models,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead climate scientist at the Red Cross Climate Center and World Weather Attribution, whose team is conducting a study on the role of climate change in the recent floods and typhoons in central Vietnam.

Crops destroyed

With 70 percent of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas, Vietnam is highly exposed to riverine and coastal flooding and is also one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.

“There is even more damage after the floods,” Hong said, driving by rice fields made inlets because of the storms and floods in her hometown in Thua Thien Hue Province.

When the water retreated, it took crops with it, leaving behind scarred earth. Many farming families in central Vietnam count on rice, various other crops and cattle for income, especially as the Lunar New Year celebration, known as Tet, nears.

Tet is usually when Vietnamese shop for new clothes, gifts and appliances to welcome a new, fulfilling beginning; but with their homes and means of living ravaged by violent storms, severe floods and devastating landslides, Tet, which will take place in February, is likely to be tinged with sadness.

Hong’s parents are still recovering from the wounds and infections they got from wading through hip-high flood water for extended periods, and have yet to find jobs as construction workers due to the double burden of COVID-19 and the recent natural disasters.

Ichiro Sato, senior associate with the Climate Program and Sustainable Finance Center at US-based think tank World Resources Institute, says central Vietnam was battling extreme weather events long before climate change started to take effect.

“If governments have not been well-prepared even for the conventional risk of weather-related disasters that existed before climate change – and I am afraid that is the case for Central Vietnam – then there are so many things they have to work on before worrying about the additional risk of climate change,” Sato said, adding that unregulated urbanisation and economic growth may increase vulnerability to weather-related disasters in places like Vietnam.

The country typically endures between five and six storms and about three tropical depressions a year, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, but in 2020 a total of at least 14 ravaged the country. Seven consecutive tropical storms and cyclones hit the central region between October and mid-November.

Children at risk

According to the UN, an estimated 7.7 million people in nine provinces, including 2.5 million children, were affected – with hundreds of thousands of houses flooded, damaged or destroyed.

“There is no doubt that children are those most affected by natural disasters,” Rana Flowers, UNICEF representative in Vietnam, told Al Jazeera, adding that families’ ability to secure nutritious food for their children had already suffered as a result of the pandemic.

An estimated 375,000 people were sent to evacuation centres during the storms and floods, including about 90,000 children, according to Flowers.

“Many of the evacuation sites were overcrowded, did not have access to sufficient water and sanitation and healthcare, and lacked appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children,’’ Flowers said, adding that the situation severely affected the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children.

A study brief published in August by the US-based Society for Research in Child Development showed that children may suffer longer-term physical and psychological deficits than adults, including difficulty sleeping or concentrating and losing interest in their usual activities – chronic mental health symptoms have been observed among children as long as four years after a disaster.

A woman carries food through the submerged streets of Hue in central Vietnam [File: Manan Vatsyana/AFP] “In the long run, to be sustainable, the Vietnamese government should invest more to strengthen mental health services for children and their families, looking at the nationwide system and also building the workforce,’’ Flowers said.

Deforestation, which affects the ability of the land to retain water, also contributed to the flooding and a series of severe landslides during the stormy season, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said at a legislative National Assembly meeting last month.

Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam lost 657,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of primary forest – 23 percent of its total tree-cover loss according to data from international monitoring service Global Forest Watch. About 50 percent of all tree-cover loss between 2001 and 2019 took place in 11 of the country’s 63 provinces – eight of them in central Vietnam, it said.

The devastating landslides and flooding have prompted concerns about deforestation caused by the construction of hydropower plants in forests.

As of 2018, there were 385 dams in operation, with an additional 143 under construction, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Earlier this month, the minister acknowledged the increased evidence of the loss of watershed forests and vegetation, as well as a loss of soil adhesion, as a result of the developments.

The government has also announced sustainable and long-term missions to cope with storms in central Vietnam, including upgrading climate-change adaptation scenarios and relocating people in areas at risk of landslide and flooding.

No place like home

For those who have been living in the area for generations, like the parents of 21-year-old university student Le Thi Thuyen, leaving their storm-battered homes seems unfathomable.

“We can be accustomed to annual storms but whenever they come, we are still worried,” said Thuyen, a native of Quang Binh, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the central region.

Thuyen, who left for Ho Chi Minh City to study and is currently an intern at a non-governmental organisation in Vietnam’s biggest city, called her parents and siblings back home every day when the storms were pounding their commune, flooding and isolating homes in low-lying areas.

Tears welled up in her eyes when she thought of her 12-year-old brother who does not know how to swim.

Cemeteries were inundated as floodwaters rose in central Vietnam [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “I read news about kids who got swept away by the flood and I was really worried about my brother,” the 21-year-old said.

Thuyen’s parents, who make a living from agriculture and working on other people’s farms, have already been struggling this year because of the pandemic – and the storm season has created more problems, destroying their crops, and fish. It also meant weeks when there were no jobs to be found.

“Tet this year won’t be as fulfilling as others for us,” Thuyen said. “This time, it won’t be my parents supporting me, but I will be supporting them with what I can.”","Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/000_8V93XX-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['vietnam', 'children', 'storms', 'water', 'change', 'pieces', 'central', 'relentless', 'floods', 'parents', 'living', 'pick', 'vietnamese', '2020s', 'climate']", ,flood

By Vatican News staff writer

Volunteers and workers of Caritas Vietnam are visiting and assisting people in the central provinces who have to face the brunt of 13 storms this year with some severe flooding.

The umpteenth storm

In just over a month, Vietnam's central region has seen 7 tropical storms and typhoons, causing floods and landslides that killed 235 people and caused an estimated $740,000 in damage in several provinces. The rain from the storms has caused the worst flooding in the region in more than 30 years.

The latest of these typhoons, Vamco, made landfall in Vietnam on Sunday with winds of up to 150 kph, after leaving 67 dead in the Philippines. The storm has damaged more than 400,000 homes, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. At least 150,000 people are at risk of going hungry.

According to Caritas, the social arm of the Catholic Church, rebuilding homes and recovering their livelihood are extremely important apart from immediate help and survival. Farming, such as growing vegetables, rice, raising livestock and poultry, which is the mainstay in the central provinces, has been devastated. Many families have lost everything in the floods and landslides.



Local Caritas in action

The new director of Caritas Vietnam, Father Joseph Ngo Si Dinh, led a delegation to the central provinces, Nov. 9-11, to survey the flooded areas. They first visited the Diocese of Hu? and its two adjoining provinces, talking to families and providing them material and spiritual support.

Father John Nguyen Huy Tuan, director of Caritas Ha Tinh, said priests were actively involved in bringing food and relief to the affected people and moving them to safer places.

Temporary shelters have been built to accommodate 25 families. A parish mobilised its young people to rescue families trapped in flooded homes.

No one excluded

Caritas Vietnam, in collaboration with dioceses and parishes, has been engaged in social outreach and charity works to help people after natural disasters.

The social arm of the Catholic Church assists people to rebuild their lives, repair damaged houses and build new homes for families who have lost theirs. It also provides people and families with seeds, livestock, water filtering systems, and finance for school children.

Caritas discussed ways to come up with concrete plans or projects to rebuild the lives of people regardless of their religion. Father Dinh has urged Catholics to help every person in need. “We hope that the people most affected by these storms, be they Catholic or not, will get some relief,” the Caritas director said.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/reuters/2020/10/13/14/1602592734645.JPG/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'storms', 'provinces', 'flood', 'caritas', 'social', 'homes', 'central', 'region', 'families', 'typhoons', 'storm', 'victims', 'assisting']", ,flood

On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.

The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.

The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.

On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh 400-500 mm, Quang Tri 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City 1,100 mm, Quang Nam 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai 600-800 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In this period, more than 130,000 houses, mostly in Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue provinces had been flooded, with some submerged by four meters.

Streak of tragedies

Around 3 a.m. on October 8, cargo vessel Vietship 01 of a Hanoi-based logistics firm was swept away by floods and rough seas as it docked at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri.

The ship had 12 male crew members on board when swept off. Four crew members who had fallen from the vessel made it safely to shore on October 9 and 10. One member, aged 45, had also jumped into the water but went missing before his body was retrieved on October 11.

Heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas derailed rescue efforts and the vessel sank to the bottom in shallow waters, leaving the rest of the crew and one fisherman, part of a rescue squad, stranded at sea.

It took rescue teams three days to reach the stranded vessel.

""It was difficult for modern vessels to reach the stranded ship so we had to rely on rudimentary boats and experienced fishermen for the mission,"" explained Colonel Le Van Phuong, head of Quang Tri Border Guard.

On the morning of October 11, the fisherman and a crew member jumped into the water and battled their way back through the rough seas and strong waves. Two teams of rescuers rushed to deliver them safely to shore.

Within the same day, a military helicopter was sent to the scene to rescue the remaining six crew members stuck on the vessel. Two days after he was rescued, however, ship captain Nguyen Van Bao, 51, passed away due to multiple organ failure and sepsis.

At midnight on October 12, a hill collapsed onto an operation center of Rao Trang 3 Hydropower Plant, located deep in a jungle of Phong Xuan Commune, Phong Dien District in Thua Thien-Hue.

The landslide buried 17 workers after 40 others escape to a nearby plant, called Rao Trang 4.

The story of the 17 workers is even more tragic since a 21-member rescue team that had set out to verify reports of their predicament got struck by the same calamity.

At midnight the next day, a landslide had buried the ranger station housing the entire rescue team. Only eight members managed to escape, with the remaining 13 confirmed dead, including Major General Nguyen Van Man, deputy commander of the 4th Military Region of Vietnam People's Army. The bodies of the 13 victims have all been found and identified, though only five of the 17 workers' bodies have been retrieved.

During funeral procedures for the 12 soldiers and their deputy commander, another landslide struck a barracks housing 27 personnel of Defense Economics Division 337, also managed by the 4th Military Region.

The division had been assigned to assist five remote communes in Huong Hoa District of Quang Tri, which borders Laos, in mitigating the impacts of prolonged flooding and landslides triggered by abnormally heavy downpours across the central region.

As the mountain collapsed onto their barracks in the first hours of October 19, the 27 division members were all sleeping, with only five managing to escape. Three more landslides buried the remaining 22.

By the afternoon of that day, all 22 bodies had been retrieved.

Luong Thi Ly, who lost her son Le The Linh to the landslide, said she could not believe he and his comrades had lost their lives during peace time.

New flood waves

And as mountainous areas reeled under repeated landslides, urban and coastal areas were hit by a new wave of flooding on October 18 and 20 due to the impact of tropical storms, the intertropical convergence zone and east winds in tandem with water discharged from dam projects.

On October 18, flood peaks recorded on the Hieu River of Quang Tri hit 5.36 m, passing the record level of 1983 by 0.78 m, while the peak on the Thach Han River rose to 7.4 m, 0.11 m higher than the 1999 record. In Quang Binh, floodwaters were measured at 4.88 m on October 19, or 0.97 m higher than the record in 1999.

For the second flood wave, more than 177,000 households in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri were inundated by floodwaters 1-4 m deep.

Many elderly people in Ha Tinh said for the past 40 years, they had never seen such severe flooding causing such serious damage.

In Quang Binh's Le Thuy District, a family who lost their 75-year-old grandmother, on October 17, had to hang her coffin from the roof of their house for nearly a week to avoid floodwaters.

More storms, floods and landslides

With heavy rains yet to show any signs of receding, Storm Saudel developed in the East Sea on October 20, though it had weakened and turned into a tropical depression as it reached the central coast on October 25.

Two days later, Molave entered the East Sea and headed straight to central Vietnam. It landed over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28 as the most powerful storm to have hit Vietnam in 20 years.

The storm had inflicted economic damage worth around VND10 trillion ($430.16 million), according to statistics from affected provinces. The loss was nearly 1.5 times higher than 2019’s total natural disaster-induced damage of VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), mostly ascribed to flooding, storms and landslides.

Subsequently, the storm triggered heavy rains that had led to more floods and landslides.

On October 28 alone, two different landslides struck Tra Leng and Tra Van communes in Quang Nam’s Nam Tra My District.

The Tra Van landslide buried 20, killing eight and injuring 12 while in Tra Leng, a mountain collapsed on 53 villagers, with 33 managing to escape, eight confirmed dead, and 12 still missing.

One day later in Phuoc Loc Commune, Phuoc Son District of Quang Nam, another landslide buried 11 victims. Seven have since been confirmed dead and four are still missing.

A survivor of the Tra Leng landslide, Nguyen Thanh Son, 56, had lost his wife to the accident. The bereaved husband cannot believe he has lost his family, house and entire village in the mere blink of an eye.

""Altogether, tumbling soil, mud, rocks, water and trees smashed in the roofs of our houses, sweeping everything away until hitting the foot of another mountain,"" Son recalled.

By the night of October 28, more than 4,000 families in Nghe An and Ha Tinh had been evacuated to safety after their neighborhoods had been submerged by up to two meters of water.

The third flood lasted until October 30 and by November 1, had receded.

While central Vietnam residents recuperate from Storm Molave and prior flooding, Storm Goni entered the East Sea on Monday morning, forecast to strike central areas from Da Nang to Phu Yen in the next few days.","Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/02/huu-khoa-tang-le-1-1603267441-7792-8579-1604304150_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'quang', 'central', 'landslide', 'month', 'tragedies', 'mm', 'crew', 'storm', 'rescue', 'day', 'm']", ,flood

A search operation has been launched for a missing rescue team as severe flooding and landslides battered central Vietnam, authorities said on Wednesday, as the country braced for further heavy rain.

Close to a million people have been impacted by heavy downpours and rising waters since mid last week, with more than 200,000 homes flooded, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Thirty-six people are now dead, Vietnam's disaster management authority said, while rescue workers have launched a search for around 30 people missing at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue province following landslides.

The missing include a team of soldiers and officials who had tried to find plant workers who disappeared days ago.

Images on state media showed helicopters and hundreds of soldiers struggling to access the site through thick mud and fallen trees.

Elsewhere across the central region, villages and rice fields were submerged, with relief workers resorting to makeshift boats and canoes to deliver food and bottled water to those stuck in flooded homes.

North central Vietnam was also hit by severe weather on Wednesday as Storm Nangka made landfall.

Forecasters said it could bring further rain in the coming days, while warning another storm was expected to form and make impact this weekend.

The IFRC said it had ""grave fears"" that the deadly floods would worsen as more rain was dumped on hard hit communities.

""These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods,"" said IFRC's Hung Ha Nguyen.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and is often affected by more than a dozen storms each year, regularly bringing flooding and landslides.

More then 130 people were reported dead or missing due to natural disasters in the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. “I wasn’t sad,” Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017’s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tay’s land. “That’s what I had to do.” He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldn’t be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasn’t wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. “Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them,” landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a “soft” levee girding the riverbank. She doesn’t view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. “The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and you’ve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made.” Dao’s mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, “a very sensitive and fragile area where ‘hard’ solutions [to erosion] won’t work”, said Dao, who has studied the region’s ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The “common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land”, Dao says. “Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down.” As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Dao’s words, “by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous”. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tay’s riverbank is like a pillow that doesn’t stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Dao’s green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses — a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, “people aren’t afraid of flooding”, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. “We have learnt to live with the floods,” he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. “Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive,” he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yen’s fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the island’s west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals’ trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the city’s famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes aren’t simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi An’s recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground. Dr Dao Ngo bought her own land in Triem Tay village to do her conservation work. Credit:Yen Duong “Now the ecological component is extremely important. In the past it was culture, now it’s ecology,” Hoi An’s vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local government’s development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. “Of course, it is difficult and it will take time,” says Hung. “Perhaps we won’t succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation.” As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemic’s wake, Hung doesn’t want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the city’s revenue. “We’ve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, there’ll be less to worry about.“

Ecology-based development, in Hung’s words, also means preserving the city’s forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. “If we achieve that, we’ll be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals’ life will definitely be improved.” Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. “You don’t see erosion here, but build-up [of land],” said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. “I’ve never seen these trees die because of flooding,” said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the river’s mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huong’s family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as “a fortune” on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river. Le Thi Huong, 59, a mangrove palm farmer, in her home made from the palms in Cam Thanh commune. Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. “The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; that’s why they protect it,” Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tay’s sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi An’s toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

The death toll from flooding and landslides in Vietnam continued to rise Tuesday, while those hit by the disasters triggered by tropical storms in the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos criticized government inaction and made urgent appeals for assistance.

In Vietnam, at least 104 people are dead in the country’s central region, with 49, 27, and 11 deaths reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam alone, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Control. Twenty-seven people are missing, including 15 workers from a hydropower plant in Quang Tri that was hit by a landslide on Oct. 12.

The committee said that some 90,000 residents of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Tri provinces have been evacuated to higher ground. Nearly 7,000 hectares of rice paddy and crop fields have been submerged, while more than 5,800 head of cattle and 685,000 poultry birds have been killed or carried away in floods.

Vietnamese state media on Tuesday reported that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved the allocation of 100 billion Vietnamese dong (U.S. $4.3 million) and 1,000 tons of rice to the five worst flood-hit provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Ha Tinh.

Meanwhile, the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre said a tropical depression in the Philippines has strengthened into what is being called Storm Saudel. Over the next 24 hours, Saudel is expected to enter the South China Sea—called the East Sea in Vietnam—and become the eighth storm to batter Vietnam’s central provinces since the start of the rainy season.

Tran Quang Nang, head of the weather forecasting department under the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre, rejected reports circulating on Facebook, allegedly citing Japanese forecasters, that Saudel is a super typhoon.

“All of these predictions about Typhoon Saudel are baseless and fake,” Nang said. “The Japanese weather forecasting center and other countries have said no such thing.”

Nang called on the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to “punish” those responsible for spreading inaccurate information on social networks, causing public confusion.

“This issue should be handled promptly to ensure people only access accurate information released by the authorities so they can respond to natural disasters, helping to mitigate the damage they cause,” he said.

In Cambodia, the death toll remained at 25 from a day earlier, with some 40,000 evacuated to temporary shelters, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha told RFA’s Khmer Service. More than 200,000 hectares of paddy field and nearly 80,000 farms have also been destroyed, with more than 500 school buildings and 79 garment factories damaged.

Roads, hospitals, and dams have also been affected, authorities said.

In a notice issued on Tuesday, the Poipet Administration of Banteay Meanchey province, along Cambodia’s border with Thailand, temporarily closed portions of National Road 5. Downtown Poipet saw flooding of homes and roads, which the notice attributed to rains in Thailand.

Sann Ratha, a resident of Kaun Damrei village, in Poipet’s Sangkat Nimith district, told RFA that water levels increased so rapidly that several hundred families were forced to leave their homes.

He said people are stranded and in desperate need of food and other supplies.

“We are under the attack from the flood—our village looks like a river now with water everywhere and houses submerged,” he said.

“The current situation is worse than during the [1967-1975] civil war. We need the authorities to help us immediately.”

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen traveled to affected areas visiting with victims and handing out food. He said in a post to his Facebook page that he plans to spend two days in hard-hit Banteay Meanchey province, where 13 of the country’s 25 deaths have occurred and an estimated 20,000 families have been affected.

Opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha is also traveling to Banteay Meanchey to provide assistance.

Din Puthy, head of the Poipet-based Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association, expressed skepticism over the government’s handling of the flooding Tuesday.

He voiced concerns that authorities appear to prefer taking selfies with small numbers of villagers and posting them on social media to pretend they are helping the victims.

“The victims are not receiving equal treatment,” he said. “Only a few people have received some assistance while many others have been left behind.”

More aid needed

In Laos, where storms have ravaged Savannakhet province in the country’s center, authorities remained unable to access many areas due to damaged roads and a lack of boats to transport aid and other supplies, Lao sources said.

More than 125 villages in eight districts have now been flooded, with many houses and over 10,000 hectares of paddy fields submerged, official sources in the province say. Nearly 30,000 people have been impacted in Savannakhet, according to official count.

An official from Savannakhet’s inundated Phin district told RFA Tuesday that people are in need of dry goods, drinking water, medicine, and other necessities. The official said that while most aid had been distributed it still is not enough.

“In Phin district, 45 villages are heavily flooded, but they have received some help already—they mostly need sticky rice and consumer goods,” he said.

He said villagers with boats had been using them to help one another and that there have been no accidents during rescue and supply operations.

A villager in Phin told RFA that the water level is so high that the local river had flooded homes along its banks and urged authorities to provide more assistance.

“They have helped a little, but it’s very difficult for us,” he said. “Higher-level authorities should take care of this. We’re asking for more rice—all houses need rice to eat.”

Authorities in Savannakhet’s Xonbury district said waters remain high and will rise in days to come, forcing villagers to stay in clubs, schools, and other places set up by the local government as temporary shelters until flooding recedes.

According to the Meteorology Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Laos will continue to endure heavy rains and strong winds throughout the country in coming days. It urged villagers to remain vigilant for flash floods and landslides.

Storm Molave, which made landfall at around 11 am local time on Wednesday, is one of the strongest storms to hit the southeast Asian nation in 20 years.

The resulting “extreme rainfall” could continue over the coming days, worsening the already precarious situation faced by many families, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a statement.

“For the affected populations, their homes remain severely damaged, their food stocks have been lost, they have no access to clean water for drinking, washing and cooking; and water and sanitation systems have been damaged,” said the agency.

Evacuation centres flooded

Thousands have been moved to evacuation centres, which are themselves flooded, resulting in difficult health and hygiene conditions for the displaced people, primarily women, children and elderly. Health centres have also been damaged, leaving without to access basic health care services.

“Added to this is the trauma of the violent storms and rushing waters, that for a population where many cannot swim, creates fear and impacts mental wellbeing,” UNICEF added.

The storm has also damaged vital infrastructure, including electricity and roads, leaving many communities cut off from assistance and protection.

Affected populations

An estimated 7.7 million people live in the affected areas, including as many as 1.5 million who have been “directly affected”, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam said in a humanitarian update late Wednesday.

Of these, some 177,000 people considered vulnerable (poor or near-poor), should be prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance, it added.

Response

According to the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UN agencies and partners are developing and will release a multi-sector response plan, within the coming days, to support emergency relief efforts.

In the immediate term, UNICEF has mobilized to provide emergency water, nutrition, sanitation, education and protection support, it said in the statement. It is also coordinating with Government agencies and humanitarian actors to reach the most vulnerable and those most affected.

The Vietnamese army has also deployed troops and vehicles for search and rescue missions.","Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production+Library/29-10-2020-UNICEF-UN0354393-VietNam.jpg/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['storms', 'nam', 'water', 'viet', 'health', 'strikes', 'typhoon', 'millions', 'damaged', 'unicef', 'affected', 'vulnerable', 'centres', 'support', 'humanitarian', 'devastating']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The central region of Viet Nam was experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimetres of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 150 millimetres of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. Additionally, Tropical Storm Saudel hit Viet Nam on 25 October closely followed by Typhoon Molave on 28 October. Typhoon Molave was one of the most devastating typhoons making landfall in Vietnam in decades. The typhoon made landfall after a series of tropical storms hitting Viet Nam and had caused severe flooding and at least three landslides which tragically resulted in the loss of 40 lives. 44 people are still missing, and six people are severely injured. On 5 November, Typhoon Goni made landfall in Viet Nam and Tropical Storm Atsani made landfall on 7 November. Tropical storm Vamco, was the latest to hit central Viet Nam as it made landfall on 15 November 2020.

The recurrent storms bringing heavy rainfall have caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. The Viet Nam National Disaster Management Agency (VNDMA) has reported that many areas in central Vietnam recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 1,600 millimeters between 5 to 20 October 2020, with peaks of 2,400 millimeters in some locations over the same period. The Hieu River (Quang Tri), Bo River (Hue), Gianh River and Kien Giang River (Quang Binh) have reached historically high levels, and in some locations flood waters have exceeded the previous historical highs recorded in 1979 and 1999. In addition, hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs to prevent them from bursting.

Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Authorities estimate that a nearly eight million people have been exposed to the storms, and some 1.5 million people have been directly affected by the storms and floods. On 4 November, ahead of typhoon Goni’s landfall, 98,819 households (372,631 people) in six provinces (Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen) were evacuated to safe shelters. Similarly, evacuations took place on 7 November in anticipation of typhoon Atsani, and on the 15th November ahead of typhoon Vamco’s landfall additional evacuations have been carried out in seven provinces of central Viet Nam with a total of 93,795 households (324,780 people) evacuated to safer places (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai).

Most of the people who had been evacuated have now returned home after their local authorities’ approval. They are actively repairing their homes with the help of their relatives. However, according to the VNDMA 31,637 households must be urgently relocated because they lost their shelter or their houses which have collapsed or been too heavily damaged, and they are now living with host families. After the latest typhoon (Vamco), according to the VNDMA, at least 243 are reported to have been killed or are missing and over two million livestock have been killed or swept away. The floods have caused significant damage to infrastructure including roads, schools, health centres and community facilities. It is reported that 1,569 schools have been affected included 360 schools flooded or damaged, while 46,916 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people are now in desperate needs of emergency relief, such as safe shelter, safe drinking water, food and livelihood income support.","Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1546577-MDRVN020eu1.png?itok=7nf8va0m,"['vietnam', 'n', 'nam', 'update', 'mdrvn020', 'quang', 'provinces', 'viet', 'storms', 'emergency', 'tropical', 'typhoon', 'n1', 'floods', 'central', 'storm', 'operation', 'landfall']", ,flood

These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.

Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.

The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.

As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing.

In addition, 150,000 people have been evacuated and significant impacts on transportation networks and agricultural livelihoods have been reported.

USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance partner VNRC is on the frontline of the response and has mobilized rapid disaster response teams established and trained through ongoing USAID disaster risk reduction programs to support evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency response operations, said the ambassador.

""We stand together with the government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones, address the damage caused by this terrible flood, and move forward, as the people of Vietnam have always done. We pledge to assist you in your work to rebuild,"" he said.

""I would also like to express my concern for persons with disabilities in the provinces affected by the typhoon as they are amongst the most vulnerable populations in this disaster. They are often home-bound, have less access to information and cannot take full advantage of preparedness activities and evacuation protocols,"" he added.

It is estimated that the provinces impacted by storm Linfa are home to over 200,000 persons with disabilities, of whom 61,000 are directly affected by this disaster.

Since 2000, USAID, through the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, has provided over $26 million in disaster response, preparedness, and risk reduction assistance in Vietnam.

Through the Department of Defense, the U.S. government has also provided more than $28 million since 1998 to train military and civilian emergency responders and develop and equip disaster management centers, maritime response centers, and disaster shelters at community level.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/17/anh124581602340198-1602931391-3782-3057-1602931440_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'response', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'central', 'aids', 'floods', 'landslide', 'usaid', 'affected', 'linfa', '100000', 'cope', 'provided']", ,flood

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to bring them to safety beyond rising floodwater in Cambodia’s western province of Battambang, which is expected to worsen on Sunday.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces – Pursat, Battambang and Pailin – have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall heralding the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

“A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,” Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told the AFP news agency late on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to get worse.

In central Vietnam, almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking northern Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand’s Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to place sandbags and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial Governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Last year, central Vietnam, particularly the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Quang Ngai and Quang Nam, were wrecked by a series of storms and tropical depressions.

The resulting floods and landslides killed at least 192 people and caused property losses of around VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion). More than 1,500 houses were destroyed and 240,000 others damaged. The daily lives of around 5.5 million people were severely disrupted.

The fully probabilistic model provides countrywide coverage and enables insurers to assess their exposure to floods, which affect 70 percent of the country’s population.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue simulating both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding. The fluvial component of the hazard was developed using state-of-the-art hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate rainfall and river discharges across the river network in the country. Pluvial flooding is simulated using a proprietary, in-house methodology accounting for local climate conditions, soil type, land use and topography.

Offering enhanced flexibility, the model can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves, and average annual losses at virtually any level of aggregation. The model outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk® platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region. “The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon. These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.

The storm also set off landslides and knocked out power lines, leaving 1.7 million people in the dark.



Storm Molave, the ninth storm this year in the South China Sea and the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years, struck coastal provinces on Oct. 28 with heavy rainfall and winds as high as 115-135 km per hour, according to data provided by Vietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting on Wednesday.



Landslides in central provinces have killed at least 19 people and buried more than 40 others, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, adding that the bodies of 12 fishermen missing since the storm hit on Wednesday were recovered on Thursday, leaving another 14 still unaccounted for.



Around 56,000 houses were stripped of their roofs in Quang Ngai, where a massive blackout from downed power lines left more than a million people trapped in darkness as high winds tore through the province, according to state-controlled Vietnam News, AP said.



Wednesday’s storm hit central regions already devastated by weeks of heavy rains, floods, and landslides beginning Oct. 6 that left at least 130 dead and thousands displaced. The floods and landslides also wrecked highways and roads, blocking efforts to rescue and bring supplies to many cut off from help in remote areas.



Speaking to RFA on Thursday, residents in storm-hit provinces described fast-rising waters and devastated fields, with one saying that floodwaters had risen more quickly now than they had during the storms that battered the area earlier this month.



“During previous storms and floods, the water rose only to the height of my hand. But now the water rose so high that my house was submerged,” Hien Thao, a resident of Quang Tri province, speaking to RFA on Oct. 29.



“I lost 500 kg of paddy rice, and many of my household belongings were washed away,” he said.



“Yesterday, the water rose up to the yard of my house,” added 40-year-old Phan Quoc Vu of Truong Xa commune in Cam Lo district’s Cam Hieu village in Quang Tri. “But luckily it began to recede today,” he said.



“In the opinion of my 80-year-old father, this was the worst storm flooding that he can remember,” Vu said.



Calls for help



At the height of the flood, Vu called unsuccessfully to local authorities for help, and even posted calls for help on social media, but finally had to hire canoes to help evacuate elderly people and young children to safer ground, he said.



In Ninh Thuan province, villagers had made their living mainly through farming and raising shrimp, said Tran Thanh Truc, a resident of the province’s Hien Luong commune.



“But the floodwaters washed everything away—pigs, chickens, and shrimp,” she said. “We are glad to receive whatever help others can give us, but it will be difficult to make up for everything that was lost.”



In Quang Tri, supplies including large quantities of rice have been received so far only from volunteers, Hien Thao said, adding that the local People’s Committee has promised to bring relief goods soon.



“I also learned that the government will provide us with seeds for farming our next crop in the winter and spring.”



“We would like them to also give us boats and other equipment we need, along with rice that will help us while we wait for our next crop to be ready for harvest,” he said.



In Truong Xa commune, officials have cared so far only for their own relatives, though, Pham Quoc Vu said.



“They are not impartial, which is causing much suspicion,” he said.



Heavy rains, flooding in Laos



In Laos, heavy rains and flooding from Wednesday’s storm damaged or destroyed around 51,000 hectares of agricultural production, including more than 23,000 hectares of rice fields, across 13 districts of Savannakhet province, state media sources said on Friday.



Total losses in farm production and livestock from flooding in the storm are now estimated at 283 billion kip (U.S. $6,257,968.), Keoodom Souliya—an official from the province’s Agriculture and Forestry Department—said on Thursday.



In the southern province of Champassak, strong winds toppled power lines, while in Borikhamxay province, Khamkeut district’s Napae village was completely destroyed by floods, a video obtained by RFA showed on Friday, with a narrator on the video saying Napae had now become “a sea of water.”



The video also showed floods and landslides blocking the road leading from Napae to the Naphao International Border Checkpoint with Vietnam.



A rice paddy being harvested was also under water, Phetsamai Xayaathichak told local media. “We will announce the exact amount of local damage later, once we know what it is,” he said.



A total number of deaths in Laos resulting from the storm was not immediately available.

The government decided to grant VND500 billion ($21.52 million) to five central provinces worst hit by historic flooding for rescue and social welfare support.

The five provinces, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Nam, would receive VND100 billion each as part of the government’s efforts to help local communities overcome the consequences of devastating floods, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh sait at a meeting in Quang Tri on Thursday morning.

The government also provided each of the five provinces with 1,000 tons of rice alongside medicine and antiseptic chemicals.

Senior Lieutenant General Le Chiem, Deputy Minister of National Defense, said the ministry has provided 22 tons of dried food to flooded provinces. For Quang Tri, military forces also provided seven motorboats, 36 generators and three water pumps for after-flood clean-up work along with 1,000 life jackets.

Chiem suggested local authorities distribute dried food to victims in flood-prone areas immediately and properly.

In the past, the defense ministry found ""some local leaders had given dried food to officials as gifts because it was delicious,"" Chiem said. ""The dried food is meant for flood victims. They are in need.""

Binh said damage caused by floods in Quang Tri was ""very huge,"" especially in the two mountainous districts of Huong Hoa and Dak Rong where infrastructure has been heavily affected.

Therefore, the government has granted an additional VND40 billion for these two districts to cope with the flood impacts.

Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said floodwater started receding gradually, so it is necessary to focus on relief for flood victims, from Quang Nam to Ha Tinh.

Many international organizations have pledged donations of cash and disaster relief to help central Vietnam.

For more than two weeks, the central region has been swept by historic flooding and deadly landslides that caused damage described by government officials as worst in five years.

At least 114 people in central Vietnam were killed by severe flooding and landslides and more than 170,000 houses in flood-prone Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces have been submerged, with many areas currently isolated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/huukhoatangle21603267443-16033-3261-6190-1603358848_1200x0.jpg,"['floodhit', 'dried', 'vietnam', 'binh', 'mln', 'quang', 'aid', 'provinces', '21', 'disaster', 'minister', 'central', 'grants', 'food', 'victims', 'support', 'tri', 'provided']", ,flood

She said the UNDP plans to build an additional 4,000 houses next year, helping 20,000 people gain access to information on climate change and natural disasters, she said, adding that her agency would continue to support Vietnam in natural disaster management over the next decade.

Tran Quang Hoai, head of the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority, said the houses built by the UNDP in central Vietnam were still standing after the region’s historic storms and floods in October and November, which had demolished over 1,500 houses and damaged 240,000 others.

La Thi Kim Ngan, deputy head of the National Institute of Architecture, said that authorities and investors need to create a comprehensive model for housing complexes, complete with infrastructure like electricity, clean water and waste management systems.

Flood resilient houses can become homestay accommodations and help the region develop economically, she added.

Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said his ministry was cooperating with the architecture institute and the Ministry of Construction to develop appropriate and safe housing models to withstand natural disasters.

It is estimated that by 2025, Vietnam would have around 30 million people living in areas prone to natural disasters. Many of them are likely to be poverty stricken.

Rapid urbanization and economic development can intensify natural disaster risks for Vietnam's coastline and wipe billions of dollars off its economic growth over the next decade, a World Bank report warned in October.

Around 11.8 million people in coastal provinces face the threat of intense flooding, and over 35 percent of settlements are located on eroding coastlines. Each year, an average of $852 million, along with around 316,000 jobs in sectors like agriculture, aquaculture and tourism, are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding, the report said.","Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/17/img065481941608185336-16082067-5924-6541-1608206823_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'needs', 'proof', 'flood', 'disaster', 'undp', 'coast', 'management', 'development', 'natural', 'vietnams', 'million', '100000', 'houses', 'coastal']", ,flood

Another powerful storm is testing Southeast Asian disaster responders after Typhoon Goni crashed into the Philippines on 1 November, before veering towards flood-hit central Vietnam.

Goni, known as Rolly in the Philippines, made landfall on Sunday on Catanduanes Island in the country’s east, bringing violent winds and extensive flooding. The Red Cross says there’s “massive devastation” in some areas, including 90 percent of the homes in villages in one part of Catanduanes.

Philippine authorities are still assessing the total damage, but the government said 11 people had died as of 2 November, with numbers still rising.

The evacuation of at least 450,000 people and early response planning helped avoid a worse outcome, but aid groups warn that the combined hit from a barrage of recent storms and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will test communities for months to come.

The Philippines has been locked in disaster response mode for weeks after previous storms caused extensive flooding in parts of Luzon, the country’s main island. Typhoon Molave, known as Quinta in the Philippines, killed at least 23 people in October; Typhoon Saudel, known as Pepito, struck days earlier.

Attention now turns to Vietnam, which is preparing for a weakened Goni to strike its flood-hit central region around 5 November – the country’s fifth major storm since mid-October.

Typhoon Goni’s wind speeds slowed to around 90 kilometres per hour by 2 November, but successive storms over the past month have driven severe floods and landslides across central Vietnam.

Vietnam’s government says roughly 160 people have died, with dozens more missing in the worst flooding to hit the country in 20 years. The disasters have inundated more than a quarter of a million homes, and prompted a $40 million humanitarian appeal targeting 177,000 people.

The Philippines isn’t in the clear, either. Another storm, Atsani or Siony, could careen toward northern Luzon in the coming days, though forecasters say its current path is extremely erratic.

Floods are common during Asia’s various monsoon and cyclone seasons, but aid groups say the damage has been particularly severe this year.

Typhoon Goni was the strongest storm to hit the country since 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,300 people and led to a massive humanitarian response.

Climate change is fuelling more volatile extreme weather across the globe. The Philippines’ first typhoon of the season, Vongfong or Ambo, arrived relatively early in May; the storm season typically hits its peak in July.

Posting on Twitter, Yeb Saño, who was the Philippines’ climate negotiator when Haiyan struck in 2013, said Typhoon Goni and the burst of recent extreme weather is further proof of a crisis.

“The climate emergency persists and is wreaking havoc,” he said.

Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam.

The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.

The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.

The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.

As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.

Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light.""

Australia is already making ongoing efforts to support Vietnam’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $10.5 million assistance package in June.

Earlier this week the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management, the United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

""From 2 a.m. until now, there have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,"" local official Ha Ngoc Duong said, as reported by Vietnamese newspaper VnExpress, warning that the situation could worsen.

The bodies of some 22 soldiers from the army camp were recovered early on Sunday morning, according to local media reports. Ongoing rain has hampered rescue efforts. Days before, 13 rescue team members died trying to reach a group of 30 employees of a hydropower plant that had been buried by the landslides.

The rains have flooded nearly 200,000 houses in the region.

Widespread damage

Authorities also warned that river levels in the country had reached their highest in two decades, state media said.

The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides. Torrential downpours have flooded nearly 200,000 houses and 300 schools in the region.

Since storms began on October 6, some 72 people have died and a further 19 are still missing, Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said in a report.

Though Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, which often bring flooding and landslides, this month's disaster has been the worst the country has faced in years.

Neighboring Cambodia has also been affected by heavy flooding in the region. The death toll there jumped to 20 on Saturday, according to disaster management authorities.

Several areas of Vietnam hit by the worst floods in decades. In the last month, torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing, and created hardship for 240 thousand families. Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs mobilized. The strengthening of relations between the two countries can be linked to the US's anti-Beijing strategies.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) - Taiwan has donated 400,000 US dollars in aid to Vietnam to support the local population, hit by the worst floods and landslides in decades. In the past two weeks, storms no. 6 and 7 have caused serious damage in the central-northern provinces of Hà Tinh, Qu?ng Bình, Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên-Hu? and in the central-southern ones Ðà N?ng, Qu?ng Nam, Qu?ng Ngãi, Bình Ð?nh and Phú Yên.

The Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention reports that torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing since late September. River levels have risen rapidly in central areas of Vietnam, flooding 212 municipalities inhabited by 240 thousand families.

Many communities are isolated; at the moment in the devastated areas it is possible to move mostly with small boats. Victims are in immediate need of food, bottled water, medicine, clothing, blankets and books.

At the end of the emergency, money will be needed for reconstruction, especially seeds and agricultural machinery. Many Vietnamese have mobilized to support the flood victims. Groups of young people, including Catholics, brought rice, spaghetti (noodles) and drinking water to the most remote flooded areas.

Richard Shih, Taiwanese representative in Hanoi, said that Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs operating in Vietnam have mobilized and sent aid to disaster areas. He hopes the victims can rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon.

The aid delivery ceremony took place on 23 October in the presence of Tr?n Quang Hoài, director of the Vietnamese agency for the management of natural disasters. The Hanoi representative thanked the generosity of the government and the people of Taiwan, stressing that the distribution of aid will start as soon as possible.

The Taiwanese authorities highlighted the strong ties that unite their country to Vietnam. More than 320,000 Vietnamese migrants live and work in Taiwan; Taipei is Hanoi's seventh trading partner, with a turnover of 13.5 billion euros in 2019. The two nations also share fears about the growth of Chinese power, an aspect that links the strengthening of their relations with the United States anti-Beijing strategy in the region.","Mon, 26 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM-TAIWAN_-_1026_-_Aiuti_ter.jpg,"['areas', 'donates', 'vietnam', 'dollars', 'aid', 'flood', 'taiwan', 'qu?ng', 'mobilized', 'vietnamese', 'caused', '400000', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

Huynh Kim Luong was standing in a corner of his home, struggling to find a spot for guests to sit. The pots, pans and clothes scattered around the house were illuminated by the light of flickering candles.

""It has been 21 years since I saw such a flood,"" he said.

For the past 10 days the 60-year-old farmer and his family of three have barely stepped outside. In their Huong Toan Commune in Thua Thien-Hue, floods triggered by heavy rains have inundated over 2,000 homes. The only sounds they hear these days are the thump of rain falling on the roof, the clattering of windows in the wind, and distant hums of motorboats moving through the sea of water.

Like many people in central Vietnam, Luong and his wife Hoa were proud of their ability to live with floods. Since the beginning of this month, Hoa has been stocking up rice, dry fish and peanut on warnings of coming storms and rains. They knew not to stock up on meat since electricity is always cut when a storm hits. They were right.

On the morning of October 9 Luong opened his front door only to see the water almost reaching the threshold following heavy rain the previous night. As the hours passed and the rain showed no signs of relenting, the water started to come inside the house. Everywhere in the neighborhood, people were yelling that the floods had come.

Their eldest daughter, who is in her final year of high school, began to put all her books into plastic bags. Her parents waded around the house to salvage the family’s most valuable belongings like the refrigerator, TV and stove, and put them on a table that is reinforced with four blocks of wood.

Within a span of not even a day, Huong Toan turned from green paddy fields to muddy sea in the afternoon. With the electricity duly cut and dusk falling, the area, now flooded for dozens of kilometers along National Highway 1, slowly sank into darkness.

Also on October 9, in Huong Van Commune, about six kilometers away, Le Thi Thuc spent a sleepless night watching the water rise.

""I say ‘keeping watch,’ but the water will rise anyway even if I’m asleep. But my mind can be a little bit at rest if I watch it,"" she said.

The 54-year-old too has been confined at home for several days.

That night the entire family took refuge in the bedroom of her 85-year-old mother, whose room is situated farthest from the water. Thuc told her three children to go to sleep early, reminding them to turn off their phones to save the battery for the coming days without electricity.

Dung, her husband, shone the flashlight at the floor, sighing. The water was closing in. That night none of the three adults in the household slept a wink.

The local rice milling shop closed as soon as it started raining, catching Thuc off guard, leaving her no time to prepare enough food for the family.

Luckily her sister, who lives on higher ground, helped out, rowing a boat to Thuc’s house to deliver much-needed rice, bamboo shoot broth and boiled duck.

Seeing the family of six enjoying a meal sitting on a bed, surrounded by floodwater, Thuc could not help but weep.

For the next eight days the water ebbed and flowed. The children kept asking when the rain would stop, but the weather forecast kept getting gloomier.

The whole family had to shovel and sweep the mud and sludge entering the house. ""It was like walking in a swamp,"" they said.

Last Friday the water started to recede a little, going down to waist level, and Thuc took the opportunity to go out and buy some fish and vegetables. Looking around the neighborhood after being trapped inside the house for a week, she failed to recognize the place.

In Huong Toan, the situation has been grim. With the water showing no signs of receding, Hoang Trong Hieu, the commune chairman, other officials and police officers have not gone home for the last 10 days.

The group, which consists of over 20 people, has divided itself to take 24-hour shifts at the People’s Committee office to distribute supplies and respond to emergencies like transporting the injured and evacuating people.

Since the entire commune is under a meter of water, all travel is done by boat.

""It has been a long time since we saw our feet,"" a member of the group joked, carrying bags of rice on his shoulder in chest-deep water. The man had given Luong’s family two cartons of instant noodles the other day.

The day before electricity was cut, Luong’s had some vegetables, eggs and fish in the refrigerator, but only enough for two days for the family of three. So for the next eight days they had nothing to eat but rice and dry fish.

""I was given instant noodles but did not dare eat them because I did not want to urinate too much,"" he explained.

Luong’s wife, who had surgery just a month ago, stumbled in the dark and fell one night as she sought to go to the bathroom amid the sea of water. Since then he has been placing pots by the bed and replaces the candles twice every night.

""There are a lot of mosquitoes due to all the water.""

In Huong Van Commune, Nguyen Van Lieu, 63, has taken over the most dangerous task from his wife since the floods came: cooking. He dons his conical hat and raincoat every day to light the stove, standing in chest-deep water.

""If my wife gets into the water to cook, it will come up to her neck,"" he joked, patting his wife’s back with a smile.

Their house was almost completed earlier this year but the roof has not been finished. The family is among the luckier ones in the neighborhood since the water only comes up to the thighs even during the heaviest rains.

But the kitchen is a different story. There had been over 20 bags of rice, weighing over a ton, but everything was soaked the very first night. Vy, Lieu’s wife, had no choice but to give them away to her neighbors to feed their ducks and chickens. She has been borrowing rice from others.

They have not told their two eldest children, who are workers in the south, about their situation, not wanting to worry them.

Like many others, the couple have been trapped inside their home, situated just 100 m from the national highway, for more than a week. Every day Vy would cast her gaze on the other side of the highway to look at the paddy fields longingly despite realizing they must be submerged under water.

A few days before the rains came she had sold her first few gourds of the season. ""They sell well this year at VND10,000 (43 cents) per kilogram,"" she said. She was hoping to earn around VND10 million from selling them all over two months.

But that was before the storm came. She was only able to sell for two days, earning VND240,000, before she was forced to remain at home.

She and her husband have been reminiscing about the historic flood in Thua Thien Hue 21 years ago. The deluge in November 1999 had submerged thousands of houses and paralyzed all traffic and electrical and communication systems in the province. There had been rainfall of up to 2,300 mm in just the first three days. Several people had been swept away and killed during that disaster.

At that time the couple and their children stacked two beds on top of each other and waited for the floods to recede, the anguished voices of people who lost loved ones in the background.

Their son, seeing how his parents had to face flooding year after year, wanted to help them find a safer place to live in, but they cannot countenance moving out of their hometown.

More heavy rains are expected in central Vietnam regions at least until Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Rivers are expected to rise further, as is the risk of floods and landslides. Vehicles continue to line up along National Highway 1 and other roads on higher ground as people park their cars and motorbikes there to avoid the water.

But the people cannot do the same, they cannot just leave their houses. The only thing that Luong, Thuc and Lieu can do is to barricade themselves inside their homes and pray for the water to go away","Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/19/fbbdc0d9e2fe1ca045ef7172160297-3133-2038-1603105515_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'misery', 'rice', 'water', 'province', 'rain', 'thuc', 'floods', 'house', 'amid', 'days', 'wife', 'drowns', 'thua', 'night', 'family', 'continuing']", ,flood

Australia, Switzerland and Thailand have offered aid to victims of multiple storms and floods in central Vietnam last month.

The Australian embassy in Hanoi said on Friday its government will provide an additional AUD2 million ($1.45 million) to help Vietnam respond to the impacts of prolonged floods and landslides in the central region. The country had earlier provided AUD100,000 ($71,300).

The aid money will be used to meet urgent needs like providing clean water and sanitation and hygiene and dignity kits to affected people, and support the restoration of clean water supply to schools.

The Swiss embassy also announced grant of urgent aid worth CHF300,000 ($333,000) to help address the immediate needs of 160,000 people focusing on housing, livelihoods, healthcare, water, and hygiene.

In a phone call to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-o-cha, offered $30,000 toward relief efforts.

The central region was repeatedly hit by torrential rains, widespread flooding and landslides triggered by four storms in October.

So far 235 people have been killed or are missing, almost 390,000 houses were flooded and more than 300,000 families have been evacuated, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority.

Many people have lost almost all their household possessions or had their homes, food stocks, livestock, and crops badly damaged.

According to Tran Phuoc Anh, acting director of the city’s Foreign Department, the sustainable flood prevention project for Thu Duc City would have a total investment of more than $1bn, and would be implemented as a public–private project with the participation of the Dutch government.

Le Hoa Binh, deputy chair of HCMC, said he hoped the Netherlands would help create a city that was “sustainable and well adapted to climate change”.

Elizabeth Akkerman, the Dutch ambassador to Vietnam, said her government would help HCMC and Thu Duc City with advanced construction technologies.

Thu Duc will be based on advanced industries such as autonomous manufacturing, and will include the university precinct in Thu Duc as well as a new-build urban area and financial centre on the Thu Thiem Peninsula.

Thu Duc is the most elevated area in HCMC, but still suffers from seasonal flooding, and its residents suffer from inundation of streets and even houses every time there is heavy rain or a high tide.

In May 2019, HCMC sent a delegation to the Netherlands to study its urban development and flood management methods, and a number of memorandums of understanding were subsequently signed, including a $1bn anti-flooding project in Thu Duc City.

A tropical depression is projected to hit central Vietnam on Friday night, bringing heavy rains as the area struggles to recover from more than a week of flooding.

As of 10 a.m. Friday, the tropical depression was about 290 km to the east of Da Nang and Binh Dinh Province, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Its maximum wind speed was 50 kph.

Within the next 12 hours, the tropical depression would move west at about 30 kph, before making landfall in central Vietnam, then devolving into a low-pressure area over southern Laos.

By 10 p.m. Friday, the low-pressure area would be above the mountainous area of central Vietnam, with a maximum wind speed of 40 kph.

Rough seas and strong winds should be expected in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, within the next 24 hours.

Central Vietnam should expect particularly heavy rain from now until Wednesday next week, according to the center. Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and southern Nghe An should expect a total rainfall of up to 900 mm during the period, while Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and northern Nghe An should expect up to 500 mm.

Da Nang and its neighbor Quang Nam Province, home to popular ancient town Hoi An, should expect rainfall of up to 500 mm, while regions between Quang Ngai and Phu Yen should expect levels of up to 350 mm.

The Central Highlands should also expect heavy rain until Sunday, with rainfall of up to 250 mm.

Rains are expected to persist in central Vietnam even after Wednesday, the center noted.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Since last week, central Vietnam has been hit by torrential rains, floods and landslides after a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

On Sunday, Storm Linfa intensified from the turbulence and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. The next day, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

At least 56 people have been killed, including two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while coming to rescue the workers.

Torrential downpours and discharge of water from hydropower dams have caused rivers in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces to swell and threaten severe flooding.

Storm Molave, said to be the strongest to hit Vietnam in the last two decades, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Wednesday morning before weakening into a tropical depression by 4 p.m.

The provinces have been hit by rains of up to 500 mm between Tuesday night and Wednesday night. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In Quang Ngai, the Tra Bong River was flowing above flood warning danger level 2 at Chau O station while the Tra Khuc, Ve and Tra Cau rivers had crossed the highest danger level of 3 by 4 p.m. Wednesday, according to the province's Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

They are forecast to continue rising quickly on Thursday, possibly triggering severe flooding in large parts of Quang Ngai Town, the capital, and several districts.

The release of water by local hydropower dams is worsening the situation.

Dak Drinh hydropower plant discharged up to 1,680 cubic meters of water a second on Wednesday and Nuoc Trong, the largest irrigation and hydroelectricity project in the central region, discharged 1,100 cubic meters.

Authorities hurriedly evacuated people living in low-lying areas and made emergency announcements about the water discharge via loudspeakers to warn local residents.

In Quang Nam Province, home to ancient town Hoi An, the water level in the Vu Gia River reached 9.41 meters by early morning Thursday, 0.41 meters above danger level 3, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, which warned rivers in the province would rise quickly in the next few hours.

Dak Mi 4 hydropower plant plans to discharge up to 11,400 cubic meters a second and the Vu Gia River is expected to rise to 11.2 meters, surpassing the historic flood level in 2009.

Nguyen Huu Vu, a local official, said authorities have evacuated over 4,000 families living along the river.

If the hydropower plant discharges over 5,000 cubic meters per second, 120,000 houses would be submerged under 0.5-1.5 meters of water, Vu said.

The National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said on Wednesday that Quang Nam could face severe flooding in the next one or two days.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung instructed provincial authorities to evacuate people from areas threatened by landslides and ensure the safety of reservoirs and hydropower plants.

The central region, including Quang Nam, was hit by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that caused at least 130 deaths.

Phnom Penh (AFP)

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to get them to safety from rising floodwater on Saturday in Cambodia's western province of Battambang.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces -- Pursat, Battambang and Pailin -- have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall ahead of the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

""A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,"" Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told AFP on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to worsen on Sunday.

In central Vietnam almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking north Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to sandbag and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

In Laos, rising floodwater has damaged villages and rice fields along the Xepon and Xebanghieng rivers in Savannakhet province with more rain on the way.

The probabilistic model will provide full national coverage and help re/insurers to assess their exposure to floods – a peril that affects 70% of the population in Vietnam.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue that simulates both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding.

It can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves and average annual losses at any level of aggregation.

Outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region.

“The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon,” Gallagher explained.

“These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flooded.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'model', 'reinsurance', 'population', 'flood', 'guy', 'help', 'launches', 'carpenter', 'vietnamthe', 'includes']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

When a northern cold spell entered the intertropical convergence zone over central Vietnam, it caused abnormally heavy rains and flooding in the region.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh got 400-500 mm, Quang Tri got 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue got 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City got 1,100 mm, Quang Nam got 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai got 600-800 mm.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

The entire central region suffered from severe flooding for days, more than 135,000 houses were submerged under 0.3-4 meters of water, and nearly 46,000 people had to be evacuated.

At least 36 people have died due to flooding and 12 are missing.

Nguyen Van Huong, head of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting’s Climate Forecast Office, said intertropical convergence zone stretches from the Bay of Bengal and across the center of Vietnam to the Philippines.

In these areas clouds and thunderstorms often develop, and when winds from the east meet them, there is an increase in moisture content, which means more thunderstorms, he said.

When the zone has favorable conditions such as the convergence of strong winds that moved over warm seawater, a tropical depression forms and then grows into a storm in the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea, he said.

Since October 6 two storms and a tropical depression have formed in this area.

On Sunday Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.

A day later Storm Nangka formed and hit the coast between the northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa Provinces on Wednesday.

""Storms and tropical depression already cause heavy rains. For instance, Storm Linfa caused rainfall of 500-700 mm,"" Huong said.

On Thursday morning another tropical depression formed over the sea and is heading straight for the central region also with a lot of moisture.

According to the center, more rains are expected in the region until Tuesday or later.

A cold spell coming down from the north and meeting winds from the east also caused heavy rains, Huong said.

The center said the root cause of all these phenomena was La Nina, which appeared in July and is expected to last until early next year. During this period, more storms would form over the East Sea and the rains would last longer than usual, it added.

Four to six more storms and tropical depressions are expected to brew this year with at least two making landfall over the central coast.

La Nina is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years as a result of variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It occurs as strong winds blow warm water on the ocean's surface from South America across the Pacific Ocean toward Indonesia.

Over 11,000 people have been evacuated to safety in central Vietnam which has been hit by severe flooding following prolonged rains.

The entire region has been battered by torrential downpours for the last three days.

Some areas in Quang Tri Province and neighboring Thua Thien-Hue Province have received 980 mm of rain. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

At least five people have been killed, two in Quang Tri and the others in Dak Lak, Gia Lai and Quang Ngai provinces. Seven others were missing as of Thursday night.

In Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, and Da Nang, 37 communes have been cut off as some areas are under one meter of water and traffic has been blocked due to landslides.

In popular tourist town Hue in Thua Thien-Hue, many roads are inundated.

Nguyen Van Khoa, a local official, said around 200 houses are under 30 cm of water and people living in low-lying areas have been forced to move to safety.

Hoi An, a tourist hotspot and UNESCO heritage site, is like a massive lake following prolonged downpours with many streets under 0.5 meter of water.

Nguyen The Hung, the town’s vice chairman, said plans are underway to evacuate people living in low-lying areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Thursday ordered provinces from Ha Tinh to Phu Yen to deal with the heavy flooding and take urgent measures including evacuation to ensure people’s safety.

The central region from Ha Tinh to Quang Ngai provinces should expect more heavy rains of 330-400 mm a day until Sunday, the national weather forecasting center has warned.","Fri, 09 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/09/evacuation-1602211874-16022120-4297-4989-1602212088_1200x0.jpg,"['thienhue', 'areas', 'vietnam', 'evacuated', '11000', 'ravage', 'quang', 'provinces', 'province', 'central', 'floods', 'mm', 'thua', 'tri', 'ha']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

The number of patients with melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, has increased sharply at a major hospital in the central region following the prolonged flooding.

Since early October Hue Central Hospital in Thua Thien-Hue Province has admitted 28 people with the disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia Pseudomallei, which infects both humans and animals.

Around half the patients are from Thua Thien-Hue and the rest are from other central provinces like Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri, the province's news website reported.

The hospital is one of three biggest and most advanced general hospitals in Vietnam along with others in Hanoi and HCMC.

It said many of the patients came for treatment only after the disease had become serious, causing sepsis and multi-organ failure and threatening their life.

On November 14 a Quang Binh Province official died of the disease at the hospital.

Phan Thanh Mien, people’s committee chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trach District, had spent days in floodwaters in October managing relief efforts. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee, but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items in inundated areas.

The hospital had treated 83 people with the disease between 2014 and 2019 and 11 in the first nine months of this year.

It said the rise in the number of infections since early October is closely related to the floods that ravaged the central region throughout October and in November.

Various studies around the world have found that melioidosis occurs only in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, with outbreaks occurring after floods and typhoons.

In October central Vietnam was hit by floods thrice.

Melioidosis patients have symptoms like fever, pneumonia and abscesses in and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate is around 40 percent.

The disease was first diagnosed in Vietnam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country.

There are around 10,000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, around half of which prove fatal. There is no vaccine.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/17/muangapohue031602226049-160558-2074-9150-1605581241_1200x0.jpg,"['thienhue', 'infection', 'vietnam', 'patients', 'quang', 'province', 'outbreak', 'central', 'hospital', 'floods', 'cause', 'bacterial', 'floodwaters', 'thua', 'disease']", ,flood

After devastating storms and floods, the airline worked to transport thousands of aid packages to help areas in central Vietnam.

Aid transportation

Vietnam Airlines flew over 24 tons of goods and more than 2,000 packages from organizations like the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee, the Red Cross, and individual donations, among others, to support operations in central Vietnam in cities like Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi.

This is just part of Vietnam Airlines’ aid operations. The airline is expecting to fly more than 100 tons of cargo to support relief operations.

Vietnam Airlines, along with its affiliates, is receiving and transporting goods to Central Vietnam free of charge.

Stay informed: Sign up for our daily aviation news digest.

For passengers, Vietnam Airlines is also giving people to Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi one extra free bag in addition to their class of service baggage allowance. This will allow passengers to also fly with additional relief items or essential items.

Vietnam Airlines is expecting to fly over 10,000 pieces of luggage free of charge. This will help those who are bringing relief items to the region.

Central Vietnam is facing awful flooding

Devastating floods, some of the most severe in decades, according to CNN, have claimed over 100 lives and led to immense destruction. Over 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and over 691,000 cattle and poultry have either been killed or swept away. Hundreds of thousands of meters of roadways have also been damaged.

In addition to the flooding, landslides have also caused deaths and damage. However, Vietnam, which is no stranger to rain and typhoons, became overwhelmed after facing a particularly fierce set of storms.

Relief agencies rely on airlines to help transport goods and people. Another set of storms is, including a tropical storm, made its way to Vietnam this last weekend as well.

For the flag carrier of Vietnam, it was now time to step up and fly relief. After facing some operational disruptions due to the storm, the carrier became one lifeline to bring much-needed supplies to the region.

Airlines and aid flights

Over the last few months, aid flights have become common when it came to transporting medical supplies. However, airlines are no strangers when it comes to running aid and relief flights.

Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines partnered to send 20,000 pounds of aid on a brand new Boeing 787. Emirates has flown tens of thousands of kilograms of aid to Lebanon since a blast rocked Beirut.

Flag carriers, in particular, tend to step up when the country needs airlines to fly in (or fly out) people and supplies. Vietnam Airlines has used aircraft, like the ATR 72, to fly in aid.

The European Union will provide €1.3 million ($1.52 million) for critical humanitarian assistance to families affected by severe flooding that wreaked havoc across central Vietnam.

The aid will focus on addressing the urgent needs of the most affected people in central Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces, European External Action Service said in a press release.

""This contribution underlines our solidarity with the people of Vietnam, many of whom have suffered the loss of homes, livelihoods and belongings in the wake of the devastating floods,"" said Olivier Brouant, who oversees the EU’s humanitarian response in the Mekong region.

The funding includes the distribution of hygiene kits and other essential relief items while ensuring access to drinking water, sanitation facilities and the promotion of good hygiene practices. Cash transfers will also be provided, allowing people to buy food or items of their choice.

Female-headed households and people with disabilities will be given priority for humanitarian assistance.

The central region was bombarded by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that resulted in at least 130 deaths.

The historic flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated and livestock killed, damage the government claimed to be ""the worst in the past five years.""

Some countries and international organizations recently pledged immediate humanitarian relief to help central Vietnam overcome the consequences of deadly floods.

Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

South Korea pledged relief worth $300,000 while the U.S. has promised $100,000.

With central Vietnam yet to recover from the historic flooding, Storm Molave, the ninth storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Provinces on Wednesday, triggering heavy rains and strong winds for the central region.

Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri.

At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnam’s Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.

A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.

They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.

For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.

At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday.

Saudel is the eighth storm in the East Sea this year, and follows Linfa and Nangka earlier this month.

Over 3,700 UNFPA Dignity Kits worth $180,000 would be provided to the elderly in central Vietnam following a series of storms and tropical depressions that hit the region last year.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) representative in Vietnam, handed over 3,704 kits containing essential items to Bui Quang Huy, standing secretary of the HCMC Communist Youth Union, to support the elderly in three central Vietnam provinces afflicted by floods last year: Ha Tinh, Quang Tri and Quang Ngai at a Wednesday ceremony.

Dignity Kits are a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, mitigate the risk of gender-based violence, and respond to and protect the dignity of women and girls adversely affected by a crisis. Kits meant for the elderly contain items like hand towels, sweaters, socks, wet tissues, toothbrushes, soap, underwear, blankets, flashlights and whistles.

The handover was made possible via financial contributions from U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), according to a UNFPA press release.

The elderly are among the most vulnerable when natural disasters strike, according to UNFPA. During floods and landslides in central Vietnam last year, health facilities were hard hit, causing routine public health programs to be disrupted, it added. The elderly are at risk since they do not always get the care they need, and their vulnerabilities can become a serious challenge to survival and wellbeing, it stated.

Last year, central Vietnam was struck by a series of storms and tropical depressions, triggering heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Over 200 people were killed and property losses amounted to around VND30 trillion ($1.3 trillion). Hundreds of thousands of homes were either destroyed or damaged, affecting the lives of at least 7.7 million residents.

With Storm Molave set to make landfall in central Vietnam in the next few days, Vietnamese authorities are preparing to evacuate 1.2 million coast residents to safety.

At 1 p.m. Monday, the storm lay centered around 560 km east-northeast of Southwest Cay islet, with winds of 135 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

Over the next 24 hours, it will move west at 20-25 kph and gradually intensify. At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, it will be 280 km to the north of Southwest Cay with winds of up to 150 kph.

Mai Van Khiem, director of the national forecast center, said at a meeting Monday both the agency and its Japanese counterpart predict the rapidly moving storm would make landfall in central Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces.

The agencies forecast the storm would reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning, before making landfall in the coming hours.

On Wednesday morning, the storm's center would be around 200 km from the coast of Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh with a maximum wind speed of 135 kph, causing waves of up to 10 m.

Storm circulation combined with a cold spell would cause heavy rains on a large scale, and localities stretching over 1,000 km from Nghe An to Phu Yen will be battered by torrential downpours and strong winds from Tuesday until Thursday, with rainfall of between 200-400 mm.

Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh are told to brace for prolonged downpours until Saturday with total rainfall of up to 700 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Mountainous areas will be at high risk of landslides.

Mass evacuation

Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, said with Molave’s strength level, the committee is ready to evacuate over 1.2 million residents in seven central provinces Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

The region, home to popular ancient towns, beautiful beaches and world famous caves, has been bombarded by historic flooding and deadly landslides for the past three weeks, suffering damage government officials described as ""the worst in five years."" At least 130 people have been killed by floods and landslides between October 6 and 25.

Hoai urged provincial leaders to stay in contact with fishing boats, evacuate residents to safety, and make plans to limit storm damage.

There are still 65,000 fishing boats operating along the central coast, of which 45,000 have received official warnings.

""The storm is too strong,"" Hoai said, ordering localities to order boats to take shelter, ban residents from fishing activities, and close all public beaches by Tuesday night.

Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defense has called for the mobilization of more than 368,000 people - soldiers, members of the police force, and civilian volunteers, to assist residents in at-risk areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the meeting that localities must be on high alert and prepare their best flood prevention measures.

""If the storm comes as strong as forecast, damage from rains and floods will be extremely huge,"" Phuc said.

According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Storm Molave's strength is equivalent to Storm Damrey, which hit south central Vietnam in November 2017 and killed 106 people.

Hoang Tan Trong, watching over the family farm in Dong Hoi Town with his father and pregnant wife, witnessed floods tear through his home on the night of October 19. Dao, Trong’s wife, was sitting on their bed, suspended in the air thanks to four ropes connecting it to the roof. But with the walls damaged, the bed wobbled about two meters above ground, leaning to the side.

""We can't just stay here and suffer like this. We need to find a safer house,"" Dao said. That night, Trong rented a motorboat and brought the whole family to the town center, about 2 km away.

Trong later returned to his old home to herd his 30 remaining chickens out of 200 into tree branches to avoid the flood. His three dogs were given to a relative the next day for safe keeping.

Since October 6, heavy rains have inundated the lowlands of Quang Binh. While not suffering fatal landslides like Thua Thien-Hue or Quang Tri provinces, Quang Binh has been the most severely flooded.

The October 19 flood managed to submerge thousands of houses, making even the most hardy residents shudder in fear.

From 1 a.m. on October 16 to 5 p.m. October 20, Quang Binh recorded rainfall of up to 1,380 mm in certain areas. The most heavily flooded was in Le Thuy District, with over 32,000 houses swamped. Throughout the entire province, around 105,000 homes have been similarly affected.

Tran Cong Thuat, chairman of Quang Binh, said: ""Floods this year have eclipsed the record peak in 1979 by up to 0.98 m."" The historic flood peak was recorded on Kien Giang River at 3.91 m. This year, however, the peak remained at 4.89 m for several consecutive days.

""The flood came at night so it was very powerful. The peak was too high, catching certain areas off guard,"" Thuat added. On the night of October 19 alone, thousands of people throughout Quang Binh have called out for help via their phones or social media.

""We still lack boats, but we are doing our best to help alleviate the suffering,"" he said.

Floods in Quang Binh this year not only set new records, but also receded very slowly. By the morning of October 21, traffic across the province remained crippled due to several flooded locations. Over the last fews days, people have confined themselves to their homes, with many of their pets, livestock and vegetables perishing in the water.

It would take a long time for Quang Binh to recover following this historic flood, according to Thuat. As Storm Saudel approaches Vietnamese shores, the province has prepared plans to support people with necessities and food for the coming days.

""During the first days when flood levels rose quickly, we were met with many challenges. But now that the water’s receding, we’ve been surveying heavily flooded and isolated houses so we could perform rescue operations and provide supplies more easily. We would not allow any family to be abandoned amid the flooding,"" said Thuat.

Ho Van Rao's lush green fields in Quang Tri were buried under more than two feet of boulders, sand and other debris.

The field was the primary source of income to feed his family of three.

As he inspected the damage done by the prolonged flooding central Vietnam has had to suffer, he noted that some paddy sections had been swept away by floodwaters, while his tapioca field, cultivated over the past 10 months, was buried in rubble.

""We don’t know what to plant to make a living,"" said Rao, a 46-year-old resident of Huong Son Commune in Quang Tri’s Huong Hoa District. Two wet bags of grains they have are all that’s left for the next six months, he said, adding that on sunny days, he would put them out to dry.

The Huong Son Commune has over 192 ha of paddy fields, but around 90 ha were buried under rocks and wood rotting deposited by the floods, rendering them unusable and irrecoverable. Le Trong Tuong, chairman of the Huong Son People’s Committee, said residents were facing food shortages in the future for people.

In Quang Binh Province’s Bo Trach District, Le Xuan Uyen, 56, sees his field buried under mud and soil a meter deep, meaning he cannot plant new saplings for the winter-spring season without putting in significant time and efforts to clean the place up.

Worse still, the soil the fields are buried under has toxic properties that would kill paddy if they’re planted, he said. ""We are worried because we have missed the season for planting, and we don’t know what to plant anyway.""

The Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences said the top soil layer that covers several areas in Bo Trach District is actually heavy clay layers, which would make it difficult for cultivation if left as it is. Farmers should switch to different plants to adapt to the new layers, the academy has suggested.

Around 1,650 ha of fields in Quang Tri were inundated in the past month. Provincial authorities are now cooperating with the people to salvage the buried fields to prepare for the winter-spring planting season in just a month, said Ha Si Dong, deputy chairman of Quang Tri. But as the fields are large, ample time, it would take a lot of people and equipment to complete the job, he added.

Recovery efforts should be completed by mid-December so new saplings can be planted for the winter-spring season on time, Quang Tri authorities have said.

Quang Binh and Quang Tri were among several central Vietnam localities struck by heavy rains, flooding and landslides triggered by numerous storms and tropical depressions in recent months. Property losses from the disasters are estimated at around VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), according to the government.","Thu, 03 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/02/a2020112209431116291606809438-7767-1655-1606901793_1200x0.jpg,"['shortages', 'vietnam', 'buried', 'paddy', 'field', 'loom', 'quang', 'huong', 'soil', 'central', 'floods', 'food', 'fields', 'season', 'tri', 'destroy', 'ha']", ,flood

The chance of such events could increase five to 10 times by 2050, resulting in economic and infrastructural damage that could cost billions of dollars, according to a McKinsey report, dated April. The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.

Ho Chi Minh City, a historic flood area located some 1,000 miles south of the capital Hanoi, contributes about a quarter of the Vietnam’s gross domestic product. While the metropolis can cope with flood risks today that could hit 23% of its area, further urbanization is raising the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels. Those could cause about $8.4 billion of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact, McKinsey said.

The city still has time to adapt to avoid such risks by having better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas, McKinsey said. Investments and fund-raising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.

Thousands of people fled their homes in Vietnam on Saturday as Typhoon Vamco barrelled towards central regions already pummelled by weeks of successive storms.

Airports have been shut, beaches closed, and a fishing ban put in place as the country braces for winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour (60 miles per hour) when the typhoon makes landfall on Sunday, likely close to Hue.

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in four central provinces, according to the disaster management authority, while state media said hundreds of thousands more may have to flee.

“This is a very strong typhoon,” Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said, warning provinces in Vamco’s projected path to prepare for its impact.

‘No respite’

A series of storms have hit central Vietnam over the past six weeks, causing flooding and landslides that have killed at least 159 people, authorities said, while 70 others are missing.

The severe weather has also damaged or destroyed more than 400,000 homes, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Roads and bridges have been washed away, power supplies disrupted, and crucial food crops destroyed, leaving at least 150,000 people at immediate risk of food shortages, it added.

“There has been no respite for more than eight million people living in central Vietnam,” said Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, Vietnam Red Cross Society president.

“Each time they start rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, they are pummeled by yet another storm.”

Philippine coastguards conduct rescue operations after Typhoon Vamco resulted in severe flooding in the Cagayan Valley region [Reuters] Typhoon Vamco has already caused devastation in the Philippines.

Emergency response teams were dispatched to the northeast on Saturday where more than 340,000 people have been affected by severe flooding following Vamco, which killed at least 53 people across the country, disaster agencies said.

Twenty of the deaths were recorded in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya, which have become the focus of rescue efforts.

Hundreds of people were trapped on rooftops in the hardest-hit areas along the Cagayan river with rescuers unable to reach them because of strong currents, said the spokesman for the regional Office of Civil Defense.

Vast swaths of the region were underwater in what officials have described as the worst flooding in living memory.

73,73,FL-2020-000211-VNM,Vietnam suffers through a “new normal” of extreme weather events - WSWS,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/28/viet-o28.html,"Vietnam is being pummelled by ongoing tropical storms causing major flooding and landslides in its central regions. As of Monday morning, the death toll had reached 130 with 18 people missing, according to government figures. This was up from 119 fatalities on Saturday, with most occurring in the central provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam.

Close to a million people have been severely affected, with many in desperate need of shelter, food, clean drinking water and income support. According to the UN, as of last Thursday, at least 178,000 homes were currently under water.

Flood levels eclipsed the 1979 record by 0.98 metres, hovering at 4.89 metres for several consecutive days in the province of Quang Binh. The amount of rain that fell between October 6 and 13 was two to six times higher than normal in some regions.

Most of the hardest hit have been poor farmers. Agricultural damage has been extensive, with 1,500 hectares of rice fields and 7,800 hectares of other crops being either flooded or damaged. Close to a million head of cattle and poultry have also been killed or swept away.

The government has stated that the damage caused has been “the worst in five years”. Several highways and local roads are blocked with rocks the size of cars, hampering rescue efforts.

About a third of deaths have been of military personnel.

In one instance, a team of 21 rescuers, most of them military officers, was sent to verify reports of 17 workers buried by a landslide at the Rao Trang 3 hydroelectric plant deep in the jungle. The workers were reportedly asleep when they were buried on October 12.

The rescue team stopped at a ranger station for the night and were buried in a rocky landslide. Of the 13 deaths, 11 were from the military. Only four of the 17 workers at the dam have been recovered thus far and authorities have deployed more rescue forces to the scene.

Days later, a barracks in Quang Tri was consumed by a mudslide in the early hours of the morning, killing 20 military personnel, likely the largest number of military casualties suffered in a period of peace, according to officials.

Scientists believe flooding in central Vietnam is the result of a “new normal” of weather patterns driven by complex processes.

On an international scale, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDDR) reported recently a 75 percent increase in natural disasters in the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, there were 4,212 major natural disasters. Between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded costing 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy USD$2.97 trillion.

The increase is largely attributed to climate related events such as floods, droughts and storms.

Speaking at a virtual conference, UNDDR chief Mami Mizutori accused governments of abandoning effective measures to deal with climate change, “It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction,” he said, “despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.”

In the Asia Pacific, the cyclical la Nina phenomenon is intensifying storms in the region, and is expected to continue until early next year. Cambodia has reported 39 deaths from flooding, with hundreds of thousands affected and 46,216 people evacuated to safer ground.

Vietnam has been hit by three tropical storms and a depression in the month of October. Typhoon Mojave, at present travelling westwards over the Philippines, is also likely to impact in the weeks ahead. It is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds of 130 kilometres per hour. About 9,000 people in the Philippines have fled their homes.

Professor of human ecology at Rutgers University, Pamela McElwee, told the New York Times that the sheer volume of rainfall in Vietnam was, “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it shattered the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in its central regions by the end of the century.

She also stated that the construction of hydroelectric dams and poor mountain roads had weakened the soil. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go.”

Christopher Rassi, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross, warned of the economic fallout: “We are seeing a deadly double disaster unfold before our eyes as these floods compound the difficulties caused by COVID-19. These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.”

The Vietnamese economy relies heavily on its tourism industry which has been drastically cut back during the pandemic. Borders were virtually closed in late March. Apart from an outbreak in Da Nang Hospital in late July, total cases have been kept low and contained at under 1,500, with 40 deaths.

The Asian Development Bank assessed in September that Vietnam’s economy would grow at around 1.8 percent in 2020, its slowest rate in 35 years and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.

The Stalinist regime in Vietnam has ruthlessly pursued a policy of capitalist restoration for decades. According to its own estimates, economic inequality is worsening. Between 2014 and 2018 the GINI index of Vietnam, a standard measure of income inequality, was 0.4 [where 0 represents absolute equality and 1 absolute inequality]. The figure is regarded as a tipping point with higher numbers frequently associated with social unrest and political instability.

Out of fear of social unrest, the regime has sought to suppress criticism from workers and the peasantry. According to the UN, hundreds of people have been interrogated so far over COVID-19 related Facebook posts. In the lead up to the congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in January 2021, the government has begun a campaign of censoring dissident and left-wing publications.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wsws.org/asset/64544160-f1d1-4d85-aecd-24bd939be1eb?rendition=image1280,"['vietnam', 'normal', 'storms', 'quang', 'according', 'extreme', 'workers', 'central', 'events', 'military', 'million', 'rescue', 'suffers', 'weather']", ,flood

Phan Duong

She was worried the 80-kilogram beast might be swept away or escape.

The resident of a village in Quang Dien District explains: ""Pigs can be really destructive if they escape. I did not dare sleep at night.""

Central Vietnam has been hit hard by tropical storms, torrential downpours, floods, and landslides for three weeks now.

The woman, who is in her 50s, took the sow and its litter of four to her brother’s house since it is on higher ground than hers, and never left them alone for a moment.

With a stick in one hand, she made sure the sow behaved. But the animal was spooked and attacked her more than once. Vung has a wound on her right thigh from a bite.

But importantly she has been able to safeguard the family’s most valuable asset.

She had spent a year raising the pig and saw it give birth to four piglets. If she manages to keep all of them safe, and the animal continues to have more litters, she can solve the problem she has been facing: that of paying her daughter’s tuition.

Her daughter is a freshman at a college in Da Nang City, and Vung has to send her VND1.5 million ($65) every month for living expenses besides paying VND6 million a year tuition for the two-year course.

Since her daughter was in 10th grade Vung had been telling her, ""I think you should drop out of school and work; I am not able to afford your schooling.""

But the girl would plead: ""Please let me stay in school so that I can have a proper career in future and build us a better life.""

Vung relented.

Their family consists of just the two of them. Vung does the best she can, growing rice on a 750-square-meter farm and doing agricultural labor and menial jobs for others.

Every year in October she travels to the Central Highlands to harvest coffee and cassava for farmers there. But this year she has been stuck in floods described as the worst in decades.

Earlier this year, along with many other localities across Vietnam, Thua Thien-Hue was also hit by the African swine fever, an incurable and fatal disease in pigs.

Vung worked for other farmers, burying pigs killed by the disease.

""God blessed me and kept my sow healthy.""

Now she has once again kept the sow safe through the floods.

But she has not been able to save a small flock of chickens and a cassava crop that had almost been ready for harvest.

All hopes for the mother and daughter’s future now rest on that one sow.

When meeting us in the courtyard of a government office to receive a donation of essential items from readers of VnExpress through FPT’s Hope Foundation, Vung cannot hold back her tears, and tells us all about her pigs and chickens.

The floodwaters have now started receding in several parts of the central region, including her Quang Dien District, and people are trying to pick up the pieces again after two weeks of living with the floods.

Vung is still at her brother’s house with her pigs since it is still not safe to return home.

Her 20-year-old single-storied house has deteriorated and its walls are cracked, and now after the floods Vung is afraid they could collapse at any time.

""More storms are coming, so I’d better stay here.""

Storm Molave is expected to reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning.

In Phong Dien, another district in Thua Thien Hue, we met Le Thi Sinh, 51.

Three years ago her son passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children. Her daughter-in-law works elsewhere and sends home money for Sinh and her husband to raise the two kids, one of whom is learning to talk while the other is in kindergarten. Sinh’s husband has a number of health problems and so she is the family’s breadwinner.

No one had foreseen such severe flooding. Like many other locals, Sinh and her husband did not have enough time to prepare for the disaster.

When the waters came, they packed off the children, belongings and grain to the first floor. They hung their six piglets, each weighing around 15 kg, from the ceiling, but one was swept away and another was killed.

The floods also swept away their flock of 200 chickens and destroyed their cassava and sweet potato crops.

Her grandchildren cried and asked for their mother. Then they asked for their father after seeing a man next door casting a net to catch fish. There was nothing Sinh could do except shed tears of grief.

Sinh still has a litany of problems to worry about like a loan she took to buy supplements for the pigs and chickens and buying formula and other essential items for the children.

She hopes to get relief from the authorities and plant a new crops and resume her livestock and poultry farming.

In the district’s Phong Xuan Commune, locals grow trees and paddy. In May Storm Noul destroyed grown paperbark and acacia trees, and now the floods have destroyed all the young ones.

In Phong Hien Commune 2,000 families have been living in the floodwaters. They have lost 250 hectares (620 acres) of cassava, 27 hectares of glittering chive, 25 hectares of sugarcane, and 15 hectares of other crops.

""There is nothing left,"" Nguyen Si Hiep, chairman of the commune Fatherland Front Committee, said. The front, an overarching public organization, is tasked with ""promoting national solidarity and unity of mind in political and spiritual matters,"" and conducting many of the government's social programs, especially those to mitigate poverty.

Hiep said the commune administration is advising farmers to switch to short-term crops after the floods recede so that they could earn some income before the new year arrives.

There is way too much attention on flood relief though it is just one part of the big picture when a natural disaster strikes. Reconstructing the livelihoods and rebuilding the lives of millions of people in the central region is now a serious challenge in what has already been a disastrous year.

A World Bank report released last week estimated that 12 million people living in coastal provinces face the threat of severe flooding and over 35 percent of people live on eroding coastlines.

Each year an average of $852 million and 316,000 jobs in key economic sectors are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding.

In this context, I reviewed the concept of social capital. Economists treat social capital as an important resource of the nation. It is understood as the two-way and multidimensional cooperation between members of the society, the power of connection between people in a community, a country, and transactions based on mutual trust that bring mutual benefit.

The fact that Vietnamese everywhere are pitching in to provide succor to people in the central region these days is an expression of social capital in Vietnam.

The World Bank believes that social capital helps the community coordinate voluntarily and effectively because it is based on a common goal to help solve collective problems. The natural disasters in the central region are a collective problem. To address this problem, the government can collaborate with the community and make use of the social capital that has been on display in recent days.

Dealing with the aftermath of the floods gives the government an opportunity to tweak its policies. Authorities should make appropriate decisions to remove unnecessary barriers, paving the way for an increase in tolerance and trust, which would help heal the wounds caused by natural disasters.

A timely and substantial reconstruction plan for people like Vung and Sinh will help soothe the gaping economic wounds suffered by the central region, sustain growth and lead to a sustainable development vision for the country.

VnExpress’s Hope Foundation is soliciting emergency support for people in central Vietnam, whose lives have been impacted by severe floods and landslides since earlier this month.

When the floodwaters rose on October 12 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Hoang Thi Phuong, a textile worker in Phong Dien District, went into labor.

Her husband tried to take her to hospital, but their motorbike could not cross a flooded section of National Highway 1A. In desperation, he asked a person with a boat to take his wife to the other side.

But the boat capsized just 20 meters from safety. Both Phuong and her unborn baby died.

""I killed you,"" her husband sobbed inconsolably, down on his knees in front of the raging floods that had snatched away his loved ones.

They are not the only victims of the tragedy that has befallen central Vietnam in the last two weeks. Dozens of others, including at least two hydropower plant workers and 13 members of a rescue team, lost their lives to landslides in Thua Thien-Hue.

In the last 10 days nonstop rain and floods have submerged entire regions under a sea of water and triggered massive landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of thousands of houses have been engulfed, and the death toll has been rising relentlessly.

Thousands of families face food and water shortages, and the floods do not seem likely to recede any time soon.

As fighters on the frontlines in a battle against nature, soldiers, doctors, rescuers, and thousands of others have had to take on the harsh and unrelenting elements.

What they need right now are boats, medicines, food, clothes, rescue equipment, and other supplies.

Highlights

From October 6th, the Central region observed prolonged heavy rains that caused severe and widespread flooding and landslides. Water levels have risen rapidly flooding large areas in the provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

78,78,FL-2020-000211-VNM,One million swamped by deadly floods as Viet Nam faces another major storm - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/one-million-swamped-deadly-floods-viet-nam-faces-another-major-storm,"Kuala Lumpur/Hanoi/Geneva, October 14, 2020 – Close to a million people have been severely affected by prolonged flooding in central Viet Nam as the country faces another major tropical storm and further dangerous floods.

Red Cross holds grave fears that deadly floods, which have submerged the country’s central provinces over recent days, will worsen as tropical storm Nangka makes landfall today, bringing destructive winds and dumping more rain on hard hit communities.

Since the floods began in early October, at least 28 people have been killed, more than 200,000 homes flooded and an estimated 84,000 hectares of crops damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people – many cut off by the floodwater – are now in desperate need of emergency relief.

As part of a coordinated relief effort, Viet Nam Red Cross staff and volunteers have been accessing isolated communities by boat to provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and other much needed supplies. More relief supplies are urgently being brought in from other parts of the country.

Mr Hoa Nguyen, Deputy Director of External Relations and Development, Viet Nam Red Cross, said: “Our volunteers and staff have been working in the affected areas since the floods began, providing relief supplies to thousands of people, but we need to reach many more as the rain continues and floods worsen. Every day we hear of more families who have lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods.”

Hung Ha Nguyen, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator said: “These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods.”

“Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities, especially on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need to help ensure families receive the relief they need in the coming days and weeks,” Mr Hung Ha said.

So far, at least 235 people have died or been listed missing after the floods and landslides triggered by storms and heavy rains in central Vietnam last month, the government informed the National Assembly Tuesday.

Among the casualties were 35 military officers and soldiers of two different military teams sent on search and rescue missions after landslides hit several districts in the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri.

The region suffered historic flooding, with the peak time falling between October 12 and 19. Floodwaters inundated the homes of 317,000 families with 1.2 million members from Nghe An to Quang Nam, with many areas being flooded for nearly two weeks.

Over 200,000 houses were seriously damaged. Many public construction projects also suffered heavy damage and roads were heavily eroded.

Of the total damage of VND17 trillion, VND10 trillion ($430.16 million) was caused by Molave, one of the most powerful storms to hit Vietnam, the government said.

The storm made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28, causing heavy rains and deadly landslides in the central region.

Earlier, the government granted over VND1 trillion, over 11,500 tons of rice and other essential items in relief support for the worst-hit central provinces.

Not over

The government said it would continue to mobilize all forces to search for the victims buried in several landslides and fishermen missing at sea. Among the missing are 12 hydropower plant workers in Thua Thien-Hue Province who were hit by a landslide on October 12, 19 residents in Quang Nam Province hit by two landslides as an impact of Storm Molave last week, and 23 fishermen from Binh Dinh Province whose boats sank in rough sea as the storm was near.

Priority in relief support will be given to those in worst-hit localities and isolated areas and to quickly repairing infrastructure and public construction works damaged by storms and floods, the parliament was told.

The government is also joining forces with local authorities to evacuate residents from high risk areas as storm Goni, the 10th storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, heads towards south-central Vietnam.

International forecasting agencies expect the storm to directly affect the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.

Natural disasters, predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

The East Sea could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, and half of them could affect Vietnam, meteorologists have warned.","Wed, 04 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/03/baoso978941604389761-160439695-9969-6110-1604397091_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', '12', 'storms', 'mln', 'quang', 'suffered', 'damage', 'landslides', 'disaster', 'reckons', 'hit', '734', 'sea', 'storm', 'trillion']", ,flood
80,80,FL-2020-000211-VNM,Anguish as Mekong Delta’s annual floods continue to dry up - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/anguish-as-mekong-delta-s-annual-floods-continue-to-dry-up-4171382.html,"It is time for the annual floods in the Mekong Delta, but the flooding season these days is more a cherished memory than a practical phenomenon.

One day in mid-September Cao Van Bi, 50, was rowing a boat with his wife across a paddy field that had been partially flooded.

All over the field, in Phu Hoi, a rural commune in An Giang Province’s An Phu District, traps had been set up to catch fish.

That morning the catch was 2.5 kilograms of carp and five kilograms of other fish and shrimp.

In previous years, during the flooding season, Bi would have got dozens of kilograms worth of fish every day, but these days it never exceeds 10 kg.

The reason is that the annual flooding of Vietnam's Mekong Delta from the upstream Mekong before reaching the sea no longer occurs.

Not far away, in Vinh Hoi Dong Commune in An Phu, Phan Van Lang, 54, was standing in front of his house.

Since they live in an area hit by annual flooding, Lang and his neighbors have their houses built well above the ground. His house is nearly three meters in the air with a flight of the stairs leading up from the road. In 2000, for instance, the floodwater almost reached the house. But ever since the flooding levels have kept decreasing.

Pointing at the road in front of his house, he says the entire road would have been under one meter of water at this time of the year but this year, the water has not even reached the road.

Hung Dien Commune in Long An Province's Tan Hung District, 80 km (50 miles) away, has been witnessing the clearest change.

In the past its paddy fields would have waters reaching waist high and be filled with water lilies and boats would be the only means of getting around.

That scene now exists only in the memories of seniors.

Bay De, 53, who has been fishing for more than 30 years, recalls floods when catching up to 200 kg of various kinds of fish every day and earning a million dong ($40) was a ""piece of cake.""

For several weeks now he has not caught any fish. He spends almost every day drinking tea and chatting with neighbors in his thatched house.

Fifty kilometers away, Tran Van Thanh, 58, of Tan Lap Commune in Moc Hoa District is fixing traps for catching crabs.

He has been doing this for dozens of years, a job that has ensured a decent livelihood, but that has changed.

""I used to set up more than 600 traps during the flood season, but only a few tens of them these days because the flood waters are way too low and there are no crabs to catch.""

In the neighboring province of Dong Thap, Nguyen Van Phuong, 42, of Tan Thanh A Commune in Tan Hong District is watching the news on TV for possible information about the floods, something he has been looking forward to for several weeks now.

He has an eight-hectare rice field and has been waiting for the floods to come so that he could start sowing the winter-spring crop.

There was heavy rain a few weeks ago, and water had filled up canals and then reached the fields. Phuong, thinking the floods had finally arrived, hired people to till the soil.

But soon a scorching sun replaced the rains and water dropped, leaving the field dry and cracked once again.

He says: ""I had spent VND750,000 ($32.44) per hectare, but that has been a wasted effort. Now I have to wait for the floodwaters to come and do that all over again.""

In his neighborhood, farmers are now worried that if the floods do not come or are low, they would have to shell out money to pump water from canals into their fields.

Rice farmers in the delta have for generations depended on the floodwaters to come and inundate their fields before sow seeds directly.

The Plain of Reeds, a wetland straddling Long An and Dong Thap provinces, produces more than two million tons of rice a year.

The floods usually start coming in late July or early August and remain until November or even later to bless the region with extraordinary fertility as they typically deposit silt from upstream areas.

When they do not come or arrive late, cropping and fishing activities are disrupted.

For several years now they have been late or deficient, and experts have been blaming this on climate change and the construction of a series of dams in the upstream area.

According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, this year’s floodwater level in the delta will be only 55 percent of the long-term average, which translates into a shortfall of 130 billion cubic meters.

It will be 15 percent lower than last year’s level and the lowest in a decade, it has warned.

Late last year the highest water levels in the upstream areas of the delta were 1.12-2 meters lower than the long-term average and 1-1.65 meters lower than in the previous year.

The delta suffered the worst salinity levels and resultant freshwater shortage in 100 years but meteorologists warn things could get worse.

Tran Tan Tai, deputy head of the agriculture department of Long An’s Tan Hung District, says the water level in his hometown is currently 1.4 meters, or 80 centimeters lower than a year ago.

""If there are no floods, the fields will lack silt, and pathogens and wild grass seeds will not be washed away, and farmers will have to spend more on pesticide and fertilizers.""

Meteorologists expect the floods to come around the middle of this month, stay low and ebb away quickly.

Those were the days

Early one morning in late September, Muoi, 64, of Tan Lap rides a motorbike to a wet market two kilometers away from home. He returned after a while with a bag of barb.

""All my life I have seen fish all over the place every time it is the flooding season, but now I have to go buy them... Isn’t it weird?""

Not far from his home a neighbor had set up a lift net the previous night, but until around noon the next day, when Muoi returned from the market, it had only around two kilograms of fish.

Muoi can never forget what it was like one or two decades ago: Every year when the flood season arrived, water would be everywhere, covering the fields and even the streets. People would be rowing boats, picking water lilies and river hemp, both used to make specialty dishes of the region.

In the water, there would be so much fish that anyone could become a fisherman without having to learn any skills.

""Back then people did not weigh fish in kilograms but in a unit of around 20 kilograms. Normally, in one night a family could catch at least five to seven of that unit. Some would even feed the fish to their pigs.""

In years of heavy flooding fish moving down stream into the delta would breed along the way, and it would be extremely rare to see a field or waterway without fish in it.

Fishermen would enlarge the holes in their net to only catch adult fish, leaving the young ones untouched.

When the floods retreated, mud, algae and water lilies would be left in the paddy fields. The fields mud would be silt while the algae and flowers served as organic fertilizers, leaving the fields with all the nutrition they needed.

Besides, the floods would wash away the pathogens and wild grass seeds, and it was not common for farmers to use fertilizers or pesticides.

A kilometer away from Muoi’s place, Danh Van Minh, 62, asks his son to take him by motorbike to a house nearby. The house stands along a canal and in front is a concrete road around three meters wide.

""This used to be a small dirt road, and every year during this season it would be two or three meters under water,"" Minh says.

""The house used to be just a hut beside which I would anchor my boat after fishing.""

Minh’s life has been filled with tragedy. He lost his first wife and two of his children during two different flood seasons.

In the middle of the 1991 season his wife had twins, but both died at birth due to lack of medical care in that rural area.

Worse still the floods covered every inch of land that they could not find a place to bury the children. All he could do was put their bodies in a coffin, stick a bamboo pole in the water and hang the coffin up that.

Only a month after they passed away could he give them a proper burial.

Five years after they lost the twins, Minh’s wife suddenly fell sick and died. Once again he could not bury her immediately, and had to leave her body inside a coffin on the family boat and leave it anchored next to the hut.

In the past 20 years the delta has witnessed several floods that left a significant impact on its residents, especially in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2011.

The 2000 floods were the most severe in 70 years, with the water rising to 4.78 meters. They claimed 481 lives and caused losses of nearly VND4 trillion.

As told by Le Thanh Tam, party chief of Long An Province in 1999-2005, 20 years ago and further, the Plain of Reeds had heavy floods almost every year.

The region had not yet got an embankment system, and every time it flooded there was no way to tell where the road was and where the canal was. The only way people could move around was by boat.

""Back then we always had fish, shrimps and crabs in abundance, but we would lose lives every year, and of children in most cases.

""When the floods retreated, we had to expend a lot of effort to rebuild houses and roads.""

But a 2017 study by the Mekong River Commission estimated that the flooding provides $8-10 billion in annual economic benefits while causing losses of just $60-70 million.

The Mekong River flows through six countries, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before reaching the sea.

Many parts of the Mekong Delta were formed by sedimentation over eons.

When the Vietnamese expanded their nation to the south, they began to conquer the delta in the 18th century. For generations, no other place in the nation could compare with it as a agriculture and aquaculture hub.

In his book ‘Last days of the Mighty Mekong’ published in February last year, Brian Eyler, director of the Asia Program at U.S. think tank Stimson Center, writes: ""For the past 3,000 years, the Mekong carried about 150 million tons of sediment in its system to the delta each year.""

Without the sedimentation, the delta’s land would fall apart under natural conditions, which are worsened by intense groundwater extraction and sea level rise, he says.

He strongly condemns China’s dam building in the upstream areas of the Mekong for holding back floodwaters and, along with them, sediments.

Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent researcher into the ecology of the Mekong Delta, says the main cause of the low floods this year is the El Nino phenomenon that lasted from the year’s beginning to the end of August, resulting in scanty rain fall in the region.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the rainy season arrived late last year and was shorter than usual, with the result that rainfall was 8 percent below normal at 1,240 mm.

Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of Can Tho University’s Research Institute of Climate Change, says the calamity faced by the delta cannot be blamed just on nature or Chinese dams.

""Sea levels rise and the Earth gets warmer. Yes. But that happens just a little each year and it needs a long period for dramatic changes. It is humans who have accelerated that process.""

He cites one example of human action that changed the delta’s hydrological profile. Ever since the delta was formed, it has had several low-lying areas like the Long Xuyen quadrilateral in Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and Can Tho City and the Plain of Reeds that worked as natural reservoirs to store the seasonal floodwaters, he explains.

For generations farmers did not use them for cultivation, but due to the wars, the nation had to consider food security, and built embankments to keep the seasonal floodwaters from flowing into them and directed the water toward the sea, he says.

""Now in peace time, we still have the mindset of growing as much rice as we can, and many have treated the seasonal floods as a disaster for their paddy fields while in fact it is a blessing.

""With that thinking, many have continued to keep out the floods, going against nature, thus intensifying the lack of water once it took hold in the region.""

Minh, who has been a poor farmer his entire life and is haunted by a tragic past related to the floods, does not care much for the explanations experts like Tuan have to offer.

After his wife’s death, he took his son to another village, remarried and built a new life.

He now owns a 6,000 sq.m rice field and both his home and field are surrounded by embankments, allowing him and others in his neighborhood to go against nature and cultivate three instead of just two rice crops as in the past.

The field does not have any time to recover, and instead of getting floodwaters that wash it clean and deposit sediments, it has to do with plant protection chemicals instead.

With this method of growing rice, farmers remain mired in poverty since they have to spend money on fertilizers and pesticides for every crop and also lose out on an abundant source of fish, shrimp and crab and the plants that always grow in the flood season.

""My children and grandchildren have all taken turns to leave,"" Minh says, reflecting the trend of delta dwellers abandoning their hometown for Ho Chi Minh City and other industrial areas, where they work in factories or the service sector.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/05/lu-dong-thap-muoi-2300-1601345-2309-7479-1601885014_1200x0.jpg,"['continue', 'annual', 'field', 'water', 'dry', 'flooding', 'floods', 'delta', 'anguish', 'mekong', 'fields', 'season', 'away', 'fish', 'deltas']", ,flood

Highways in the provinces have also been severely damaged, with the total cost of repairs estimated at around VND 355 billion, state media said, citing figures provided by the Directorate of Roads of Vietnam on Oct. 21.

Also on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung and deputies of Vietnam’s National Assembly welcomed efforts by Vietnamese pop star Thuy Tien to collect more than VND 100 billion (U.S. $15,316,811) for relief work in flood-hit Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue.

Large-scale fundraising is normally restricted by law to state organizations or social associations to reduce the risk of personal gain, with penalties prescribed for violations. But National Assembly deputy Le Thanh Vanh voiced confidence in the work of Thuy Tien and her staff.

“They are ready to take responsibility before the sponsors who donated the funds,” Vanh said, quoted on Oct. 21 in state media reports. “I am sure they will be completely transparent,” he said.

Relief teams have poured for the last few days into central regions hit by floods and landslides that have destroyed roads and buried workers at a hydropower plant and soldiers at a military barracks, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told state media on Wednesday.

Many areas have already received help, while others remain cut off because of damaged roads, Dung said, calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to send more teams to reach remote areas and give further support to those already helped.

34 now killed in Cambodia

Relief work meanwhile continues in Cambodia, where 34 people have now been killed by floods to date, with Prime Minister Hun Sen urging local authorities to guard damaged homes to prevent looting and calling on banks and other lending institutions to delay or reduce payments owed to them by villagers impoverished by the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 has hit us hard for the last 10 months, and now we are facing floods that are destroying us,” Hun Sen said.

“We have not concluded our damage assessments yet. For now, we are just working to rescue people and take them to safer areas,” he said.

Around 10,000 families have already been safely evacuated from flood-hit areas, Cambodian media sources say.

Speaking to RFA, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha said that flood waters are now receding in several provinces, including Oddor Meanchey, Pursat, Takeo, Pailin, Kampong Speu, Stung Treng, and the two hardest-hit provinces of Banteay Meahchey and Battambang.

The 34 flood deaths reported so far reflect the inability of central government and local authorities to deal effectively with the disaster, said Kean Ponlok, secretary general of the Cambodia Intellectual Students Alliance.

“The authorities must look into the causes of these deaths and hold themselves responsible,” he said, adding that because of corruption in Cambodia, he is not convinced that all donations handed over to the government will be spent on victims of the floods.

Banteay Meanchey villager Nay Thoeun said she has now lost her home and job because of the floods and is debt after borrowing money from a bank to buy medicine to treat the tuberculosis to which she was exposed in her family.

“I am very worried. I’m living now under a shelter on a hill, but the water is still rising here, and I’m afraid of [venomous insects].”

“I’m urgently calling for aid to be delivered to this hill. There are many poor families here,” she said.

Flood begins to recede in Laos

In Laos, flood waters have begun to recede from eight districts in Savannakhet province, where 125 villages containing 5,134 families, or nearly 30,000 people, have been affected, Lao media sources say.

In the province’s Sepon district alone, 40 villages containing nearly a thousand households have been flooded, with many houses completely destroyed, sources said.

Sepon’s La Or and Vang Khot villages were hardest hit, with 44 houses swept away, and another 90 dwellings hit by fast-running floods and partly damaged, a district official said on Oct. 21.

“The district is still asking for help, but we will set up temporary refuges in the villages for people to live in,” the official said, adding that funds are being sought for building materials such as roofs and nails for the construction of temporary shelters.

Fast-rising water hit one village on Oct. 18 and swept away 28 or 29 houses, leaving nothing to come back to when villagers returned two days later, one villager said. “Now we have no place to stay in but the schools, and no one has any clothing. We are waiting to see how the authorities plan to handle this.”

“We are all in a very poor condition. We have no rice to eat, and all our rice fields are flooded. We will have to buy all the rice that we eat next year,” he said.

“The water is receding now, but the villagers’ houses are damaged beyond repair, and nothing can be restored. There is no thought of fixing them now,” a rescue team member said, adding that many residents of Sepon and other districts are still cut off because of damage to the roads.

Though Lao authorities had moved quickly to help victims of the floods, more help is needed, an NGO official said, asking that neither he nor his organization be named. “For a start, we urgently need dry food and drinking water, clothes, rice, and many other things, as so many houses have been swept away.”

“The authorities did go down to do everything they could, but there are just too many villagers to help,” he said.

Many residents in areas of Sepon and Phin districts are still out of reach, a Sepon district official said. “We are still unable to get to almost half of the areas affected by the floods because the roads have been cut off by landslides,” he said.

Losses in Savannakhet including houses damaged, livestock drowned, and paddy fields destroyed are still being calculated, the official Vientiane Times said on Oct. 21.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguy?n Thái H?p celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vu?t Lu C?ng Ð?ng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p, the bishop of Hà Tinh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghia, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Ngu?n N?y River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tinh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghia, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Ð?n.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_festaOK.JPG,"['tinh', 'h?p', 'centre', 'build', 'bishop', 'thái', 'hà', 'catholics', 'flood', 'work', 'nguy?n', 'local', 'community', 'paul', 'house', 'tiên', 'victims']", ,flood

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan donated US$400,000 on Friday (Oct. 23) to Vietnam in aid after the country suffered the severest floods and landslides in decades.

Richard Shih (???), Taiwan’s representative in Vietnam, said the Taiwanese business community in Vietnam, as well as non-governmental organizations from Taiwan, have mobilized themselves to send relief to the stricken areas in the country's central region. He said he hoped the victims will be able to reconstruct their homes and return to a normal life as soon as possible.

As of Friday, the series of floods and landslides have killed at least 114 people, and 20 people remain missing. Among those who lost their lives are dozens of military personnel who were deployed to search for those who had gone missing in previous disasters.

The Vietnamese military said it has suffered the most serious casualties in peacetime. In addition to the loss of lives, hundreds and thousands of houses were wiped out in central Vietnam, including Quang Tri and Thua Thien Huei provinces, and schools and other facilities have been forced to close.

Tran Quang Hoai, an official responsible for coordinating Vietnam’s rescue missions, accepted Taiwan's donation on behalf of the Vietnamese government at a ceremony on Friday. He remarked that the government is grateful for the generosity of the Taiwanese authorities and people, and that it will make the most appropriate arrangement for the donation so that relief and aid can be distributed to those in need soon, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

MOFA said via a statement that more than 320,000 Vietnamese migrant workers and new immigrants are living in Taiwan, and that the people of the two countries have been more than good partners. Taiwan looks forward to further strengthening bilateral collaboration to combat natural disasters in the future, it added.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/2020/AP/20201016/be8fe4b916764366af4b4d65ce1e386f.jpg,"['us400000', 'vietnam', 'donates', 'aid', 'taiwans', 'flood', 'suffered', 'oct', 'workers', 'central', 'taiwan', 'rescue', 'vietnamese', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

85,85,FL-2020-000211-VNM,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hardest', 'flooded', 'water', 'change', 'infrastructure', 'flood', 'flooding', 'region', 'floods', 'global', 'risk', 'river', 'hits', 'asia', 'climate']", ,flood

The bodies of two people were recovered on Saturday evening, while one remains missing.

The Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Van Ban District reported that the sudden floods affected 25 households, with furniture, motorbikes and construction materials damaged.

Two houses were swept away and dozens of others were damaged.

Prime Minister Ph?m Minh Chính issued a dispatch asking localities to focus resources on dealing with the consequences of floods and heavy rain in the northern mountainous region since Friday.

In the dispatch to the people’s committees of the six northern mountainous provinces of Lai Chau, Yen Bai, Son La, Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang, the Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control, National Committee for Disaster Response and Search and Rescue, and relevant ministries and agencies, the PM extended his condolences to families of the victims, and asked the local authorities to help locals fix houses and clean the environment, and provide them with food and essential goods.

He also asked the localities to keep a close watch on developments of flooding and rain, and to review and assess the safety of homes, especially in areas at high risk of flash floods and landslides, while preparing forces, vehicles, and equipment to deal with any circumstances.

The media will continue to provide information on developments of the natural disaster, damage, and response efforts, according to the dispatch.

The recent, devastating floods highlight the fragility of the country's natural environment. Deforestation, expanded farming, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric dams are the main culprits. In four years, 7,300 hectares of forest have been lost. So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built with another 450 on their way.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) – Recent floods in Vietnam caused by typhoons and tropical storms have had a devastating impact in terms of lost human lives, environmental damage, and economic dislocations, highlighting the fragility of the Asian country's environment.

Frequent and violent weather events worry both environmentalists and the affected communities more and more.

According to Vietnam’s Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, the main factor is deforestation and the conversion of entire forests to farmland, timber harvesting, and the large dam and hydroelectric plant construction.

Among the most affected areas are the central coastal region and the central Highlands, scene of the recent devastations.

The General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control estimates that some 7,300 hectares of forest land were lost between 2016 and 2019, with an annual average of 1,800.

At the current rate of deforestation, if nothing is done to slow this down, the risk of floods and landslides will increase considerably, along with periods of drought and loss of mangroves.

Environmentalists and experts note that the life and survival of Highland communities are closely linked to local forests.

From the central part of the country to the Mekong River Delta in the south, forests play a leading role in regulating local ecosystems, biodiversity, water resources, and the climate of much of the country.

For Prof Nguy?n Ng?c Lung, forests are key to blocking winds, limiting soil erosion and containing the devastating force of storms. In addition, tree roots absorb excess water.

Deforestation contributes to climate change, global warming, drought, rising water levels, pollution, and famine.

In view of the situation, the General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, noting that the country has recently had to face between 10 and 15 floods.

The blame goes to extensive “legal and illegal” deforestation to expand farmland, harvest timber or build crucial hydro-electric plants to meet the country’s energy needs.

So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built and another 450 are in the planning phase with further devastating impact on the environment.

Some see these plants as ""water bombs"" ready to strike at the population. Their effects are visible in many parts of the country, including Da Lat, a city that is located about 1,500 metres above sea level and a major tourist destination, with its almost year-round cool and temperate climate.

Since 2012, the city has been hit by flooding with increasing frequency, to the extent that today, when rain is intense, many parts of the city and Lam Dong province ""end up submerged by water"".

Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc Thanh.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Vietnam has given $540,000 in immediate support to women and girls in six central provinces affected by flooding.

UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of hygiene items and maternal health equipment. It is also supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services.

The central region has suffered unprecedented flooding from prolonged downpours and successive typhoons since October 6, resulting in at least 230 people dead or missing. Storm Molave hit the region on October 28, reportedly one of the strongest in 20 years.

At least 5.5 million people in the region have been affected, including more than 1.3 million women of reproductive age, over 92,000 of them pregnant mothers, who need uninterrupted services for pregnancy and menstruation, UNFPA said.

According to joint rapid assessment led by UNFPA last week, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programs such as antenatal, delivery, post-natal care and family planning services have been disrupted.

As a result, local women are unable to manage their hygiene properly and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear needed to manage menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and places to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged, the organization explained.

On October 12, a 35-year-old pregnant mother living in Phong Dien District of Thua Thien-Hue Province died on her way to give birth.

She entered labor in the morning, with her husband hiring a boat to take her to a local medical center for delivery. However, the boat was upturned and she was swept away by floodwater.

Her husband and local residents tried to look for her, but failed because of the fast-flowing current. Her body was found in the afternoon.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA representative in Vietnam, said: ""When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousands of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable.

The National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on Monday afternoon that the low pressure out in the north of the South China Sea (known in Vietnam as the East Sea) had strengthened into a typhoon internationally known as Nangka.

Nangka is forecast to make landfall in the north-central part of Vietnam on Wednesday, while the accompanying rains could cover the central region already battered by torrential downpours over the last few days.

The centre forecast that central provinces would face heavy rains ranging from 150 to 300mm on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control issued an urgent letter on Monday asking the bureau to closely supervise the development of the low pressure system and issue warnings to localities and ships.

Authorities also instructed boats and ships to find safe habour and to take measures to ensure the safety of local people and tourists on islands and in coastal areas.

The Foreign Ministry was also asked to contact countries and territories to ask for shelter for Vietnamese fishermen.

The ongoing downpour, exacerbated by Typhoon Linfa which hit the central region on Sunday morning before weakening to a low pressure area, destroyed a total of 382 houses and flooded 109,034 others, and damaged 108 sections of national highways and 8.6km of provincial highways.

The disaster caused big losses to agricultural production by destroying 584ha of rice, 3,879ha of vegetable, 2,141ha of aquaculture, whilst killing about 150,700 cattle and poultry.

In Danang, many communes were submerged by rising floods worsened by water discharged from hydropower reservoirs.

As of 7am on Monday morning, the communes of Hòa Phong, Hòa Nhon, Hòa Liên, Hòa Khuong, Hòa Châu and Hòa Ti?n were badly submerged, affecting the lives of 3,000 local households in 38 hamlets.

In the mountainous districts of Hoà Vang, Liên Chi?u and C?m L?, there was high risk of flash floods and landslides.

At present, 882 households in typhoon-affected areas have been moved to safer areas.

Meanwhile, people in the central province of Th?a Thiên-Hu? are entering their fifth day of flooding and heavy rain.

Rainfall of over 1,000mm flooded areas near the B? River, badly affecting to districts of Phong Ði?n and Qu?ng Ði?n, as well as Huong Trà Township.

Local people have been suffering from food shortages due to disrupted transport.

Hoàng Sinh, a resident of Phong Hi?n Commune, told Vietnam News Agency that his family’s food reserves were running due to the prolonged rain and flooding, and they were down to a few packs of instant noodles and rice.

Tr?n Ð?c Thi?n, chairman of Phong Hi?n Commune, said the local government was trying to reach local households to supply food, drink and medicine.

“The floods surged rapidly and people in low-lying areas could not keep up. Water spilled into their houses submerging them up to one metre,” said Tr?n Van Hoàn from Huong Trà Township.

“The whole family had to move to a neighbour's house. For several days, we only had instant noodles to survive,” said Hoàn.

“This is the worst flood since 2006. It has badly affected 70 per cent of local people,” said Ph?m Công Phu?c, vice chairman of Qu?ng Thái Commune.

The provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Rescue reported that as of 6pm on Sunday, three people had died, while seven were injured and another was missing.

Nineteen houses had, and 53,385 houses and 360ha of crops had been flooded.

More than 100km of coastline from Huong River across Huong Th? Commune and Huong Trà Township was severely damaged by erosion. About 300m of the dyke in Qu?ng Phú Commune, Qu?ng Ði?n District was also hit.

In Hu?, more than 50 per cent of roads in 27 wards and 2,560 houses were flooded as of Monday morning.

In Qu?ng Tr? Province, the flooding dramatically increased on Monday morning.

The downpour made the water in the Th?ch Hãn and Ô Lâu rivers reach alert levels.

The river water levels were forecast to continue rising today and next days.

To cope with the situation, Qu?ng Tr? authorities have asked the central Government to supply materials and rescue equipment, including two amphibious vehicles, 27 boats, rescue equipment and chemicals for disinfection.

The week-long rain killed six and injured two in the province, with a further six reported missing in the province.

Hue, Vietnam — Every day for the last four months, Duong Thi Mong has carried food, pots, dishes and other utensils on her shoulders to walk nearly 5 kilometers daily from her house to a nearby village, where she serves com hen (rice mixed with mussel, a popular traditional dish) to local people on streets of Thua Thien Hue province. Mong, a Buddhist from Hue's Vi Da ward in central Vietnam, which is famous for its mussels, said she usually takes her boat to carry food over the Huong River then walks only 600 meters to her destination. However, her boat was wiped out in severe flooding after six tropical storms hit the central provinces in October and November. The 56-year-old mother of two said she earns 80,000 to 100,000 dong ($3.50 to $4.30) per day to support her family, not enough money to buy a new boat. She said she had to work harder and sell food at night to get money to prepare food for the celebration of Tet, or Lunar New Year. Local markets closed for the weeklong traditional festival Feb. 10 ahead of the New Year, which starts Feb. 12. Thankfully, sisters across Vietnam have stepped in to help Mong and others like her.

""I am excited for the nuns who offered me 10 million dong [$435] on Jan. 28. I will use the money to buy a new boat for my work soon,"" Mong said cheerfully, adding that the boat is really a lifeboat that will help save her energy so she can work longer and earn more money to put food on the table. Sr. Maria Truong Thi Minh Yen of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate said her community provided boats for 12 people who lost their boats during the severe floods that left many people nothing in their wake. Yen, who serves Tan Thuy Parish, said she called on benefactors for donations. ""We do want to provide local flood victims with longer-term help so that they can stand on their own feet and return to normal life soon,"" she said. Many victims do not have enough money to be able to purchase basic means of doing their jobs. The 69-year-old nun said her convent gives clothes, blankets, rice and medicine to more than 100 street people, migrants, boat people and slum dwellers on a regular basis. Many live in makeshift shelters while others stay in low-rent, stuffy lodgings as their properties were washed away by flooding. ""They have suffered much from the last natural disasters and the chilly weather this year,"" Yen said. The temperature fell to 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January in the tropical area.

Luong The Thien from Phu Hiep ward said he built a new house in January after he received 65 million dong from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. His old 40-square-meter house was damaged in the floods. Thien, a 54-year-old Buddhist, said he could not afford to rebuild his house as he works as a motorbike taxi driver to support his wife, who has lung cancer, and three children. ""We are happy to celebrate the Tet festival in the dream house. We are extremely grateful for the nuns' generous help that benefits our life long-term,"" he said, adding that according to tradition, people cannot be well-established in their careers until they have stable homes.

Thien said he has had a good relationship with the nuns since he took a nun from a local hospital to her convent in 2008. The nuns regularly visit his family, and his children receive a monthly scholarship from them. Nguyen The Thieu, a Buddhist from Cau Nhi village, said he is among seven local families who received money to repair their storm-damaged houses. His Catholic son-in-law introduced him to the nuns.

Sr. Maria Nguyen Thi Hong of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Visitation, who serves Nam Dong Parish, said the nuns offer 60 local ethnic Co Tu and Kinh families money to buy pigs and chicken to raise and fertilizers to cultivate their crops. Local people lost all their crops, poultry and cattle during the floods and now have to collect firewood and bamboo shoots for a living. On Jan. 23, the nuns provided bicycles for 23 students in Nam Dong Parish who walk 5 kilometers to school.

As of Wednesday morning, northern Vinh Phuc Province had reported two fatalities while Lao Cai, Son La, Lai Chau and Thai Nguyen claimed one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.

The committee said at least four others were injured.

Since last Sunday, northern provinces have been battered by torrential downpours due to the influence of a tropical convergence zone and effects from tropical storm Higos, which made landfall on China’s southern coast Wednesday morning.

Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Ha Giang and Tuyen Giang experienced heavy rainfall of up to 300 mm each downpour while Quang Ninh, home to world famous Ha Long Bay, and Hai Phong City received rainfall of between 200 and 350 mm each time. Levels of 180 mm a day are considered heavy.

At least 334 houses in the localities were damaged. Over 550 ha of rice and other crops were inundated while landslides blocked many roads leading to northern mountainous provinces like Lai Chau and Lao Cai, home to popular Sa Pa Town.

Weather forecasters warned northern provinces should expect heavy downpours with rainfall of between 100 and 250 mm from Thursday to Saturday due to the impacts of Higos.

Tran Quang Hoai, vice head of the committee, asked northern authorities to deploy rescue teams and evacuate residents in flood-prone areas.

Higos is the fourth storm formed in the East Sea this year.

The waters, known internationally as the South China Sea, could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, half of them directly affecting the country, meteorologists said.

Natural disasters, including drought, floods and landslides, killed 133 Vietnamese last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In the first half of this year, natural disasters killed 47 people and caused economic damages of VND3.3 trillion, according to official data.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/08/19/a9f5d4e442a7abf9f2b6-159782323-4253-6860-1597823279_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'flood', 'provinces', 'tropical', 'hit', 'heavy', 'rainfall', 'mm', 'committee', 'cai', 'killed', 'northern', 'ha']", ,flood

The United Nations Population Fund in Vietnam will provide an additional $800,000 to support women and girls affected by flooding in eight central provinces and cities.

It brings the UNFPA's total support to $1.34 million. In October it had given $540,000.

The support includes setting up mobile and outreach health care clinics and the distribution of dignity kits with essential hygiene items and vital maternal health equipment and supplies.

Between early October and mid-November the central region and parts of the Central Highlands were hit by a succession of storms that brought torrential rains, resulting in severe flooding and landslides.

At least 192 people were killed and 57 others are still listed missing, and losses amounted to VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), the government said.

Around 5.5 million people have been affected, including over 1.3 million women of reproductive age and more than 92,000 pregnant women, the UNFPA said.

The disaster forced women and girls into shelters without having the time to pack essential supplies, and many lack basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear that are needed to manage their menstrual periods, it said, adding that access to water and places to wash, dry reusable pads and clothes and dispose of used materials are lacking.

Routine public health programs such as antenatal, child birth, post-natal care, and family planning services have been disrupted.

The government provided VND770 billion for emergency relief.

Many international organizations and countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Australia also provided aid.","Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/08/huukhoaduadeolethuy51603180554-1148-5001-1607411128_1200x0.jpg,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'rains', 'health', 'girls', 'flooding', 'central', 'agency', '800000', 'women', 'pregnant', 'million', 'support', 'provided']", ,flood

On the night of October 11, Le Trung Lam, a resident of the central town, braved the floods to go and pick up some migrant students who had been marooned in their inundated home for days. He took them to his company on Ngu Binh Street, An Tay Ward, where 30 people were already sheltering.

They cook in the kitchen and eat three meals a day, and also have blankets, mattresses and electricity.

Three days earlier, many students from other places now studying in Hue, had no idea where to shelter as the floodwaters rose relentlessly and inundated their homes. Then Lam's message arrived out of the blue.

He said: ""The company's headquarters, a five-floor building, is situated on Ngu Binh Mountain, and so the water has not reached it yet. Its two top floors have 10 rooms each that can accommodate 20-30 people.""

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential downpours in central Vietnam for a week now have killed 29 as of Tuesday morning. Among the deaths, six are from Thua Thien-Hue Province, home to Hue.

Lam, 33, decided to turn his company into a shelter on October 8 as the waters reached some major roads and were expected to rise further. Driving around the town to check on the flood situation and how people were coping, he passed by the studio apartment where he himself had lived 15 years ago as a migrant student from central Nghe An Province. He too had suffered during flooding.

Fearing for students who were possibly cut off, he posted an announcement that he was willing to shelter people.

In the last few days he has received hundreds of calls from people seeking help. Since the neighborhood still has access to electricity and the market remains open, Lam's employees have been able to buy food and cook meals.

Lam said he would take care of the students until the floods receded.

If the water level keeps rising, he plans to also use the main hall which can hold 500 people.

Le Thi Anh Ngoc, 19, from the central Quang Binh Province, said she walked on flooded streets for more than an hour to reach Lam's place on the morning of October 11.

""I arrived in Hue four days ago. I did not know who would help us before I learned about Lam.""

Six kilometers away from the company, on Tung Thien Vuong Street, Ngo Thi Kim Loan is busy making 500 banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich, with the help of a few others to send to people stranded on Hen Dune and Han Mac Tu Street.

Loan, who regularly does charity, always has instant noodles at home. Three days ago, seeing the rising water levels, she gave away 100 boxes of them to households in her neighborhood facing difficulties.

On October 12 she cooked 40 kilograms of rice for people living in areas where power has been turned off due to the floods.

The owner of a noodles restaurant also posted on her Facebook page that families with children or old people could command shelter at her home.

In the evening, when Loan sent 300 banh mi to households on Hen, Le Quoc Phong, Loan's neighbor, 40, was eating dinner under an oil lamp. The island in the middle of the Huong River was cut off by the rising waters.

Phong volunteered to help distribute food to those in need. Finishing his meal, he quickly got on a boat to take the banh mi to people before dinner time was over.

Distributing food and offering accommodation are Hue people’s way of supporting people affected by the floods.

Dozens of families living in higher places said they are ready to take in people whose houses are flooded and provide instant noodles to those who need them.

Free food distribution centers have been set up in downtown areas in the last few days, but are accessible only to people living nearby because of the situation.

People are also helping their fellows facing a threat of losing their livelihoods.

Over several days, strong winds and torrential rains caused huge damage, submerging homes, wiping out farmland, killing and sweeping away cattle. The Diocese of Hà Tinh, along with Caritas and the Catholic Business Association brought donations.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) - Strong winds and torrential rain over several days have caused flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 37 so far. Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên Hu? and Qu?ng Nam are the most affected provinces.

Heavy rains from 10 to 13 October inundated residential areas, farmland and roads, causing huge damages to people and property.

The General Department of Disaster Prevention reported that, in addition to the 37 deaths, at least 50,000 houses were flooded or wrecked whilst 250 hectares of rice fields and 2,500 hectares planted with vegetables were wiped out. Some 900 hectares dedicated to aquaculture were also damaged; at least 60,000 animals, mainly cows and poultry, were killed or swept away by the raging waters.

Bishop Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p of Hà Tinh (about 340 km south of the capital, near the coast), decided to visit the flooded areas to bring some help. On Saturday, he led a delegation from his diocese to Trung Quán parish.

The prelate tried to visit every family, one by one, to encourage them and leave them with some small gifts. For those who met him, “He is a true pastor. He did not just give us some gifts; he brought us God.”

Trung Quán parish, one of the hardest hit, saw homes submerged and streets turned into rivers.

Thanks Caritas and the Hà Tinh Catholic Business Association, the bishop was able to leave a package containing instant noodles, a bottle of oil and two packs of condiments for each family he visited.

He also brought more than 200 million dong (about US$ 8,600). The diocese donated 100 million; Caritas 50 million and the Catholic Business Association, another 50 million. Although not huge, the money will help with the emergency.

Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p encouraged the faithful to recite the rosary and pray for all the people living in the flooded area.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VN-_Evacuation.jpg,"['tinh', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'business', 'bishop', 'diocese', 'hà', 'left', 'hectares', 'catholic', 'caritas', 'central', 'floods', '37', 'huge', 'million', 'visits', 'dead']", ,floood

The situation

Several provinces in the center, central highlands and south of Vietnam have been impacted by floods following torrential rain over a number of days. The worst affected provinces are Kien Giang followed by Lam Dong. Other provinces affected include Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Kon Tum, Dong Nai, Binh Thuan and Binh Phuoc. Re

According to a report issued by the National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (NCDPC), as of 10 August 2019, 10 deaths have been reported while four people injured and over 1,985 people evacuated. In total 12,141 houses are affected by the floods. In addition, households have lost livestock, gardens and other assets.

Flooding of the Cam Ly river in Lam Dong peaked on the evening of 8 August 2019 at 834.25m, exceeding all previous records by 0.28m. While the river level dropped slightly to 830.41m on the following day, it remains at dangerous levels. Flooding of the Dong Nai river at peaked on 9 August 2019 at 114.10m.

99,99,FL-2020-000211-VNM,Vietnam's handling of deadly floods shows how Covid-19 may slow disaster response - The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/vietnams-handling-of-deadly-floods-shows-how-covid-19-may-slow-disaster-response,"JAKARTA - A series of storms buffeting Vietnam this month, claiming the lives of 130 people and leaving 20 missing so far, has underscored the added complexity of responding to disasters during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Typhoon Molave, packing winds of 125kmh, is the fourth big storm to hit the country's central provinces this month, further immiserating the 800,000 people already affected by flooding in the region, as well as in Cambodia and Laos.

In such emergencies, teams of logistics and communications specialists would normally be dispatched from neighbouring countries to help pave the way for the delivery of supplies, and search and rescue missions. This time, owing to the pandemic, Vietnamese officials have declined such offers of help.

""Vietnam made clear that no personnel could come - only items,"" said Ms Adelina Kamal, executive director of the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, better known as the AHA Centre.

To be sure, Vietnam has seen worse and may be able to manage the disaster itself, with or without a pandemic. In 2017, more than a dozen storms triggered floods and landslides that claimed nearly 400 lives and caused the equivalent of $3.5 billion in damage.

Last week, the AHA Centre arranged the airlift of 1,300 kitchen sets, consisting of utensils for cooking and eating, from Subang, Malaysia, the location of one of three Asean regional stockpiles.

But none of the more than 320-strong Emergency Rapid Assessment Team who were already outside Vietnam were permitted to enter.

As Covid-19 threatens to drag on for many more months, emergency response officials will need to rely more on local talent if the pandemic deters the arrival of help from overseas.

There could be a repeat of recent years that saw multiple large-scale disasters, at a time when disaster mitigation officials may already be distracted with Covid-19.

Damage caused by storms and typhoons in the western Pacific in 2018, including Typhoon Mangkhut which claimed more than 130 lives in the Philippines and China, set a record of US$30.2 billion (S$41.2 billion) that year, only to be bested by the figure the following year which topped US$34 billion.

More than 4,300 lost their lives in earthquakes and tsunamis that stuck Indonesia's Central Sulawesi in September 2018. Ms Adelina recalls daily morning meetings in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan to plan airlifts using military aircraft to ferry supplies to victims of that tragedy.

""Without physical coordination, if we have multiple disasters like in 2018, it's going to be difficult,"" Ms Adelina said.

Flooding in Vietnam notwithstanding, this year has been quiet. The airlift to Vietnam this month was AHA Centre's first for a natural disaster since the onset of the pandemic in March, Ms Adelina said

The AHA Centre was established in 2011. By now, teams there have notched up sufficient experience and familiarity to cope with limitations stemming from the pandemic, said Ms Adelina, stressing the need for preparation to deal with disasters.

""We have to start the planning from now on,"" she said. ""People may have been clouded by Covid-19. Maybe they are praying that there won't be a disaster. But we are a disaster-prone region.""

Dr Raditya Jati, head of data, information and disaster communication at Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), said the central government is pushing local governments to identify populated areas prone to flooding and landslides, and temporary shelters that can minimise crowding.

Floods in West Jakarta last month were something of a dress rehearsal for a large-scale disaster, with officials handing out masks and enforcing social distancing, which Dr Raditya said prevented clusters of Covid-19 infections.

Decisions to admit foreign emergency workers remain on a case-by-case basis, Dr Raditya said.

""We are a big country,"" he said. ""There is a challenge to access the whole country.""","Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/10/28/yq-vietflood-28102020.jpg?itok=jWXcl7KJ,"['vietnam', 'officials', 'response', 'deadly', 'covid19', 'shows', 'disaster', 'lives', 'pandemic', 'adelina', 'floods', 'handling', 'month', 'vietnams', 'slow', 'ms', 'aha']", ,flood

The country’s benchmark VN Index soared 17% in the three months ended April 30, beating every major market in the region and almost doubling gains from the S&P 500 Index.

While foreign investors pulled about US$842mil (RM3.46bil) from the country’s shares so far this year, the tide could be turning.

Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR Global. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has raised more than US$350mil.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that – like in many others around the world – has attracted retail punters in droves.

Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

“The stock market was very active and many of my friends were making money from it, so I decided to withdraw money from the bank to invest in stocks for a better return, ” said Nguyen Lan Huong, a 30-year-old grocery store worker from the riverside district of Long Bien in Hanoi.

The final catalyst for Vietnam could be if international investors reverse their net sales of the nation’s stocks. Vietnam’s retail investors normally model much of their investment behavior around foreign investors when they look for which sectors to favour, according to SSI Securities JSC, the country’s second-largest brokerage.

Vietnam is an “investable market, ” according to HSBC Holdings Plc. The flood of local cash has seen trading volumes more than quadruple since the end of 2019, based on 50-day moving averages.

Worst hit is Hue province, some 700km (434 miles) away from the capital, Hanoi. Police and soldiers have been using canoes and boats in Ha Tinh city to reach the most flooded areas to evacuate people and move property to safety. In this city alone, more than 20,700 people were reported to have been evacuated.

In Quang Binh province, 130km away, flood water continues to rise, swallowing up entire houses or burying them beneath landslides. On Sunday 13 households , about 60 people in total, were relocated, as an estimated 3,000 tonnes of rock and soil came crashing down on homes and roads.

3,3,FL-2020-000210-VNM,Asia's Hottest Stock Market Has Vietnam Primed for Inflows - Bloomberg,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/frenzied-retail-investors-lead-charge-back-into-vietnam-stocks,"Individual investors are piling into Vietnam stocks at an unprecedented pace, fueling Asia’s biggest rally and stoking speculation that foreign funds will return after fleeing the market over the past year.

The country’s benchmark VN Index soared 17% in the three months ended April 30, beating every major market in the region and almost doubling gains from the S&P 500 Index.

While foreign investors pulled about $842 million from the Southeast Asian country’s shares so far this year, the tide could be turning. Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam ETF that’s raised more than $350 million.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that -- like in many others around the world -- has attracted retail punters in droves. Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

“The stock market was very active and many of my friends were making money from it, so I decided to withdraw money from the bank to invest in stocks for a better return,” said Nguyen Lan Huong, a 30-year-old grocery store worker from the riverside district of Long Bien in Hanoi.

The final catalyst for Vietnam could be if international investors reverse their net sales of the nation’s stocks. Vietnam’s retail investors normally model much of their investment behavior around foreign investors when they look for which sectors to favor, according to SSI Securities JSC, the country’s second-largest brokerage.

Bulking Up

Vietnam is an “investable market,” according to HSBC Holdings Plc. The flood of local cash has seen trading volumes more than quadruple since the end of 2019, based on 50-day moving averages. The benchmark index now includes 11 stocks exceeding $5 billion in market value, up from just two in 2015. Vingroup JSC has been leading the charge, and the conglomerate is now launching an ambitious plan to sell electric vehicles to the U.S. Vingroup was founded by the country’s richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine. The company started out focusing on property development but it now also makes cars and smartphones.

The stock exchange’s other heavy hitters include a smattering of state-backed behemoths -- Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, PetroVietnam Gas JSC -- as well as steelmaker Hoa Phat Group JSC and Vietnam Dairy Products JSC.

Vietnam’s stocks have been climbing amid optimism its export-oriented economy can maintain momentum after being one of the few in Asia to expand last year. Manufacturing activity jumped in April to the strongest since November 2018, according to a PMI report Tuesday. Equities retreated today, sending the VN Index down 1.1% as of 9:38 a.m. local time, after Vietnam’s capital city instructed school pupils to stay home in order to help contain an increase in local Covid-19 cases.

The country is well positioned as the U.S. and Chinese economies lead a global rebound from the pandemic. That’s because Vietnam benefited when U.S.-China trade tensions spurred companies to diversify supply chains out of its larger Asian neighbor.

“We’ve been positive on Vietnam for a number of years. They are a clear beneficiary of China-U.S. trade tensions and their handling of the pandemic has been among the best examples globally,” said Jeff Gill, who helped manage about $10.9 billion of assets at City of London Investment Management as of Dec. 31.

Waiting Room

Part of the problem may be that international investors overstretched when they splurged. Foreigners sold a net $876 million of Vietnamese stocks last year, similar to what’s been already sold so far this year. That’s in line with a wave of selling across Asian emerging markets. Those moves look to have simply swelled foreigners’ cash positions inside Vietnam, which are already substantially higher now than they were at the end of 2020, according to Vu Bang, former chairman of the State Securities Commission.

Vietnam’s stocks also faced a setback in March when FTSE Russell decided to maintain the country as a frontier market, instead of upgrading it to a secondary emerging market, citing settlement methodology issues. The State Securities Commission expects to resolve the issue later this year. Investors have also cited foreign ownership limits as a concern that could hamstring the market’s capacity to grow further.

Money managers from Sempione Sim SpA, to Asia Frontier Capital and City of London Investment Management Co. say they are busy looking for entry points. They cite solid economic prospects, relatively attractive valuations, rising foreign-direct investment flows and healthy earnings growth as reasons to be optimistic, while also showing faith in the government’s ability to contain the pandemic.

“I see Vietnam as a very nice compelling growth and stable story for the short, mid and long term,” said Federico Parenti, a fund manager at Sempione Sim in Milan.

Vietnamese like Quy, a 33-year-old swimming teacher, are all too willing to keep investing in the nation’s stocks. He never thought of buying shares until the pandemic kept on shutting down the pool where the Hanoi resident usually teaches his students, slashing his income. He used his entire savings at that time -- around 300 million dong ($13,000) -- to buy stocks. He made about a 12% return last year.

“I am not a professional investor and I don’t have experience,” he said. Quy is considering some more short-term purchases. “I think I am just surfing the wave to make some money from the stock market.”","Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ir5mSyGOctkc/v0/1200x800.jpg,"['jsc', 'vietnam', 'investors', 'investment', 'inflows', 'foreign', 'return', 'according', 'market', 'hottest', 'stocks', 'asias', 'primed', 'stock']", ,none

Since the beginning of October, central Vietnam has been pounded by consecutive tropical storms and typhoons, which have brought widespread flooding and landslides to the region.

At least 1.5 million people have been affected by flooding and 235 people have died or are missing, according to the Vietnamese government.

On October 15, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink declared a national disaster for the Central Vietnam region as a result of the widespread devastation caused by flooding and landslides. This flooding has disrupted electricity and telecommunication networks, as well as destroying infrastructure, houses, livestock, and crops.

On October 28, Typhoon Molave made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Vietnam. It was the worst typhoon to hit the country in the last two decades.

Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are the two of the five central provinces that have been hardest hit by the recent flooding and landslides. The other three provinces that have been severely affected are Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, and Hue.

To make matters worse, the monsoon season is still ongoing and another powerful storm, Typhoon Vamco, made landfall last Sunday morning in central Vietnam, causing even greater damage. This is the third storm system to pummel Vietnam in November and the 13th to hit the country this year. The economic damage is now estimated to be close to $1 billion, according to the Vietnamese government.

International donations are starting to come in from various countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Japan. To date, the U.S. has donated $2.1 million toward the humanitarian relief effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Vietnam Red Cross Society to assist during the ongoing recovery period.

The financial backing also focuses on USAID’s longstanding investments in Vietnam to help minimize loss and destruction caused by natural disasters. Although the Vietnamese government has been quick to allocate disaster relief funds, its efforts and capacities have been strained also by the coronavirus pandemic. Donations from the outside world will be certainly needed and appreciated.

Local NGOs have been working tirelessly alongside the government to deliver aid to those who have been most affected by the catastrophic storms and their results. Pacific Links Foundation is an NGO that currently supports disadvantaged families in central Vietnam and it has been vigorously fundraising to support families in flood-affected Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Hue provinces.

“Our volunteers on the ground have delivered emergency packages, which included rice, food, life jackets, and flashlights, to students and their families,” said Hong Nguyen, the deputy director for SEEDS, a Pacific Links Foundation scholarship program which currently supports over 2,500 students.

SEEDS and the Pacific Links Foundation are now working on another round of support that will focus specifically on long-term recovery, allowing school children in all eight central Provinces to return to school and provide support for the families that suffered the most during the recent typhoons and floods.

“We will provide packages which will include books and school supplies, as well as computer tablets for students to continue learning through our online learning platform, especially when schooling is being disrupted,” said Nguyen.

Another non-profit charitable organization focused on philanthropic activities to benefit Vietnamese people in need throughout the Central Vietnam region is Da Nang Go. The organization uses fundraising events and direct donations to address the specific needs of Vietnamese people affected by natural disasters, poverty, and hunger.

Presently, the group consists of about 20 local and international volunteers who have been doing regular relief trips to some of the harder hit flood and landslide zones across the region. The NGO recently took a convoy of trucks and cars to Tay Giang district in Quang Nam province to provide much-needed supplies.

Tay Giang experienced heavy flooding and deadly landslides in October and November and is generally considered to be one of the more economically disadvantaged areas of Central Vietnam. The majority of the people who live there are from the Co Tu ethnic minority, a patriarchal rural society whose men raise livestock and whose women are well known for making high-quality traditional handicrafts.

The Co Tu live in small stilt huts which can be easily damaged by storms and landslides. At least 30 families had previously been evacuated from one village in Tay Giang due to the recent landslides.

“Before the last storm came, the government wanted to move them to a safer place but the problem is they don’t want to move anywhere because they are scared and if they die then they want to die in their hometown. They are used to yearly storms but they didn’t know this year’s storms would be so bad,” said Hannah Bui, one of the main directors of Da Nang Go and owner of Hannah’s Restaurant in Da Nang.

“I wish I had more money so I could do more to help these people,” she said.

Recently, the Da Nang Go team assembled 250 aid packages for children and 750 for adults in Tay Giang, as well as presenting some cash donations in envelopes at Hannah’s Restaurant.

The aid packages consisted of water, milk, noodles, dry food, oil, fish sauce, salt, blankets, and notebooks. The money was raised through a recent fundraising event and from various donations by local and expat members of the Da Nang community.

The aid was greeted with smiles by the local villagers and government officials. The team also delivered supplies to two elementary schools and to adults in the neediest villages of Tay Giang. In one of the poorest schools, students are so impoverished that they can’t afford basic school uniforms and some students walk up to four kilometers per day to attend classes.

“When I do charity and I do small things like give candy to poor kids they are happy and smile, and when I give old people clothes and they say ‘thank you,’ it warms my heart and makes me feel good knowing I’ve brightened their day,” said Bui.

Da Nang Go will continue its ongoing fundraising and aid missions to help people around central Vietnam affected by these historically devastating storms and typhoons. Both Pacific Links Foundation and Da Nang Go are continuing to deliver aid packages and funds in the aftermath of Typhoon Vamco.

As much as these local charities and NGOs have brought much-needed relief for affected communities, in terms of food, clothing, school supplies, and direct funding, what is really needed now in terms of the recovery effort is the rebuilding of infrastructure, houses, and technological networks, and a re-supply of livestock to get things back to normal.

Office of Press Relations

press@usaid.gov

Today, while in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced the United States is providing an additional $2 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to Typhoon Molave and the ongoing severe flooding that has affected Central Vietnam since early October. This amount brings the total humanitarian assistance from the U.S. Government for people touched by the floods to $2.1 million.

With this new funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is ramping up efforts to meet emergency needs in communities affected by Vietnam’s historic typhoon season. Typhoon Molave, which made landfall in Central Vietnam on October 28, 2020, is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. Typhoon Molave follows weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1.5 million people and killed more than 130.

In response, USAID’s partners, including the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC), are addressing the immediate needs of the affected families for food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Because the floods have washed away livestock, farms, and infrastructure, USAID’s partners also will provide assistance to these families as they begin to restore their livelihoods.

This assistance builds on USAID’s long-term investments in Vietnam to reduce the risk and impact of disasters. With funding from USAID, for example, the VNRC has been on the front lines in responding to the impact of severe weather throughout this typhoon season.

The United States stands with the people of Vietnam during this difficult time.

7,7,FL-2020-000210-VNM,We must not repeat the Vietnam refugee tragedy in Afghanistan - Military Times,https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2021/05/18/we-must-not-repeat-the-vietnam-refugee-tragedy-in-afghanistan/,"The parallel between the Vietnam War and Afghan War is troubling. In both cases, the U.S. became involved in a foreign war without having a clear picture of what our ultimate objective was. We largely took over the direction of each war from a corrupt host government. Many citizens of our host country placed reliance on the U.S. to provide for their safety, come what may. The war became unwinnable because of a series of unfortunate decisions. Losing interest in the endeavor, we shaped settlement terms the host government was required to accept, intimating we would be there to help if worse came to worst. Here, the similarity ends, for now.

In the case of Vietnam, even though we knew weeks beforehand that the fall of South Vietnam was imminent, we made no concerted effort to extract the Vietnamese who had steadfastly supported the U.S. When their government fell, many thousands who had helped, trusted and relied upon us were murdered or incarcerated to the great dishonor of our nation. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the south and, although we gave many of them sanctuary, our help was slow in coming. The final chapter in Afghanistan has yet to be written, but it must not end up with a betrayal of our friends.

During the long and tortured course of America’s war in Afghanistan, many Afghans stepped forward at their great peril to serve and help protect our military personnel. As we withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban have stepped up their violent attacks and the danger to our friends has dramatically increased. We are morally obligated to provide them sanctuary within our borders.

There are two special immigrant visa (SIV) programs in place to bring our Afghan friends to the U.S., but they are mired in red tape — it takes up to three years to process an application. There is a backlog of nearly 19,000 SIV applicants, with about 50,000 family members. They are waiting in line, living in fear of death. There are not enough slots to take care of the backlog. The vetting process is understaffed, underfunded and overly burdensome.

In this crisis situation, there are two feasible alternatives — either review existing documentation in the files and grant visas to those who U.S. personnel have credibly vouched for in the files, or extract the SIVs and families from Afghanistan and complete any necessary vetting in a safe location. We processed South Vietnamese refugees at U.S. military bases in the late 1980s.

We need, also, to consider the plight of Afghans who don’t qualify for SIV status. A Taliban take-over, which appears increasingly likely, will create a flood of refugees, fleeing for their very lives. Being partially responsible for their plight, we are honor bound to provide sanctuary for many of them, just as we eventually did for those fleeing Vietnam. We should plan to evacuate Afghans who will be targets of Taliban reprisal — uncorrupted government and military officials, women’s rights advocates, educators, democracy advocates and the like.

Like many troops who served in America’s wars, this issue is very personal for me. I lived and worked with South Vietnamese soldiers in 1968-1969. I trusted them with my life, while they relied on the U.S. government as a friend and ally. Most of my Vietnamese friends were Catholics who moved from North Vietnam to Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam in 1954 to escape persecution. They were fiercely anti-communist and pro-American. It broke my heart when the communists took over in April 1975, knowing that my friends would be killed or imprisoned, as were many thousands of their countrymen. We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate. We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us.

8,8,FL-2020-000210-VNM,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

Vietnam’s flood death toll rose to at least 23 and authorities said the incoming storm Nangka would dump more heavy rain on the country in the coming days.

The floods also left at least 14 people missing in Vietnam’s central provinces, the government said in a statement on Monday.

Most of the victims were washed away by floodwaters, the national disaster management authority said, adding local authorities evacuated nearly 46,000 people from affected areas.

The floods have inundated more than 109,000 homes and 1,443 acres (584 hectares) of crops and damaged roads and bridges, the agency added.

According to weather forecasters, water levels will keep rising, swelling rivers and submerging more communities in the region, the state-owned Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.

The situation worsened over the weekend when Tropical Storm Linfa, which weakened to a depression when it hit the country, brought more rain to the region.

Soldiers were deployed to the area to rescue the workers, said the official, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

“We are concerned that the incoming storm will worsen the flood situation,” the official said.

Storm Nangka, which is forecast to make landfall in northern Vietnam on Wednesday, will trigger heavy rain of up to 400 millimetres (16 inches) in parts of northern and central Vietnam from Wednesday through Friday, the national weather agency said.

However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband.

Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDP’s 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.“Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam,” she said.“However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.”Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last year’s floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.”Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.“It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life,” he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: “I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, ( Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).“In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households,” said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing. At least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or collapsed./.","Tue, 04 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://en.vietnamplus.vn/favicon.ico,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'receive', 'storms', 'nam', 'quang', 'residents', 'undp', 'nams', 'central', 'support', 'house', 'houses', 'safe']", ,flood
11,11,FL-2020-000210-VNM,How flood protection can paradoxically put people at risk - Horizon,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/how-flood-protection-can-paradoxically-put-people-risk.html,"Professor Jeroen Aerts, a hydrologist at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in The Netherlands, says that when a city builds a defensive wall or dyke, it can make its citizens feel so secure that they actually flock to live or to develop businesses in the protected area. What’s more, they don’t bother to install their own flood protection.

This means that when rare – but inevitable – extreme flooding occurs the damage can be colossal.

It is just one way in which flood protection modellers may be underestimating – and sometimes overestimating – the true consequences of sea level rise, says Prof. Aerts. And it is happening because physical scientists are failing to integrate human behaviour into their models.

Prof. Aerts leads a team that is trying to change this using the technique of agent-based modelling which attempts to reproduce complex phenomena like human behaviour. They use software that creates autonomous decision-making entities called agents, each of which assesses its situation and makes a decision based on a set of rules that have been drawn from survey data and decision theory.

Last year, they published a paper that underlined the problem of the safe development paradox. By modelling what is known about how humans behave when governments install flood protection where they live and work, the team demonstrated that ‘the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas.’

But the study went on to show that governments could ‘largely counteract’ this effect if they simultaneously promoted policies that encourage people to flood-proof their buildings.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’ Prof. Jeroen Aerts, Vrije University, The Netherlands

Migration

Prof. Aerts believes that the failure of physical scientists to take human behaviour into account may also have led them to misjudge the degree to which flooding will drive migration. What’s more, it means they are not identifying precisely where it would be best to target help, because the models don’t distinguish adequately between those who will manage to look after themselves and those who won’t.

Sea level rise will, it is commonly predicted, displace 187 million people by 2100. But the figure, which comes from a 2011 study, is controversial.

‘Most modelling studies that deal with flooding risk or sea level rise use a top-down approach,’ said Prof. Aerts. ‘You have long-term scenarios – like how many centimetres is sea level going to rise, and what will the exposed population be … and you try to estimate the impact.’ Then, he said, the models are rerun to include the effects of various adaptation measures, such as dykes or managed retreat, after which researchers do a cost-benefit analysis.

But, Prof. Aerts said, ‘they forget about (asking) what is the probability that this dyke will be built? Or what is the probability that people will retreat? So they do not take into account the human behavioural factor which determines whether or not this measure will be implemented.

‘Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.’

Factors that get ignored include evidence that people’s decisions to migrate, or to stay and defend their land, vary with their wealth, age, risk perception, trust of government and attitudes to individual freedom.

Social scientists

Prof. Aerts says that his team is now turning the models on their head, in a new project known as COASTMOVE. They are integrating a global coastal flood risk model with an agent-based model to simulate how governments, private sector actors such as insurance companies, and individuals act and influence each other.

Another difference is that social scientists are feeding data into the project.

‘They provide me with the information about under what conditions are people going to implement a certain measure, from the individual level to the higher aggregate government level,’ said Prof. Aerts.

Some of this information is from pre-existing surveys on what drives people to migrate or otherwise respond to floods. The rest will be gathered from new surveys in six coastal areas in France, Ghana, the Marshall Islands, the United States, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Other, less traditional sources of information will come from data already collected via mobile phones, Twitter posts and even tax returns.

They will use data from Bangladesh, for example, where other researchers have been able to discover, from anonymised mobile phone data, how many people have fled from floods, where they travelled, and how soon they returned. They will also use data that Prof. Aerts has gathered over the last six years using algorithms to monitor tweets that mention the word ‘flood’, in 20 different languages. This provides daily flood maps that give ‘a pretty good idea of where we can expect most of the problems’, he said.

More data is coming from the United States where it has been possible to draw conclusions about migration after flooding from the location from which people have filed their annual tax returns.

Vulnerabilities

By simulating adaptive behaviour, the team hopes to provide more refined predictions about the degree to which sea level rise will cause migration – in the form of 1x1km2 global migration maps.

Dr Bina Desai, head of policy and research at the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, says that sea level rise will bring a variety of direct and indirect impacts, which will affect people differently depending on factors such as inequality and poverty, that are not adequately reflected in models.

‘What’s needed, if we think about risk of migration and displacement, is modelling with a less strong focus on the hazard and a stronger focus on underlying vulnerabilities and what exacerbates them,’ she said.

‘In principle, it’s the only way to do it,’ Dr Desai said of COASTMOVE’s approach. Even as a conceptual model, she adds, it will help to work out how the many factors interrelate.

‘The downside is to move beyond the conceptual model,’ she added. ‘If you want to translate that into numbers then (when we have tried it) we found we failed because all the inputs could not be populated with data.

‘But if they can find a way of doing it by (collecting enough data), using proxies and making assumptions and somehow modelling it out then I think that’s great.’

Just how are our seas changing and rising with climate change and the melting of Earth’s ice caps? This is the final story in a three-part series looking at the past, present and future of extreme sea level rise. In part one, we looked at what the last interglacial can tell us about extreme sea level rise and in part two we looked at rise of atmospheric ‘meteotsunamis’.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

i. Deliver immediate, life-saving assistance to those in the most urgent need, in support of the Government response and in line with Government requests for assistance.

ii. Ensure the most vulnerable people, including women and children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and LGBTIQ persons, are protected against violence and have equal access to humanitarian assistance and services without discrimination.

iii. Prevent the outbreak of communicable diseases and effectively monitor risks to the health of the affected population, including the nutrition status of vulnerable people such as pregnant and lactating women and children under five years of age. Deliver assistance in a manner that minimises the risk of COVID-19 for disaster-affected people.

iv. Ensure access to multi sectoral assistance and re-establish critical services. Promote the repair of key public service infrastructure in affected provinces, ensure food security, by restoring lost food stock, livestock and livelihoods, ensure access to sustainable drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene supplies, housing, replacement of productive assets and household items, and access to basic medical, social and public services to support the affected population transition to recovery and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

On 13 October, the Government of Viet Nam released a call for emergency relief and support following four tropical cyclones and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which combined have caused severe and widespread flooding, landslides, storm surge and strong winds since 6 October. As of 28 October, 214 people have reportedly been killed or are missing, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). An estimated 7.7 million people live in areas affected by flooding caused by the multiple storms, with some 1.5 million people in nine provinces directly affected and approximately 380,000 houses flooded, damaged or destroyed. Of those people directly affected by the current disaster, some 753,000 are women and girls, 134,000 are children under five, and 143,000 are over 65 years old.

On the morning of 11 October, Tropical Storm Linfa (Storm No. 6) made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Viet Nam, resulting in 150 to 300 mm of rain. This was followed on 14 October by Tropical Storm Nangka (Storm No. 7) which made landfall in northern Viet Nam, but also brought a further 150 mm of rain to the still flooded provinces of central Viet Nam. On 16 October, tropical depression INVEST 94W in the East Sea weakened into a low-pressure area and made landfall in the central provinces, and was subsequently followed by Tropical Storm Saudel (Storm No. 8) which made landfall in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces on 25 October. On 28 October, Tropical Cyclone Molave (Storm No. 9) made landfall in approximately the same area as Tropical Storm Linfa, with up to 700 mm of rain reported in Nghe An and Ha Thinh provinces and up to 400 mm of rain in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces.

In Quang Ngai province, some 17,000 people were evacuated because of the strong winds and rain. Between 5 and 20 October, VNDMA reported that many areas in central Viet Nam recorded a total rainfall of more than 2,400 mm, and in some locations, flood waters exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1979 and 1999.

As of 29 October, nine provinces have been affected by the cumulative impacts of the multiple storms including Tropical Cyclone Molave. These are, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Nghe An, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum provinces, with Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces most severely affected.

Following Tropical Cyclone Molave, more than 88,000 houses and 50 schools had their roofs blown off, the majority in Quang Ngai province, and some 375,000 people were evacuated to evacuation centres. Those in the evacuation centres are amongst the most vulnerable having had their houses damaged or destroyed and having lost key household items in the floods. Many of the evacuation centres are overcrowded, do not have access to sufficient basic facilities such as water and sanitation, and health care, and lack appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children.

As well as damage to houses, some 30,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged (including rice, other crops, and aquatic products) and more than 2 million cattle and poultry have been killed. This is likely to have severe impacts on food security and livelihoods, especially for those people who were already experiencing adverse economic impacts due to COVID19. Further, more than 360 schools have been flooded and damaged, with detrimental impacts on children’s ability to continue accessing education. In addition, more than 78 health centres and hospitals have also been damaged or flooded.

To date, the delivery of assistance has been hampered by extensive damage to public transportation infrastructure. VNDMA reports that more than 165 km of national highway, 140 km of local roads and three bridges have been heavily damaged. Rescue teams are accessing affected areas by boat to deliver relief items and to evacuate vulnerable people, prioritizing children, people with disabilities and elderly people. Communication has also been hampered by the loss of electricity in many affected areas.

The areas most severely affected by flooding are also those same provinces which experienced a second wave of COVID19 cases in July and August. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, a further thirty days of lockdown measures were implemented from 28 July to 5 September, with adverse socio-economic impacts for the region which already records higher than national average multidimensional poverty rates. As a consequence of COVID-19 related measures, the most vulnerable people had already had their coping capacities eroded prior to this current disaster and are thus in more acute need of immediate assistance to help them manage the current, compound crisis.

From 20 and 23 October, joint GovernmentUN-NGO assessments were undertaken in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai provinces. Key findings from the assessments include the need for emergency food assistance for 177,000 of the most vulnerable people, restoration of agricultural land, safe access to clean water and sanitation facilities including in health centres and schools, the provision of dignity kits for women and girls, provision of education supplies and alternative learning solutions to ensure continuity of learning, support for those people evacuated from their homes, repairs for damaged houses, replacement of basic household items, health support especially maternal and child health, risk communication activities, provision of micro nutrients and continuation of nutrition activities to prevent an increase in rates of malnutrition.

Protection has been identified as a key need in this response, including the immediate need to ensure protection and safeguards for women and children currently living in evacuation centres. Partners involved in the development of this plan have also highlighted the need to provide assistance in a gender-responsive manner that addresses the specific needs of women and girls. The Government has requested that all relief activities target the most vulnerable people, including poor, near poor, people living with disabilities, children, femaleheaded households and elderly people, which are the target populations for this response plan.","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/VNM-ResponsePlan-201031-051%20%281%29.jpg?itok=QHnLLURt,"['plan', 'response', 'nam', 'quang', 'provinces', '2020', 'viet', 'tropical', 'floods', 'affected', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'assistance', 'storm', 'including']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The lower Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam) experienced prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020 until early December 2020. This was due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka as well as tropical depression INVEST 94W. The three wind systems made landfall in Vietnam but brought along heavy rain to the rest of the lower Mekong region. Tropical storm Linfa made landfall on 11 October 2020, tropical storm Nangka made landfall on 14 October 2020 whilst tropical depression INVEST 94W made landfall on 16 October 2020.

The rainfall brought by the wind systems resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in southern Lao PDR. As of 20 October 2020, nine districts in three provinces of Salawan, Savannaket and Sekong were affected by the floods. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Based on an initial assessment on 20 October 2020, conducted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) with participation of Lao Red Cross, it was highlighted that 163 villages in the three provinces, with an estimated 15,305 households (97,514 people) were affected. Savannaket was the worst affected province with more than 10,000 households from 137 villages were reportedly affected in the province and two people had lost their lives. In Sekong province, around 3,000 people were affected, and two people had lost their lives. Salawan province reported more than 600 people affected with five deaths.

Cyclone Molave – the fourth tropical cyclone to threaten Vietnam this month – is barrelling towards the country’s central coast, worsening severe floods and landslides that have inundated parts of the region for weeks.

Vietnamese authorities are rushing to evacuate half a million people before Molave makes a projected 28 October landfall, packing wind speeds topping 110 kilometres per hour. The country is already struggling with intense floods and landslides that have killed at least 130 people and damaged a quarter of a million homes.

The Vietnamese Red Cross has already warned that 160,000 people may need food aid over the next six months, but that figure could rise after Molave makes landfall and its impact becomes more clear.

Aid groups say parts of Vietnam are seeing their worst floods and landslides in two decades. Disasters are common during Asia’s various monsoon seasons, but this month’s flurry of storms has aggravated conditions, with weeks of extended heavy rainfall.

Parts of Laos and Cambodia are also submerged. And Thailand is projecting that Molave's rains will hit the country’s north and northeast.

Before threatening Southeast Asia’s Mekong region, Cyclone Molave uprooted some 25,000 people in the Philippines earlier this week.

16,16,FL-2020-000210-VNM,Vietnamese pick up the pieces after 2020’s relentless storms - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/31/vietnam-storms,"Climate change increases the risk to hard-hit central provinces, but few want to leave the only home they know.

Hue, Vietnam – Before floodwater inundated half their living room one night during the storm season this year, the Trans put their most valuable possessions – their TV and refrigerator – in the attic and told their two daughters to take refuge there.

Tran Nhu Hong, 23, and her 18-year-old sister, who do not know how to swim, survived the storms – the worst her generation had ever experienced and the worst her parents had seen in decades.

A neighbour was not so fortunate. The 19-year-old student was swept away in the floods after the vehicle she was travelling in was tipped over by the force of the water – on the same route the two young women usually take.

“Shortly after the water retreated, I went on that route and the vehicle was still there and had not yet been pulled out (of the mud),” Hong said. “I don’t dare to go on that route late at night any more.”

Across central Vietnam, cascading floods from October onward inundated the living and the dead, as record rainfall submerged towns and cemeteries. Authorities said earlier this month that the typhoons, which they referred to as “abnormal”, cost the Southeast Asian country 30 trillion dong ($1.3bn) in damage and killed at least 192 people – a death toll more than five times higher than the 35 COVID-19 deaths Vietnam recorded this year.

A woman drives along a flooded road beside submerged rice fields [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “In general, it is well-established that rainfall from typhoons is increasing due to climate change, both from observations and from models,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead climate scientist at the Red Cross Climate Center and World Weather Attribution, whose team is conducting a study on the role of climate change in the recent floods and typhoons in central Vietnam.

Crops destroyed

With 70 percent of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas, Vietnam is highly exposed to riverine and coastal flooding and is also one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.

“There is even more damage after the floods,” Hong said, driving by rice fields made inlets because of the storms and floods in her hometown in Thua Thien Hue Province.

When the water retreated, it took crops with it, leaving behind scarred earth. Many farming families in central Vietnam count on rice, various other crops and cattle for income, especially as the Lunar New Year celebration, known as Tet, nears.

Tet is usually when Vietnamese shop for new clothes, gifts and appliances to welcome a new, fulfilling beginning; but with their homes and means of living ravaged by violent storms, severe floods and devastating landslides, Tet, which will take place in February, is likely to be tinged with sadness.

Hong’s parents are still recovering from the wounds and infections they got from wading through hip-high flood water for extended periods, and have yet to find jobs as construction workers due to the double burden of COVID-19 and the recent natural disasters.

Ichiro Sato, senior associate with the Climate Program and Sustainable Finance Center at US-based think tank World Resources Institute, says central Vietnam was battling extreme weather events long before climate change started to take effect.

“If governments have not been well-prepared even for the conventional risk of weather-related disasters that existed before climate change – and I am afraid that is the case for Central Vietnam – then there are so many things they have to work on before worrying about the additional risk of climate change,” Sato said, adding that unregulated urbanisation and economic growth may increase vulnerability to weather-related disasters in places like Vietnam.

The country typically endures between five and six storms and about three tropical depressions a year, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, but in 2020 a total of at least 14 ravaged the country. Seven consecutive tropical storms and cyclones hit the central region between October and mid-November.

Children at risk

According to the UN, an estimated 7.7 million people in nine provinces, including 2.5 million children, were affected – with hundreds of thousands of houses flooded, damaged or destroyed.

“There is no doubt that children are those most affected by natural disasters,” Rana Flowers, UNICEF representative in Vietnam, told Al Jazeera, adding that families’ ability to secure nutritious food for their children had already suffered as a result of the pandemic.

An estimated 375,000 people were sent to evacuation centres during the storms and floods, including about 90,000 children, according to Flowers.

“Many of the evacuation sites were overcrowded, did not have access to sufficient water and sanitation and healthcare, and lacked appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children,’’ Flowers said, adding that the situation severely affected the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children.

A study brief published in August by the US-based Society for Research in Child Development showed that children may suffer longer-term physical and psychological deficits than adults, including difficulty sleeping or concentrating and losing interest in their usual activities – chronic mental health symptoms have been observed among children as long as four years after a disaster.

A woman carries food through the submerged streets of Hue in central Vietnam [File: Manan Vatsyana/AFP] “In the long run, to be sustainable, the Vietnamese government should invest more to strengthen mental health services for children and their families, looking at the nationwide system and also building the workforce,’’ Flowers said.

Deforestation, which affects the ability of the land to retain water, also contributed to the flooding and a series of severe landslides during the stormy season, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said at a legislative National Assembly meeting last month.

Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam lost 657,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of primary forest – 23 percent of its total tree-cover loss according to data from international monitoring service Global Forest Watch. About 50 percent of all tree-cover loss between 2001 and 2019 took place in 11 of the country’s 63 provinces – eight of them in central Vietnam, it said.

The devastating landslides and flooding have prompted concerns about deforestation caused by the construction of hydropower plants in forests.

As of 2018, there were 385 dams in operation, with an additional 143 under construction, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Earlier this month, the minister acknowledged the increased evidence of the loss of watershed forests and vegetation, as well as a loss of soil adhesion, as a result of the developments.

The government has also announced sustainable and long-term missions to cope with storms in central Vietnam, including upgrading climate-change adaptation scenarios and relocating people in areas at risk of landslide and flooding.

No place like home

For those who have been living in the area for generations, like the parents of 21-year-old university student Le Thi Thuyen, leaving their storm-battered homes seems unfathomable.

“We can be accustomed to annual storms but whenever they come, we are still worried,” said Thuyen, a native of Quang Binh, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the central region.

Thuyen, who left for Ho Chi Minh City to study and is currently an intern at a non-governmental organisation in Vietnam’s biggest city, called her parents and siblings back home every day when the storms were pounding their commune, flooding and isolating homes in low-lying areas.

Tears welled up in her eyes when she thought of her 12-year-old brother who does not know how to swim.

Cemeteries were inundated as floodwaters rose in central Vietnam [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] “I read news about kids who got swept away by the flood and I was really worried about my brother,” the 21-year-old said.

By Vatican News staff writer

Volunteers and workers of Caritas Vietnam are visiting and assisting people in the central provinces who have to face the brunt of 13 storms this year with some severe flooding.

The umpteenth storm

In just over a month, Vietnam's central region has seen 7 tropical storms and typhoons, causing floods and landslides that killed 235 people and caused an estimated $740,000 in damage in several provinces. The rain from the storms has caused the worst flooding in the region in more than 30 years.

The latest of these typhoons, Vamco, made landfall in Vietnam on Sunday with winds of up to 150 kph, after leaving 67 dead in the Philippines. The storm has damaged more than 400,000 homes, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. At least 150,000 people are at risk of going hungry.

According to Caritas, the social arm of the Catholic Church, rebuilding homes and recovering their livelihood are extremely important apart from immediate help and survival. Farming, such as growing vegetables, rice, raising livestock and poultry, which is the mainstay in the central provinces, has been devastated. Many families have lost everything in the floods and landslides.



Local Caritas in action

The new director of Caritas Vietnam, Father Joseph Ngo Si Dinh, led a delegation to the central provinces, Nov. 9-11, to survey the flooded areas. They first visited the Diocese of Hu? and its two adjoining provinces, talking to families and providing them material and spiritual support.

Father John Nguyen Huy Tuan, director of Caritas Ha Tinh, said priests were actively involved in bringing food and relief to the affected people and moving them to safer places.

Temporary shelters have been built to accommodate 25 families. A parish mobilised its young people to rescue families trapped in flooded homes.

No one excluded

Caritas Vietnam, in collaboration with dioceses and parishes, has been engaged in social outreach and charity works to help people after natural disasters.

The social arm of the Catholic Church assists people to rebuild their lives, repair damaged houses and build new homes for families who have lost theirs. It also provides people and families with seeds, livestock, water filtering systems, and finance for school children.

Caritas discussed ways to come up with concrete plans or projects to rebuild the lives of people regardless of their religion. Father Dinh has urged Catholics to help every person in need. “We hope that the people most affected by these storms, be they Catholic or not, will get some relief,” the Caritas director said.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/reuters/2020/10/13/14/1602592734645.JPG/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'storms', 'provinces', 'flood', 'caritas', 'social', 'homes', 'central', 'region', 'families', 'typhoons', 'storm', 'victims', 'assisting']", ,flood

On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.

The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.

The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.

On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh 400-500 mm, Quang Tri 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City 1,100 mm, Quang Nam 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai 600-800 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In this period, more than 130,000 houses, mostly in Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue provinces had been flooded, with some submerged by four meters.

Streak of tragedies

Around 3 a.m. on October 8, cargo vessel Vietship 01 of a Hanoi-based logistics firm was swept away by floods and rough seas as it docked at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri.

The ship had 12 male crew members on board when swept off. Four crew members who had fallen from the vessel made it safely to shore on October 9 and 10. One member, aged 45, had also jumped into the water but went missing before his body was retrieved on October 11.

Heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas derailed rescue efforts and the vessel sank to the bottom in shallow waters, leaving the rest of the crew and one fisherman, part of a rescue squad, stranded at sea.

It took rescue teams three days to reach the stranded vessel.

""It was difficult for modern vessels to reach the stranded ship so we had to rely on rudimentary boats and experienced fishermen for the mission,"" explained Colonel Le Van Phuong, head of Quang Tri Border Guard.

On the morning of October 11, the fisherman and a crew member jumped into the water and battled their way back through the rough seas and strong waves. Two teams of rescuers rushed to deliver them safely to shore.

Within the same day, a military helicopter was sent to the scene to rescue the remaining six crew members stuck on the vessel. Two days after he was rescued, however, ship captain Nguyen Van Bao, 51, passed away due to multiple organ failure and sepsis.

At midnight on October 12, a hill collapsed onto an operation center of Rao Trang 3 Hydropower Plant, located deep in a jungle of Phong Xuan Commune, Phong Dien District in Thua Thien-Hue.

The landslide buried 17 workers after 40 others escape to a nearby plant, called Rao Trang 4.

The story of the 17 workers is even more tragic since a 21-member rescue team that had set out to verify reports of their predicament got struck by the same calamity.

At midnight the next day, a landslide had buried the ranger station housing the entire rescue team. Only eight members managed to escape, with the remaining 13 confirmed dead, including Major General Nguyen Van Man, deputy commander of the 4th Military Region of Vietnam People's Army. The bodies of the 13 victims have all been found and identified, though only five of the 17 workers' bodies have been retrieved.

During funeral procedures for the 12 soldiers and their deputy commander, another landslide struck a barracks housing 27 personnel of Defense Economics Division 337, also managed by the 4th Military Region.

The division had been assigned to assist five remote communes in Huong Hoa District of Quang Tri, which borders Laos, in mitigating the impacts of prolonged flooding and landslides triggered by abnormally heavy downpours across the central region.

As the mountain collapsed onto their barracks in the first hours of October 19, the 27 division members were all sleeping, with only five managing to escape. Three more landslides buried the remaining 22.

By the afternoon of that day, all 22 bodies had been retrieved.

Luong Thi Ly, who lost her son Le The Linh to the landslide, said she could not believe he and his comrades had lost their lives during peace time.

New flood waves

And as mountainous areas reeled under repeated landslides, urban and coastal areas were hit by a new wave of flooding on October 18 and 20 due to the impact of tropical storms, the intertropical convergence zone and east winds in tandem with water discharged from dam projects.

On October 18, flood peaks recorded on the Hieu River of Quang Tri hit 5.36 m, passing the record level of 1983 by 0.78 m, while the peak on the Thach Han River rose to 7.4 m, 0.11 m higher than the 1999 record. In Quang Binh, floodwaters were measured at 4.88 m on October 19, or 0.97 m higher than the record in 1999.

For the second flood wave, more than 177,000 households in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri were inundated by floodwaters 1-4 m deep.

Many elderly people in Ha Tinh said for the past 40 years, they had never seen such severe flooding causing such serious damage.

In Quang Binh's Le Thuy District, a family who lost their 75-year-old grandmother, on October 17, had to hang her coffin from the roof of their house for nearly a week to avoid floodwaters.

More storms, floods and landslides

With heavy rains yet to show any signs of receding, Storm Saudel developed in the East Sea on October 20, though it had weakened and turned into a tropical depression as it reached the central coast on October 25.

Two days later, Molave entered the East Sea and headed straight to central Vietnam. It landed over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28 as the most powerful storm to have hit Vietnam in 20 years.

The storm had inflicted economic damage worth around VND10 trillion ($430.16 million), according to statistics from affected provinces. The loss was nearly 1.5 times higher than 2019’s total natural disaster-induced damage of VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), mostly ascribed to flooding, storms and landslides.

Subsequently, the storm triggered heavy rains that had led to more floods and landslides.

On October 28 alone, two different landslides struck Tra Leng and Tra Van communes in Quang Nam’s Nam Tra My District.

The Tra Van landslide buried 20, killing eight and injuring 12 while in Tra Leng, a mountain collapsed on 53 villagers, with 33 managing to escape, eight confirmed dead, and 12 still missing.

One day later in Phuoc Loc Commune, Phuoc Son District of Quang Nam, another landslide buried 11 victims. Seven have since been confirmed dead and four are still missing.

A survivor of the Tra Leng landslide, Nguyen Thanh Son, 56, had lost his wife to the accident. The bereaved husband cannot believe he has lost his family, house and entire village in the mere blink of an eye.

""Altogether, tumbling soil, mud, rocks, water and trees smashed in the roofs of our houses, sweeping everything away until hitting the foot of another mountain,"" Son recalled.

By the night of October 28, more than 4,000 families in Nghe An and Ha Tinh had been evacuated to safety after their neighborhoods had been submerged by up to two meters of water.

The third flood lasted until October 30 and by November 1, had receded.

While central Vietnam residents recuperate from Storm Molave and prior flooding, Storm Goni entered the East Sea on Monday morning, forecast to strike central areas from Da Nang to Phu Yen in the next few days.","Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/02/huu-khoa-tang-le-1-1603267441-7792-8579-1604304150_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'quang', 'central', 'landslide', 'month', 'tragedies', 'mm', 'crew', 'storm', 'rescue', 'day', 'm']", ,flood

A search operation has been launched for a missing rescue team as severe flooding and landslides battered central Vietnam, authorities said on Wednesday, as the country braced for further heavy rain.

Close to a million people have been impacted by heavy downpours and rising waters since mid last week, with more than 200,000 homes flooded, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Thirty-six people are now dead, Vietnam's disaster management authority said, while rescue workers have launched a search for around 30 people missing at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue province following landslides.

The missing include a team of soldiers and officials who had tried to find plant workers who disappeared days ago.

Images on state media showed helicopters and hundreds of soldiers struggling to access the site through thick mud and fallen trees.

Elsewhere across the central region, villages and rice fields were submerged, with relief workers resorting to makeshift boats and canoes to deliver food and bottled water to those stuck in flooded homes.

North central Vietnam was also hit by severe weather on Wednesday as Storm Nangka made landfall.

Forecasters said it could bring further rain in the coming days, while warning another storm was expected to form and make impact this weekend.

The IFRC said it had ""grave fears"" that the deadly floods would worsen as more rain was dumped on hard hit communities.

""These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods,"" said IFRC's Hung Ha Nguyen.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and is often affected by more than a dozen storms each year, regularly bringing flooding and landslides.

More then 130 people were reported dead or missing due to natural disasters in the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. “I wasn’t sad,” Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017’s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tay’s land. “That’s what I had to do.” He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldn’t be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasn’t wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. “Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them,” landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a “soft” levee girding the riverbank. She doesn’t view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. “The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and you’ve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made.” Dao’s mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, “a very sensitive and fragile area where ‘hard’ solutions [to erosion] won’t work”, said Dao, who has studied the region’s ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The “common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land”, Dao says. “Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down.” As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Dao’s words, “by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous”. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tay’s riverbank is like a pillow that doesn’t stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Dao’s green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses — a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, “people aren’t afraid of flooding”, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. “We have learnt to live with the floods,” he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. “Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive,” he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yen’s fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the island’s west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals’ trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the city’s famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes aren’t simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi An’s recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground. Dr Dao Ngo bought her own land in Triem Tay village to do her conservation work. Credit:Yen Duong “Now the ecological component is extremely important. In the past it was culture, now it’s ecology,” Hoi An’s vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local government’s development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. “Of course, it is difficult and it will take time,” says Hung. “Perhaps we won’t succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation.” As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemic’s wake, Hung doesn’t want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the city’s revenue. “We’ve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, there’ll be less to worry about.“

Ecology-based development, in Hung’s words, also means preserving the city’s forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. “If we achieve that, we’ll be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals’ life will definitely be improved.” Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. “You don’t see erosion here, but build-up [of land],” said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. “I’ve never seen these trees die because of flooding,” said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the river’s mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huong’s family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as “a fortune” on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river. Le Thi Huong, 59, a mangrove palm farmer, in her home made from the palms in Cam Thanh commune. Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. “The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; that’s why they protect it,” Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tay’s sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi An’s toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

The death toll from flooding and landslides in Vietnam continued to rise Tuesday, while those hit by the disasters triggered by tropical storms in the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos criticized government inaction and made urgent appeals for assistance.

In Vietnam, at least 104 people are dead in the country’s central region, with 49, 27, and 11 deaths reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam alone, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Control. Twenty-seven people are missing, including 15 workers from a hydropower plant in Quang Tri that was hit by a landslide on Oct. 12.

The committee said that some 90,000 residents of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Tri provinces have been evacuated to higher ground. Nearly 7,000 hectares of rice paddy and crop fields have been submerged, while more than 5,800 head of cattle and 685,000 poultry birds have been killed or carried away in floods.

Vietnamese state media on Tuesday reported that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved the allocation of 100 billion Vietnamese dong (U.S. $4.3 million) and 1,000 tons of rice to the five worst flood-hit provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Ha Tinh.

Meanwhile, the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre said a tropical depression in the Philippines has strengthened into what is being called Storm Saudel. Over the next 24 hours, Saudel is expected to enter the South China Sea—called the East Sea in Vietnam—and become the eighth storm to batter Vietnam’s central provinces since the start of the rainy season.

Tran Quang Nang, head of the weather forecasting department under the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre, rejected reports circulating on Facebook, allegedly citing Japanese forecasters, that Saudel is a super typhoon.

“All of these predictions about Typhoon Saudel are baseless and fake,” Nang said. “The Japanese weather forecasting center and other countries have said no such thing.”

Nang called on the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to “punish” those responsible for spreading inaccurate information on social networks, causing public confusion.

“This issue should be handled promptly to ensure people only access accurate information released by the authorities so they can respond to natural disasters, helping to mitigate the damage they cause,” he said.

In Cambodia, the death toll remained at 25 from a day earlier, with some 40,000 evacuated to temporary shelters, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha told RFA’s Khmer Service. More than 200,000 hectares of paddy field and nearly 80,000 farms have also been destroyed, with more than 500 school buildings and 79 garment factories damaged.

Roads, hospitals, and dams have also been affected, authorities said.

In a notice issued on Tuesday, the Poipet Administration of Banteay Meanchey province, along Cambodia’s border with Thailand, temporarily closed portions of National Road 5. Downtown Poipet saw flooding of homes and roads, which the notice attributed to rains in Thailand.

Sann Ratha, a resident of Kaun Damrei village, in Poipet’s Sangkat Nimith district, told RFA that water levels increased so rapidly that several hundred families were forced to leave their homes.

He said people are stranded and in desperate need of food and other supplies.

“We are under the attack from the flood—our village looks like a river now with water everywhere and houses submerged,” he said.

“The current situation is worse than during the [1967-1975] civil war. We need the authorities to help us immediately.”

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen traveled to affected areas visiting with victims and handing out food. He said in a post to his Facebook page that he plans to spend two days in hard-hit Banteay Meanchey province, where 13 of the country’s 25 deaths have occurred and an estimated 20,000 families have been affected.

Opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha is also traveling to Banteay Meanchey to provide assistance.

Din Puthy, head of the Poipet-based Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association, expressed skepticism over the government’s handling of the flooding Tuesday.

He voiced concerns that authorities appear to prefer taking selfies with small numbers of villagers and posting them on social media to pretend they are helping the victims.

“The victims are not receiving equal treatment,” he said. “Only a few people have received some assistance while many others have been left behind.”

More aid needed

In Laos, where storms have ravaged Savannakhet province in the country’s center, authorities remained unable to access many areas due to damaged roads and a lack of boats to transport aid and other supplies, Lao sources said.

More than 125 villages in eight districts have now been flooded, with many houses and over 10,000 hectares of paddy fields submerged, official sources in the province say. Nearly 30,000 people have been impacted in Savannakhet, according to official count.

An official from Savannakhet’s inundated Phin district told RFA Tuesday that people are in need of dry goods, drinking water, medicine, and other necessities. The official said that while most aid had been distributed it still is not enough.

“In Phin district, 45 villages are heavily flooded, but they have received some help already—they mostly need sticky rice and consumer goods,” he said.

He said villagers with boats had been using them to help one another and that there have been no accidents during rescue and supply operations.

A villager in Phin told RFA that the water level is so high that the local river had flooded homes along its banks and urged authorities to provide more assistance.

“They have helped a little, but it’s very difficult for us,” he said. “Higher-level authorities should take care of this. We’re asking for more rice—all houses need rice to eat.”

Authorities in Savannakhet’s Xonbury district said waters remain high and will rise in days to come, forcing villagers to stay in clubs, schools, and other places set up by the local government as temporary shelters until flooding recedes.

According to the Meteorology Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Laos will continue to endure heavy rains and strong winds throughout the country in coming days. It urged villagers to remain vigilant for flash floods and landslides.

Typhoon Molave was one of the biggest storms to hit the country in two decades, bringing a second round of deadly landslides there this month. Torrential rains and flooding unleashed a mudslide on Oct. 18 that leveled soldiers’ barracks in Huong Phung Commune, in the central coastal province of Quang Tri.

Storm Molave, which made landfall at around 11 am local time on Wednesday, is one of the strongest storms to hit the southeast Asian nation in 20 years.

The resulting “extreme rainfall” could continue over the coming days, worsening the already precarious situation faced by many families, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said in a statement.

“For the affected populations, their homes remain severely damaged, their food stocks have been lost, they have no access to clean water for drinking, washing and cooking; and water and sanitation systems have been damaged,” said the agency.

Evacuation centres flooded

Thousands have been moved to evacuation centres, which are themselves flooded, resulting in difficult health and hygiene conditions for the displaced people, primarily women, children and elderly. Health centres have also been damaged, leaving without to access basic health care services.

“Added to this is the trauma of the violent storms and rushing waters, that for a population where many cannot swim, creates fear and impacts mental wellbeing,” UNICEF added.

The storm has also damaged vital infrastructure, including electricity and roads, leaving many communities cut off from assistance and protection.

Affected populations

An estimated 7.7 million people live in the affected areas, including as many as 1.5 million who have been “directly affected”, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam said in a humanitarian update late Wednesday.

Of these, some 177,000 people considered vulnerable (poor or near-poor), should be prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance, it added.

Response

According to the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UN agencies and partners are developing and will release a multi-sector response plan, within the coming days, to support emergency relief efforts.

In the immediate term, UNICEF has mobilized to provide emergency water, nutrition, sanitation, education and protection support, it said in the statement. It is also coordinating with Government agencies and humanitarian actors to reach the most vulnerable and those most affected.

The Vietnamese army has also deployed troops and vehicles for search and rescue missions.","Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production+Library/29-10-2020-UNICEF-UN0354393-VietNam.jpg/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['storms', 'nam', 'water', 'viet', 'health', 'strikes', 'typhoon', 'millions', 'damaged', 'unicef', 'affected', 'vulnerable', 'centres', 'support', 'humanitarian', 'devastating']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

The central region of Viet Nam was experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimetres of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 150 millimetres of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. Additionally, Tropical Storm Saudel hit Viet Nam on 25 October closely followed by Typhoon Molave on 28 October. Typhoon Molave was one of the most devastating typhoons making landfall in Vietnam in decades. The typhoon made landfall after a series of tropical storms hitting Viet Nam and had caused severe flooding and at least three landslides which tragically resulted in the loss of 40 lives. 44 people are still missing, and six people are severely injured. On 5 November, Typhoon Goni made landfall in Viet Nam and Tropical Storm Atsani made landfall on 7 November. Tropical storm Vamco, was the latest to hit central Viet Nam as it made landfall on 15 November 2020.

The recurrent storms bringing heavy rainfall have caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. The Viet Nam National Disaster Management Agency (VNDMA) has reported that many areas in central Vietnam recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 1,600 millimeters between 5 to 20 October 2020, with peaks of 2,400 millimeters in some locations over the same period. The Hieu River (Quang Tri), Bo River (Hue), Gianh River and Kien Giang River (Quang Binh) have reached historically high levels, and in some locations flood waters have exceeded the previous historical highs recorded in 1979 and 1999. In addition, hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs to prevent them from bursting.

Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Authorities estimate that a nearly eight million people have been exposed to the storms, and some 1.5 million people have been directly affected by the storms and floods. On 4 November, ahead of typhoon Goni’s landfall, 98,819 households (372,631 people) in six provinces (Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen) were evacuated to safe shelters. Similarly, evacuations took place on 7 November in anticipation of typhoon Atsani, and on the 15th November ahead of typhoon Vamco’s landfall additional evacuations have been carried out in seven provinces of central Viet Nam with a total of 93,795 households (324,780 people) evacuated to safer places (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai).

Most of the people who had been evacuated have now returned home after their local authorities’ approval. They are actively repairing their homes with the help of their relatives. However, according to the VNDMA 31,637 households must be urgently relocated because they lost their shelter or their houses which have collapsed or been too heavily damaged, and they are now living with host families. After the latest typhoon (Vamco), according to the VNDMA, at least 243 are reported to have been killed or are missing and over two million livestock have been killed or swept away. The floods have caused significant damage to infrastructure including roads, schools, health centres and community facilities. It is reported that 1,569 schools have been affected included 360 schools flooded or damaged, while 46,916 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people are now in desperate needs of emergency relief, such as safe shelter, safe drinking water, food and livelihood income support.","Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1546577-MDRVN020eu1.png?itok=7nf8va0m,"['vietnam', 'n', 'nam', 'update', 'mdrvn020', 'quang', 'provinces', 'viet', 'storms', 'emergency', 'tropical', 'typhoon', 'n1', 'floods', 'central', 'storm', 'operation', 'landfall']", ,flood

These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.

Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.

The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.

As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing.

In addition, 150,000 people have been evacuated and significant impacts on transportation networks and agricultural livelihoods have been reported.

USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance partner VNRC is on the frontline of the response and has mobilized rapid disaster response teams established and trained through ongoing USAID disaster risk reduction programs to support evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency response operations, said the ambassador.

""We stand together with the government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones, address the damage caused by this terrible flood, and move forward, as the people of Vietnam have always done. We pledge to assist you in your work to rebuild,"" he said.

""I would also like to express my concern for persons with disabilities in the provinces affected by the typhoon as they are amongst the most vulnerable populations in this disaster. They are often home-bound, have less access to information and cannot take full advantage of preparedness activities and evacuation protocols,"" he added.

It is estimated that the provinces impacted by storm Linfa are home to over 200,000 persons with disabilities, of whom 61,000 are directly affected by this disaster.

Since 2000, USAID, through the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, has provided over $26 million in disaster response, preparedness, and risk reduction assistance in Vietnam.

Through the Department of Defense, the U.S. government has also provided more than $28 million since 1998 to train military and civilian emergency responders and develop and equip disaster management centers, maritime response centers, and disaster shelters at community level.","Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/17/anh124581602340198-1602931391-3782-3057-1602931440_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'response', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'central', 'aids', 'floods', 'landslide', 'usaid', 'affected', 'linfa', '100000', 'cope', 'provided']", ,flood

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to bring them to safety beyond rising floodwater in Cambodia’s western province of Battambang, which is expected to worsen on Sunday.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces – Pursat, Battambang and Pailin – have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall heralding the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

“A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,” Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told the AFP news agency late on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to get worse.

In central Vietnam, almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The fully probabilistic model provides countrywide coverage and enables insurers to assess their exposure to floods, which affect 70 percent of the country’s population.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue simulating both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding. The fluvial component of the hazard was developed using state-of-the-art hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate rainfall and river discharges across the river network in the country. Pluvial flooding is simulated using a proprietary, in-house methodology accounting for local climate conditions, soil type, land use and topography.

Offering enhanced flexibility, the model can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves, and average annual losses at virtually any level of aggregation. The model outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk® platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region. “The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon. These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.

The storm also set off landslides and knocked out power lines, leaving 1.7 million people in the dark.



Storm Molave, the ninth storm this year in the South China Sea and the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years, struck coastal provinces on Oct. 28 with heavy rainfall and winds as high as 115-135 km per hour, according to data provided by Vietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting on Wednesday.



Landslides in central provinces have killed at least 19 people and buried more than 40 others, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, adding that the bodies of 12 fishermen missing since the storm hit on Wednesday were recovered on Thursday, leaving another 14 still unaccounted for.



Around 56,000 houses were stripped of their roofs in Quang Ngai, where a massive blackout from downed power lines left more than a million people trapped in darkness as high winds tore through the province, according to state-controlled Vietnam News, AP said.



Wednesday’s storm hit central regions already devastated by weeks of heavy rains, floods, and landslides beginning Oct. 6 that left at least 130 dead and thousands displaced. The floods and landslides also wrecked highways and roads, blocking efforts to rescue and bring supplies to many cut off from help in remote areas.



Speaking to RFA on Thursday, residents in storm-hit provinces described fast-rising waters and devastated fields, with one saying that floodwaters had risen more quickly now than they had during the storms that battered the area earlier this month.



“During previous storms and floods, the water rose only to the height of my hand. But now the water rose so high that my house was submerged,” Hien Thao, a resident of Quang Tri province, speaking to RFA on Oct. 29.



“I lost 500 kg of paddy rice, and many of my household belongings were washed away,” he said.



“Yesterday, the water rose up to the yard of my house,” added 40-year-old Phan Quoc Vu of Truong Xa commune in Cam Lo district’s Cam Hieu village in Quang Tri. “But luckily it began to recede today,” he said.



“In the opinion of my 80-year-old father, this was the worst storm flooding that he can remember,” Vu said.



Calls for help



At the height of the flood, Vu called unsuccessfully to local authorities for help, and even posted calls for help on social media, but finally had to hire canoes to help evacuate elderly people and young children to safer ground, he said.



In Ninh Thuan province, villagers had made their living mainly through farming and raising shrimp, said Tran Thanh Truc, a resident of the province’s Hien Luong commune.



“But the floodwaters washed everything away—pigs, chickens, and shrimp,” she said. “We are glad to receive whatever help others can give us, but it will be difficult to make up for everything that was lost.”



In Quang Tri, supplies including large quantities of rice have been received so far only from volunteers, Hien Thao said, adding that the local People’s Committee has promised to bring relief goods soon.



“I also learned that the government will provide us with seeds for farming our next crop in the winter and spring.”



“We would like them to also give us boats and other equipment we need, along with rice that will help us while we wait for our next crop to be ready for harvest,” he said.



In Truong Xa commune, officials have cared so far only for their own relatives, though, Pham Quoc Vu said.



“They are not impartial, which is causing much suspicion,” he said.



Heavy rains, flooding in Laos



In Laos, heavy rains and flooding from Wednesday’s storm damaged or destroyed around 51,000 hectares of agricultural production, including more than 23,000 hectares of rice fields, across 13 districts of Savannakhet province, state media sources said on Friday.



Total losses in farm production and livestock from flooding in the storm are now estimated at 283 billion kip (U.S. $6,257,968.), Keoodom Souliya—an official from the province’s Agriculture and Forestry Department—said on Thursday.



In the southern province of Champassak, strong winds toppled power lines, while in Borikhamxay province, Khamkeut district’s Napae village was completely destroyed by floods, a video obtained by RFA showed on Friday, with a narrator on the video saying Napae had now become “a sea of water.”



The video also showed floods and landslides blocking the road leading from Napae to the Naphao International Border Checkpoint with Vietnam.



A rice paddy being harvested was also under water, Phetsamai Xayaathichak told local media. “We will announce the exact amount of local damage later, once we know what it is,” he said.



A total number of deaths in Laos resulting from the storm was not immediately available.

The government decided to grant VND500 billion ($21.52 million) to five central provinces worst hit by historic flooding for rescue and social welfare support.

The five provinces, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Nam, would receive VND100 billion each as part of the government’s efforts to help local communities overcome the consequences of devastating floods, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh sait at a meeting in Quang Tri on Thursday morning.

The government also provided each of the five provinces with 1,000 tons of rice alongside medicine and antiseptic chemicals.

Senior Lieutenant General Le Chiem, Deputy Minister of National Defense, said the ministry has provided 22 tons of dried food to flooded provinces. For Quang Tri, military forces also provided seven motorboats, 36 generators and three water pumps for after-flood clean-up work along with 1,000 life jackets.

Chiem suggested local authorities distribute dried food to victims in flood-prone areas immediately and properly.

In the past, the defense ministry found ""some local leaders had given dried food to officials as gifts because it was delicious,"" Chiem said. ""The dried food is meant for flood victims. They are in need.""

Binh said damage caused by floods in Quang Tri was ""very huge,"" especially in the two mountainous districts of Huong Hoa and Dak Rong where infrastructure has been heavily affected.

Therefore, the government has granted an additional VND40 billion for these two districts to cope with the flood impacts.

Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said floodwater started receding gradually, so it is necessary to focus on relief for flood victims, from Quang Nam to Ha Tinh.

Many international organizations have pledged donations of cash and disaster relief to help central Vietnam.

For more than two weeks, the central region has been swept by historic flooding and deadly landslides that caused damage described by government officials as worst in five years.

At least 114 people in central Vietnam were killed by severe flooding and landslides and more than 170,000 houses in flood-prone Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces have been submerged, with many areas currently isolated.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/22/huukhoatangle21603267443-16033-3261-6190-1603358848_1200x0.jpg,"['floodhit', 'dried', 'vietnam', 'binh', 'mln', 'quang', 'aid', 'provinces', '21', 'disaster', 'minister', 'central', 'grants', 'food', 'victims', 'support', 'tri', 'provided']", ,flood

She said the UNDP plans to build an additional 4,000 houses next year, helping 20,000 people gain access to information on climate change and natural disasters, she said, adding that her agency would continue to support Vietnam in natural disaster management over the next decade.

Tran Quang Hoai, head of the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority, said the houses built by the UNDP in central Vietnam were still standing after the region’s historic storms and floods in October and November, which had demolished over 1,500 houses and damaged 240,000 others.

La Thi Kim Ngan, deputy head of the National Institute of Architecture, said that authorities and investors need to create a comprehensive model for housing complexes, complete with infrastructure like electricity, clean water and waste management systems.

Flood resilient houses can become homestay accommodations and help the region develop economically, she added.

Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said his ministry was cooperating with the architecture institute and the Ministry of Construction to develop appropriate and safe housing models to withstand natural disasters.

It is estimated that by 2025, Vietnam would have around 30 million people living in areas prone to natural disasters. Many of them are likely to be poverty stricken.

Rapid urbanization and economic development can intensify natural disaster risks for Vietnam's coastline and wipe billions of dollars off its economic growth over the next decade, a World Bank report warned in October.

Around 11.8 million people in coastal provinces face the threat of intense flooding, and over 35 percent of settlements are located on eroding coastlines.

Another powerful storm is testing Southeast Asian disaster responders after Typhoon Goni crashed into the Philippines on 1 November, before veering towards flood-hit central Vietnam.

Goni, known as Rolly in the Philippines, made landfall on Sunday on Catanduanes Island in the country’s east, bringing violent winds and extensive flooding. The Red Cross says there’s “massive devastation” in some areas, including 90 percent of the homes in villages in one part of Catanduanes.

Philippine authorities are still assessing the total damage, but the government said 11 people had died as of 2 November, with numbers still rising.

The evacuation of at least 450,000 people and early response planning helped avoid a worse outcome, but aid groups warn that the combined hit from a barrage of recent storms and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will test communities for months to come.

The Philippines has been locked in disaster response mode for weeks after previous storms caused extensive flooding in parts of Luzon, the country’s main island. Typhoon Molave, known as Quinta in the Philippines, killed at least 23 people in October; Typhoon Saudel, known as Pepito, struck days earlier.

Attention now turns to Vietnam, which is preparing for a weakened Goni to strike its flood-hit central region around 5 November – the country’s fifth major storm since mid-October.

Typhoon Goni’s wind speeds slowed to around 90 kilometres per hour by 2 November, but successive storms over the past month have driven severe floods and landslides across central Vietnam.

Vietnam’s government says roughly 160 people have died, with dozens more missing in the worst flooding to hit the country in 20 years. The disasters have inundated more than a quarter of a million homes, and prompted a $40 million humanitarian appeal targeting 177,000 people.

The Philippines isn’t in the clear, either. Another storm, Atsani or Siony, could careen toward northern Luzon in the coming days, though forecasters say its current path is extremely erratic.

Floods are common during Asia’s various monsoon and cyclone seasons, but aid groups say the damage has been particularly severe this year.

Typhoon Goni was the strongest storm to hit the country since 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,300 people and led to a massive humanitarian response.

Climate change is fuelling more volatile extreme weather across the globe. The Philippines’ first typhoon of the season, Vongfong or Ambo, arrived relatively early in May; the storm season typically hits its peak in July.

Posting on Twitter, Yeb Saño, who was the Philippines’ climate negotiator when Haiyan struck in 2013, said Typhoon Goni and the burst of recent extreme weather is further proof of a crisis.

“The climate emergency persists and is wreaking havoc,” he said.

Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam.

The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.

The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.

The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.

As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.

Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light.""

Australia is already making ongoing efforts to support Vietnam’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $10.5 million assistance package in June.

Several areas of Vietnam hit by the worst floods in decades. In the last month, torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing, and created hardship for 240 thousand families. Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs mobilized. The strengthening of relations between the two countries can be linked to the US's anti-Beijing strategies.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) - Taiwan has donated 400,000 US dollars in aid to Vietnam to support the local population, hit by the worst floods and landslides in decades. In the past two weeks, storms no. 6 and 7 have caused serious damage in the central-northern provinces of Hà Tinh, Qu?ng Bình, Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên-Hu? and in the central-southern ones Ðà N?ng, Qu?ng Nam, Qu?ng Ngãi, Bình Ð?nh and Phú Yên.

The Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention reports that torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing since late September. River levels have risen rapidly in central areas of Vietnam, flooding 212 municipalities inhabited by 240 thousand families.

Many communities are isolated; at the moment in the devastated areas it is possible to move mostly with small boats. Victims are in immediate need of food, bottled water, medicine, clothing, blankets and books.

At the end of the emergency, money will be needed for reconstruction, especially seeds and agricultural machinery. Many Vietnamese have mobilized to support the flood victims. Groups of young people, including Catholics, brought rice, spaghetti (noodles) and drinking water to the most remote flooded areas.

Richard Shih, Taiwanese representative in Hanoi, said that Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs operating in Vietnam have mobilized and sent aid to disaster areas. He hopes the victims can rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon.

The aid delivery ceremony took place on 23 October in the presence of Tr?n Quang Hoài, director of the Vietnamese agency for the management of natural disasters. The Hanoi representative thanked the generosity of the government and the people of Taiwan, stressing that the distribution of aid will start as soon as possible.

The Taiwanese authorities highlighted the strong ties that unite their country to Vietnam. More than 320,000 Vietnamese migrants live and work in Taiwan; Taipei is Hanoi's seventh trading partner, with a turnover of 13.5 billion euros in 2019. The two nations also share fears about the growth of Chinese power, an aspect that links the strengthening of their relations with the United States anti-Beijing strategy in the region.","Mon, 26 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM-TAIWAN_-_1026_-_Aiuti_ter.jpg,"['areas', 'donates', 'vietnam', 'dollars', 'aid', 'flood', 'taiwan', 'qu?ng', 'mobilized', 'vietnamese', 'caused', '400000', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

Flash floods triggered by heavy rains swept through a village in Lao Cai Province early Saturday, killing two people and leaving another missing.

The sudden flood at 2 a.m. brought down with it a large volume of rocks and soil as it hit the village in Minh Luong Commune, Van Ban District, damaging 25 houses and five hectares (12.35 acres) of crops.

""The entire scene is a mess with soil and rocks entering people’s houses, and we are still looking for the missing person,"" Quang Van Viet, deputy head of the Command for Natural Disaster Prevention and Search and Rescue of Lao Cai Province, said.

Lao Cai is home to the resort town of Sa Pa.

The flood also dumped hundreds of cubic meters of soil and rock on a 200-meter stretch of National Highway 279 in Minh Luong Commune, paralyzing traffic.

Lao Cai received heavy rains from late Friday to early Saturday due to a cold spell from the north.

Huynh Kim Luong was standing in a corner of his home, struggling to find a spot for guests to sit. The pots, pans and clothes scattered around the house were illuminated by the light of flickering candles.

""It has been 21 years since I saw such a flood,"" he said.

For the past 10 days the 60-year-old farmer and his family of three have barely stepped outside. In their Huong Toan Commune in Thua Thien-Hue, floods triggered by heavy rains have inundated over 2,000 homes. The only sounds they hear these days are the thump of rain falling on the roof, the clattering of windows in the wind, and distant hums of motorboats moving through the sea of water.

Like many people in central Vietnam, Luong and his wife Hoa were proud of their ability to live with floods. Since the beginning of this month, Hoa has been stocking up rice, dry fish and peanut on warnings of coming storms and rains. They knew not to stock up on meat since electricity is always cut when a storm hits. They were right.

On the morning of October 9 Luong opened his front door only to see the water almost reaching the threshold following heavy rain the previous night. As the hours passed and the rain showed no signs of relenting, the water started to come inside the house. Everywhere in the neighborhood, people were yelling that the floods had come.

Their eldest daughter, who is in her final year of high school, began to put all her books into plastic bags. Her parents waded around the house to salvage the family’s most valuable belongings like the refrigerator, TV and stove, and put them on a table that is reinforced with four blocks of wood.

Within a span of not even a day, Huong Toan turned from green paddy fields to muddy sea in the afternoon. With the electricity duly cut and dusk falling, the area, now flooded for dozens of kilometers along National Highway 1, slowly sank into darkness.

Also on October 9, in Huong Van Commune, about six kilometers away, Le Thi Thuc spent a sleepless night watching the water rise.

""I say ‘keeping watch,’ but the water will rise anyway even if I’m asleep. But my mind can be a little bit at rest if I watch it,"" she said.

The 54-year-old too has been confined at home for several days.

That night the entire family took refuge in the bedroom of her 85-year-old mother, whose room is situated farthest from the water. Thuc told her three children to go to sleep early, reminding them to turn off their phones to save the battery for the coming days without electricity.

Dung, her husband, shone the flashlight at the floor, sighing. The water was closing in. That night none of the three adults in the household slept a wink.

The local rice milling shop closed as soon as it started raining, catching Thuc off guard, leaving her no time to prepare enough food for the family.

Luckily her sister, who lives on higher ground, helped out, rowing a boat to Thuc’s house to deliver much-needed rice, bamboo shoot broth and boiled duck.

Seeing the family of six enjoying a meal sitting on a bed, surrounded by floodwater, Thuc could not help but weep.

For the next eight days the water ebbed and flowed. The children kept asking when the rain would stop, but the weather forecast kept getting gloomier.

The whole family had to shovel and sweep the mud and sludge entering the house. ""It was like walking in a swamp,"" they said.

Last Friday the water started to recede a little, going down to waist level, and Thuc took the opportunity to go out and buy some fish and vegetables. Looking around the neighborhood after being trapped inside the house for a week, she failed to recognize the place.

In Huong Toan, the situation has been grim. With the water showing no signs of receding, Hoang Trong Hieu, the commune chairman, other officials and police officers have not gone home for the last 10 days.

The group, which consists of over 20 people, has divided itself to take 24-hour shifts at the People’s Committee office to distribute supplies and respond to emergencies like transporting the injured and evacuating people.

Since the entire commune is under a meter of water, all travel is done by boat.

""It has been a long time since we saw our feet,"" a member of the group joked, carrying bags of rice on his shoulder in chest-deep water. The man had given Luong’s family two cartons of instant noodles the other day.

The day before electricity was cut, Luong’s had some vegetables, eggs and fish in the refrigerator, but only enough for two days for the family of three. So for the next eight days they had nothing to eat but rice and dry fish.

""I was given instant noodles but did not dare eat them because I did not want to urinate too much,"" he explained.

Luong’s wife, who had surgery just a month ago, stumbled in the dark and fell one night as she sought to go to the bathroom amid the sea of water. Since then he has been placing pots by the bed and replaces the candles twice every night.

""There are a lot of mosquitoes due to all the water.""

Nguyen Van Lieu wades through water to the stove in his flooded home in Thua Thien Hue Province, October 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Tao.

In Huong Van Commune, Nguyen Van Lieu, 63, has taken over the most dangerous task from his wife since the floods came: cooking. He dons his conical hat and raincoat every day to light the stove, standing in chest-deep water.

""If my wife gets into the water to cook, it will come up to her neck,"" he joked, patting his wife’s back with a smile.

Their house was almost completed earlier this year but the roof has not been finished. The family is among the luckier ones in the neighborhood since the water only comes up to the thighs even during the heaviest rains.

But the kitchen is a different story. There had been over 20 bags of rice, weighing over a ton, but everything was soaked the very first night. Vy, Lieu’s wife, had no choice but to give them away to her neighbors to feed their ducks and chickens. She has been borrowing rice from others.

They have not told their two eldest children, who are workers in the south, about their situation, not wanting to worry them.

Like many others, the couple have been trapped inside their home, situated just 100 m from the national highway, for more than a week. Every day Vy would cast her gaze on the other side of the highway to look at the paddy fields longingly despite realizing they must be submerged under water.

A few days before the rains came she had sold her first few gourds of the season. ""They sell well this year at VND10,000 (43 cents) per kilogram,"" she said. She was hoping to earn around VND10 million from selling them all over two months.

But that was before the storm came. She was only able to sell for two days, earning VND240,000, before she was forced to remain at home.

She and her husband have been reminiscing about the historic flood in Thua Thien Hue 21 years ago. The deluge in November 1999 had submerged thousands of houses and paralyzed all traffic and electrical and communication systems in the province. There had been rainfall of up to 2,300 mm in just the first three days. Several people had been swept away and killed during that disaster.

At that time the couple and their children stacked two beds on top of each other and waited for the floods to recede, the anguished voices of people who lost loved ones in the background.

Their son, seeing how his parents had to face flooding year after year, wanted to help them find a safer place to live in, but they cannot countenance moving out of their hometown.

More heavy rains are expected in central Vietnam regions at least until Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Rivers are expected to rise further, as is the risk of floods and landslides. Vehicles continue to line up along National Highway 1 and other roads on higher ground as people park their cars and motorbikes there to avoid the water.

But the people cannot do the same, they cannot just leave their houses. The only thing that Luong, Thuc and Lieu can do is to barricade themselves inside their homes and pray for the water to go away","Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/19/fbbdc0d9e2fe1ca045ef7172160297-3133-2038-1603105515_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'misery', 'rice', 'water', 'province', 'rain', 'thuc', 'floods', 'house', 'amid', 'days', 'wife', 'drowns', 'thua', 'night', 'family', 'continuing']", ,flood

Australia, Switzerland and Thailand have offered aid to victims of multiple storms and floods in central Vietnam last month.

The Australian embassy in Hanoi said on Friday its government will provide an additional AUD2 million ($1.45 million) to help Vietnam respond to the impacts of prolonged floods and landslides in the central region. The country had earlier provided AUD100,000 ($71,300).

The aid money will be used to meet urgent needs like providing clean water and sanitation and hygiene and dignity kits to affected people, and support the restoration of clean water supply to schools.

The Swiss embassy also announced grant of urgent aid worth CHF300,000 ($333,000) to help address the immediate needs of 160,000 people focusing on housing, livelihoods, healthcare, water, and hygiene.

In a phone call to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-o-cha, offered $30,000 toward relief efforts.

The central region was repeatedly hit by torrential rains, widespread flooding and landslides triggered by four storms in October.

So far 235 people have been killed or are missing, almost 390,000 houses were flooded and more than 300,000 families have been evacuated, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority.

Many people have lost almost all their household possessions or had their homes, food stocks, livestock, and crops badly damaged.

According to Tran Phuoc Anh, acting director of the city’s Foreign Department, the sustainable flood prevention project for Thu Duc City would have a total investment of more than $1bn, and would be implemented as a public–private project with the participation of the Dutch government.

Le Hoa Binh, deputy chair of HCMC, said he hoped the Netherlands would help create a city that was “sustainable and well adapted to climate change”.

Elizabeth Akkerman, the Dutch ambassador to Vietnam, said her government would help HCMC and Thu Duc City with advanced construction technologies.

Thu Duc will be based on advanced industries such as autonomous manufacturing, and will include the university precinct in Thu Duc as well as a new-build urban area and financial centre on the Thu Thiem Peninsula.

Thu Duc is the most elevated area in HCMC, but still suffers from seasonal flooding, and its residents suffer from inundation of streets and even houses every time there is heavy rain or a high tide.

In May 2019, HCMC sent a delegation to the Netherlands to study its urban development and flood management methods, and a number of memorandums of understanding were subsequently signed, including a $1bn anti-flooding project in Thu Duc City.

A tropical depression is projected to hit central Vietnam on Friday night, bringing heavy rains as the area struggles to recover from more than a week of flooding.

As of 10 a.m. Friday, the tropical depression was about 290 km to the east of Da Nang and Binh Dinh Province, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Its maximum wind speed was 50 kph.

Within the next 12 hours, the tropical depression would move west at about 30 kph, before making landfall in central Vietnam, then devolving into a low-pressure area over southern Laos.

By 10 p.m. Friday, the low-pressure area would be above the mountainous area of central Vietnam, with a maximum wind speed of 40 kph.

Rough seas and strong winds should be expected in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, within the next 24 hours.

Central Vietnam should expect particularly heavy rain from now until Wednesday next week, according to the center. Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and southern Nghe An should expect a total rainfall of up to 900 mm during the period, while Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and northern Nghe An should expect up to 500 mm.

Da Nang and its neighbor Quang Nam Province, home to popular ancient town Hoi An, should expect rainfall of up to 500 mm, while regions between Quang Ngai and Phu Yen should expect levels of up to 350 mm.

The Central Highlands should also expect heavy rain until Sunday, with rainfall of up to 250 mm.

Rains are expected to persist in central Vietnam even after Wednesday, the center noted.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Since last week, central Vietnam has been hit by torrential rains, floods and landslides after a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence.

On Sunday, Storm Linfa intensified from the turbulence and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. The next day, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

At least 56 people have been killed, including two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while coming to rescue the workers.

Torrential downpours and discharge of water from hydropower dams have caused rivers in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces to swell and threaten severe flooding.

Storm Molave, said to be the strongest to hit Vietnam in the last two decades, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Wednesday morning before weakening into a tropical depression by 4 p.m.

The provinces have been hit by rains of up to 500 mm between Tuesday night and Wednesday night. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

They are forecast to continue rising quickly on Thursday, possibly triggering severe flooding in large parts of Quang Ngai Town, the capital, and several districts.

The release of water by local hydropower dams is worsening the situation.

Dak Drinh hydropower plant discharged up to 1,680 cubic meters of water a second on Wednesday and Nuoc Trong, the largest irrigation and hydroelectricity project in the central region, discharged 1,100 cubic meters.

Authorities hurriedly evacuated people living in low-lying areas and made emergency announcements about the water discharge via loudspeakers to warn local residents.

In Quang Nam Province, home to ancient town Hoi An, the water level in the Vu Gia River reached 9.41 meters by early morning Thursday, 0.41 meters above danger level 3, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, which warned rivers in the province would rise quickly in the next few hours.

Dak Mi 4 hydropower plant plans to discharge up to 11,400 cubic meters a second and the Vu Gia River is expected to rise to 11.2 meters, surpassing the historic flood level in 2009.

Nguyen Huu Vu, a local official, said authorities have evacuated over 4,000 families living along the river.

If the hydropower plant discharges over 5,000 cubic meters per second, 120,000 houses would be submerged under 0.5-1.5 meters of water, Vu said.

The National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said on Wednesday that Quang Nam could face severe flooding in the next one or two days.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung instructed provincial authorities to evacuate people from areas threatened by landslides and ensure the safety of reservoirs and hydropower plants.

The central region, including Quang Nam, was hit by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that caused at least 130 deaths.

Phnom Penh (AFP)

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to get them to safety from rising floodwater on Saturday in Cambodia's western province of Battambang.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces -- Pursat, Battambang and Pailin -- have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall ahead of the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

""A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,"" Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told AFP on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to worsen on Sunday.

In central Vietnam almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking north Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to sandbag and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

The probabilistic model will provide full national coverage and help re/insurers to assess their exposure to floods – a peril that affects 70% of the population in Vietnam.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue that simulates both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding.

It can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves and average annual losses at any level of aggregation.

Outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenter’s MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

“The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood,” said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenter’s Asia-Pacific region.

“The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon,” Gallagher explained.

“These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.”

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/flooded.jpeg,"['vietnam', 'model', 'reinsurance', 'population', 'flood', 'guy', 'help', 'launches', 'carpenter', 'vietnamthe', 'includes']", ,flood

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

When a northern cold spell entered the intertropical convergence zone over central Vietnam, it caused abnormally heavy rains and flooding in the region.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh got 400-500 mm, Quang Tri got 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue got 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City got 1,100 mm, Quang Nam got 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai got 600-800 mm.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

The entire central region suffered from severe flooding for days, more than 135,000 houses were submerged under 0.3-4 meters of water, and nearly 46,000 people had to be evacuated.

At least 36 people have died due to flooding and 12 are missing.

Nguyen Van Huong, head of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting’s Climate Forecast Office, said intertropical convergence zone stretches from the Bay of Bengal and across the center of Vietnam to the Philippines.

In these areas clouds and thunderstorms often develop, and when winds from the east meet them, there is an increase in moisture content, which means more thunderstorms, he said.

When the zone has favorable conditions such as the convergence of strong winds that moved over warm seawater, a tropical depression forms and then grows into a storm in the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea, he said.

Since October 6 two storms and a tropical depression have formed in this area.

On Sunday Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.

A day later Storm Nangka formed and hit the coast between the northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa Provinces on Wednesday.

""Storms and tropical depression already cause heavy rains. For instance, Storm Linfa caused rainfall of 500-700 mm,"" Huong said.

On Thursday morning another tropical depression formed over the sea and is heading straight for the central region also with a lot of moisture.

According to the center, more rains are expected in the region until Tuesday or later.

A cold spell coming down from the north and meeting winds from the east also caused heavy rains, Huong said.

The center said the root cause of all these phenomena was La Nina, which appeared in July and is expected to last until early next year. During this period, more storms would form over the East Sea and the rains would last longer than usual, it added.

Four to six more storms and tropical depressions are expected to brew this year with at least two making landfall over the central coast.

La Nina is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years as a result of variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It occurs as strong winds blow warm water on the ocean's surface from South America across the Pacific Ocean toward Indonesia.

Natural disasters, mostly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 last year.","Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/15/ngap58721602691483-1602735112-2156-7246-1602735562_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'zone', 'depression', 'storms', 'quang', 'cold', 'rains', 'storm', 'deluge', 'tropical', 'central', 'mm', 'sea', 'spell', 'intertropical', 'winds', 'convergence', 'blamed']", ,flood

Over 11,000 people have been evacuated to safety in central Vietnam which has been hit by severe flooding following prolonged rains.

The entire region has been battered by torrential downpours for the last three days.

Some areas in Quang Tri Province and neighboring Thua Thien-Hue Province have received 980 mm of rain. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

At least five people have been killed, two in Quang Tri and the others in Dak Lak, Gia Lai and Quang Ngai provinces. Seven others were missing as of Thursday night.

In Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, and Da Nang, 37 communes have been cut off as some areas are under one meter of water and traffic has been blocked due to landslides.

In popular tourist town Hue in Thua Thien-Hue, many roads are inundated.

Nguyen Van Khoa, a local official, said around 200 houses are under 30 cm of water and people living in low-lying areas have been forced to move to safety.

Hoi An, a tourist hotspot and UNESCO heritage site, is like a massive lake following prolonged downpours with many streets under 0.5 meter of water.

Nguyen The Hung, the town’s vice chairman, said plans are underway to evacuate people living in low-lying areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Thursday ordered provinces from Ha Tinh to Phu Yen to deal with the heavy flooding and take urgent measures including evacuation to ensure people’s safety.

The number of patients with melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, has increased sharply at a major hospital in the central region following the prolonged flooding.

Since early October Hue Central Hospital in Thua Thien-Hue Province has admitted 28 people with the disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia Pseudomallei, which infects both humans and animals.

Around half the patients are from Thua Thien-Hue and the rest are from other central provinces like Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri, the province's news website reported.

The hospital is one of three biggest and most advanced general hospitals in Vietnam along with others in Hanoi and HCMC.

It said many of the patients came for treatment only after the disease had become serious, causing sepsis and multi-organ failure and threatening their life.

On November 14 a Quang Binh Province official died of the disease at the hospital.

Phan Thanh Mien, people’s committee chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trach District, had spent days in floodwaters in October managing relief efforts. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee, but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items in inundated areas.

The hospital had treated 83 people with the disease between 2014 and 2019 and 11 in the first nine months of this year.

It said the rise in the number of infections since early October is closely related to the floods that ravaged the central region throughout October and in November.

Various studies around the world have found that melioidosis occurs only in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, with outbreaks occurring after floods and typhoons.

In October central Vietnam was hit by floods thrice.

Melioidosis patients have symptoms like fever, pneumonia and abscesses in and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate is around 40 percent.

The disease was first diagnosed in Vietnam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country.

There are around 10,000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, around half of which prove fatal. There is no vaccine.","Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/17/muangapohue031602226049-160558-2074-9150-1605581241_1200x0.jpg,"['thienhue', 'infection', 'vietnam', 'patients', 'quang', 'province', 'outbreak', 'central', 'hospital', 'floods', 'cause', 'bacterial', 'floodwaters', 'thua', 'disease']", ,flood

The European Union will provide €1.3 million ($1.52 million) for critical humanitarian assistance to families affected by severe flooding that wreaked havoc across central Vietnam.

The aid will focus on addressing the urgent needs of the most affected people in central Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces, European External Action Service said in a press release.

""This contribution underlines our solidarity with the people of Vietnam, many of whom have suffered the loss of homes, livelihoods and belongings in the wake of the devastating floods,"" said Olivier Brouant, who oversees the EU’s humanitarian response in the Mekong region.

The funding includes the distribution of hygiene kits and other essential relief items while ensuring access to drinking water, sanitation facilities and the promotion of good hygiene practices. Cash transfers will also be provided, allowing people to buy food or items of their choice.

Female-headed households and people with disabilities will be given priority for humanitarian assistance.

The central region was bombarded by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that resulted in at least 130 deaths.

The historic flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated and livestock killed, damage the government claimed to be ""the worst in the past five years.""

Some countries and international organizations recently pledged immediate humanitarian relief to help central Vietnam overcome the consequences of deadly floods.

Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

South Korea pledged relief worth $300,000 while the U.S. has promised $100,000.

With central Vietnam yet to recover from the historic flooding, Storm Molave, the ninth storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Provinces on Wednesday, triggering heavy rains and strong winds for the central region.

Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri.

At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnam’s Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.

A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.

They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.

For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.

At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday.

Saudel is the eighth storm in the East Sea this year, and follows Linfa and Nangka earlier this month.

Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline.

Over 3,700 UNFPA Dignity Kits worth $180,000 would be provided to the elderly in central Vietnam following a series of storms and tropical depressions that hit the region last year.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) representative in Vietnam, handed over 3,704 kits containing essential items to Bui Quang Huy, standing secretary of the HCMC Communist Youth Union, to support the elderly in three central Vietnam provinces afflicted by floods last year: Ha Tinh, Quang Tri and Quang Ngai at a Wednesday ceremony.

Dignity Kits are a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, mitigate the risk of gender-based violence, and respond to and protect the dignity of women and girls adversely affected by a crisis. Kits meant for the elderly contain items like hand towels, sweaters, socks, wet tissues, toothbrushes, soap, underwear, blankets, flashlights and whistles.

The handover was made possible via financial contributions from U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), according to a UNFPA press release.

The elderly are among the most vulnerable when natural disasters strike, according to UNFPA. During floods and landslides in central Vietnam last year, health facilities were hard hit, causing routine public health programs to be disrupted, it added. The elderly are at risk since they do not always get the care they need, and their vulnerabilities can become a serious challenge to survival and wellbeing, it stated.

Last year, central Vietnam was struck by a series of storms and tropical depressions, triggering heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Over 200 people were killed and property losses amounted to around VND30 trillion ($1.3 trillion). Hundreds of thousands of homes were either destroyed or damaged, affecting the lives of at least 7.7 million residents.

With Storm Molave set to make landfall in central Vietnam in the next few days, Vietnamese authorities are preparing to evacuate 1.2 million coast residents to safety.

At 1 p.m. Monday, the storm lay centered around 560 km east-northeast of Southwest Cay islet, with winds of 135 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

Over the next 24 hours, it will move west at 20-25 kph and gradually intensify. At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, it will be 280 km to the north of Southwest Cay with winds of up to 150 kph.

Mai Van Khiem, director of the national forecast center, said at a meeting Monday both the agency and its Japanese counterpart predict the rapidly moving storm would make landfall in central Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces.

The agencies forecast the storm would reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning, before making landfall in the coming hours.

On Wednesday morning, the storm's center would be around 200 km from the coast of Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh with a maximum wind speed of 135 kph, causing waves of up to 10 m.

Storm circulation combined with a cold spell would cause heavy rains on a large scale, and localities stretching over 1,000 km from Nghe An to Phu Yen will be battered by torrential downpours and strong winds from Tuesday until Thursday, with rainfall of between 200-400 mm.

Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh are told to brace for prolonged downpours until Saturday with total rainfall of up to 700 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Mountainous areas will be at high risk of landslides.

Mass evacuation

Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, said with Molave’s strength level, the committee is ready to evacuate over 1.2 million residents in seven central provinces Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

The region, home to popular ancient towns, beautiful beaches and world famous caves, has been bombarded by historic flooding and deadly landslides for the past three weeks, suffering damage government officials described as ""the worst in five years."" At least 130 people have been killed by floods and landslides between October 6 and 25.

Hoai urged provincial leaders to stay in contact with fishing boats, evacuate residents to safety, and make plans to limit storm damage.

There are still 65,000 fishing boats operating along the central coast, of which 45,000 have received official warnings.

""The storm is too strong,"" Hoai said, ordering localities to order boats to take shelter, ban residents from fishing activities, and close all public beaches by Tuesday night.

Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defense has called for the mobilization of more than 368,000 people - soldiers, members of the police force, and civilian volunteers, to assist residents in at-risk areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the meeting that localities must be on high alert and prepare their best flood prevention measures.

""If the storm comes as strong as forecast, damage from rains and floods will be extremely huge,"" Phuc said.

According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Storm Molave's strength is equivalent to Storm Damrey, which hit south central Vietnam in November 2017 and killed 106 people.

Dao, Trong’s wife, was sitting on their bed, suspended in the air thanks to four ropes connecting it to the roof. But with the walls damaged, the bed wobbled about two meters above ground, leaning to the side.

""We can't just stay here and suffer like this. We need to find a safer house,"" Dao said. That night, Trong rented a motorboat and brought the whole family to the town center, about 2 km away.

Trong later returned to his old home to herd his 30 remaining chickens out of 200 into tree branches to avoid the flood. His three dogs were given to a relative the next day for safe keeping.

Since October 6, heavy rains have inundated the lowlands of Quang Binh. While not suffering fatal landslides like Thua Thien-Hue or Quang Tri provinces, Quang Binh has been the most severely flooded.

The October 19 flood managed to submerge thousands of houses, making even the most hardy residents shudder in fear.

From 1 a.m. on October 16 to 5 p.m. October 20, Quang Binh recorded rainfall of up to 1,380 mm in certain areas. The most heavily flooded was in Le Thuy District, with over 32,000 houses swamped. Throughout the entire province, around 105,000 homes have been similarly affected.

""The flood came at night so it was very powerful. The peak was too high, catching certain areas off guard,"" Thuat added. On the night of October 19 alone, thousands of people throughout Quang Binh have called out for help via their phones or social media.

""We still lack boats, but we are doing our best to help alleviate the suffering,"" he said.

Floods in Quang Binh this year not only set new records, but also receded very slowly. By the morning of October 21, traffic across the province remained crippled due to several flooded locations. Over the last fews days, people have confined themselves to their homes, with many of their pets, livestock and vegetables perishing in the water.

It would take a long time for Quang Binh to recover following this historic flood, according to Thuat. As Storm Saudel approaches Vietnamese shores, the province has prepared plans to support people with necessities and food for the coming days.

""During the first days when flood levels rose quickly, we were met with many challenges. But now that the water’s receding, we’ve been surveying heavily flooded and isolated houses so we could perform rescue operations and provide supplies more easily. We would not allow any family to be abandoned amid the flooding,"" said Thuat.

As of Thursday afternoon, at least 10 people have died in Quang Binh due to floods. Over 7,500 tons of food were soaked in water, while several roads and other infrastructure in the province have either been flooded or damaged.

Ho Van Rao's lush green fields in Quang Tri were buried under more than two feet of boulders, sand and other debris.

The field was the primary source of income to feed his family of three.

As he inspected the damage done by the prolonged flooding central Vietnam has had to suffer, he noted that some paddy sections had been swept away by floodwaters, while his tapioca field, cultivated over the past 10 months, was buried in rubble.

""We don’t know what to plant to make a living,"" said Rao, a 46-year-old resident of Huong Son Commune in Quang Tri’s Huong Hoa District. Two wet bags of grains they have are all that’s left for the next six months, he said, adding that on sunny days, he would put them out to dry.

The Huong Son Commune has over 192 ha of paddy fields, but around 90 ha were buried under rocks and wood rotting deposited by the floods, rendering them unusable and irrecoverable. Le Trong Tuong, chairman of the Huong Son People’s Committee, said residents were facing food shortages in the future for people.

In Quang Binh Province’s Bo Trach District, Le Xuan Uyen, 56, sees his field buried under mud and soil a meter deep, meaning he cannot plant new saplings for the winter-spring season without putting in significant time and efforts to clean the place up.

Worse still, the soil the fields are buried under has toxic properties that would kill paddy if they’re planted, he said. ""We are worried because we have missed the season for planting, and we don’t know what to plant anyway.""

The Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences said the top soil layer that covers several areas in Bo Trach District is actually heavy clay layers, which would make it difficult for cultivation if left as it is. Farmers should switch to different plants to adapt to the new layers, the academy has suggested.

Around 1,650 ha of fields in Quang Tri were inundated in the past month. Provincial authorities are now cooperating with the people to salvage the buried fields to prepare for the winter-spring planting season in just a month, said Ha Si Dong, deputy chairman of Quang Tri. But as the fields are large, ample time, it would take a lot of people and equipment to complete the job, he added.

Recovery efforts should be completed by mid-December so new saplings can be planted for the winter-spring season on time, Quang Tri authorities have said.

Quang Binh and Quang Tri were among several central Vietnam localities struck by heavy rains, flooding and landslides triggered by numerous storms and tropical depressions in recent months. Property losses from the disasters are estimated at around VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), according to the government.","Thu, 03 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/02/a2020112209431116291606809438-7767-1655-1606901793_1200x0.jpg,"['shortages', 'vietnam', 'buried', 'paddy', 'field', 'loom', 'quang', 'huong', 'soil', 'central', 'floods', 'food', 'fields', 'season', 'tri', 'destroy', 'ha']", ,flood

The chance of such events could increase five to 10 times by 2050, resulting in economic and infrastructural damage that could cost billions of dollars, according to a McKinsey report, dated April. The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.

Ho Chi Minh City, a historic flood area located some 1,000 miles south of the capital Hanoi, contributes about a quarter of the Vietnam’s gross domestic product. While the metropolis can cope with flood risks today that could hit 23% of its area, further urbanization is raising the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels. Those could cause about $8.4 billion of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact, McKinsey said.

The city still has time to adapt to avoid such risks by having better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas, McKinsey said. Investments and fund-raising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.

Thousands of people fled their homes in Vietnam on Saturday as Typhoon Vamco barrelled towards central regions already pummelled by weeks of successive storms.

Airports have been shut, beaches closed, and a fishing ban put in place as the country braces for winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour (60 miles per hour) when the typhoon makes landfall on Sunday, likely close to Hue.

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in four central provinces, according to the disaster management authority, while state media said hundreds of thousands more may have to flee.

“This is a very strong typhoon,” Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said, warning provinces in Vamco’s projected path to prepare for its impact.

‘No respite’

A series of storms have hit central Vietnam over the past six weeks, causing flooding and landslides that have killed at least 159 people, authorities said, while 70 others are missing.

The severe weather has also damaged or destroyed more than 400,000 homes, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Roads and bridges have been washed away, power supplies disrupted, and crucial food crops destroyed, leaving at least 150,000 people at immediate risk of food shortages, it added.

“There has been no respite for more than eight million people living in central Vietnam,” said Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, Vietnam Red Cross Society president.

“Each time they start rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, they are pummeled by yet another storm.”

Philippine coastguards conduct rescue operations after Typhoon Vamco resulted in severe flooding in the Cagayan Valley region [Reuters] Typhoon Vamco has already caused devastation in the Philippines.

Emergency response teams were dispatched to the northeast on Saturday where more than 340,000 people have been affected by severe flooding following Vamco, which killed at least 53 people across the country, disaster agencies said.

Twenty of the deaths were recorded in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya, which have become the focus of rescue efforts.

Hundreds of people were trapped on rooftops in the hardest-hit areas along the Cagayan river with rescuers unable to reach them because of strong currents, said the spokesman for the regional Office of Civil Defense.

Vast swaths of the region were underwater in what officials have described as the worst flooding in living memory.

73,73,FL-2020-000210-VNM,Vietnam suffers through a “new normal” of extreme weather events - WSWS,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/28/viet-o28.html,"Vietnam is being pummelled by ongoing tropical storms causing major flooding and landslides in its central regions. As of Monday morning, the death toll had reached 130 with 18 people missing, according to government figures. This was up from 119 fatalities on Saturday, with most occurring in the central provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam.

Close to a million people have been severely affected, with many in desperate need of shelter, food, clean drinking water and income support. According to the UN, as of last Thursday, at least 178,000 homes were currently under water.

Flood levels eclipsed the 1979 record by 0.98 metres, hovering at 4.89 metres for several consecutive days in the province of Quang Binh. The amount of rain that fell between October 6 and 13 was two to six times higher than normal in some regions.

Most of the hardest hit have been poor farmers. Agricultural damage has been extensive, with 1,500 hectares of rice fields and 7,800 hectares of other crops being either flooded or damaged. Close to a million head of cattle and poultry have also been killed or swept away.

The government has stated that the damage caused has been “the worst in five years”. Several highways and local roads are blocked with rocks the size of cars, hampering rescue efforts.

About a third of deaths have been of military personnel.

In one instance, a team of 21 rescuers, most of them military officers, was sent to verify reports of 17 workers buried by a landslide at the Rao Trang 3 hydroelectric plant deep in the jungle. The workers were reportedly asleep when they were buried on October 12.

The rescue team stopped at a ranger station for the night and were buried in a rocky landslide. Of the 13 deaths, 11 were from the military. Only four of the 17 workers at the dam have been recovered thus far and authorities have deployed more rescue forces to the scene.

Days later, a barracks in Quang Tri was consumed by a mudslide in the early hours of the morning, killing 20 military personnel, likely the largest number of military casualties suffered in a period of peace, according to officials.

Scientists believe flooding in central Vietnam is the result of a “new normal” of weather patterns driven by complex processes.

On an international scale, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDDR) reported recently a 75 percent increase in natural disasters in the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, there were 4,212 major natural disasters. Between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded costing 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy USD$2.97 trillion.

The increase is largely attributed to climate related events such as floods, droughts and storms.

Speaking at a virtual conference, UNDDR chief Mami Mizutori accused governments of abandoning effective measures to deal with climate change, “It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction,” he said, “despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.”

In the Asia Pacific, the cyclical la Nina phenomenon is intensifying storms in the region, and is expected to continue until early next year. Cambodia has reported 39 deaths from flooding, with hundreds of thousands affected and 46,216 people evacuated to safer ground.

Vietnam has been hit by three tropical storms and a depression in the month of October. Typhoon Mojave, at present travelling westwards over the Philippines, is also likely to impact in the weeks ahead. It is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds of 130 kilometres per hour. About 9,000 people in the Philippines have fled their homes.

Professor of human ecology at Rutgers University, Pamela McElwee, told the New York Times that the sheer volume of rainfall in Vietnam was, “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it shattered the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in its central regions by the end of the century.

She also stated that the construction of hydroelectric dams and poor mountain roads had weakened the soil. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go.”

Christopher Rassi, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross, warned of the economic fallout: “We are seeing a deadly double disaster unfold before our eyes as these floods compound the difficulties caused by COVID-19. These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.”

The Vietnamese economy relies heavily on its tourism industry which has been drastically cut back during the pandemic. Borders were virtually closed in late March. Apart from an outbreak in Da Nang Hospital in late July, total cases have been kept low and contained at under 1,500, with 40 deaths.

The Asian Development Bank assessed in September that Vietnam’s economy would grow at around 1.8 percent in 2020, its slowest rate in 35 years and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.

The Stalinist regime in Vietnam has ruthlessly pursued a policy of capitalist restoration for decades. According to its own estimates, economic inequality is worsening. Between 2014 and 2018 the GINI index of Vietnam, a standard measure of income inequality, was 0.4 [where 0 represents absolute equality and 1 absolute inequality]. The figure is regarded as a tipping point with higher numbers frequently associated with social unrest and political instability.

Out of fear of social unrest, the regime has sought to suppress criticism from workers and the peasantry. According to the UN, hundreds of people have been interrogated so far over COVID-19 related Facebook posts. In the lead up to the congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in January 2021, the government has begun a campaign of censoring dissident and left-wing publications.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wsws.org/asset/64544160-f1d1-4d85-aecd-24bd939be1eb?rendition=image1280,"['vietnam', 'normal', 'storms', 'quang', 'according', 'extreme', 'workers', 'central', 'events', 'military', 'million', 'rescue', 'suffers', 'weather']", ,flood

Phan Duong

She was worried the 80-kilogram beast might be swept away or escape.

The resident of a village in Quang Dien District explains: ""Pigs can be really destructive if they escape. I did not dare sleep at night.""

Central Vietnam has been hit hard by tropical storms, torrential downpours, floods, and landslides for three weeks now.

The woman, who is in her 50s, took the sow and its litter of four to her brother’s house since it is on higher ground than hers, and never left them alone for a moment.

With a stick in one hand, she made sure the sow behaved. But the animal was spooked and attacked her more than once. Vung has a wound on her right thigh from a bite.

But importantly she has been able to safeguard the family’s most valuable asset.

She had spent a year raising the pig and saw it give birth to four piglets. If she manages to keep all of them safe, and the animal continues to have more litters, she can solve the problem she has been facing: that of paying her daughter’s tuition.

Her daughter is a freshman at a college in Da Nang City, and Vung has to send her VND1.5 million ($65) every month for living expenses besides paying VND6 million a year tuition for the two-year course.

Since her daughter was in 10th grade Vung had been telling her, ""I think you should drop out of school and work; I am not able to afford your schooling.""

But the girl would plead: ""Please let me stay in school so that I can have a proper career in future and build us a better life.""

Vung relented.

Their family consists of just the two of them. Vung does the best she can, growing rice on a 750-square-meter farm and doing agricultural labor and menial jobs for others.

Every year in October she travels to the Central Highlands to harvest coffee and cassava for farmers there. But this year she has been stuck in floods described as the worst in decades.

Earlier this year, along with many other localities across Vietnam, Thua Thien-Hue was also hit by the African swine fever, an incurable and fatal disease in pigs.

Vung worked for other farmers, burying pigs killed by the disease.

""God blessed me and kept my sow healthy.""

Now she has once again kept the sow safe through the floods.

But she has not been able to save a small flock of chickens and a cassava crop that had almost been ready for harvest.

All hopes for the mother and daughter’s future now rest on that one sow.

When meeting us in the courtyard of a government office to receive a donation of essential items from readers of VnExpress through FPT’s Hope Foundation, Vung cannot hold back her tears, and tells us all about her pigs and chickens.

The floodwaters have now started receding in several parts of the central region, including her Quang Dien District, and people are trying to pick up the pieces again after two weeks of living with the floods.

Vung is still at her brother’s house with her pigs since it is still not safe to return home.

Her 20-year-old single-storied house has deteriorated and its walls are cracked, and now after the floods Vung is afraid they could collapse at any time.

""More storms are coming, so I’d better stay here.""

Storm Molave is expected to reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning.

In Phong Dien, another district in Thua Thien Hue, we met Le Thi Sinh, 51.

Three years ago her son passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children. Her daughter-in-law works elsewhere and sends home money for Sinh and her husband to raise the two kids, one of whom is learning to talk while the other is in kindergarten. Sinh’s husband has a number of health problems and so she is the family’s breadwinner.

No one had foreseen such severe flooding. Like many other locals, Sinh and her husband did not have enough time to prepare for the disaster.

When the waters came, they packed off the children, belongings and grain to the first floor. They hung their six piglets, each weighing around 15 kg, from the ceiling, but one was swept away and another was killed.

The floods also swept away their flock of 200 chickens and destroyed their cassava and sweet potato crops.

Her grandchildren cried and asked for their mother. Then they asked for their father after seeing a man next door casting a net to catch fish. There was nothing Sinh could do except shed tears of grief.

Sinh still has a litany of problems to worry about like a loan she took to buy supplements for the pigs and chickens and buying formula and other essential items for the children.

She hopes to get relief from the authorities and plant a new crops and resume her livestock and poultry farming.

In the district’s Phong Xuan Commune, locals grow trees and paddy. In May Storm Noul destroyed grown paperbark and acacia trees, and now the floods have destroyed all the young ones.

In Phong Hien Commune 2,000 families have been living in the floodwaters. They have lost 250 hectares (620 acres) of cassava, 27 hectares of glittering chive, 25 hectares of sugarcane, and 15 hectares of other crops.

""There is nothing left,"" Nguyen Si Hiep, chairman of the commune Fatherland Front Committee, said. The front, an overarching public organization, is tasked with ""promoting national solidarity and unity of mind in political and spiritual matters,"" and conducting many of the government's social programs, especially those to mitigate poverty.

Hiep said the commune administration is advising farmers to switch to short-term crops after the floods recede so that they could earn some income before the new year arrives.

There is way too much attention on flood relief though it is just one part of the big picture when a natural disaster strikes. Reconstructing the livelihoods and rebuilding the lives of millions of people in the central region is now a serious challenge in what has already been a disastrous year.

A World Bank report released last week estimated that 12 million people living in coastal provinces face the threat of severe flooding and over 35 percent of people live on eroding coastlines.

Each year an average of $852 million and 316,000 jobs in key economic sectors are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding.

In this context, I reviewed the concept of social capital. Economists treat social capital as an important resource of the nation. It is understood as the two-way and multidimensional cooperation between members of the society, the power of connection between people in a community, a country, and transactions based on mutual trust that bring mutual benefit.

The fact that Vietnamese everywhere are pitching in to provide succor to people in the central region these days is an expression of social capital in Vietnam.

The World Bank believes that social capital helps the community coordinate voluntarily and effectively because it is based on a common goal to help solve collective problems. The natural disasters in the central region are a collective problem. To address this problem, the government can collaborate with the community and make use of the social capital that has been on display in recent days.

Dealing with the aftermath of the floods gives the government an opportunity to tweak its policies. Authorities should make appropriate decisions to remove unnecessary barriers, paving the way for an increase in tolerance and trust, which would help heal the wounds caused by natural disasters.

A timely and substantial reconstruction plan for people like Vung and Sinh will help soothe the gaping economic wounds suffered by the central region, sustain growth and lead to a sustainable development vision for the country.

VnExpress’s Hope Foundation is soliciting emergency support for people in central Vietnam, whose lives have been impacted by severe floods and landslides since earlier this month.

When the floodwaters rose on October 12 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Hoang Thi Phuong, a textile worker in Phong Dien District, went into labor.

Her husband tried to take her to hospital, but their motorbike could not cross a flooded section of National Highway 1A. In desperation, he asked a person with a boat to take his wife to the other side.

But the boat capsized just 20 meters from safety. Both Phuong and her unborn baby died.

""I killed you,"" her husband sobbed inconsolably, down on his knees in front of the raging floods that had snatched away his loved ones.

They are not the only victims of the tragedy that has befallen central Vietnam in the last two weeks. Dozens of others, including at least two hydropower plant workers and 13 members of a rescue team, lost their lives to landslides in Thua Thien-Hue.

In the last 10 days nonstop rain and floods have submerged entire regions under a sea of water and triggered massive landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of thousands of houses have been engulfed, and the death toll has been rising relentlessly.

Thousands of families face food and water shortages, and the floods do not seem likely to recede any time soon.

As fighters on the frontlines in a battle against nature, soldiers, doctors, rescuers, and thousands of others have had to take on the harsh and unrelenting elements.

What they need right now are boats, medicines, food, clothes, rescue equipment, and other supplies.

Highlights

From October 6th, the Central region observed prolonged heavy rains that caused severe and widespread flooding and landslides. Water levels have risen rapidly flooding large areas in the provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

78,78,FL-2020-000210-VNM,One million swamped by deadly floods as Viet Nam faces another major storm - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/one-million-swamped-deadly-floods-viet-nam-faces-another-major-storm,"Kuala Lumpur/Hanoi/Geneva, October 14, 2020 – Close to a million people have been severely affected by prolonged flooding in central Viet Nam as the country faces another major tropical storm and further dangerous floods.

Red Cross holds grave fears that deadly floods, which have submerged the country’s central provinces over recent days, will worsen as tropical storm Nangka makes landfall today, bringing destructive winds and dumping more rain on hard hit communities.

Since the floods began in early October, at least 28 people have been killed, more than 200,000 homes flooded and an estimated 84,000 hectares of crops damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people – many cut off by the floodwater – are now in desperate need of emergency relief.

As part of a coordinated relief effort, Viet Nam Red Cross staff and volunteers have been accessing isolated communities by boat to provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and other much needed supplies. More relief supplies are urgently being brought in from other parts of the country.

Mr Hoa Nguyen, Deputy Director of External Relations and Development, Viet Nam Red Cross, said: “Our volunteers and staff have been working in the affected areas since the floods began, providing relief supplies to thousands of people, but we need to reach many more as the rain continues and floods worsen. Every day we hear of more families who have lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods.”

Hung Ha Nguyen, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator said: “These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods.”

“Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities, especially on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need to help ensure families receive the relief they need in the coming days and weeks,” Mr Hung Ha said.

79,79,FL-2020-000210-VNM,Vietnam reckons October disaster damage at $734 mln - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-reckons-october-disaster-damage-at-734-mln-4186451.html,"This is nearly 2.5 times higher than the VND7 trillion ($302.6 million) loss suffered for the whole of last year as a result of natural disasters.

So far, at least 235 people have died or been listed missing after the floods and landslides triggered by storms and heavy rains in central Vietnam last month, the government informed the National Assembly Tuesday.

Among the casualties were 35 military officers and soldiers of two different military teams sent on search and rescue missions after landslides hit several districts in the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri.

The region suffered historic flooding, with the peak time falling between October 12 and 19. Floodwaters inundated the homes of 317,000 families with 1.2 million members from Nghe An to Quang Nam, with many areas being flooded for nearly two weeks.

Over 200,000 houses were seriously damaged. Many public construction projects also suffered heavy damage and roads were heavily eroded.

Of the total damage of VND17 trillion, VND10 trillion ($430.16 million) was caused by Molave, one of the most powerful storms to hit Vietnam, the government said.

The storm made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28, causing heavy rains and deadly landslides in the central region.

Earlier, the government granted over VND1 trillion, over 11,500 tons of rice and other essential items in relief support for the worst-hit central provinces.

Not over

The government said it would continue to mobilize all forces to search for the victims buried in several landslides and fishermen missing at sea. Among the missing are 12 hydropower plant workers in Thua Thien-Hue Province who were hit by a landslide on October 12, 19 residents in Quang Nam Province hit by two landslides as an impact of Storm Molave last week, and 23 fishermen from Binh Dinh Province whose boats sank in rough sea as the storm was near.

Priority in relief support will be given to those in worst-hit localities and isolated areas and to quickly repairing infrastructure and public construction works damaged by storms and floods, the parliament was told.

The government is also joining forces with local authorities to evacuate residents from high risk areas as storm Goni, the 10th storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, heads towards south-central Vietnam.

International forecasting agencies expect the storm to directly affect the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.

Natural disasters, predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

The East Sea could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, and half of them could affect Vietnam, meteorologists have warned.","Wed, 04 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/11/03/baoso978941604389761-160439695-9969-6110-1604397091_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', '12', 'storms', 'mln', 'quang', 'suffered', 'damage', 'landslides', 'disaster', 'reckons', 'hit', '734', 'sea', 'storm', 'trillion']", ,flood

One day in mid-September Cao Van Bi, 50, was rowing a boat with his wife across a paddy field that had been partially flooded.

All over the field, in Phu Hoi, a rural commune in An Giang Province’s An Phu District, traps had been set up to catch fish.

That morning the catch was 2.5 kilograms of carp and five kilograms of other fish and shrimp.

In previous years, during the flooding season, Bi would have got dozens of kilograms worth of fish every day, but these days it never exceeds 10 kg.

Cao Van Bi and his wife collect the fish they catch in one morning in mid September, 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Nam.

The reason is that the annual flooding of Vietnam's Mekong Delta from the upstream Mekong before reaching the sea no longer occurs.

Not far away, in Vinh Hoi Dong Commune in An Phu, Phan Van Lang, 54, was standing in front of his house.

Since they live in an area hit by annual flooding, Lang and his neighbors have their houses built well above the ground. His house is nearly three meters in the air with a flight of the stairs leading up from the road. In 2000, for instance, the floodwater almost reached the house. But ever since the flooding levels have kept decreasing.

Pointing at the road in front of his house, he says the entire road would have been under one meter of water at this time of the year but this year, the water has not even reached the road.

Hung Dien Commune in Long An Province's Tan Hung District, 80 km (50 miles) away, has been witnessing the clearest change.

In the past its paddy fields would have waters reaching waist high and be filled with water lilies and boats would be the only means of getting around.

That scene now exists only in the memories of seniors.

Bay De, 53, who has been fishing for more than 30 years, recalls floods when catching up to 200 kg of various kinds of fish every day and earning a million dong ($40) was a ""piece of cake.""

For several weeks now he has not caught any fish. He spends almost every day drinking tea and chatting with neighbors in his thatched house.

Fifty kilometers away, Tran Van Thanh, 58, of Tan Lap Commune in Moc Hoa District is fixing traps for catching crabs.

He has been doing this for dozens of years, a job that has ensured a decent livelihood, but that has changed.

""I used to set up more than 600 traps during the flood season, but only a few tens of them these days because the flood waters are way too low and there are no crabs to catch.""

In the neighboring province of Dong Thap, Nguyen Van Phuong, 42, of Tan Thanh A Commune in Tan Hong District is watching the news on TV for possible information about the floods, something he has been looking forward to for several weeks now.

He has an eight-hectare rice field and has been waiting for the floods to come so that he could start sowing the winter-spring crop.

There was heavy rain a few weeks ago, and water had filled up canals and then reached the fields. Phuong, thinking the floods had finally arrived, hired people to till the soil.

But soon a scorching sun replaced the rains and water dropped, leaving the field dry and cracked once again.

He says: ""I had spent VND750,000 ($32.44) per hectare, but that has been a wasted effort. Now I have to wait for the floodwaters to come and do that all over again.""

In his neighborhood, farmers are now worried that if the floods do not come or are low, they would have to shell out money to pump water from canals into their fields.

Rice farmers in the delta have for generations depended on the floodwaters to come and inundate their fields before sow seeds directly.

The Plain of Reeds, a wetland straddling Long An and Dong Thap provinces, produces more than two million tons of rice a year.

The floods usually start coming in late July or early August and remain until November or even later to bless the region with extraordinary fertility as they typically deposit silt from upstream areas.

When they do not come or arrive late, cropping and fishing activities are disrupted.

For several years now they have been late or deficient, and experts have been blaming this on climate change and the construction of a series of dams in the upstream area.

According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, this year’s floodwater level in the delta will be only 55 percent of the long-term average, which translates into a shortfall of 130 billion cubic meters.

It will be 15 percent lower than last year’s level and the lowest in a decade, it has warned.

Late last year the highest water levels in the upstream areas of the delta were 1.12-2 meters lower than the long-term average and 1-1.65 meters lower than in the previous year.

The delta suffered the worst salinity levels and resultant freshwater shortage in 100 years but meteorologists warn things could get worse.

Tran Tan Tai, deputy head of the agriculture department of Long An’s Tan Hung District, says the water level in his hometown is currently 1.4 meters, or 80 centimeters lower than a year ago.

""If there are no floods, the fields will lack silt, and pathogens and wild grass seeds will not be washed away, and farmers will have to spend more on pesticide and fertilizers.""

Meteorologists expect the floods to come around the middle of this month, stay low and ebb away quickly.

Those were the days

Early one morning in late September, Muoi, 64, of Tan Lap rides a motorbike to a wet market two kilometers away from home. He returned after a while with a bag of barb.

""All my life I have seen fish all over the place every time it is the flooding season, but now I have to go buy them... Isn’t it weird?""

Not far from his home a neighbor had set up a lift net the previous night, but until around noon the next day, when Muoi returned from the market, it had only around two kilograms of fish.

Muoi can never forget what it was like one or two decades ago: Every year when the flood season arrived, water would be everywhere, covering the fields and even the streets. People would be rowing boats, picking water lilies and river hemp, both used to make specialty dishes of the region.

In the water, there would be so much fish that anyone could become a fisherman without having to learn any skills.

""Back then people did not weigh fish in kilograms but in a unit of around 20 kilograms. Normally, in one night a family could catch at least five to seven of that unit. Some would even feed the fish to their pigs.""

In years of heavy flooding fish moving down stream into the delta would breed along the way, and it would be extremely rare to see a field or waterway without fish in it.

Fishermen would enlarge the holes in their net to only catch adult fish, leaving the young ones untouched.

When the floods retreated, mud, algae and water lilies would be left in the paddy fields. The fields mud would be silt while the algae and flowers served as organic fertilizers, leaving the fields with all the nutrition they needed.

Besides, the floods would wash away the pathogens and wild grass seeds, and it was not common for farmers to use fertilizers or pesticides.

A kilometer away from Muoi’s place, Danh Van Minh, 62, asks his son to take him by motorbike to a house nearby. The house stands along a canal and in front is a concrete road around three meters wide.

""This used to be a small dirt road, and every year during this season it would be two or three meters under water,"" Minh says.

""The house used to be just a hut beside which I would anchor my boat after fishing.""

Minh’s life has been filled with tragedy. He lost his first wife and two of his children during two different flood seasons.

In the middle of the 1991 season his wife had twins, but both died at birth due to lack of medical care in that rural area.

Worse still the floods covered every inch of land that they could not find a place to bury the children. All he could do was put their bodies in a coffin, stick a bamboo pole in the water and hang the coffin up that.

Only a month after they passed away could he give them a proper burial.

Five years after they lost the twins, Minh’s wife suddenly fell sick and died. Once again he could not bury her immediately, and had to leave her body inside a coffin on the family boat and leave it anchored next to the hut.

In the past 20 years the delta has witnessed several floods that left a significant impact on its residents, especially in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2011.

The 2000 floods were the most severe in 70 years, with the water rising to 4.78 meters. They claimed 481 lives and caused losses of nearly VND4 trillion.

As told by Le Thanh Tam, party chief of Long An Province in 1999-2005, 20 years ago and further, the Plain of Reeds had heavy floods almost every year.

The region had not yet got an embankment system, and every time it flooded there was no way to tell where the road was and where the canal was. The only way people could move around was by boat.

""Back then we always had fish, shrimps and crabs in abundance, but we would lose lives every year, and of children in most cases.

""When the floods retreated, we had to expend a lot of effort to rebuild houses and roads.""

But a 2017 study by the Mekong River Commission estimated that the flooding provides $8-10 billion in annual economic benefits while causing losses of just $60-70 million.

The Mekong River flows through six countries, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before reaching the sea.

Many parts of the Mekong Delta were formed by sedimentation over eons.

When the Vietnamese expanded their nation to the south, they began to conquer the delta in the 18th century. For generations, no other place in the nation could compare with it as a agriculture and aquaculture hub.

In his book ‘Last days of the Mighty Mekong’ published in February last year, Brian Eyler, director of the Asia Program at U.S. think tank Stimson Center, writes: ""For the past 3,000 years, the Mekong carried about 150 million tons of sediment in its system to the delta each year.""

Without the sedimentation, the delta’s land would fall apart under natural conditions, which are worsened by intense groundwater extraction and sea level rise, he says.

He strongly condemns China’s dam building in the upstream areas of the Mekong for holding back floodwaters and, along with them, sediments.

Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent researcher into the ecology of the Mekong Delta, says the main cause of the low floods this year is the El Nino phenomenon that lasted from the year’s beginning to the end of August, resulting in scanty rain fall in the region.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the rainy season arrived late last year and was shorter than usual, with the result that rainfall was 8 percent below normal at 1,240 mm.

Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of Can Tho University’s Research Institute of Climate Change, says the calamity faced by the delta cannot be blamed just on nature or Chinese dams.

""Sea levels rise and the Earth gets warmer. Yes. But that happens just a little each year and it needs a long period for dramatic changes. It is humans who have accelerated that process.""

He cites one example of human action that changed the delta’s hydrological profile. Ever since the delta was formed, it has had several low-lying areas like the Long Xuyen quadrilateral in Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and Can Tho City and the Plain of Reeds that worked as natural reservoirs to store the seasonal floodwaters, he explains.

For generations farmers did not use them for cultivation, but due to the wars, the nation had to consider food security, and built embankments to keep the seasonal floodwaters from flowing into them and directed the water toward the sea, he says.

""Now in peace time, we still have the mindset of growing as much rice as we can, and many have treated the seasonal floods as a disaster for their paddy fields while in fact it is a blessing.

""With that thinking, many have continued to keep out the floods, going against nature, thus intensifying the lack of water once it took hold in the region.""

Minh, who has been a poor farmer his entire life and is haunted by a tragic past related to the floods, does not care much for the explanations experts like Tuan have to offer.

After his wife’s death, he took his son to another village, remarried and built a new life.

He now owns a 6,000 sq.m rice field and both his home and field are surrounded by embankments, allowing him and others in his neighborhood to go against nature and cultivate three instead of just two rice crops as in the past.

The field does not have any time to recover, and instead of getting floodwaters that wash it clean and deposit sediments, it has to do with plant protection chemicals instead.

With this method of growing rice, farmers remain mired in poverty since they have to spend money on fertilizers and pesticides for every crop and also lose out on an abundant source of fish, shrimp and crab and the plants that always grow in the flood season.

""My children and grandchildren have all taken turns to leave,"" Minh says, reflecting the trend of delta dwellers abandoning their hometown for Ho Chi Minh City and other industrial areas, where they work in factories or the service sector.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/10/05/lu-dong-thap-muoi-2300-1601345-2309-7479-1601885014_1200x0.jpg,"['continue', 'annual', 'field', 'water', 'dry', 'flooding', 'floods', 'delta', 'anguish', 'mekong', 'fields', 'season', 'away', 'fish', 'deltas']", ,flood

Highways in the provinces have also been severely damaged, with the total cost of repairs estimated at around VND 355 billion, state media said, citing figures provided by the Directorate of Roads of Vietnam on Oct. 21.

Also on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung and deputies of Vietnam’s National Assembly welcomed efforts by Vietnamese pop star Thuy Tien to collect more than VND 100 billion (U.S. $15,316,811) for relief work in flood-hit Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue.

Large-scale fundraising is normally restricted by law to state organizations or social associations to reduce the risk of personal gain, with penalties prescribed for violations. But National Assembly deputy Le Thanh Vanh voiced confidence in the work of Thuy Tien and her staff.

“They are ready to take responsibility before the sponsors who donated the funds,” Vanh said, quoted on Oct. 21 in state media reports. “I am sure they will be completely transparent,” he said.

Relief teams have poured for the last few days into central regions hit by floods and landslides that have destroyed roads and buried workers at a hydropower plant and soldiers at a military barracks, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told state media on Wednesday.

Many areas have already received help, while others remain cut off because of damaged roads, Dung said, calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to send more teams to reach remote areas and give further support to those already helped.

34 now killed in Cambodia

Relief work meanwhile continues in Cambodia, where 34 people have now been killed by floods to date, with Prime Minister Hun Sen urging local authorities to guard damaged homes to prevent looting and calling on banks and other lending institutions to delay or reduce payments owed to them by villagers impoverished by the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 has hit us hard for the last 10 months, and now we are facing floods that are destroying us,” Hun Sen said.

“We have not concluded our damage assessments yet. For now, we are just working to rescue people and take them to safer areas,” he said.

Around 10,000 families have already been safely evacuated from flood-hit areas, Cambodian media sources say.

Speaking to RFA, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha said that flood waters are now receding in several provinces, including Oddor Meanchey, Pursat, Takeo, Pailin, Kampong Speu, Stung Treng, and the two hardest-hit provinces of Banteay Meahchey and Battambang.

The 34 flood deaths reported so far reflect the inability of central government and local authorities to deal effectively with the disaster, said Kean Ponlok, secretary general of the Cambodia Intellectual Students Alliance.

“The authorities must look into the causes of these deaths and hold themselves responsible,” he said, adding that because of corruption in Cambodia, he is not convinced that all donations handed over to the government will be spent on victims of the floods.

Banteay Meanchey villager Nay Thoeun said she has now lost her home and job because of the floods and is debt after borrowing money from a bank to buy medicine to treat the tuberculosis to which she was exposed in her family.

“I am very worried. I’m living now under a shelter on a hill, but the water is still rising here, and I’m afraid of [venomous insects].”

“I’m urgently calling for aid to be delivered to this hill. There are many poor families here,” she said.

Flood begins to recede in Laos

In Laos, flood waters have begun to recede from eight districts in Savannakhet province, where 125 villages containing 5,134 families, or nearly 30,000 people, have been affected, Lao media sources say.

In the province’s Sepon district alone, 40 villages containing nearly a thousand households have been flooded, with many houses completely destroyed, sources said.

Sepon’s La Or and Vang Khot villages were hardest hit, with 44 houses swept away, and another 90 dwellings hit by fast-running floods and partly damaged, a district official said on Oct. 21.

“The district is still asking for help, but we will set up temporary refuges in the villages for people to live in,” the official said, adding that funds are being sought for building materials such as roofs and nails for the construction of temporary shelters.

Fast-rising water hit one village on Oct. 18 and swept away 28 or 29 houses, leaving nothing to come back to when villagers returned two days later, one villager said. “Now we have no place to stay in but the schools, and no one has any clothing. We are waiting to see how the authorities plan to handle this.”

“We are all in a very poor condition. We have no rice to eat, and all our rice fields are flooded. We will have to buy all the rice that we eat next year,” he said.

“The water is receding now, but the villagers’ houses are damaged beyond repair, and nothing can be restored. There is no thought of fixing them now,” a rescue team member said, adding that many residents of Sepon and other districts are still cut off because of damage to the roads.

Though Lao authorities had moved quickly to help victims of the floods, more help is needed, an NGO official said, asking that neither he nor his organization be named. “For a start, we urgently need dry food and drinking water, clothes, rice, and many other things, as so many houses have been swept away.”

“The authorities did go down to do everything they could, but there are just too many villagers to help,” he said.

Many residents in areas of Sepon and Phin districts are still out of reach, a Sepon district official said. “We are still unable to get to almost half of the areas affected by the floods because the roads have been cut off by landslides,” he said.

Losses in Savannakhet including houses damaged, livestock drowned, and paddy fields destroyed are still being calculated, the official Vientiane Times said on Oct. 21.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguy?n Thái H?p celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vu?t Lu C?ng Ð?ng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p, the bishop of Hà Tinh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghia, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Ngu?n N?y River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tinh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghia, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Ð?n.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_festaOK.JPG,"['tinh', 'h?p', 'centre', 'build', 'bishop', 'thái', 'hà', 'catholics', 'flood', 'work', 'nguy?n', 'local', 'community', 'paul', 'house', 'tiên', 'victims']", ,flood

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan donated US$400,000 on Friday (Oct. 23) to Vietnam in aid after the country suffered the severest floods and landslides in decades.

Richard Shih (???), Taiwan’s representative in Vietnam, said the Taiwanese business community in Vietnam, as well as non-governmental organizations from Taiwan, have mobilized themselves to send relief to the stricken areas in the country's central region. He said he hoped the victims will be able to reconstruct their homes and return to a normal life as soon as possible.

As of Friday, the series of floods and landslides have killed at least 114 people, and 20 people remain missing. Among those who lost their lives are dozens of military personnel who were deployed to search for those who had gone missing in previous disasters.

The Vietnamese military said it has suffered the most serious casualties in peacetime. In addition to the loss of lives, hundreds and thousands of houses were wiped out in central Vietnam, including Quang Tri and Thua Thien Huei provinces, and schools and other facilities have been forced to close.

Tran Quang Hoai, an official responsible for coordinating Vietnam’s rescue missions, accepted Taiwan's donation on behalf of the Vietnamese government at a ceremony on Friday. He remarked that the government is grateful for the generosity of the Taiwanese authorities and people, and that it will make the most appropriate arrangement for the donation so that relief and aid can be distributed to those in need soon, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

MOFA said via a statement that more than 320,000 Vietnamese migrant workers and new immigrants are living in Taiwan, and that the people of the two countries have been more than good partners. Taiwan looks forward to further strengthening bilateral collaboration to combat natural disasters in the future, it added.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/2020/AP/20201016/be8fe4b916764366af4b4d65ce1e386f.jpg,"['us400000', 'vietnam', 'donates', 'aid', 'taiwans', 'flood', 'suffered', 'oct', 'workers', 'central', 'taiwan', 'rescue', 'vietnamese', 'victims', 'taiwanese']", ,flood

Responding to the emergency appeal of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies’ (IFRC), the Swiss emergency assistance will help the Vietnamese Red Cross to deliver assistance to and support the immediate and early recovery needs of 160’000 people for 12 months. The main focus of this assistance will be to provide shelter, livelihoods and basic needs, health, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion.

Central provinces of Vietnam have been hammered by storms, heavy rains and floods since early October. Typhoon Molave (Storm No.9), which made landfall in Central Vietnam on 28 October 2020 is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. This was preceded by weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1,7 million people and killed more than 130.

85,85,FL-2020-000210-VNM,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hardest', 'flooded', 'water', 'change', 'infrastructure', 'flood', 'flooding', 'region', 'floods', 'global', 'risk', 'river', 'hits', 'asia', 'climate']", ,flood

The bodies of two people were recovered on Saturday evening, while one remains missing.

The Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Van Ban District reported that the sudden floods affected 25 households, with furniture, motorbikes and construction materials damaged.

Two houses were swept away and dozens of others were damaged.

Prime Minister Ph?m Minh Chính issued a dispatch asking localities to focus resources on dealing with the consequences of floods and heavy rain in the northern mountainous region since Friday.

In the dispatch to the people’s committees of the six northern mountainous provinces of Lai Chau, Yen Bai, Son La, Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang, the Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control, National Committee for Disaster Response and Search and Rescue, and relevant ministries and agencies, the PM extended his condolences to families of the victims, and asked the local authorities to help locals fix houses and clean the environment, and provide them with food and essential goods.

He also asked the localities to keep a close watch on developments of flooding and rain, and to review and assess the safety of homes, especially in areas at high risk of flash floods and landslides, while preparing forces, vehicles, and equipment to deal with any circumstances.

The media will continue to provide information on developments of the natural disaster, damage, and response efforts, according to the dispatch.

The recent, devastating floods highlight the fragility of the country's natural environment. Deforestation, expanded farming, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric dams are the main culprits. In four years, 7,300 hectares of forest have been lost. So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built with another 450 on their way.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) – Recent floods in Vietnam caused by typhoons and tropical storms have had a devastating impact in terms of lost human lives, environmental damage, and economic dislocations, highlighting the fragility of the Asian country's environment.

Frequent and violent weather events worry both environmentalists and the affected communities more and more.

According to Vietnam’s Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, the main factor is deforestation and the conversion of entire forests to farmland, timber harvesting, and the large dam and hydroelectric plant construction.

Among the most affected areas are the central coastal region and the central Highlands, scene of the recent devastations.

The General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control estimates that some 7,300 hectares of forest land were lost between 2016 and 2019, with an annual average of 1,800.

At the current rate of deforestation, if nothing is done to slow this down, the risk of floods and landslides will increase considerably, along with periods of drought and loss of mangroves.

Environmentalists and experts note that the life and survival of Highland communities are closely linked to local forests.

From the central part of the country to the Mekong River Delta in the south, forests play a leading role in regulating local ecosystems, biodiversity, water resources, and the climate of much of the country.

For Prof Nguy?n Ng?c Lung, forests are key to blocking winds, limiting soil erosion and containing the devastating force of storms. In addition, tree roots absorb excess water.

Deforestation contributes to climate change, global warming, drought, rising water levels, pollution, and famine.

In view of the situation, the General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, noting that the country has recently had to face between 10 and 15 floods.

The blame goes to extensive “legal and illegal” deforestation to expand farmland, harvest timber or build crucial hydro-electric plants to meet the country’s energy needs.

So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built and another 450 are in the planning phase with further devastating impact on the environment.

Some see these plants as ""water bombs"" ready to strike at the population. Their effects are visible in many parts of the country, including Da Lat, a city that is located about 1,500 metres above sea level and a major tourist destination, with its almost year-round cool and temperate climate.

Since 2012, the city has been hit by flooding with increasing frequency, to the extent that today, when rain is intense, many parts of the city and Lam Dong province ""end up submerged by water"".

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Vietnam has given $540,000 in immediate support to women and girls in six central provinces affected by flooding.

UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of hygiene items and maternal health equipment. It is also supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services.

The central region has suffered unprecedented flooding from prolonged downpours and successive typhoons since October 6, resulting in at least 230 people dead or missing. Storm Molave hit the region on October 28, reportedly one of the strongest in 20 years.

At least 5.5 million people in the region have been affected, including more than 1.3 million women of reproductive age, over 92,000 of them pregnant mothers, who need uninterrupted services for pregnancy and menstruation, UNFPA said.

According to joint rapid assessment led by UNFPA last week, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programs such as antenatal, delivery, post-natal care and family planning services have been disrupted.

As a result, local women are unable to manage their hygiene properly and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear needed to manage menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and places to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged, the organization explained.

On October 12, a 35-year-old pregnant mother living in Phong Dien District of Thua Thien-Hue Province died on her way to give birth.

She entered labor in the morning, with her husband hiring a boat to take her to a local medical center for delivery. However, the boat was upturned and she was swept away by floodwater.

Her husband and local residents tried to look for her, but failed because of the fast-flowing current. Her body was found in the afternoon.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA representative in Vietnam, said: ""When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousands of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable.

The National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on Monday afternoon that the low pressure out in the north of the South China Sea (known in Vietnam as the East Sea) had strengthened into a typhoon internationally known as Nangka.

Nangka is forecast to make landfall in the north-central part of Vietnam on Wednesday, while the accompanying rains could cover the central region already battered by torrential downpours over the last few days.

The centre forecast that central provinces would face heavy rains ranging from 150 to 300mm on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control issued an urgent letter on Monday asking the bureau to closely supervise the development of the low pressure system and issue warnings to localities and ships.

Authorities also instructed boats and ships to find safe habour and to take measures to ensure the safety of local people and tourists on islands and in coastal areas.

The Foreign Ministry was also asked to contact countries and territories to ask for shelter for Vietnamese fishermen.

The ongoing downpour, exacerbated by Typhoon Linfa which hit the central region on Sunday morning before weakening to a low pressure area, destroyed a total of 382 houses and flooded 109,034 others, and damaged 108 sections of national highways and 8.6km of provincial highways.

The disaster caused big losses to agricultural production by destroying 584ha of rice, 3,879ha of vegetable, 2,141ha of aquaculture, whilst killing about 150,700 cattle and poultry.

In Danang, many communes were submerged by rising floods worsened by water discharged from hydropower reservoirs.

As of 7am on Monday morning, the communes of Hòa Phong, Hòa Nhon, Hòa Liên, Hòa Khuong, Hòa Châu and Hòa Ti?n were badly submerged, affecting the lives of 3,000 local households in 38 hamlets.

In the mountainous districts of Hoà Vang, Liên Chi?u and C?m L?, there was high risk of flash floods and landslides.

At present, 882 households in typhoon-affected areas have been moved to safer areas.

Meanwhile, people in the central province of Th?a Thiên-Hu? are entering their fifth day of flooding and heavy rain.

Rainfall of over 1,000mm flooded areas near the B? River, badly affecting to districts of Phong Ði?n and Qu?ng Ði?n, as well as Huong Trà Township.

Local people have been suffering from food shortages due to disrupted transport.

Hoàng Sinh, a resident of Phong Hi?n Commune, told Vietnam News Agency that his family’s food reserves were running due to the prolonged rain and flooding, and they were down to a few packs of instant noodles and rice.

Tr?n Ð?c Thi?n, chairman of Phong Hi?n Commune, said the local government was trying to reach local households to supply food, drink and medicine.

“The floods surged rapidly and people in low-lying areas could not keep up. Water spilled into their houses submerging them up to one metre,” said Tr?n Van Hoàn from Huong Trà Township.

“The whole family had to move to a neighbour's house. For several days, we only had instant noodles to survive,” said Hoàn.

“This is the worst flood since 2006. It has badly affected 70 per cent of local people,” said Ph?m Công Phu?c, vice chairman of Qu?ng Thái Commune.

The provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Rescue reported that as of 6pm on Sunday, three people had died, while seven were injured and another was missing.

Nineteen houses had, and 53,385 houses and 360ha of crops had been flooded.

More than 100km of coastline from Huong River across Huong Th? Commune and Huong Trà Township was severely damaged by erosion. About 300m of the dyke in Qu?ng Phú Commune, Qu?ng Ði?n District was also hit.

In Hu?, more than 50 per cent of roads in 27 wards and 2,560 houses were flooded as of Monday morning.

In Qu?ng Tr? Province, the flooding dramatically increased on Monday morning.

The downpour made the water in the Th?ch Hãn and Ô Lâu rivers reach alert levels.

The river water levels were forecast to continue rising today and next days.

To cope with the situation, Qu?ng Tr? authorities have asked the central Government to supply materials and rescue equipment, including two amphibious vehicles, 27 boats, rescue equipment and chemicals for disinfection.

The week-long rain killed six and injured two in the province, with a further six reported missing in the province.

Hue, Vietnam — Every day for the last four months, Duong Thi Mong has carried food, pots, dishes and other utensils on her shoulders to walk nearly 5 kilometers daily from her house to a nearby village, where she serves com hen (rice mixed with mussel, a popular traditional dish) to local people on streets of Thua Thien Hue province. Mong, a Buddhist from Hue's Vi Da ward in central Vietnam, which is famous for its mussels, said she usually takes her boat to carry food over the Huong River then walks only 600 meters to her destination. However, her boat was wiped out in severe flooding after six tropical storms hit the central provinces in October and November. The 56-year-old mother of two said she earns 80,000 to 100,000 dong ($3.50 to $4.30) per day to support her family, not enough money to buy a new boat. She said she had to work harder and sell food at night to get money to prepare food for the celebration of Tet, or Lunar New Year. Local markets closed for the weeklong traditional festival Feb. 10 ahead of the New Year, which starts Feb. 12. Thankfully, sisters across Vietnam have stepped in to help Mong and others like her.

Sr. Maria Truong Thi Minh Yen of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate said her community provided boats for 12 people who lost their boats during the severe floods that left many people nothing in their wake. Yen, who serves Tan Thuy Parish, said she called on benefactors for donations. ""We do want to provide local flood victims with longer-term help so that they can stand on their own feet and return to normal life soon,"" she said. Many victims do not have enough money to be able to purchase basic means of doing their jobs. The 69-year-old nun said her convent gives clothes, blankets, rice and medicine to more than 100 street people, migrants, boat people and slum dwellers on a regular basis. Many live in makeshift shelters while others stay in low-rent, stuffy lodgings as their properties were washed away by flooding. ""They have suffered much from the last natural disasters and the chilly weather this year,"" Yen said. The temperature fell to 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January in the tropical area.

""We plan to offer them necessary finance to do small business, buy tricycles, and raise cattle and poultry for a living,"" she said, adding that students will be given school things while those with health problems will be provided with free treatment. Yen, member of the Hue Archdiocese's committee representing local women religious orders, said some local congregations have built and repaired 40 victims' homes at a total cost of 1 billion dong ($43,000). Luong The Thien from Phu Hiep ward said he built a new house in January after he received 65 million dong from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. His old 40-square-meter house was damaged in the floods. Thien, a 54-year-old Buddhist, said he could not afford to rebuild his house as he works as a motorbike taxi driver to support his wife, who has lung cancer, and three children. ""We are happy to celebrate the Tet festival in the dream house. We are extremely grateful for the nuns' generous help that benefits our life long-term,"" he said, adding that according to tradition, people cannot be well-established in their careers until they have stable homes.

Thien said he has had a good relationship with the nuns since he took a nun from a local hospital to her convent in 2008. The nuns regularly visit his family, and his children receive a monthly scholarship from them. Nguyen The Thieu, a Buddhist from Cau Nhi village, said he is among seven local families who received money to repair their storm-damaged houses. His Catholic son-in-law introduced him to the nuns. ""We have received humanitarian aid seven times from sisters and Catholic benefactors, and we gradually overcame the hard times,"" the 78-year-old father of four said. Sr. Maria Nguyen Thi Hong of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Visitation, who serves Nam Dong Parish, said the nuns offer 60 local ethnic Co Tu and Kinh families money to buy pigs and chicken to raise and fertilizers to cultivate their crops. Local people lost all their crops, poultry and cattle during the floods and now have to collect firewood and bamboo shoots for a living. On Jan. 23, the nuns provided bicycles for 23 students in Nam Dong Parish who walk 5 kilometers to school.

As of Wednesday morning, northern Vinh Phuc Province had reported two fatalities while Lao Cai, Son La, Lai Chau and Thai Nguyen claimed one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.

The committee said at least four others were injured.

Since last Sunday, northern provinces have been battered by torrential downpours due to the influence of a tropical convergence zone and effects from tropical storm Higos, which made landfall on China’s southern coast Wednesday morning.

Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Ha Giang and Tuyen Giang experienced heavy rainfall of up to 300 mm each downpour while Quang Ninh, home to world famous Ha Long Bay, and Hai Phong City received rainfall of between 200 and 350 mm each time. Levels of 180 mm a day are considered heavy.

At least 334 houses in the localities were damaged. Over 550 ha of rice and other crops were inundated while landslides blocked many roads leading to northern mountainous provinces like Lai Chau and Lao Cai, home to popular Sa Pa Town.

Weather forecasters warned northern provinces should expect heavy downpours with rainfall of between 100 and 250 mm from Thursday to Saturday due to the impacts of Higos.

Tran Quang Hoai, vice head of the committee, asked northern authorities to deploy rescue teams and evacuate residents in flood-prone areas.

Higos is the fourth storm formed in the East Sea this year.

The waters, known internationally as the South China Sea, could see 11-13 storms and tropical depressions this year, half of them directly affecting the country, meteorologists said.

Natural disasters, including drought, floods and landslides, killed 133 Vietnamese last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In the first half of this year, natural disasters killed 47 people and caused economic damages of VND3.3 trillion, according to official data.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/08/19/a9f5d4e442a7abf9f2b6-159782323-4253-6860-1597823279_1200x0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'flash', 'landslides', 'flood', 'provinces', 'tropical', 'hit', 'heavy', 'rainfall', 'mm', 'committee', 'cai', 'killed', 'northern', 'ha']", ,flood

The United Nations Population Fund in Vietnam will provide an additional $800,000 to support women and girls affected by flooding in eight central provinces and cities.

It brings the UNFPA's total support to $1.34 million. In October it had given $540,000.

The support includes setting up mobile and outreach health care clinics and the distribution of dignity kits with essential hygiene items and vital maternal health equipment and supplies.

Between early October and mid-November the central region and parts of the Central Highlands were hit by a succession of storms that brought torrential rains, resulting in severe flooding and landslides.

At least 192 people were killed and 57 others are still listed missing, and losses amounted to VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), the government said.

Around 5.5 million people have been affected, including over 1.3 million women of reproductive age and more than 92,000 pregnant women, the UNFPA said.

The disaster forced women and girls into shelters without having the time to pack essential supplies, and many lack basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear that are needed to manage their menstrual periods, it said, adding that access to water and places to wash, dry reusable pads and clothes and dispose of used materials are lacking.

Routine public health programs such as antenatal, child birth, post-natal care, and family planning services have been disrupted.

The government provided VND770 billion for emergency relief.

Many international organizations and countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Australia also provided aid.","Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2020/12/08/huukhoaduadeolethuy51603180554-1148-5001-1607411128_1200x0.jpg,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'rains', 'health', 'girls', 'flooding', 'central', 'agency', '800000', 'women', 'pregnant', 'million', 'support', 'provided']", ,flood_and_drought

On the night of October 11, Le Trung Lam, a resident of the central town, braved the floods to go and pick up some migrant students who had been marooned in their inundated home for days. He took them to his company on Ngu Binh Street, An Tay Ward, where 30 people were already sheltering.

They cook in the kitchen and eat three meals a day, and also have blankets, mattresses and electricity.

Three days earlier, many students from other places now studying in Hue, had no idea where to shelter as the floodwaters rose relentlessly and inundated their homes. Then Lam's message arrived out of the blue.

He said: ""The company's headquarters, a five-floor building, is situated on Ngu Binh Mountain, and so the water has not reached it yet. Its two top floors have 10 rooms each that can accommodate 20-30 people.""

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential downpours in central Vietnam for a week now have killed 29 as of Tuesday morning. Among the deaths, six are from Thua Thien-Hue Province, home to Hue.

Lam, 33, decided to turn his company into a shelter on October 8 as the waters reached some major roads and were expected to rise further. Driving around the town to check on the flood situation and how people were coping, he passed by the studio apartment where he himself had lived 15 years ago as a migrant student from central Nghe An Province. He too had suffered during flooding.

Fearing for students who were possibly cut off, he posted an announcement that he was willing to shelter people.

In the last few days he has received hundreds of calls from people seeking help. Since the neighborhood still has access to electricity and the market remains open, Lam's employees have been able to buy food and cook meals.

Lam said he would take care of the students until the floods receded.

If the water level keeps rising, he plans to also use the main hall which can hold 500 people.

Le Thi Anh Ngoc, 19, from the central Quang Binh Province, said she walked on flooded streets for more than an hour to reach Lam's place on the morning of October 11.

""I arrived in Hue four days ago. I did not know who would help us before I learned about Lam.""

Six kilometers away from the company, on Tung Thien Vuong Street, Ngo Thi Kim Loan is busy making 500 banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich, with the help of a few others to send to people stranded on Hen Dune and Han Mac Tu Street.

Loan, who regularly does charity, always has instant noodles at home. Three days ago, seeing the rising water levels, she gave away 100 boxes of them to households in her neighborhood facing difficulties.

On October 12 she cooked 40 kilograms of rice for people living in areas where power has been turned off due to the floods.

The owner of a noodles restaurant also posted on her Facebook page that families with children or old people could command shelter at her home.

In the evening, when Loan sent 300 banh mi to households on Hen, Le Quoc Phong, Loan's neighbor, 40, was eating dinner under an oil lamp. The island in the middle of the Huong River was cut off by the rising waters.

Phong volunteered to help distribute food to those in need. Finishing his meal, he quickly got on a boat to take the banh mi to people before dinner time was over.

Distributing food and offering accommodation are Hue people’s way of supporting people affected by the floods.

Dozens of families living in higher places said they are ready to take in people whose houses are flooded and provide instant noodles to those who need them.

Free food distribution centers have been set up in downtown areas in the last few days, but are accessible only to people living nearby because of the situation.

People are also helping their fellows facing a threat of losing their livelihoods.

Over several days, strong winds and torrential rains caused huge damage, submerging homes, wiping out farmland, killing and sweeping away cattle. The Diocese of Hà Tinh, along with Caritas and the Catholic Business Association brought donations.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) - Strong winds and torrential rain over several days have caused flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 37 so far. Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thiên Hu? and Qu?ng Nam are the most affected provinces.

Heavy rains from 10 to 13 October inundated residential areas, farmland and roads, causing huge damages to people and property.

The General Department of Disaster Prevention reported that, in addition to the 37 deaths, at least 50,000 houses were flooded or wrecked whilst 250 hectares of rice fields and 2,500 hectares planted with vegetables were wiped out. Some 900 hectares dedicated to aquaculture were also damaged; at least 60,000 animals, mainly cows and poultry, were killed or swept away by the raging waters.

Bishop Phaolô (Paul) Nguy?n Thái H?p of Hà Tinh (about 340 km south of the capital, near the coast), decided to visit the flooded areas to bring some help. On Saturday, he led a delegation from his diocese to Trung Quán parish.

The prelate tried to visit every family, one by one, to encourage them and leave them with some small gifts. For those who met him, “He is a true pastor. He did not just give us some gifts; he brought us God.”

Trung Quán parish, one of the hardest hit, saw homes submerged and streets turned into rivers.

Thanks Caritas and the Hà Tinh Catholic Business Association, the bishop was able to leave a package containing instant noodles, a bottle of oil and two packs of condiments for each family he visited.

He also brought more than 200 million dong (about US$ 8,600). The diocese donated 100 million; Caritas 50 million and the Catholic Business Association, another 50 million. Although not huge, the money will help with the emergency.

Bishop Nguy?n Thái H?p encouraged the faithful to recite the rosary and pray for all the people living in the flooded area.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VN-_Evacuation.jpg,"['tinh', 'vietnam', 'flooded', 'business', 'bishop', 'diocese', 'hà', 'left', 'hectares', 'catholic', 'caritas', 'central', 'floods', '37', 'huge', 'million', 'visits', 'dead']", ,flood
