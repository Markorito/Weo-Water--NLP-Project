GATINEAU, Quebec — Along the coast of the United States, people who lost homes to Hurricane Dorian are preparing to rebuild. But Canada — which has faced devastating flooding of its own — is testing a very different idea of disaster recovery: Forcing people to move.

Unlike the United States, which will repeatedly help pay for people to rebuild in place, Canada has responded to the escalating costs of climate change by limiting aid after disasters, and even telling people to leave their homes. It is an experiment that has exposed a complex mix of relief, anger and loss as entire neighborhoods are removed, house by house.

“Canadians are stubbornly beginning to reconsider the wisdom of building near flood-prone areas,” said Jason Thistlethwaite, a professor of environment and business at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. “It’s taking government action to obligate people to make better decisions.”

The real-world consequences of that philosophy are playing out in Gatineau, a city across the river from Ottawa that has been hit by two 100-year-floods since 2017. Residents here are waiting for officials to tell them if the damage from the latest flood, in April, exceeded 50 percent of the value of those homes. Those who get that notice will be offered some money and told to leave.","Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/21/climate/00CLI-CANADAFLOODS2/00CLI-CANADAFLOODS2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=caf209fe4cc348bace487dc85a98e0ce7d4b6844f57e54c6d712a67ac3124baf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['states', 'forceful', 'waterloo', 'message', 'united', 'canada', 'live', 'homes', 'someplace', 'tries', 'flood', 'victims', 'climate', 'rebuild', 'leave', 'wisdom', 'waiting']", ,flood

Flooding in eastern Canada forced the evacuation of 1,200 people while more than 600 troops have been deployed in response, authorities said Sunday.

Warming weather over the Easter weekend has brought spring floods due to heavy rains and snowmelt from Ontario to southern Quebec and New Brunswick.

A man was killed Saturday in Pontiac, Quebec after he failed to see that a bridge had been swept away by the floods and drove his vehicle into the water.

Authorities, who initially feared a repeat of catastrophic 2017 floods in Quebec, the worst in half a century, appeared more confident about the situation on Sunday.

""We are optimistic about the coming days,"" civil security spokesperson Eric Houde told AFP.

""There will be significant floods but globally not at the level of 2017, except in certain areas like Lake St. Pierre,"" a widening of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, he said.

""The big difference from 2017 is the level of preparation of municipalities and citizens,"" he added.

Over the past several days, towns have mobilized volunteers and distributed tens of thousands of sandbags to erect barriers or protect houses in threatened areas.

The areas most affected Sunday were the region around Ottawa, and Beauce, a region south of Quebec City where nearly 800 people were evacuated. As of midday Sunday, about 1,000 homes had been affected by the flooding in Quebec.

Residents in Laval, just north of Montreal, erected barriers with sandbags to ward off flooding

The provincial governments of Quebec and New Brunswick asked for reinforcements from the military. About 200 soldiers had deployed in Quebec by Saturday night, and 400 others near Ottawa; in Laval, just north of Montreal; and in Trois-Rivieres between Montreal and Quebec City.

About 120 additional soldiers were available to be mobilized in New Brunswick.

Rain is expected in Ontario’s cottage country, stretching east into Quebec and Atlantic Canada.

Montreal, Ottawa and many smaller communities have declared states of emergency, prompting the federal government to deploy hundreds of soldiers to help with sandbagging and other relief operations.

“We’re all just putting our shoulder to the wheel in the most effective way, to make sure that the personnel and the resources are available to fight the immediate disaster,” Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said.

But worried residents are watching as water levels rise fast, with little respite in sight.

“We are watching the next system, possibly Wednesday into Thursday another huge system that will be sweeping across southern and central Ontario and southern Quebec,” Gerald Cheng from Environment Canada told CTV Toronto.

Ontario

The worst is yet to come for Ottawa according to Patrick Nadeau, executive director of Ottawa Riverkeeper, which works to protect the Ottawa River and its tributaries.

“What we’re seeing for the Ottawa area right now is that the peak is set to come around Monday or Tuesday,” he told CTV News Channel. The city issued a state of emergency on Thursday.

“Those levels could be over half a metre from what we’re seeing right now.”

Despite a night that gave Ottawa a break from rain, water levels around the capital region are expected to rise half a metre higher than they did during a 2017 flood that was thought to have been a once-in-a-century event.

Brian Streatton, engineering manager at the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority, told CTV News Channel that the river is the highest it’s ever been.

“People that live along the Ottawa River from Ottawa down to Montreal are getting flooding at the highest level we’ve ever seen,” he said.

“There was a high snow pack this year throughout the entire Ottawa River watershed and we’ve had some major precipitation events over the last couple of weeks.”

Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement forecasting up to 35 millimetres of rain in the Ottawa region.

Four hundred soldiers have been deployed to help battle the flood water. A large focus is being put on the Constance Bay area, which is considered one of the worst hit areas.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Constance Bay on Saturday morning, where he spoke with local volunteers. Trudeau and his two sons helped with sandbagging.

Dozens of volunteers, including players from the Ottawa 67’s hockey team, also helped with the flood relief. Others donated food to help those in need.

A morning report from the board that monitors levels in the Ottawa River near Constance Bay says water levels are just shy of their 2017 levels and are forecast to rise another 47 centimetres.

At a measuring spot near Parliament Hill, where paths and parking lots along the river are already underwater, the board forecasts a rise of another 75 centimetres before water levels peak on May 1.

Nadeau says flooding like this is becoming the new normal, adding that better coordination is needed.

“We need sustained investment in our conservation authorities that help to plan for these disasters.”

Increased winds also hampered sandbagging efforts, causing waves to crash over walls protecting homes. Ontario Provincial Police arediscouraging motor boats from goingclose to shore, after reports of wake causing additional damage to nearby homes.

Officials announced Saturday night that the Chaudiere Bridge over the Ottawa River would be closed as of 6 a.m. on Sunday,due to flooding and high waters. The Ottawa River is expected to rise another 55 centimeters by Tuesday.

Efforts are also underway to protect the Britannia Water Treatment plant, which purifies water for more than half of Ottawa. Ifflood waters block the road leading to the plantdeliveries of purifying chemicals will be haltedthreatening safe water supplies, officials said.

There are also flood warnings in several other areas of Ontario, which includes the province’s cottage country.

Bracebridge Mayor Graydon Smith asked cottage owners not to come to their properties to check for damage this weekend because there are a lot of roads closed.

""Don't try and be a hero,"" he said.

Bracebridge saw some snow overnight and about 34 mm of rain at nearby Muskoka airport.

Smith said the late-season snow is a welcome sight as it acts as a ""sponge"" for rising floodwaters that now mark a ""historical event.""

Property owners have been advised to wait until the emergency passes before checking on cottages.

Quebec

Rainfall warnings have been issued for the southern half of Quebec, with some areas expected to see another 60 mm of rain.

Water at the Chute-Bell dam, built in 1915, has reached levels expected once every 1,000 years, but Hydro-Quebec said it's confident the structure is solid.

Provincial police were patrolling homes and cottages along the Rouge River, about 140 kilometres west of Montreal, where 75 people were forced to evacuate over fears the flood waters could overwhelm the dam.

Meanwhile, soldiers with the Canadian Armed Forces were dispatched to reinforce a dike in Pointe-Calumet, northwest of Montreal, that was threatening to give way.

Quebec authorities said that as of Saturday morning, 3,056 homes across the province were flooded and 2,736 were surrounded by water.

About 2,000 people have so far been forced from their homes.

Just in the city of Rigaud, near the Ontario border, 685 people have left their houses where a mandatory evacuation order is in place.

Officials say by Sunday, water levels could surpass those seen two years ago.

Montreal and 13 others municipalities have declared states of emergency in Quebec.

Flood waters in Gatineau are expected to take weeks to recede.

Some 1,800 homes there are in the flood zone, with about 4,000 people at risk. Around 750 have asked for help.

Quebec's Public Security Minister Genevieve Guilbault said Saturday about 50 landslides have been reported across the province.

“The situation is changing hour by hour,” Stephanie Picard, spokesperson for Canadian Red Cross, told CTV News Channel.

The Red Cross has 10 centres across Quebec to help those affected by the floods, she said.

“Last night (Friday) we provided safe shelter for close to 500 people who had no other option but to turn to the Red Cross to have a safe place to sleep,” she said.

In Montreal, the Galipeault Bridge, which connects Ile-Perrot to Montreal’s West Island, is closed until further notice due to rising water.

In Rigaud and Point-Fortune, residents have been defying mandatory evacuation orders. According to Rigaud Fire Chief Daniel Boyer, only 10 out of 170 homes had been evacuated as of Saturday.

New Brunswick

Meanwhile, the Saint John River has been receding in Fredericton, where parts of the downtown core were underwater this week.

Geoffrey Downey, a spokesperson for New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization, said while it's raining across much of the province on Saturday, officials aren't expecting a lot of precipitation.

The Red Cross has registered 940 evacuees from 330 households in New Brunswick as of Friday afternoon.

Red Cross officials in New Brunswick said Friday 70 per cent of the people asking for flood assistance this year also asked last year.

Premier Blaine Higgs told reporters that with two floods in as many years it’s clear climate change is affecting flooding frequency, and his new Conservative government will take this into account in future planning.

The latest forecast predicts waters will slowly recede in most areas over the next five days.

Manitoba

In southern Manitoba, the rising Red River has forced some road closures and a small number of evacuations near St. Jean Baptiste but earlier predictions for major flooding between the U.S. border and Winnipeg haven't come to pass.

4,4,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Canada: extreme floods show climate threat as experts warn of further tumult - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/30/canada-flooding-quebec-montreal-justin-trudeau-climate-change,"News footage showed people boating where they once walked, homes and cars filled with muddy water, volunteers searching for lost pets. Thousands of people in eastern Canada have been forced from their homes as heavy rains and meltwater cause unprecedented flood evacuations.

One of the worst-hit areas was a Montreal suburb where more than 6,000 people were evacuated after a dike burst on Sunday. A further 3,000 people were evacuated in other parts of Quebec, and in Ontario and New Brunswick, hundreds more are waiting out the floods in hotels and shelters.

“This year’s flooding is very extreme,” said Ursule Boyer-Villemaire, an associate professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal who specializes in disaster management and climate resilience planning.

Climate change means that catastrophic flooding will only become more common, but experts say the events of the past week highlight the fact that Canada has still not done enough to prepare for such disasters.

The current mass evacuations have forced Canadian politicians at every level to confront this dramatic evidence of climate change in a federal election year. Speaking on Sunday night, Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, suggested that using federal money to help relocate communities affected by flooding was a possibility. “Once we secure the situation through this spring flooding season, we will have to have significant reflections and conversations on how we move forward,” he said, according to the Canadian Press.

This is not the first time Quebec has seen large-scale flooding: in 2017, Quebec rivers reached similar levels.

The fact that two so-called “hundred-year floods” occurred so close together has climate preparedness experts concerned.

Rapid temperature increases in spring and huge variation in the amount of precipitation, two factors in the flood, are related to climate change, said Laura Coristine, a biologist at the University of British Columbia.

But Canada has done little to prepare for flooding that is likely to become even more common as the planet continues to warm, she said. “Responding to disaster is going to be a lot more expensive than being proactive in vulnerable sites.”

Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, whose government has fought hard against the imposition of a country-wide carbon tax aimed at curbing emissions, toured flooded areas near the Ottawa River on Friday night. According to the Canadian Press, Ford did not explicitly mention climate change but did say “something is going on and we have to be conscious of it”.

Meanwhile, the leaders of Quebec and New Brunswick, the other affected provinces, are starting to talk about permanently relocating communities in flood-prone areas.

That is not a simple thing to consider, said political scientist Daniel Henstra, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo who studies flooding in Canada: when a similar strategy was tried in Calgary after 2013 flooding, only 30% of homeowners in a high-risk flood area took the offered buyout so they could move.

Currently, Quebec is offering residents C$200,000 (US$150,000) to move, but that may not even cover the mortgage for many.

There are some other options, Henstra said, such as building flood barriers to keep the water in the river. “These types of barriers are really expensive to install and maintain,” he said “and they cause environmental impacts downstream.” A more widely adopted strategy, globally speaking, is just to plan for flooding and keep people from building in flood plains.

More extreme attempts to get them to move, such as mandating a buyout, could be politically damaging, but that might be what it takes to get everyone out of a flood-prone area, said Henstra. “These are the kind of tough decisions we’re facing,” he says, “and we’re just at the beginning of having those hard conversations.”","Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca5c5bb17c856610db70f4c0256463a7813e5781/0_31_3299_1980/master/3299.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=91f4e79f0f6cddb4409d36fc6151ca16,"['change', 'water', 'warn', 'threat', 'quebec', 'floods', 'canada', 'tumult', 'climate', 'flood', 'extreme', 'university', 'canadian', 'flooding', 'experts', 'henstra']", ,flood
5,5,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Why is basement flooding on the rise across Canada? - Insurance Business Canada,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/flood/why-is-basement-flooding-on-the-rise-across-canada-188720.aspx,"Flooding is also exacerbated by the loss of natural infrastructure and the ageing of municipal infrastructure. Filippi commented: “More and more people are moving into higher density cities and areas. This is causing a loss of natural infrastructure. Many local municipalities in Canada don’t have a lot of money. How do they make their money? They let developers build new homes and they collect taxes from them. But what’s happening is that they’re taking away a lot of that natural infrastructure – the trees, the wetlands and the parks.

“Natural infrastructure allows for more infiltration when there’s major rainfall. If you’re developing or paving over that natural infrastructure, the water is going to go to the lowest common denominator, and that’s going to be the homes at lowest level in that city or municipality. They’re the ones that are going to be flooded first, and they’re the ones that are going to be seeing these costly basement claims. Ageing infrastructure creates similar problems. Municipalities aren’t updating infrastructure enough because they don’t have the money, which again causes water infiltration issues.”

Another key issue causing a rise in basement flooding is the lack of flood protection measures at a household level. This is where the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation hopes its Home Flood Protection Program will start to make some waves. Launched in 2016, the residential flood risk reduction education program helps Canadians by providing free online flood protection resources, training programs, and a nationally applicable flood risk assessment tool.

“A lot of homeowners don’t know how to implement simple flood risk management in their basements,” said Filippi. “According to the IBC, the average cost for homeowners to repair their damaged basement is $43,000. But as more people are finishing their basements, that’s where they’re keeping the lifeblood of their homes – the water heater, the AC, all of this important stuff - which is going to be impacted first in the event of a flood. The basement, which historically used to be a storage area for people is now a new living area as people try to grow the square footage of their home.”

According to the Home Flood Protection Program, there are three steps homeowners can take to reduce their risk of basement flooding and lower the cost of clean-up if flooding occurs. The first step revolves around maintenance and involves things homeowners can do themselves for no additional cost. It includes actions like: removing debris from storm drains, cleaning out eaves troughs, maintaining plumbing fixtures, testing sump pumps, and cleaning out backwater valves.

The second step involves completing simple home upgrades, often for less than $250. That might be installing window well covers, installing flood alarms, extending downspouts and sump discharge pipes at least two metres from the home foundation, and buying watertight containers to store valuable or hazardous materials.

Finally, the third step homeowners can take involves making more complex upgrades, which often requires work with a contractor and can cost over $250. A few suggestions include: installing a backup sump pump and battery, installing a backwater valve, correcting the grading to direct water away from a home’s foundation, and installing window wells. For some of the items in this step, some municipalities offer flood protection subsidies, so homeowners and brokers are advised to check on that before making the investment.","Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://us.res.keymedia.com/files/image/iStock-flood-house-river.jpg,"['rise', 'water', 'infrastructure', 'theyre', 'homeowners', 'going', 'canada', 'protection', 'flood', 'basement', 'installing', 'flooding', 'step']", ,none

Michelle Lorrain climbs into a canoe and paddles down a flooded street to check in on her parents desperately trying to save their ""dream home"" from rising waters in Canada's capital region—the second time in two years.

""We're all discouraged and ready to give up,"" she told AFP, holding back tears as waters creeped from the nearby Gatineau and Ottawa Rivers.

Her father, she said, cried when she last saw him a day earlier. He'd just finished renovating his basement and it was now water-damaged.

""This is his dream house,"" she said, pointing to a modest two-story house in the distance shored up by sand bags and surrounded by flood waters, adding that neighbors in this part of Gatineau, Quebec ""are all in the same boat.""

A few blocks over, Gilles Raymond in hip waders surveilled the flooding.

""We had the same thing in 2017,"" he recalled. ""We expect it's going to be the same thing again this year.""

""It's nerve-wracking,"" he said. If his water pump fails, his home will be lost. But he's optimistic that everyone is better prepared this time.

Climate change

Homes lost now, however, could be gone forever.

There is mounting pressure, led by Quebec Premier Francois Legault, to not rebuild those at risk of repeat flooding.

Twenty-three homes damaged in 2017 in the neighborhood have already been demolished.

Ghost lots dot the area, filled with water several feet deep. Sand bags as high as six feet protect those remaining.

His sister lives further up the street.

""When she saw the vacant lots (where homes were demolished) she started crying, it was very emotional, we grew up with these people and now they're just gone.""

Jocelyn Laplante, checking on his parents, said they have lived in their house for more than 50 years and ""they hope to continue to until they die.""

The biologist is of the opinion that damaged homes in flood plains shouldn't be rebuilt, but acknowledges that it is a hard sell for many.

""It make sense,"" he said, ""to give the land back to Nature especially if it's going to be flooded year after year.""

Soldiers have been helping fill sandbags and even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie dropped by to assist

""But people are very attached to their homes. They're working day and night to save them.""

It's a picturesque single-family residential neighborhood with thick woods all around and a river view.

Many of the homes are worth much more than the Can$200,000 (US$150,000) buyout proposed by the Quebec government.

The mayor of Gatineau Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin said more aid monies are needed to help communities cope and adapt to climate change.

An official report published earlier this month said Canada is warming at twice the rate of other countries, bringing a higher risk of extreme weather events, including wildfires and floods.

Soldiers have been helping fill sandbags. Even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie dropped by to help.

Floods and heavy rains have led to evacuations and caused extensive damage in waterlogged eastern Canada

The toll from severe flooding in eastern Canada worsened Monday with thousands of people affected and schools closed, but authorities were optimistic that rising water levels would soon crest.

Several rivers and lakes have reached near 50-year peak levels in Quebec province, between Gatineau in the Canadian capital region and Montreal 200 kilometers (125 miles) downstream, Quebec Public Safety Minister Martin Coiteux announced.

The ground is saturated and unable to absorb any more water.

But recent heavy rains have started to subside and ""as of Wednesday, we expect to see the situation begin to improve,"" Coiteux said.

The Canadian army has deployed troops to help stem the flooding, reinforcing dikes, maintaining water treatment facilities, and protecting other critical infrastructure such as bridges.

Brigadier-General Hercule Gosselin said their ranks would swell to 1,650 later in the day.

Although it is unlikely to get any worse as of Monday, ""the situation will last a few weeks,"" said Coiteux.

""I have never seen so much water between Ottawa and Montreal,"" Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, the wife of the prime minister, told broadcaster RDI.

The day before, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accompanied by his two young children, had traveled to the town of Terrasse Vaudreuil west of Montreal to help locals fill sandbags.

'Exception circumstance' caused floods

There are ""exceptional circumstances"" behind the flooding, said Quebec Environment Minister David Heurtel, pointing to a month of rain coming on the heels of a spring thaw after a ""severe winter.""

For many residents who have been fighting an exhausting battle to hold back the waters, often in vain, despair has started to set in.

In the small community of Pierrefonds, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Montreal, resident John Parker was busy Monday morning hauling wet furniture and personal belongings to the curb, as a pump and hose sputtered water from his flooded basement over a wall of sandbags.

""It will get better, because it can't get any worse,"" he told AFP.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said the recovery and cleanup from this ""historic flood"" will take time.

Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said it was the worst Canadian flood in ""50 years"" but added that the situation was improving in Ontario, where high water levels in one of the Great Lakes—Lake Ontario—threatened coastal communities including parts of Toronto, Belleville to the east and the Thousand Islands region, which is home to thousands of 19th century mansions and cottages.

""We are watching closely the events in New Brunswick"" on the Atlantic coast, and in eastern Quebec where the rains ""appear to be headed,"" said Goodale.

Sunday evening, a 37-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter were reported missing after their car veered into a river and was swept away near Sainte-Anne-des-Monts in the Gaspe region of eastern Quebec.

In British Columbia, on the opposite side of the country, the same combination of rain and snowmelt has caused flooding and mudslides that left at least two people missing, including the fire chief of the village of Cache Creek who had been out checking water levels.

In Quebec, many schools and other public institutions remained closed Monday.

McGill University in downtown Montreal canceled classes and postponed year-end exams, citing difficulties facing students and faculty just getting to the campus.

More than 400 roadways have been closed due to flooding across the province.

8,8,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Why Canada’s political system makes it difficult to fight floods - The Conversation CA,https://theconversation.com/why-canadas-political-system-makes-it-difficult-to-fight-floods-118511,"Floods are some of the most damaging weather-related events in Canada, occurring so frequently that they’re the most commonly experienced natural hazard. In recent years, Canadians have witnessed a number of floods of historic proportions, largely in Eastern Canada.

Scant attention is paid to how history has shaped our approach to flood management in Canada. More specifically, little consideration is given to how our system of government handles hazard management, and how the current situation can be improved through the application of what’s known as “international relations theory.”

What’s in a theory?

Addressing events such as floods, wildfires, tsunamis and rising sea levels causes what’s known as “collective action problems” in international relations theory, which focuses on international governance. These events require co-ordination between multiple entities, usually sovereign governments, and this can prove difficult.

Tackling these hazards is hard because it requires a variety of states, each with their own interests and goals, to come together to address a common issue, provide a common good or achieve a collective objective.

These problems also suffer from what international relations theory identifies as the free-rider problem: Some states can reap the benefits of the collective actions of others while not fully committing to paying the associated costs themselves. Effectively, they get a free ride. For example, U.S. President Donald Trump claims that Canada and other American allies are free-riding on their NATO defence spending obligations.

There have been a variety of attempts to solve the problems associated with the need to take collective action, including the establishment of specialized international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as regulatory regimes like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Canadian floods & fires

The recurring effects of flooding in Eastern Canada and wildfires in Western Canada are examples of collective action problems within the boundaries of Canada.

Canadian history can give us better perspective on why co-ordinating flood management, in particular, has proven so difficult in Canada and what can be done about it.

The administrative makeup of Canada ensures that roles, responsibilities and accountability for a host of issues — like emergency management, building codes, land-use planning and the administration of renewable resources — are spread among three levels of government and other entities, including private firms.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn

The British North America Act and, later, the 1982 Constitution Act, assigned the management of forests and water to the provinces and territories.

This ensures that an often confusing host of local, provincial or territorial and federal ministries, departments and agencies have authority over how the hazards of wildfires and floods are managed.

In the case of forest management, there are 13 provincial and territorial ministries and one federal body that oversee Canada’s forests.

The situation is far more convoluted for flood management, as a greater number of ministries, agencies, departments, authorities, councils and other entities shoulder responsibility.

A flood of authorities

In Ontario alone, this includes 36 conservation authorities, the provincial Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 444 municipalities, the federal government — for waterways like the Trent-Severn, Rideau Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway, as well as Indigenous communities — and other owners of private flood management infrastructure.

Across the rest of the country, there is a similar mix of provincial ministries, federal, provincial and municipal agencies and departments, basin and watershed planning and advisory councils and private flood management infrastructure owners. All of them have varying levels of conflicting responsibilities and authority.

In most jurisdictions, there is no single entity in charge of flood risk. Within larger entities, there are separate departments that deal with various aspects of flood risk, from flood mapping, hydrology, flood modelling and flood defence to conservation and disaster assistance.

Flood management in Canada, in fact, is rife with the co-ordination problems highlighted in international relations theory and seen globally when it comes to combating other impacts of climate change and extreme weather events.

‘Patchwork quilt’

There are three major issues that highlight collective action problems in the governance of flood risk in Canada:

1) The patchwork of entities responsible for governing floods have a hard time communicating and co-ordinating among themselves.

2) The winding-down of the federal Flood Damage Reduction Program, Canada’s de facto coordinating body for flood governance, created a two-decade gap of communication between the provinces and the federal government. The program was significant because it set standards and facilitated cost-sharing. It was a co-ordinating body, setting minimum national standards for flood plain mapping and disaster assistance.

The federal government attempted to remedy the communication and co-ordination problems by earmarking $200 million in the 2014 budget for the creation of the National Disaster Mitigation Program.

It successfully set out flood mapping guidelines, but funding to the program ceases in 2020 and there’s been no announcement of a renewal.

3) Canadian flood risk governance suffers from the aforementioned free-rider problem. Municipalities control what gets built and where, enjoying the permit fees and property tax revenue from those decisions, but do not directly fund disaster assistance when catastrophe strikes. Instead, the provincial and federal governments do.

Private developers also exercise power over these decisions. But again, they don’t directly pay the costs for disaster assistance when their developments are flooded.

In fact, there are few incentives for decision-makers to pay the costs associated with making different choices when it comes to development and flood risk.

What to do?

So are there any solutions contained within international relations theory when it comes to the flood management dilemma?

Read more: Wicked problems and how to solve them

International relations theory informs us that collective action is difficult when dealing with situations where multiple actors at various levels of authority are involved.

It also suggests that the creation of dedicated institutions to assist with co-ordination can help and is precisely what is needed for flood risk governance in Canada.

The provinces and territories should establish a directorate or centre that would serve as a central hub for flood management and oversight in their respective jurisdictions.

The federal government should make the National Disaster Mitigation Program permanent and continue to restore flood-related communication, co-ordination, standard setting and cost sharing with the provinces, territories and other stakeholders. The program should create a holistic, risk management-based national flood management program.

We should not delay further action on the co-ordination of flood management strategies in Canada, especially given the recurring deluge of impacts on individuals and communities across the country.

9,9,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"Ottawa River poised to peak amid flooding in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick - CBC News",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/flooding-impact-ontario-quebec-nb-1.5116376,"Severe spring flooding that has forced thousands of residents from their homes in Canada's eastern half refuses to let up in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

Environment Canada has issued heavy rainfall warnings and special weather statements — with a mess of rain, sleet, snow and ice pellets possible across a wide section of the flood zones starting Tuesday night and continuing Wednesday.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said at a news conference in Ottawa Tuesday that there are now 2,600 Canadian Forces personnel deployed across the three provinces, with more on standby. He said about 1,000 of those are in Quebec.

Another 1,500 have been authorized to be sent to Ontario to help with historic flooding along the Ottawa River and in central Ontario cottage country towns like Bracebridge and Muskoka Lakes.

Annual flooding in the Kashechewan First Nation in northern Ontario remains a concern. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the vast majority of the 1,600 evacuations in Ontario are from that region, with the remainder mostly from the Ottawa area.

Late Tuesday, the transport minister announced additional navigational restrictions in flooded areas. Marc Garneau also urged people to stay off all flooded waterways in Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick — including those not currently subject to restrictions — to prevent environmental damage.

While many in these areas have been deploying sandbags to help cope with the flooding, researchers and consultants say they aren't necessarily the best solution.

They say the sacks can be effective in flash floods or other situations where they won't be in contact with water for too long, but sandbags lose their effectiveness as soon as they become saturated with water, meaning they have limited impact during prolonged floods.

Here are the latest developments in each affected region.

Ottawa

Mayor Jim Watson pleaded Tuesday for more people to help with flood-prevention efforts, as water levels are expected to peak in Ottawa-Gatineau on Wednesday.

Some communities along the Ottawa River are already seeing waters higher than they saw in the 2017 flood.

In Constance Bay, to the west, 150 homeowners have been urged to voluntarily evacuate their homes as floodwaters rise around them. Power is being shut off to part of the community on Tuesday evening, said Pierre Poirier, the city's head of emergency management.

Approximately one million sandbags are standing between the Ottawa River and residences and businesses in Ottawa, and more are in place across the river in Gatineau, Que.

But they may not be up to the task of holding back the water, which in Ottawa-Gatineau could rise 50 centimetres above 2017 flood levels. Municipal officials in Ottawa don't expect to be near cleanup mode until the Victoria Day long weekend.

Watch aerial footage of the flooded Ottawa River:

Goodale also flagged another source of concern.

""The water level now in Lake Ontario is just to about its maximum normal run off,"" he said. ""All of that obviously has to flow east. Combining with the flow coming down the Ottawa [River], that presents significant potential issues in relation to Montreal and places further downstream.""

The weather could also make things difficult for those working to shore up properties against the floodwaters on Wednesday. Ottawa-Gatineau and areas to the west as far as Algonquin Park on the Ontario side of the river are expected to get two to five centimetres of snow, mixed with ice pellets, then 15 to 25 mm of rain.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday these extreme weather events will happen more often, and the government is fighting climate change and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada predicts the record flooding will push losses for homeowners from extreme weather to more than $1 billion this year.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in light of record flooding this spring, the federal government is talking with the provinces about investments in disaster mitigation and prevention efforts.

Increasingly, communities are looking at relocating people living in high-risk areas instead of paying year after year to help them rebuild.

Quebec

Officials partially lifted an evacuation order in Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Que., on Tuesday, allowing hundreds of residents — but not all — to return to their homes.

The evacuation order was put in place after floodwaters breached a dike Saturday and forced about 6,000 to flee.

Residents who do return home, however, will not have access to potable water or electricity.

Mayor Sonia Paulus said they ""will need to present identification and receive clearance before returning home.""

The order excludes a section of Sainte-Marthe that remains submerged. It's unclear when residents in the hardest hit areas might be able to go home.

One resident kayaked through her home and shared emotional video:

This video of Valérie Deslauriers kayaking through her flooded home was posted on Facebook. Montreal 0:19 Deslauriers lives in Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Que. A natural dike holding back the Lake of Two Mountains was breached this weekend. 0:19

The island of Montreal and Laval remain in states of emergency, a measure giving authorities the power to seize property and force evacuations, while officials in Quebec say the data available suggests the risk of flooding on several rivers across the province remains high.

An additional 34 local states of emergency are still in effect around the province.

The province reported over 6,400 flooded homes, a further 3,500 surrounded by water and more than 10,000 evacuees — most of them from Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac.

New Brunswick

The St. John River from Fredericton to Saint John is still above flooding levels, but emergency officials said the river system is expected to recede to near or below flood stage before the week ends.

The entire river basin is steadily declining, according to Greg MacCallum, director of the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization (EMO).

EMO is now turning its focus to cleanup measures. Residents, however, are warned to avoid contact with floodwater, which can contain sewage and other waste.

The Trans-Canada Highway remains closed between Oromocto and River Glade, N.B., but the province's Department of Transportation and Infrastructure said it could reopen this week.

This is the second year in a row the major highway has closed due to flooding.

Despite the turn in events, strong winds in the forecast remain a concern.

New Brunswick power crews have been inspecting downed lines:

Sajjan visited the Saint John area yesterday to view the activities of military personnel helping in the response effort.

He says if the impact of climate change disasters continues to worsen, he may have to increase the number of Canadian Forces personnel available.

Goodale said 9,200 residences and cottages have been affected by the flooding in New Brunswick, along with another 7,000 buildings.

Kashechewan First Nation

First Nations leaders called on the Ontario and federal governments Monday to help relocate the community of Kashechewan as it deals with annual flooding — a problem one said would have already been solved if it involved a non-Indigenous population.

Community members rallied on Parliament Hill on Tuesday.

The northern Ontario community of 2,500 first flooded in 1976 and has been evacuated annually for the past several years while it waits for the federal government to fulfil its promises to move residents to a permanent new location.

""Both levels of government — Ontario and Canada — has allowed this to be normalized,"" said Nishnawbe Aski Nation Deputy Grand Chief Derek Fox. ""I believe personally that if these were non-native, non-First Nations people, action would have happened a lot sooner. I sincerely believe that.""

Central Ontario cottage country

The mayor of Bracebridge said he's hoping tomorrow's weather forecast doesn't play out as expected. Environment Canada issued a rainfall warning for the swath of central Ontario that's been struggling to cope with flooding in recent days.

Mayor Graydon Smith said 25 to 30 mm could fall on Bracebridge tomorrow, with the possibility of a little more rain on Thursday. Smith says an additional 60 military personnel are coming to the region today to help with flood conditions, making a total of 160 soldiers in the area.

10,10,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Report: Basement flooding is the top climate change cost in Canada - Insurance Business Canada,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/flood/report-basement-flooding-is-the-top-climate-change-cost-in-canada-165200.aspx,"Citing data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the report said that the average cost to repair and remediate a flood basement in 2018 was $43,000 – a figure that could rise even more over time as basement flood incidents across the country continue to rise with the changing weather and climate.

According to the report, the most common factors that increase the risk of flooded basements in homes include ground level windows (82% of homes assessed), downspouts that deposit water less than two metres from the foundation of the structure (78%), basement drains with poor grading that directs water into the foundation (69%), and cracks in basement windows that allow seepage (63%).

The report also found that many Ontario households did not do enough to prevent water damage in their homes. Eighty-five per cent (85%) of Ontario households did not have a backup sump pump or backup power; 71% had furniture or electronics at risk of water damage; 53% had a lack of maintenance of backwater valves; and 40% failed to maintain their sump pumps.

Intact Centre discovered that 60% of participants would take action to reduce flood risk if the actions were simple, cost under $500, and could be completed by a homeowner in less than a day. Acting on that observation, the research centre has suggested 10 actions homeowners can carry out to reduce flood risk – all while costing under $250 (or even nothing at all, in some cases):

Remove debris from nearest storm drain

Correct grading around foundation

Clean eaves and extend downspouts

Install window wells ad covers

Keep floor drains clear

Store valuables in watertight containers

Test sump pump and install backup power

Install and maintain backwater valve

Repair or replace deteriorating pipes and appliances

Install and maintain flood alarms

“For many Canadians, their home is their biggest asset and ultimately their retirement fund,” said Intact Centre head and University of Waterloo professor Blair Feltmate in a statement. “To protect that investment, any homeowner who lives where it rains can easily and cost-effectively deploy simple measures to lower their chances of experiencing basement flooding.”","Fri, 19 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://us.res.keymedia.com/files/image/analyzeee%20(10)(1).jpg,"['change', 'report', 'water', 'centre', 'risk', 'maintain', 'canada', 'homes', 'sump', 'climate', 'cost', 'basement', 'flood', 'flooding', 'backup']", ,none

Quebec's government has offered to buy out residents in flood zones, while New Brunswick is considering it.

But for homeowners who are trying to figure out if they're at risk in the future, research from the University of Waterloo suggests that information may prove very difficult to find.

Jason Thistlethwaite, professor of environment and economics at the University of Waterloo, conducted a study to find and understand Canada's flood maps. He and his colleagues reviewed maps from 280 municipalities and found that most were insufficient — either out of date, inaccessible to the public or unintelligible to the average property owner.

""In Canada right now, we're ignorant of this risk, so we're not even able to defend our property,"" Thistlethwaite told Day 6's Brent Bambury.

He says many of the flood maps were meant for engineers and planners, so would mean little to most property owners. Others were only accessible on a dated web browser. And other municipalities didn't have any maps that the public could access at all.

""It's absurd as an industrialized country; we actually don't have high quality flood maps to let people know about their exposure to flood risk,"" said Thistlethwaite.

Researcher Jason Thistlethwaite points to this Nanaimo B.C. map as an example of poor flood map quality in Canada. A study from the University of Waterloo indicates that most flood maps in Canada are lacking. (Government of British Columbia Floodplain Maps by Region)

High-risk areas not always obvious

Even residents who don't live near a body of water could be at risk of flooding. Thistlethwaite says urban flooding is very common, with thanks to high population densities and aging infrastructure. This is a type of flooding that Toronto residents got to know too well this past summer when torrents of rainwater flooded much of the city.

Thistlethwaite says that the flood maps available in Canada will deal with river flooding, but not urban flooding.

""We actually don't have a very good idea of where that risk is at all in Canada,"" he said.

U.K. residents can search their postal code to see flood risk

Canada's system of flood maps isn't universal. The United Kingdom has a website that allows residents to type in a postal code and see what the flood risk is relative to that property.

The Australian government simply collected the existing maps into one database and made them publicly accessible. Thistlethwaite says he and his team have recommended the federal government take on Australia's system.

""At this point, anything is better than nothing,"" he said.

Thistlethwaite blamed the hold-up on a combination of governments ""downloading"" the responsibility of flood risk onto the property owner, and a lack of investment.

""What really has been missing is leadership by the federal government to help coordinate this information and get it out to the provinces, [and] support from the provinces to then make the information available there,"" said Thistlethwaite.

'This is not people's fault'

Thistlethwaite says there is a lot of ""victim-blame"" in flooding — the assumption that property owners should know if they're in high-risk flood areas or not, or that they should just move.

""The information is not available,"" he said. ""This is not people's fault, and we need to be doing a better job getting the government to do the things that help us protect ourselves from this flood risk.""

In New Brunswick, Gagetown restaurant owner Thane Mallory had to shut down his shop due to flooding from Gagetown Creek.

""You're seeing the the local marina which used to be nicely stacked and now it's just kind of Jenga,"" he said.

Mallory describes his relationship with the creek as a ""tough love affair.""

""When the river is where it's supposed to be, you wake up in the morning and you go, 'Hey, this is the best place to be in the world.' And after travelling all over the world, [...] this is home, and the river keeps calling me back,"" said Mallory.

So, what can you do to find out?

Thistlethwaite says a property owner's ability to find their flood risk really depends on where the property is.

""If you're lucky,"" he said, some municipalities have the information accessible on their website.

Some provincial governments, like Ontario, have a conservation authority, which he says have relatively up-to-date riverine flood maps.

But he says the best option is to check with an insurance provider, and ask about flood insurance.

The small Canadian city of Beauceville, located to the east of Quebec City, was assessing major damage on Wednesday after an ice jam broke free in the spring thaw the day before, sending icy water down roads and flooding streets.

The floodwater rose quickly, moving chunks of ice and debris along with it through submerged roads according to the state broadcaster CBC.

Canadian news outlets reported that somewhere between 230 and 300 homes and businesses were flooded and that several dozen people had been displaced from their homes.

Water levels are now starting to drop along the Chaudiere River in Beauceville but the actual clean-up is expected to take many days if not weeks.

Such flooding has not been seen in the area in over a decade, and local meteorologists say that temperatures in the region are expected to stay above freezing. This means that the increased risk of flooding from melting snow is ongoing.

Meanwhile, the city of Rigaud, near the Quebec-Ontario border, is telling residents to pack up and leave their homes over the next 24 hours as Thursday and Friday will bring heavy rains, and the resulting floods could be worse than those in the spring of 2017.

Marie Andree Gagnon, a spokesperson for the municipality on the Ottawa River, west of Montreal, said flooding will peak over the next four days and will worsen quickly once it starts.

Environment Canada, which is part of the environment ministry, said 25 to 50 millimetres of rain is expected to fall in the region over Thursday and Friday, and the still-frozen ground has a limited ability to absorb it. More rain is forecast for the weekend.

Officials in Montreal and Laval are also bracing for flooding that could come by the weekend, as the storm clouds dumping rain near the Ontario border move further east.

Starting on Sunday, areas hit by flooding in 2017 could be in for more of the same.

Canadian homeowners can expect to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a flooded basement this spring, especially if their home insurance plan doesn’t include adequate flood coverage.

A flooded basement costs an average of $43,000 to repair, according to the latest numbers from the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC). Flood insurance can help cover that cost, but older plans won’t help at all if the water comes from heavy rainfall, according to Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

“People should call today to find out what insurance coverage they have for their basement,” Feltmate told Global News. Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""People should call today to find out what insurance coverage they have for their basement,"" Feltmate told Global News.

Most traditional flood insurance plans only cover flooding from a backed-up sewer, and do not apply when the water comes in through a basement wall or window — commonly known as overland flooding. That’s why homeowners should specifically check to make sure they have overland flood insurance, which insurers only started offering within the last four years. Most plans cost a few hundred dollars annually.

“Historically, overland flooding was not overly problematic in the country,” Feltmate said. “But with the bigger storms we’re experiencing today due primarily to climate change … we’re getting more overland flooding.”

A drowned basement can be a nightmare, but even a bit of leakage can cause long-term damage in the form of mould and cracks to your foundation.

WATCH BELOW: Major spring flooding strikes in Eastern Canada

Severe weather caused $1.9 billion in insured damage last year, according to IBC statistics. It was the fourth-most expensive year on record, even without a single catastrophic disaster like the 2013 Calgary flood or the 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray.

Summer storms caused more than $240 million in insured damage across the Prairies last year, IBC says. Toronto suffered $80 million in insured damage after a flood last August, and a storm caused more than $85 million in damage across Quebec and Ontario last April.

Major disasters cost Canadian governments $3 for every $1 in damage covered by insurance, IBC estimates.

Even if you are covered for overland flooding, Feltmate says it’s critical to know what your cap is for damage. For example, a person with $10,000 worth of coverage would still be on the hook for more than $30,000 in the event of a full basement flood, he says.

Longtime homeowners should check in to make sure they have the new overland flood insurance, even if they’ve never had an issue, Feltmate said. He recommends inviting an insurance adjuster over to help you figure out how much coverage you need for your basement.

14,14,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Historic floods are ravaging Canada - Popular Science,https://www.popsci.com/canada-flooding/,"“You know I’ve often said in Canada that our greatest attribute, in terms of the weather, is that the weather hits and runs,” said David Phillips, the senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada (the agency tasked with implementing the Canadian government’s environmental agenda). “It doesn’t stand around and torment you and clobber you and tease you like it does in other latitudes, like in Florida or the Carolinas. A hurricane can stand there for two or three days and then come ashore, go back out and then come back in again. It just absolutely wears you down, because it doesn’t go away.”

In Canada, even terrible weather knows it’s impolite to overstay. But this week’s rains, which inundated the residents of Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec with a catastrophic deluge of water, were nigh unCanadian.

“That storm just crawled up to Canada and then it just stayed there like an unwanted house guest. It wouldn’t leave,” said Phillips. “And it just rained, and rained, and then more rain. In Ottawa [Canada’s capital], over three days there were three hours where it didn’t rain. We’ve never seen weather like that before.”

The malingering storms caused historic flooding—Canada’s public safety minister Ralph Goodale called it the worst flooding in fifty years. Ottawa, which normally receives around 3.2 inches of rain in the entire month of May, was drenched with 4.42 inches in just the first ten days of this month. Similarly, Montreal—which ordinarily gets 2.29 inches of rain in May—has already seen 2.6 inches. It’s not surprising that the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers are beginning to overrun their banks, breaking retaining dikes and flooding communities. Thousands have been evacuated, and over the weekend the city of Montreal declared a state of emergency.

Phillips says that the recent rains weren’t the underlying cause of the flooding. They were more of a precipitating event.

“It’s been really wet since the first of January,” said Phillips. “Over the first 125 days of this year we’ve never seen wetter conditions in those areas.”

The areas that are currently flooding received more than the usual amount of snow this winter (though the snowfall was not record shattering). Montreal received 15 percent more snow than normal, while the areas around Ottawa saw around 30 percent more snow than normal. That’s exactly a major problem—this is, after all Canada, one of the snowiest nations on Earth. But then the weather did something weird: it got warm.

This year the Earth experienced the second warmest February on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It was the second warmest February for the United States (and the nation’s sixth warmest winter on record). Given that Canada is both located on Earth and 75 percent of Canadians reside within 100 miles of our border, our weather patterns and Canadian’s weather aren’t wholly unaligned. In fact, that storm that barreled up to Canada hit New York and New England first. On February 23 of this year, Ottawa—home to the world’s largest naturally frozen skating rink—set a heat record of 54F, dwarfing the normal high of around 9F. Montreal, known for its ‘underground city’ or network of tunnels to help residents move around without having to deal with its winter weather, was just about as warm.

A fairly warm February was followed by a weirdly cold March. “That delayed a lot of the melt,” said Bob Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Weather Underground. “And then April was not only relatively warm, but quite wet as well, which produced a double whammy. Snow melted and rain fell on top of that melting snow. You had precipitation from both sources.”

The warming Arctic, along with warmer waters and a shifting jet stream, are altering the conditions which can create a storm. In April, Montreal received 4.6 inches of precipitation, or 50 percent more rain than usual; Ottawa received 155 percent more rain than normal. And it’s not just southeast Canada that’s experiencing unusual rain. April was the second wettest April on record for the United States. Arkansas, like our neighbors to the north, is in the midst of historic floods.

The April rains and melt, “filled all of the nooks and crannies,” said Phillips. “The ground is like a sponge, and it took all of that melt water and absorbed it and there wasn’t any room left in the soil for when those spring rains came.”

And those May storms, said Phillips, “were lined up there like jumbo jets on the airport tarmac. One coming after the other out of Texas, picking up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, from the Atlantic Ocean, they were sopping wet storms, and they arrived and they hit an area that had been vulnerable because of their brothers and cousins that had come in the previous five months.”

Given the sheer scale of the weather, one might be tempted to lay all the blame to climate change. Phillips says it’s likely a factor, but he notes that infrastructure matters too.

“The same old weather would have a different effect now than it had twenty, thirty, forty years ago,” said Phillips. “It doesn’t matter how dry Toronto or Ottawa or New York City are. That rain drop becomes a flood drop when it falls, because that rain is falling on impervious surfaces. What has changed is the surfaces on which that rain falls, because it falls in built up areas. We don’t have green infrastructure anymore, we don’t have park lands that could absorb the water.”

But Phillip also notes that the weather is changing, and that climate change likely has a role. Though he’s quick to note the difference between a changing climate and changing weather.

“Climate change doesn’t cause the weather, it doesn’t cause rain,” said Phillips. “You’re going to get hurricanes, tornadoes, sandstorms, windstorms, floods without climate change. We always have. What makes climate change different is that it gives storms a different personality or character. It changes the intensity, the duration, the frequency of it. It doesn’t give you typhoons in Saskatoon or sandstorms in Detroit—but the statistics of weather change.”

To put that in context, it helps to lay out what factors aligned to cause this flooding. If the winter snowfall had been less, if the spring had not been unusually warm and wet, if the rains had kept on moving, Western Ontario and Eastern Quebec would be in a much drier situation right now. If—and it’s too soon to have data on this —climate change increased the likelihood of each of those occurrences, climate change would not have caused the floods. But it would have made the flood-perfect weather more likely to occur.

It’s too soon for a proper attribution study, but Phillips says that the fingerprints, or the patterns of the weather, are in line with changes that Canadians have been seeing in the weather in recent years. The storms that hit Canada, like this one, seem to have lost their hit and run characteristic and are sticking around longer, and dumping more water.

“What we’ve seen over recent years, more than the fact that we’re squeezing more precipitation over the air masses, we’re seeing that storms are hanging out longer, they’re squeezing misery out longer,” said Phillips.

It’s a pattern in keeping with the predictions of what Canada will look like under climate change. “The intergovernmental panel on climate change predictions for later this century, if greenhouse gasses continue to accumulate and the eEarth continues to warm, is for Canada generally to get wetter,” said Henson.","Fri, 12 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.popsci.com/app/uploads/2019/01/29/C6NEUBAN5B5OOCJW3PJR47DVOI.jpg,"['snow', 'ottawa', 'change', 'doesnt', 'weather', 'floods', 'canada', 'ravaging', 'storms', 'rain', 'climate', 'historic', 'phillips']", ,flood

Aerial photos showed entire neighborhoods submerged, with television news broadcasting video of residents frantically piling sandbags around their homes to hold back swollen rivers.

An elderly woman died over the weekend after rising waters washed out the road she was driving on, according to media reports.

The flooding has so far affected more than 4,000 properties across Quebec, according to the Urgence Quebec website, including homes in the Montreal suburb of Laval and Gatineau, part of the Ottawa capital region.

The federal government said it is providing disaster response to Quebec, including hundreds of Canadian Armed Forces already deployed to help with sandbagging and other efforts.

“Citizens can rest assured that help will be provided,” Canada’s Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said in a statement.

It is the second year of major flooding over the last three in Quebec, following massive spring floods in 2017 that caused more than C$230 million ($172 million) in insured damages in Quebec and neighboring Ontario.

A spokesman for Goodale said it was too soon to compare the scale of flooding to 2017, but noted that the frequency and severity of natural disasters has increased in Canada in recent years due to climate change.

Quebec Premier François Legault said on Monday that his government would provide capped compensation to victims, along with financial incentives for people to move out of flood zones.

“Once people have accumulated some C$100,000 in expenses, we won’t compensate them any more. And if it goes beyond that, it will be to offer them to move,” he told reporters in Gatineau.

Separate flooding in the east coast province of New Brunswick has also led to evacuations, though waters were expected to peak on Monday, according to local media reports.","Mon, 22 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190422&t=2&i=1379577386&r=LYNXNPEF3L0UF&w=800,"['canadas', 'ottawa', 'flooding', 'province', 'evacuations', 'quebec', 'floods', 'force', 'dead', 'homes', 'according', 'leave', 'million', 'rising', 'waters', 'spring']", ,flood

That could soon change.

The National Research Council (NRC) is working on potential changes to the National Building Code of Canada that would include information on how to flood-proof buildings.

""That's a pretty difficult problem to wrap your arms around,"" said Bill Coulbourne, president of Coulbourne Consulting, of Annapolis, Md., the team hired by the NRC to help with the building code update.

Coulbourne and his team are ""uniquely qualified to carry our this work due to their extensive experience (140 years combined) in the design of flood resistant buildings,"" said an email statement from Nic Defalco, communications adviser with the NRC.

Coulbourne Consulting will be paid $564,057 for its expertise.

In Canada, building construction falls under provincial jurisdiction, but the federal government publishes and updates the National Building Code to provide a baseline starting point.

Six provinces have accepted the national code as is. Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec use the code, but with some variations.

This year thousands of Canadians were affected by floods.

Residents along the Ottawa River were forced to evacuate their homes when water levels rose to record levels in May. The month before, the Saint John River flooded homes throughout New Brunswick. In July, hay crops in British Columbia were destroyed when the Chilcotin River burst its banks.

The Canadian government says the frequency and severity of flooding will likely increase in the years ahead.

Canadian basements

Coulbourne Consulting has helped governments in the United States craft codes to build flood-resistant structures. But Canada's code needs to be tailor-made.

""In the U.S., one of the prohibitions when you're building in a flood plain is that you cannot build a basement,"" Coulbourne said.

""In Canada, colder temperatures mean deeper foundations for buildings. You pretty much [always] have a basement.""

Hundreds of homes in Windsor, Ont., and Tecumseh, Ont., had their basements flooded after storms pummelled the region in 2017. (Jason Viau/CBC)

For homes built alongside bodies of water, Coulbourne suggests assuming that a basement will flood on a semi-regular basis and to plan accordingly.

That would mean using a basement for storage boxes that could be easily moved upstairs when floodwaters rise.

""[It means] keeping the basement in place but using it as a place to collect water when it floods,"" he said. ""That's not a popular thing to do, as you can imagine. In some cases, that might be half their living space.""

Water more powerful than wind

For newer construction, keeping floodwaters out of basements is possible but challenging.

""The force of water is usually a lot higher than the load transferred into buildings from high winds and earthquakes,"" said Coulbourne. ""So water can actually exert quite a force on something like a building wall.""

The flooded Muskoka River submerges a front-yard flagpole in Bracebridge, Ont., earlier this year. (Jean-Francois Morissette/CBC)

If the structure is built strong enough to withstand the force of the water, the next step is sealing every entrance.

""The effort in flood-proofing a building is really to search for all those places that water could penetrate the building and figure out how to seal them up,"" Coulbourne said.

Providing guidance, not writing policies

Coulbourne says his team is not telling the Canadian government exactly what its code should be.

""I don't think that's our place. We are going to stay out of the policy conversation as much as we can,"" he said.

""We are working on reports and guidance documents that would provide the NRC with information about what to use and how to consider the current information that's available in Canada.""

The NRC says the reports and analysis from Coulbourne Consulting ""will be provided to codes committees for consideration in future editions of building codes, standards and guides.""

Once the water recedes, it easy to assume that people's lives return to normal. After all, when the rivers and lakes go back down, the story disappears from the news and the public's attention turns elsewhere.

But what happens to the people still living in the flood zone?

Many Canadians experienced some of the worst flooding in recorded history this spring — one of the hardest-hit areas in New Brunswick, where more than 5,500 homes flooded or were threatened, was still recovering from a 2018 inundation. The National sent reporter Nick Purdon and producer Leonardo Palleja to to find out what happens after the flood.

Dawn Burke

""Every time the waves hit, the house shook.""

Dawn Burke remembers how the water of Grand Lake rose so high that it reached the ceiling of the main floor inside her house.

""It wasn't worth risking our lives to be in there, so that's when we left,"" she says.

(CBC)

Climate change is a critical issue for our readers, viewers and listeners. Recent polling suggests that it is a leading concern in this election year. In Our Backyard is an ambitious and comprehensive CBC News project about how climate change is affecting our lives. You'll see and hear it wherever CBC News is: online, on television, on the radio and on CBC Kids News, because Canada's youth care deeply about this issue.

That spring day in 2018, her house battered and completely surrounded by water, Burke, 52, and her husband didn't believe there was anything they could do to save it.

So instead they went to help a neighbour.

When they finally returned to the house, Burke says she opened the front door and water poured out.

""That was very dramatic,"" she says. ""But I didn't cry for it. I didn't cry once for it,"" even though it was the home where she had raised her six children.

""I think for me it was more important to show my kids that material possessions come and go, and that's not what is going to define what we are,"" Burke says. ""There was a lesson there for us all to learn.""

Dawn Burke stands where her house once was on the shores of Grand Lake in New Brunswick. 'Even today when you look at how far away the lake is, it's hard to believe that the flood actually happened,' she says. (Nick Purdon/CBC)

Burke says it would have cost more to fix her house than it was worth.

In the end, the province paid Burke a percentage of its value and the family walked away.

Now they've started again.

""My husband is 64 — we never thought at our age we'd be trying to come up with a downpayment,"" she says.

""But what's the choice?"" she adds.

This spring the family managed to buy a house — far outside the flood zone.

Burke admits she'll miss the lake she loves, but she won't risk being flooded again.

""How high do you build?"" Burke asks. ""How bad are the floods going to get? So that was a struggle for us.""

Sarah Kirstead

Childhood for Sarah Kirstead was all about the cottage her grandfather built almost 50 years ago.

""We played hide and seek, we picked berries, and had campfires all the time,"" she says. ""The cottage was home. I think what it was to me as a child was freedom.""

Sarah Kirstead grew up on the shores of Grand Lake. She learned to walk at her grandparents' cottage and had some of the most memorable moments of her childhood there. (Sarah Kirstead)

Then the flood of 2018 destroyed it.

Kirstead, 22, who is now a professional photographer, has used her camera to make sense of her loss.

""I remember standing in what was their kitchen — the whole front of the cottage was open to the water, the walls were completely gone,"" she says.

""I thought, 'I lost an era of my life.'""

Kirstead was devastated when her grandparents' cottage was destroyed by the 2018 floods. 'I guess it's such a stark reality that nothing is permanent. I think that's what hit me about it,' she says. (Sarah Kirstead)

Kirstead is worried about her grandparents, too, because she knows how much they loved the cottage.

""There was a little bedroom — that was grammy's room,"" Kirstead remembers. ""She used to have a window right onto the lake and she would always listen for the waves in there.""

Kirstead says her grandmother was usually at the window of the cottage looking out at the lake when Sarah came to visit.

""In a way it's gone, but it's still here too,"" Kirstead says.

""That's one thing my grandmother said when we were processing the aftermath. She was like, 'You know, the view is still there. At least the view is still there.'""

Kirstead recalls some of her childhood memories as she sits near the site where her grandparents' cottage used to be. (Nick Purdon/CBC)

Kirstead's family decided not to rebuild the cottage. With catastrophic floods two years in a row, they say the water levels are too unpredictable.

Instead, Kirstead's grandparents have parked a trailer near the spot — but higher up and closer to the road.

Kirstead says the flooding has taught her a lot about which things in life really last.

""You want to feel secure and permanent, but I don't necessarily need the cottage to physically be there to understand what it meant to me growing up.

""That's still there,"" she says.

Lisa Sanderson

""I haven't actually been down to the beach since the flood,"" Lisa Sanderson admits as she stares out at the St. John River.

On this day the river is perfectly calm.

""I just…"" she tries to explain, but pauses.

""It's a little too real to see the water.""

Sanderson stands on the shore of the St. John River, which has threatened to flood her home twice in two years. (Nick Purdon/CBC)

Sanderson has been through a lot over the past couple of years.

She and her partner checked the historical flood data before they bought the property in 2012 — water had never come close to the house.

They thought they were safe.

Then in 2018 it took 2,500 sandbags, a dozen people and days of pumping water out of her house to save it.

A flood like that wasn't supposed to happen more than once in her lifetime — but then the water rose again this spring.

One of the things she has learned about floods, Sanderson says, is that they don't get easier the more they happen.

They get harder.

""This year the helplessness was worse. The anxiety was worse, because you know what to expect,"" she says. ""You know how hard it is to see the water coming. It's a feeling of doom and dread. It feels like it is attacking your life.""

It took a wall of thousands of sandbags and a team of people working around the clock to save Sanderson's home from the floodwaters. (Lisa Sanderson)

Sanderson says she has decided to seek counselling to help her with the stress of the floods.

""It's really hard. You picture your life here,"" she says. ""It looks like just a little piece of land to someone, but to us it perks us up when we come home — every single day. But at the same time, we can't go through what we went through the last couple of years.""

Sanderson, a high school music teacher in St. John, isn't sure what to do. She and her partner have discussed building a flood wall, and they've looked into moving, too — but how do you sell a house that floods?

""Who is going to want to build here? Who is going to want to live here?

""It was never a concern before,"" Sanderson adds. ""Things are changing. The world is changing.""

To stay or go? CBC News 0:39 When Lisa Sanderson bought her home on New Brunswick's Saint John River in 2012, historical data showed that floodwaters had never been recorded near the building. But the house has now been threatened by flooding twice in the past two years, and she's struggling with what to do next. 0:39

Standing on the beach as the sun begins to set, Sanderson admits her perspective on the St. John River has changed too.

""When we first came down here this was one of the selling points — standing here and looking at this river,"" she says.

And now?

""It's like that friend who betrayed you who you still hang out with — you're just careful.""

Flood risk maps could be an essential tool for helping Canadians avoid buying houses in flood-prone areas – or building them there in the first place.

But too often they are of poor quality, and what information is presented is hard to interpret, an expert charges.

Jason Thistlethwaite, who teaches climate change risk management at the University of Waterloo, studied flood maps across Canada and was disturbed by what he found.

“We looked at over 300 that exist in high-risk areas,” he explains. “We asked a simple question: Would an average property owner be able to look at this map and understand the risk to their property, or to a property they were considering purchasing?

“We found that Canada’s flood maps are low-quality, and they will not help with the decision-making that a property owner will have to make to protect their property from flooding. They’re designed for land use planners, they’re designed for engineers. They’re not designed to help an individual understand the flood risk.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""We found that Canada's flood maps are low-quality, and they will not help with the decision-making that a property owner will have to make to protect their property from flooding.

Local governments are caught in a difficult bind, he explains. Part of their job is stopping homes from being built in flood plains — but the more development happens, the more money comes in.

“For municipalities, it’s actually very difficult to limit development in these areas, given the benefits associated with increased property tax revenue.”

Properties near water are seen as more desirable — and bring in more tax revenue — until the day the water rises, he says.

Some flood-prone areas were developed generations ago, often when a community grew up around a water-powered mill. But some were built on much more recently.

In Quebec, over 3,000 homes are flooded and another 2,300 cut off by floods. Parts of New Brunswick downstream from Fredericton on the St. John River are also afflicted, as are the Muskoka and Ottawa areas in Ontario.

Nationally, over 1,500 troops are deployed to flooded areas in the three provinces.

Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Ontario Premier Doug Ford both blamed the floods’ destructiveness on climate change.

But Thistlethwaite says this mostly misses the point.

“Climate change is a factor, but it’s nowhere near as big a factor as the neglect of governments to enforce effective land use, restricting development, giving information to the public so that they know, when they’re buying a property, whether or not it’s in a flood plain and aging infrastructure.”

Goodale said Friday that federal money is available to help local governments do better flood mapping, and he’s “surprised” it hasn’t been applied for more often.

Better maps would “help prepare province and municipalities to know what happens if you get five inches of precipitation, if you get 10 inches of precipitation, if you get 15 inches of precipitation, what happens to the rivers, the creeks, the drains,” he said.

Flood maps in Britain and the United States are easily accessible and easy to understand, Thistlethwaite says.

“For the most part, Canadians are in the dark when it comes to the exposure of their big investment in their property to flood risk.”

In the long run, he argues, governments that allowed development need to offer to help people leave houses that never should have been built in the first place.

“Governments need to take responsibility for this. The property owner did not know they were buying in a high-risk area, so how is it contingent on them to take the liability, and the cost of the devaluation of their property? That’s where you need governments to come in and say, ‘We’d be willing to buy out your property.”

However, a controversy in Quebec illustrates some of the practical problems. The province has offered to buy out some flood-prone homeowners for up to $200,000, but affected residents say that’s far too little money.

On that evening, conservation authority staff were trying to assess the threat of the Black Creek, a repeat offender for flooding. The first “low level” alarm (from a water-level gauge) for Black Creek at Highway 401 arrived by text message at 8:45 p.m. But, as a debriefing report noted, the rainfall gauges showed little precipitation.

Still, Black Creek continued to rise. It peaked between 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. In 90 minutes, it would rise 3.5 metres.

Inside the elevator, where Freire and Otrin are trapped, the river water keeps rising. It is brown. Otrin watches big bugs paddling on the surface.

Unable to find a door release, Freire joins Otrin on the handrails, to keep their one cellphone dry. With no way out, no cell signal, Otrin begins smashing the escape hatch in the ceiling. His knuckles bleed. He uses the top of his head, trying to let a cell signal inside. The hatch opens a crack and Otrin shoves in Freire’s red leather journal to keep it open. Standing on the railing with water at chest level, Freire calls 911. Police and firefighters are swamped with flooding calls. Eventually, he gets through.

A few minutes after 11 p.m., when the water reaches their chins, Freire and Otrin hear voices in the basement hallway, which was filled with six feet of water, nearly reaching the top of the elevator. Two Toronto police officers heard the 911 dispatcher’s call for help. Still in uniform, they swim down the stairs into the garage hallway and use a crowbar to pry open the elevator door. Water rushes into the elevator and then sweeps them out. One officer drags Freire up the stairs until he can walk on his own.

It took months, but Otrin and Freire are ready to talk. “There almost hasn’t been a day when I don’t think of the incident to some degree … some days I think about it more deeply than others. Certainly, it changes your perception of life,” Otrin says.

“We went through a lot of recovery, adjusting, dealing with the events and self-reflection,” says Freire.

Freire and Otrin had a hard time working, focusing and sleeping. They sought help for trauma. They received calls from lawyers, but declined offers of representation to sue the building owner, who has since added a floodgate to the garage entrance and water sensors on the elevators. “He’s a good guy,” says Freire. “We decided to just move forward.”

Freire designed an elevator sensor that would detect water below and stop on a higher floor. It could be used on elevators in flood-prone areas to “save lives for less than $50 dollars worth of hardware,” Freire says. The Ontario Building Code does not require flood detection sensors on elevators, a city of Toronto spokesperson says.

Freire and Otrin looked at the drone business and questioned its impact.

Do they continue trying to build consumer drones or use their experience to find a different purpose?

The answer, Freire says, lies with clean energy to combat climate change.

They designed a drone that can fly up a wind turbine and video the unmoving blades to check for damage or necessary maintenance, collecting data which Freire says, will improve the mechanics and potentially save on electricity costs.

“I think we realized that if we were still here, we might as well do something that was meaningful.”","Tue, 21 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://projects.thestar.com/climate-change-canada/toronto-flooding/img/og.jpg,"['creek', 'water', 'rains', 'heres', 'hard', 'elevators', 'gauges', 'elevator', 'keeps', 'toronto', 'freire', 'otrin', 'trying', 'flooding', 'think']", ,flood

More than 10,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in eastern Canada in recent days as spring floods broke record levels set in 2017, officials said Monday, warning that it could take weeks for the waters to recede.

Meanwhile an operation is underway to rescue pets from homes in the area that had to be abandoned during evacuations.

Hardest hit was the town of Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, west of Montreal, where more than 6,000 people were forced to flee rising waters over the weekend after a natural dike was breached.

Flooding in the town ""is stabilizing,"" Quebec Public Safety Minister Genevieve Guilbault told a press conference.

""Water levels are falling and we hope that we can protect the area,"" she said, noting that construction of new gravel barriers was underway to keep waters at bay.

About 9,000 people have been displaced in Quebec province, or twice the number in 2017, which had seen the region's worst flooding in a half-century.

In the rush to flee the rising water scores of pets were abandoned.

Eric Dussault, whose Animal Rescue Network is spearheading the effort to find the marooned pets, said an emergency shelter has been set up and people with training in animal rescues and expertise in cat and dog behaviors have been sent door to door.

""We have a huge number of animals we need to evacuate. We're working with a list of hundreds of animals supplied by their owners,"" he said.

About 40 animals were rescued since late Sunday, but the group was too late to save a dog, a guinea pig and another unspecified animal believed to have drowned or died of hypothermia.

""Flooding is incredibly stressful on animals,"" Dussault told AFP.

In New Brunswick, more than 1,000 people have been forced from their homes. A handful also were evacuated in the capital Ottawa.

Several thousand soldiers have been deployed throughout Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick to help with evacuations and fill sandbags.

Guilbault said she expects there will be a break in rainfall, but added that waters are likely take a long time to recede.

The current standard for the spacing of a topographic grid for regional mapping and modelling is 30 metres, as the the Canadian Water Network noted in a recent study, Improving Flood Risk Evaluation through Cross-Sector Sharing of Richer Data. The study found this standard is too coarse to represent fully the results of pluvial flooding, which results from intense rainfall events.

In Canada, digital terrain models for flood mapping have a resolution of 30 by 30 meters. The Insurance Bureau of Canada would like to improve that to five by five meters or better, IBC federal affairs vice president Craig Stewart told Canadian Underwriter earlier.

IBC was a partner for the Canadian Water Network in the pilot test, which was done in Edmonton, Regina, Halifax, Windsor and the Town of Tecumseh, Ont., which borders Windsor to the east. Founded as a result of the Walkerton, Ont. water contamination tragedy, the Canadian Water Network has a board comprised of members from academia, municipalities, utilities and conservation authorities.

There may be an advantage to having flood maps with a two-metre resolution in certain areas such as dense urban centres, the Water Network suggests in its Oct. 11 report.

During the pluvial flood modelling pilot, participating municipalities tested flood modelling with two-metre resolution. This provided much greater detail (compared to 30-metre resolution) and improved the predictability of the results. But it also had a significant impact on the time it took for the computers to run the models, the network said in the report.

“A dense dataset is likely too costly and impractical to produce national-scale pluvial flood maps. A 5-metre grid spacing reduces processing time, with minimal reduction in output quality as compared to finer grid spacing. However, it may be advantageous to use 2-metre grid spacing in certain key areas, such as dense urban centres.”

Having higher resolution makes it easier to model the impact of things like storm sewers, dikes and dry ponds.

The full report, published this past June, was not made public because it has proprietary information from the modelling firms, as well as private data from the participating municipalities, a spokesperson for the Canadian Water Network told Canadian Underwriter.

24,24,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Spring flooding in Canada: Are you at risk this year? - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/spring-flooding-in-canada-are-you-at-risk-this-year-1.4337430,"With stubborn snow still on the ground in much of the country after one of the coldest winters in recent history, the threat of flooding looms large everywhere from New Brunswick to Alberta, according to Environment Canada.

The weather agency’s senior climatologist David Phillips said they will typically see the risk of severe springtime flooding in just one or two areas of the country, this year he said there are potential flood issues from the Maritimes through Quebec and Ontario and into the Prairies.

With few opportunities for snow to melt this winter, Phillips said a sudden transition to warm weather could increase the flooding risk.

“In every area we’re seeing snow that fell before Halloween is still there on the ground,” he told CTV’s Your Morning on Friday. “Heavy, deep snowpack, we haven’t got rid of it much this winter because we had the second coldest winter in 16 years and record cold in the Prairies and other parts of the country.”

New Brunswick, in particular, is at risk of another year of springtime flooding following record-high water levels and flooding in 2018, which caused millions of dollars in property damage. Phillips said the situation is just as critical as it was last year.

In Quebec, Phillips said southern portions of the province may struggle with flooding this spring. Quebec City has received more than 100 centimetres of snow this winter that still needs to melt, Phillips said.

With a dramatic warm up on the way in Ontario just in time for the first official day of spring, Phillips said northern parts of the province, including Sudbury, could see some flooding this year depending on how quickly temperatures rise.

Phillips said southern Manitoba, particularly Winnipeg and low-lying areas around the Red River, could be threatened with flooding this spring.

Saskatchewan does not appear to be currently at risk for flooding this spring, according to Phillips.

Further west, Phillips said Edmonton and areas to the north could experience flooding this year.

Despite “terrible” flooding in British Columbia the past two springs, Phillips said this year doesn’t look as bad for the province thanks to normal snowfall amounts in alpine areas.

The amount of snow on the ground isn’t the only predictor of flooding, Phillips said. Daily temperatures and rainfall in the spring can also determine the potential for flooding.

“What you need is the convergence of several weather situations that could cause you to get rid of that snow in a rush,” he explained. “You don’t want to go from slush to sweat. You want kind of an easy, slow [transition] into the spring and that would in fact help to diminish the flood risk.”

Phillips said a warmer climate can contribute to an increase in flooding every year because the atmosphere can hold more moisture, which can result in heavier rain.

“My sense is that trend has been there in recent decades and there’s no reason to suggest that it won’t go away,” he said. “I think that is something that we’re going to have to live with in the years to come.”","Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4337437.1552653913!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['snow', 'flooding', 'province', 'winter', 'risk', 'quebec', 'weather', 'ground', 'canada', 'spring', 'phillips']", ,flood

Nearly all of the 2,300 people surveyed for a new University of Waterloo study did not know or weren't sure that they lived in a designated flood risk area. Almost 90 per cent were unaware that their home was in an area vulnerable to flooding.

Half of them said they weren't worried about it happening either.

That lack of awareness is a problem, according to the researchers.

Canada has seen about 80 flood events since 2000, and related costs are going up.

Development in flood-prone areas is a contributing factor, as are shifting weather patterns, more people living in basements, and outdated dams, dikes and stormwater infrastructure.

Canadians personally shoulder about $600 million each year in losses related to flooding.

“It is Canada’s most common and costly natural hazard,” the researchers wrote.

It’s not yet known how much flood damage in Quebec will cost after thousands of people were forced from their homes, but other past catastrophes weren’t cheap.

The 2013 floods in Alberta, considered the priciest disaster in Canadian history, cost more than $6 billion.

Floods also have social implications — physical and mental health issues, job loss and family disruption.

But while 83 per cent of respondents in the study said they thought they had a responsibility to protect their property, less than a third of them used flood protection measures like sump pumps, rain barrels or water-resistant materials in the basement.

And half said they weren’t interested in buying overland flood insurance.

“Canadians’ self-assessment of flood risk does not align with actual risk,” the authors wrote.

Feds set to help less with disaster relief

And what Canadians might not know is that the federal government is trying to offload more responsibility for dealing with the issue onto them.

The Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements program, which gives provinces and territories financial help, can't continue doling out the amount that it does, a Parliamentary Budget Office report found last year. While the budget for the program isn’t expected to grow, costs are continuing to do so.

As a result, the feds have invested money in flood mitigation, but are also upping the thresholds that provinces and territories must meet to receive money, according to the University of Waterloo study. Several private insurance companies also now offer flood insurance, so some provinces now tell their residents that flooding doesn’t qualify for disaster help.

“These changes could have serious implications for Canadians,"" the study authors wrote. ""By reducing the availability of disaster assistance and tightening the eligibility to receive it, the federal and provincial governments have shifted more financial liability and responsibility to homeowners.""

But as they note, governments, realtors and insurers also have an obligation to make sure people know they’re at risk in the first place and what to do. Only a quarter of the study respondents said they’d been approached about flood insurance.

More than 90 per cent agreed that flood risk maps should be public. Roughly the same number also agreed that home sellers should be required to tell buyers about potential risk if it's in a designated flood risk area and wanted to know whether their home was in one.

“Homeowners can’t afford to remain in the dark about their options and responsibilities,” said Jason Thistlethwaite, a study co-author and University of Waterloo assistant professor, in a press release.

And the need for people to be aware will only grow. While recent floods have been devastating, things may only get worse, if climate change has anything to say about it.

27,27,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Back-to-back historic floods in Atlantic Canada force a climate reckoning - The Narwhal,https://thenarwhal.ca/back-to-back-historic-floods-in-atlantic-canada-force-a-climate-reckoning/,"There are no buildings left on the road to Darlings Island, a low-lying strip of asphalt that curves gently along the Hammond River in southern New Brunswick. The demolition crews may have knocked them down, but it was the floods that did them in.

In the aftermath of another spring of extreme flooding in Atlantic Canada, few places have been as physically changed as this roadway in Nauwigewauk, a rural community on the front lines of Canada’s changing climate.

“It looks like a nuclear blast site,” Paul Thompson, a retired firefighter who was one of the residents who lost their homes, told The Narwhal.

Where his house once stood, there’s a pile of gravel, surrounded by debris left behind when the water receded. His neighbours’ homes are gone, too. Most notably, the volunteer fire hall across the road and the Nauwigewauk Community Centre ⁠— a local social hub that had hosted countless kindergarten classes, dances, variety shows, Halloween parties, Beaver Scouts meetings and strawberry-shortcake socials since 1948 ⁠— have also been demolished.

After back-to-back historic floods along the St. John River watershed, this community and others like it in New Brunswick are being redrawn by backhoes, demolition equipment and government officials — who are now enforcing flood-plain building restrictions that went ignored for decades.

In Thompson’s case, the province bought his house, which he’d spent years building up to withstand floods, and sold it to the highest bidder for $5,000 — provided they moved it to higher ground. In its place, there are plans for a new road that would be raised 1.5 metres above the existing road.

People in the province are talking about climate change in a way they never would have a few years ago. For the second straight year, hundreds of homes were evacuated and long stretches of the Trans-Canada Highway were underwater. Even officials who manage flood response seemed surprised at the level of destruction this spring.

Many in the province say New Brunswick needs to start making hard choices about how to adapt.

‘Not even peaked yet’

“The world is changing. I see it every year,” Taya Wallace, president of the Nauwigewauk Community Club, told The Narwhal. “You see how it’s affecting things. It’s right in front of us here.”

In May, Wallace and her neighbours watched as heavy equipment knocked down their community centre. It was an emotional moment for some, including Wallace, who had her wedding reception and many family reunions there.

The decision to demolish the hall was made prior to this spring’s flooding that once again left the building half-submerged — something that only confirmed it was the right choice.

“It was devastating,” she said. “But we didn’t really have a choice.”

The building’s fate was sealed the previous spring, when Wallace watched as the river rose higher and higher over the covered bridge by her house. That wooden span, the postcard-esque entryway to Darlings Island since 1914, has long been a measuring stick for the annual spring thaw.

The last time the river was that swollen, Pierre Trudeau was in his second term as prime minister. Residents had to strap the historic bridge down to keep it from floating away. More than 45 years later, Trudeau’s son was calling that kind of extreme weather “the new reality.”

Residents on Darlings Island have grown used to becoming stranded from the mainland for days, their road vanishing under flood waters. When Wallace’s husband arrived by boat to report the community centre was also under water, she sensed that something serious — and unprecedented — was happening to her community.

“I remember Brent coming home and saying, ‘The flood, it’s in the hall, and it’s not even peaked yet,’ ” she said. “I just had this overwhelming feeling that we were up against something we’d never dealt with before.”

Average temperatures could increase by five degrees by 2100

New Brunswick, with its sprawling network of rivers, wetlands and low-lying communities, is grappling with an increasingly expensive flooding problem. The Insurance Bureau of Canada says flood claims paid out by insurance companies in New Brunswick grew from $59 million in 1996 to $144.3 million in 2015. That’s larger than the average annual flood payout for all of Canada between 1990 and the early 2000s.

For people who live in the province’s flood-prone communities, climate change has sparked a debate over costly mitigation projects, such as diverting water channels, building dikes or raising highways. Premier Blaine Higgs, a vocal opponent of the federal carbon tax, believes permanent fixes are needed — fixes like changes to building patterns and regulations around how close people can build to rivers.

Some argue the federal government should require homeowners move out of areas with repeated floods if they want to receive disaster relief funding. Critics say New Brunswick needs to become more proactive when it comes to climate change, instead of reacting once disasters hit.

The floods are only expected to get worse. The province’s legislative committee on climate change has computer models that predict New Brunswick’s average annual temperature could increase by as much as five degrees within 80 years. That means more intense rain and snowfalls, exacerbating the spring runoff.

Some residents are choosing to adjust the way they live, raising their homes up above high water marks. Others are simply leaving. In some rural communities, volunteer fire departments are offering to torch flood-ravaged properties to save on demolition costs.

Thompson believes homeowners should be allowed to build in flood plains, as long as they’re prepared for recurring flood waters. He believes the government’s response to chronic flooding, by expanding restrictions on building near water, is an over-reaction.

“Common sense has to prevail,” he said. “Look at Vancouver. They have houses on piers. Down in Louisiana, they have houses on piers. Our house was built on concrete, with blocks all around it. We felt we were protected.”

‘We’ve had water pretty much every year’

Nauwigewauk has always existed on a floodplain, but the severity and frequency of the flooding here is literally reshaping the community. Flooding that used to happen every few decades has become an annual event. That concern, for future floods, was a big factor in the decision to demolish the community hall.

“We moved here in 1974, and for 30 years we never had a problem. The last ten years, we’ve had water pretty much every year,” Nancy Thorpe, a Darlings Island resident and longtime volunteer with the community club, told The Narwhal.

“There were quite a few people who thought we could save the hall, and continue. But there was so much we had to mitigate and do to handle the next flood. Here was two years in a row,” Thorpe said.

“Whatever we would have done last year, we would have to do again this year.”

Thorpe points out life was already changing in Nauwigewauk long before the flooding. It’s been harder and harder to get volunteers for community events, and the club’s directors were already pondering a future without their landmark hall. But the flooding forced their hand.

In a province where one out of every six homes is built in a flood-prone area, thousands of homes and businesses have been affected.

As the waters receded from the recent floods, the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization warned cleanup efforts could be hampered by contaminated water that posed serious health risks. From plunging property values to depleted disaster-relief programs, the economic impact is significant.

“I feel bad for people who can’t sell their homes because of all the flooding,” Catherine White, who has lived on Darlings Island for 48 years, told The Narwhal.

“It’s just one of the things with where we live… When the flooding starts, you have to decide if you’re going to stock up on groceries and stay, or you find somewhere to live off the island for a while.”

Climate change increases risk of flooding, scientists say

Chronic flooding has people paying more attention to sudden flips in the weather here, such as some wild swings seen last April when the temperature soared from snowstorms to 26 C in a matter of days.

The rising waters can’t entirely be blamed on climate change, but climatologists say higher seasonal temperatures and precipitation certainly increase the risk of flooding. In Nauwigewauk, Darlings Island and many other New Brunswick communities, people say life is already changing, and fast.

“In 2018, everyone said it’s a once-in-a-century flood. It’ll never happen again. And sure enough, it did happen again. The very next spring,” White said.

“If you don’t think global warming is happening now, you’ve got your head buried in the sand.”

Mr. Coochey's was one of the many homes damaged during the flooding of May, 2017. Dario Ayala/The Globe and Mail

Tim Coochey had no idea how much water was coming his way. As the St. Lawrence River swelled in May, 2017, the resident of the Montreal borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro assumed the home he’d bought a quarter-century earlier was safe; after all, the river was more than 250 metres away, and the neighbourhood’s drainage infrastructure had been upgraded considerably since the last notable flooding, in the 1970s.

But as the river rose, storm sewers began working in reverse. His street flooded. Mr. Coochey watched in shock as his driveway, which slopes toward his house, filled with water in a matter of minutes and spilled over the makeshift barricade in front of the garage door. He told his family to abandon the house.

“I didn’t even know it was a flood zone,” Mr. Coochey said. “Only now am I finding out that my particular street was basically swamp, which they backfilled. And then they built houses on it.”

Those floods could have played out differently had Mr. Coochey, his neighbours and their civic officials better understood the situation with the help of flood-risk maps.

Flood maps – cartographic depictions of areas that are likely to flood under certain conditions – are invaluable sources of information for homeowners and civic officials. In the United States, England and France, one can enter a postal code into a government website and quickly assess a property’s susceptibility to flooding. Had Mr. Coochey possessed such information, he could have taken steps to protect his property – or never purchased the home in the first place. Various studies have determined that every dollar spent on flood prevention is worth many times that amount in property replacement costs.

Yet the vast majority of Canadians do not have easy access to such maps. Partly due to government cutbacks – and the reluctance of municipalities to discourage development – all too often the best many homeowners can do is visit a local government office and dust off a decades-old relic intended for engineers or hydrologists.

Professor Jason Thistlethwaite and colleagues at the University of Waterloo recently completed a study of almost 700 Canadian flood maps. “The results are not impressive,” he said. Many were old, few had been digitized and most were not publicly accessible.

Environment Canada/New Brunswick Department of the Environment

And for as many as a third of Canadians living in flood-prone areas, there are no flood maps to consult. Mr. Coochey is one of them. The Globe and Mail asked his municipal government for flood maps of his neighbourhood. The municipality said such a request would “disrupt the flow of work of the borough office,” but promised to respond within a month. When it did respond, two months later, it said it didn’t have any such maps.

Little wonder, then, that rising floodwaters catch so many Canadians off guard. According to a 2016 estimate by analytics firm LexisNexis Risk Solutions, there are 8.6 million residential addresses in Canada. More than a fifth of those – 1.8 million – are susceptible to flooding. By another estimate, as much as 10 per cent of Canada’s population lives in high-risk flood zones. However alarming that may seem, the bigger problem is that nearly all of those at risk don’t know it. A 2017 survey of 2,300 homeowners by the University of Waterloo found that just 6 per cent of respondents realized they lived in designated flood-risk areas.

That ignorance often leads to bad decisions. Without flood maps, prospective home buyers may unwittingly purchase at-risk homes. And they may fail to take protective measures, such as installing sump pumps, regrading their properties or purchasing the right kind of insurance.

This week’s floods in Quebec and New Brunswick are the latest reminder of what happens when communities fail to account for the risks as they grow. Entire neighbourhoods may be developed in harm’s way, resulting in extensive damage and financial loss for homeowners, insurers and government disaster-assistance programs.

The federal government is well aware of the situation. “Canada lacks effective flood hazard maps, which are considered essential risk assessment tools,” according to a 2017 report published by Public Safety Canada. But remedying the situation would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and might take a decade. And few governments in Canada seem willing to accept the challenge.

A flood of forgetfulness

While maps cannot guarantee better flood management, they are a crucial start. Canada has largely forgotten how to draft them. The irony is that we were once considered a world leader.

In 1975, Environment Canada introduced the Flood Damage Reduction Program (FDRP). Organized as a series of deals between Ottawa and provincial and territorial governments, its cornerstone was producing flood-risk maps for urban areas. All provinces and territories participated except Prince Edward Island and Yukon.

Ottawa’s motives were not entirely altruistic. A few years earlier it had introduced the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements, a cost-sharing program with provinces for mopping up after natural disasters. The scheme had been stung by a series of costly flood claims. Ottawa’s goal with the new program was to wash its hands of people who insisted on building in high-risk areas. In the hopes that they would inform better land-use planning, the new maps were to be widely disseminated.

By most accounts, the effort paid off. A report by the Government of Saskatchewan found that participating communities such as Regina and the town of Lumsden, in the Qu’Appelle River valley, had used that information to take a variety of flood-prevention measures, from diking to regulating land use in floodplains, that “greatly aided” them later. Had Lumsden not constructed its dikes in the late 1970s, the report estimated, it would have suffered $140-million in property damage during the serious floods of 2011; instead, it suffered “minimum” damage.

The FDRP wasn’t an unqualified success. Some communities continued making bad decisions; one study found that development continued in defined floodplain areas in Montreal, for instance. “The information may have been there, but there was no teeth or enforcement,” Prof. Thistlethwaite said.

Nonetheless, almost 1,000 communities were mapped and their floodplains identified. One 1995 assessment published in the Canadian Water Resources Journal concluded the FDRP had been “extremely successful in identifying urban flood risk areas across Canada and in redirecting damage-prone development away from flood risk areas.”

So highly regarded was the program, University of Western Ontario geography professor Dan Shrubsole said, that countries in Europe and the Caribbean requested Environment Canada’s assistance in mapping their own floodplains.

But then the FDRP fell victim to budget cuts, and the federal government eventually cancelled it in 1996. Provinces were left to their own devices. Wealthier provinces, including Alberta and Ontario, continued mapping, albeit no longer to common standards. Activity in the Maritimes, meanwhile, ceased almost completely.

Today, Canada is among a minority of members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that lack a national floodplain mapping program. Many communities continue to rely on FDRP-era maps. MMM Group, a consultancy hired a few years ago to assess the situation, found that half the maps still in use are between 18 and 40 years old.

Considered cutting-edge in their day, the FDRP maps have not aged well. Most of them feature a single line delineating the area affected by a specified regulatory flood level. (Actual flooding risk is, of course, more nuanced.) And many maps were of such coarse resolution that they are of little use to property owners seeking to understand the risk of flooding on their properties.

An even bigger problem is that many of Canada’s flood maps have outlived their usefulness. With a changing climate, relying on decades-old data and assumptions about rainfall and storm surge is a dangerous proposition. Changing landscapes must also be taken into account. When loggers, wildfires or pine beetles destroy large swaths of forest, more water tends to run off into rivers more quickly. Meanwhile, far away from watercourses, increased development and the destruction of wetlands can fundamentally alter where water goes after heavy rainfalls.

Blind in British Columbia

Neil Peters, a water resource engineer, witnessed Canada’s increasing blindness to flood risks. When he was hired by the B.C. government in 1987, the province had already paid for dozens of flood maps out of pocket and had about 45 people working full time on flood management. It joined the FDRP and mapped a total of 89 areas prior to its cancellation.

But British Columbia’s flood-mapping expertise was already in gradual decline. After the FDRP’s demise, the province downloaded most of the responsibility for flood mapping and management to municipalities, including decisions regarding development on floodplains. Tamsin Lyle, principal at Ebbwater Consulting, said the province henceforth contributed very little funding or expertise to flood-mapping efforts. “The municipal governments were pretty much left on their own,” she said.

The problem is that municipalities have powerful disincentives for regulating floodplain development. After all, they rely on property taxes for revenue and face “a lot of pressure from developers and others to promote development of the city,” said John Pomeroy, a geography professor at the University of Saskatchewan. “And where do people want to live? Humans want to be on the water.”

What’s more, floodplain maps are costly to produce; according to a 2017 report by the B.C. Real Estate Association, communities in the province struggled “to find funding sources for floodplain mapping projects.”

The result of B.C.'s decision was predictable. “There was very little mapping done” by B.C.'s municipalities after the FDRP’s cancellation, Ms. Lyle said. Surveying the state of the province’s flood maps in 2015, Ebbwater found that the median age was 26 years.

More alarmingly, much of the populous Lower Fraser Valley still hadn’t been mapped or was served by maps dating from the 1960s. Ebbwater estimated that more than 300,000 people live on the floodplain in Delta, Coquitlam and particularly Richmond. According to a report published this year by the province’s Auditor-General, the Lower Mainland is expected to flood more often; owing partly to the changing climate, flood levels previously expected just once every 500 years may now be expected every 50 years.

By the time Mr. Peters retired in 2016, B.C. had just eight full-time-equivalent professionals working in flood management, down from 45 three decades earlier. Asked how much development had taken place on B.C.'s floodplains, he said it had clearly happened but he couldn’t quantify it. “I really don’t have a good handle on that. I don’t think anybody does.”

The price of ignorance

While Ottawa successfully downloaded responsibility for flood mapping to lower levels of government, it still had to pay for much of the resulting bad decisions.

Payments from the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements, now administered by Public Safety Canada, are triggered when damages exceed certain thresholds per capita of population, rising to as much as 90 per cent of costs. The more expensive the disaster, the more Ottawa pays. Canada’s flood-mapping dark age coincided with skyrocketing payments for flood damage – of a magnitude far greater than what prompted the FDRP in the first place.

There’s every reason to believe damages will continue to escalate. In 2016 the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimated that the DFAA could expect to pay out an average of $673-million for flooding alone during each of the following five years.

It’s difficult to quantify how much of the mounting costs can be attributed to bad planning decisions, because the evidence is mostly anecdotal. Prof. Thistlethwaite points to a 2013 storm in Toronto that caused widespread power outages “mainly because they had transformers in low-lying areas that flood.” But other factors are also driving up the damage costs, including a changing climate and the fact Canadians have more valuable belongings – everything from big-screen TVs to luxury cars – than in the past.

Asked to hazard a guess, Mr. Pomeroy estimated the federal government saved between $40-million and $60-million by cancelling the FDRP. “But I think it’s cost us billions since then,” he said.

Stung by these rising costs, governments are once again seeking to download responsibility – this time directly to homeowners. In 2015, insurance for overland flooding became available to Canadian homeowners. Daniel Henstra, an associate professor in the University of Waterloo’s political science department, said both Ottawa and some provinces are eager to withdraw eligibility for disaster assistance from areas where that insurance is now offered. Indeed, this week Quebec Premier François Legault proposed capping assistance to homes that flood repeatedly.

The problem, according to Prof. Henstra, is that most Canadians can’t assess the likelihood their property will wind up under water. “If governments are going to start cutting off people’s eligibility for disaster assistance, they’d better make that risk knowable,” he said. ""And right now, it’s not.”

The insurance industry, on the other hand, is quickly amassing property-level risk data. A few years ago, the Insurance Bureau of Canada hired LexisNexis Risk Solutions and JBA Risk Management to create a national flood-risk model. JBA collected data on snow cover, rainfall, historical river levels, land cover, terrain and flooding across Canada to produce its own flood models and maps. LexisNexis used that to build a software product underwriters can use to decide whether to offer flooding insurance to homeowners and at what price. While imperfect, the insurance industry’s data are far superior to what’s available to the Canadian public – and the quality continues to improve.

Moving toward renewed national flood mapping

Ottawa has in recent years made tentative steps toward addressing the problem. Public Safety Canada took a hesitant early step by introducing its new guidelines for floodplain mapping. And in 2015 it introduced the National Disaster Mitigation Program, a $200-million five-year initiative intended to fund some flood mapping and flood-risk assessments.

Ms. Lyle of Ebbwater said the federal program prompted a recent uptick in flood mapping activity in B.C. But the maps she’s seen often don’t meet existing guidelines, which she already regards as weak. And one legacy of the FDRP’s dissolution is a dearth of professionals with adequate experience and training. She’s afraid much of the new funding will be wasted. ""There’s a lot of very poor mapping being done,” she said.

Prof. Henstra and Prof. Thistlethwaite recently published a paper urging the federal government to follow Australia’s example by creating a national repository of Canada’s existing flood maps. But that’s just a stopgap measure: Canada’s longer-term objective, they argue, should be to map all of Canada using modern techniques and uniform standards – all with a view to reducing risk.

Thanks to technological advances, modern flood maps can accomplish much more than their predecessors. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can produce high-resolution elevation data that can be used to simulate a multitude of different flooding scenarios. Using modern geographical information systems (GIS), it’s now relatively straightforward to combine flood-hazard information with inventories of buildings and other infrastructure, allowing users to understand what’s at risk.

Digital maps can be published online as interactive tools, maximizing their reach and usefulness. Residents of England, for example, can obtain detailed information about their flood risk on this national website.

Catching up to Canada’s peers would not be cheap. A 2014 estimate by the MMM Group estimated each square kilometre of floodplain mapped to modern standards would cost between $7,500 (for rural areas) and $10,500 (for cities). After mapping additional floodplains for which maps are not available, the national tab would come to $365-million. It could take as long as a decade.

But that should be weighed against the costs Canadians have already paid – and will continue to pay – for not knowing where floodwaters will go.

It’s a price Mr. Coochey knows all too well. He spent almost two years and tens of thousands of dollars repairing his basement on evenings and weekends. With Pierrefonds at risk of flooding again, he and his neighbours hauled truckload after truckload of sandbags over the weekend to his street to erect new barriers. He’s watching river-level data and video footage of upstream dams nervously.

There still aren’t any flood maps for his neighbourhood, although he believes new ones are being drawn up. But they didn’t arrive soon enough for the neighbours who moved into a townhouse across the street a few months ago.

“When we started fixing up for the floods, they come up and they say, ‘What the hell is going on?’ We’re going, ‘Well, we’re preparing for another flood,’ ” he said.

""They go, ‘Another flood. What flood?’ ”

In Quebec, the official numbers provided by public security officials remained largely the same Friday as they were Wednesday, with more than 7,000 homes reported flooded, 4,000 properties isolated, and some 10,000 unable to return home due to flooding across the province.

In the nation’s capital, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said he didn’t expect a second wave of flooding for Ottawa and Gatineau. It’s the second bout of major spring flooding in three years in the area, and in 2017 the worst damage was caused by a second round of floods.

Meanwhile, the Canadian Red Cross will disperse $600 in emergency funds to affected homeowners to pay for food, essential supplies, clothing, or a temporary place to stay, at a cost of between $4-million and $6-million. Mr. Goodale announced a grant to provide $2.5-million of that amount.

The town of Bracebridge, Ont., in the heart of the province’s cottage country, said water levels in the Muskoka River are receding, but are still higher than normal.

Health and safety inspection teams fanned out across flood-affected regions of New Brunswick Friday, assessing homes and businesses that are still drying out amid receding floodwaters.

In Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, northwest of Montreal, some of the 6,000 residents ordered to leave after a dike broke on Saturday returned to houses filled with mud-covered detritus and plates of food abandoned during rushed evacuations.

In all, more than 10,000 people remained out of their homes in Quebec on Wednesday, and 7,000 residences were flooded.

Water levels in the corridor along the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers between Montreal and the boundary with Ontario threatened residents all week, but appear to have stabilized for the time being.

In Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Que., about halfway between Montreal and Ottawa, residents were allowed to return home after Hydro-Quebec confirmed the structural integrity of a dam.

An overview of April’s weather helps explain how spring spawned a flooding disaster for several communities from Ottawa to Montreal.

A snowy winter with below-average temperatures meant about twice the normal average amount of snow was still on the ground in mid-April, according to Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin.

Then, temperatures began to warm, remaining above freezing day and night.

Finally, rain was falling every two or three days by mid-month. Montreal alone had 128 mm in April, while it usually gets 82 mm.

“We had ideal conditions for a catastrophe,” Mr. Cantin said.

Political response

Last Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians must talk about how and where to rebuild after floods, and he did not close the door on using federal dollars to help relocate communities facing the recurring threat of severe flooding.

“Once we secure the situation through this spring flooding season, we will have to have significant reflections and conversations on how we move forward,” he said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Quebec Premier François Legault has said the government will offer homeowners $200,000 to abandon homes that flood year after year, after capping flood relief compensation at $100,000 starting this year.

Communities from Fredericton to Saint John were flooded in the second half of April, forcing nearly 1,000 people to evacuate their homes and more than 400 to stay in temporary hotel accommodations provided by the Canadian Red Cross.

Officials said about 70 per cent of the roughly 940 people seeking help from the Red Cross this year also registered for assistance a year ago.

Among 84 closed roads across the province was a stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway between Oromocto and River Glade. Everyone from community volunteers to federal officials and Canadian Armed Forces pitched in to help – even federal fisheries officers were aiding evacuation efforts in Fredericton, Quispamsis and St. George.

“Minor seasonal flooding has always been a way of life in New Brunswick’s southern riverside communities,” The Globe and Mail’s Atlantic bureau chief Jessica Leeder writes. “But when this year’s flood levels began contending with the highs seen in 2018 – a flood billed then as historically destructive – many began wondering how many more years like this they can endure.”

Political response

The province rolled out a disaster financial assistance program Friday, announcing that affected property owners could receive a maximum of $160,000 for structural repairs to private residences, and up to $500,000 for small businesses and non-profit organizations.

The program is not available for those with damaged cottages and recreational properties.

“Together, we made major efforts to plan for, prepare for and respond to the flood,” said Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart. “Residents, volunteers, first responders and the military worked to protect lives and property. Despite that work there was damage.”

Mr. Urquhart said the province was committed to coming up with a better long-term plan to deal with the impact of spring flooding.

Premier Blaine Higgs told reporters during a tour of affected areas that with two floods in as many years, it’s clear climate change is changing flooding frequency, and his new Tory government will take this into account in future planning.

Along with Quebec, Ontario welcomed the help of 2,300 Canadian Forces troops in the past week: filling sandbags, building barriers, checking on waterlogged homes and evacuating residents. That compared to 2,200 deployed outside the country.

Many roads in the Bracebridge area, in Ontario’s cottage country, were washed out by floodwaters as two nearby lakes had water levels that exceed those last seen during serious flooding in 2013.

Kashechewan First Nation has been evacuated, as its more than 2,500 members have been flown to other locations across the province and its leaders continue to call for a permanent relocation.

Political response

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he believes climate change is among the reasons Ontario homeowners are being forced to deal with flooding for the second time in three years.

The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing has activated a disaster recovery assistance program to the Ontario communities of Renfrew County, Pembrooke, Bracebridge and Huntsville.

The program applies to primary residences (though not cottages) and their basic contents, as well as to small businesses, farms and not-for-profit organizations.

The long view

Believing that climate change is the lone issue at play means that we risk missing a major part of the story – and the solution, argues Les Stanfield.

When it comes to facing the risks of large-scale disasters, Wency Leung reports, many people have a hard time envisioning – let alone preparing for – worst-case scenarios.

If floods and forest fires and other calamities can forge a political consensus on the need to combat climate change, then that’s progress, writes John Ibbitson.

There are more floods than ever before, and yet our behaviour toward them in the 21st century is just as irrational as that of our pagan ancestors, who considered them a punishment from a vengeful God, wrote Ian Brown in the aftermath of the floods Hurricane Harvey unleashed on Houston in 2017.

The discourse of flood recovery has to turn to getting those in the immediate flood plain permanently out of harm’s way, writes Glenn McGillivray, managing director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss and Reduction. He is advocating for governments to buy out landowners located on floodplains.

Inadequacies in the mapping of coastal areas are hindering Canadians’ efforts to protect themselves from flood disaster, The Globe’s Matthew McClearn learns.

Engineers and the scientific community need to move more swiftly to design infrastructure that accounts for climate change science, according to one expert.

31,31,FL-2019-000179-CAN,New Brunswick will keep flooding. We have to adapt - Toronto Star,https://projects.thestar.com/climate-change-canada/new-brunswick,"Flooding routinely costs Canadians more than any other natural disaster in terms of property damage. Costs have skyrocketed in recent years. Average insured losses across the country from water-related severe weather events, which include flooding, were $143 million per year between 1983 and 2008, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada. Since 2009 the annual average has increased to $595 million, which doesn’t account for uninsured losses.

Pomeroy said he would like to see Canada put more resources into flood forecasting and prediction by creating a federal flood forecasting system. Currently flood forecasting is done by the provinces. “We’re the only G7 country without a national flood model,” he said, adding that we could “tremendously reduce” the damage from floods with more sophisticated forecasting.

Although the water levels for this year’s flood in New Brunswick were nearly as high as last year, residents were more prepared thanks to earlier warnings and the still-fresh memories of last year’s havoc. But being ready for the flood didn’t stop it from coming.

Figures have not been released on the extent of property damage this year, but at least 1,425 people voluntarily evacuated, according to the New Brunswick Red Cross. The floods also forced dozens of road closures, including a section of the Trans-Canada Highway, which was closed for more than a week.

New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs said during this year’s flood that his province must adapt because “the flooding is going to keep happening.” He has talked about trying to get people out of flood zones and mused about building a spillway in Saint John to mitigate what he called the “Reversing Falls pinch,” where the river is forced through its narrowest passage before flowing into the Bay of Fundy.



“The (question) is how quickly has (climate change) ramped up based on human activity and how quickly has it ramped up based on global change.” —Blaine Higgs, New Brunswick premier

But Higgs, whose government has only been in power since November, has been criticized for his lack of urgency and action on dealing with the root causes of climate change. He is part of the coalition of conservative premiers opposing the federal carbon tax, and in a recent exchange in Question Period he seemed to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that human activity is the driver of climate change. “We’ve seen a climate change activity that has ramped up in the last number of years. I don’t think anyone is going to deny that,” he said in response to an opposition question asking if he believed there was a climate emergency. “The (question) is how quickly has that ramped up based on human activity and how quickly has it ramped up based on global change.”

Higgs’ office did not respond to questions from the Star asking him to clarify what he meant by “global change.”

Higgs adopted the climate change action plan produced by the previous Liberal government under Brian Gallant, and his office says the government continues to work toward implementing that plan. New Brunswick has reduced its emissions by 28 per cent since 2005, largely due to the closing of outdated coal and oil-fired power plants and restructuring in the forestry sector. The province said it’s on track to meet its goal of a 30-per-cent reduction by 2030.

David Coon, New Brunswick’s Green Party leader, said Higgs has focused more on fighting the carbon tax than on fighting climate change, but he hopes the severity of recent floods will inspire more action. “We’ve squandered a lot of time and now we’re suffering the consequences.”

It was still early days in this year’s flood when Greg MacCallum, the director of New Brunswick’s Emergency Measures Organization, issued a stern warning. If you’re thinking of evacuating, he said, you probably should. “This is the time.”

Bruce and Marian Langhus were already comfortably settled into the Days Inn hotel in Oromocto, home to many flood refugees this year. The Langhuses, both retired geologists, moved into the hotel a couple of days before MacCallum’s warning, when the water rose uncomfortably high at their riverfront home and business, The Lang House Bed & Breakfast, in the village of Gagetown, about 40 km downriver from Maugerville.

Like Markus Harvey, the Langhuses are trying to live with the flood. They bought their 139-year-old house in 2015 as part of their retirement plans and didn’t want those plans derailed by a little water. Or a lot of water, as was the case last year when more than a foot filled their main floor. When the water receded, the whole floor had to be gutted and redone. But they figured it would be foolish to simply rebuild what they had before.

“We both had the feeling that last year was the new normal,” Bruce says over coffee at the Days Inn. “We knew it was going to happen again.”","Thu, 06 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://projects.thestar.com/climate-change-canada/new-brunswick/img/og.jpg,"['adapt', 'change', 'water', 'brunswick', 'ramped', 'higgs', 'flood', 'climate', 'days', 'flooding', 'question', 'quickly']", ,flood

“These are greater impacts than anything I’m aware of,” said John Pomeroy, head of the University of Saskatchewan’s Global Water Futures program and lead author on a recently published paper.

Scientists have long warned that Canada’s northwest corner is warming more quickly than almost any other spot on the globe.

Using modelling techniques so detailed they take a supercomputer to process, Pomeroy and his colleagues say they’ve looked more closely than any other researchers into how temperatures are likely to play out over the next century.

They concluded that, if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current level, temperatures in the area around Inuvik, N.W.T. will go up by six degrees on top of the three degrees they’ve already risen.

“It’s hard to imagine what that world would even look like,” Pomeroy said.

Still, they’ve tried.

The researchers project about 70 per cent more snow will fall, but the snow season will shrink by almost a month.

That means spring runoff will more than double, causing the kind of heavy flows and floods that wash out links such as the Dempster Highway, Canada’s only route from the south all the way to the Arctic coast.

They say roads in winter will be vulnerable to a phenomenon in which melted groundwater seeps to the surface, then refreezes into a thick layer of ice.

Permafrost holding up buildings and roads will melt and retreat by another 25 centimetres.

“They’re already seeing some of these problems,” Pomeroy said. “Washouts are a common occurrence.”

The predictions are based on a modelling technique so precise that it can zero in on an area as small as four square kilometres. That’s small enough to predict the impact of thunderstorms that can produce flood-causing rainfall.

Pomeroy said the model’s accuracy has been checked by using it to “predict” past weather. It’s considered accurate if the results from the model match what actually happened.

“The model replicated current weather very accurately.”

The study has major implications for construction in the North.

Last year, the federal government committed $570 million over 10 years for roads and other infrastructure in the N.W.T. The last link of the Dempster, from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk, was opened last summer.

Territorial governments have also been trying to open up areas for oil and gas development.

“It’s going to be a challenge throughout the North,” Pomeroy said.

The Arctic study is only the first region to which the new model will be applied. Researchers at Global Water Futures are working on similar studies for the Rocky Mountains, the prairies and the boreal forest, as well as specific watersheds such as the Bow River flowing into Calgary.

Pomeroy said the impacts will be less if the world is able to reduce its carbon emissions, but right now, that doesn’t look likely.

“This isn’t necessarily the future we’ll have. But it’s the one we’re headed for.”","Wed, 16 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.canadianunderwriter.ca/uploads/2018/11/climate-change-polar-bear.jpg,"['canadas', 'change', 'researchers', 'water', 'northern', 'risk', 'weather', 'world', 'canada', 'theyve', 'flood', 'roads', 'temperatures', 'model', 'pomeroy']", ,flood

The flooding event has already been declared a catastrophe event, meaning at least $25 million in insured damage, Catastrophe Indices and Quantification Inc. (CatIQ) confirmed Friday.

“Due to the relatively low overland flood insurance take-up, a sizeable portion of the economic cost was expected to be uninsured,” said the Global Catastrophe Recap for April, released Thursday by Aon’s Impact Forecasting cat model development team.

According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), the take-up rate for overland flood insurance in Quebec was about 33% in 2017. Statistics for Ontario and New Brunswick were not available by press time.

Flooding occurred in late April and early May. The combination of increasing temperatures and heavy rainfall during the second half of April and extending into May exacerbated the seasonal spring flood situation across the St. Lawrence, Ottawa and St. John River basins, the Aon report said. These river overflows led up to 10,000 homes incurring flood inundation, with most of the worst impacts registered in southern Quebec.

In late April, water from the Lake of Two Mountains burst through a natural dike in Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, inundating the suburb west of Montreal. Many homes flooded in the suburb will be total losses and may not have overland flood coverage, Michel Lachelle, vice president of organizational services in eastern Canada for ClaimsPro/IndemniPro, said May 1. The adjusting firm was involved in about 2,000 flood claims from April in Quebec alone, Lachelle said at the time.

The Canadian Press reported Friday that “water levels are expected to rise again this weekend between Ottawa and Montreal, even as New Brunswick’s floods are effectively over.” The City of Ottawa, which has been in a state of emergency since Apr. 25, confirmed water levels are expected to rise in the city. Water levels to the west of Ottawa (between Mattawa and Lac Deschenes) will also rise this weekend and the peak could exceed maximum levels earlier this spring, and even previous historical highs.","Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.canadianunderwriter.ca/uploads/2019/05/21027002.jpg,"['ottawa', 'water', 'rise', 'levels', 'catastrophe', 'quebec', 'canada', 'overland', 'flood', 'cost', 'expected', 'eastern', 'flooding', 'insurance']", ,none

An ancient river channel that cuts through downtown Calgary is now plugged with concrete. Edmonton’s city-owned utility is ranking drainage basins by risk. Key roads in Fredericton have been elevated to guard against the next deluge.

Cities and utility providers across Canada are girding for a wetter future as rising global temperatures supercharge storms and lead to more frequent and severe flooding.

The preparation, while not entirely new, has gained urgency amid a push by major insurers, bond-rating agencies and governments to reduce the mounting financial and social costs tied to extreme weather. It aligns with an emerging consensus that worldwide efforts to curb emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases are likely to fall short of targets, necessitating costly retrofits of infrastructure to cope with the worsening effects of climate change.

“We have a growing adaptation deficit in Canada, and we’ve got to reverse that trend,” said Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

A new report from the think tank pegs flooding in major urban centres as Canada’s costliest and fastest-growing extreme-weather challenge, with implications for everything from residential insurance premiums to municipal credit ratings.

It cites data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada that show payouts for catastrophic losses jumped from an average $405-million a year between 1983 and 2008 to a yearly average of $1.8-billion since 2009, with flooding accounting for more than half of the increase.

The report is the latest in a series sponsored by major insurer Intact Financial Corp. and is also backed by the National Research Council of Canada and the Standards Council of Canada.

It makes the case for a national framework to limit flood risks in communities by taking into account factors such as local design standards, aging infrastructure and whether a region has a history of extensive flooding.

Some jurisdictions face threats from ice-jamming in rivers, while others are exposed to increased rainfall or coastal flooding. Communities built prior to 1970 are especially vulnerable.

Many were developed on floodplains without positive overland flow routes, for example. That means water can easily pool and flood homes as storms grow more intense and frequent.

“We’re seeing, particularly in these existing areas, the fact that some of the older systems were not designed to be resilient to these types of storms,” said Ron Scheckenberger, a principal at engineering firm Wood PLC.

Downtown Calgary was inundated in 2005 and 2013. The second deluge was the city’s largest since 1932. Fast-rising waters from the Bow River killed five people, forced the evacuation of 80,000 residents and led to as much as $6-billion in financial losses and property damage.

Frank Frigo, a river engineer with that city’s water resources department, said the disaster prompted a collaboration with energy company TransAlta Corp. to boost storage levels in large hydro reservoirs upstream of Calgary’s core.

About $30-million was also budgeted for berms and concrete flood walls, portions of which are designed to stop water flowing along an ancient channel that slices through modern-day downtown. Together the measures are meant to withstand more powerful storms and floods.

“And that’s in part because we learned our lesson very clearly in 2013,” Mr. Frigo said.

Similarly, Edmonton’s EPCOR Utilities Inc. is accelerating plans to deal with risks, with an emphasis on pockets of the city seen as vulnerable to overland flooding. “Those are events that as a utility or a community, you already see,"" said Susan Ancel, EPCOR’s director of storm-water strategies. “What is changing with climate change is they’re happening more frequently.""

In Fredericton, critical sections of road were elevated and storm-water systems reinforced after flooding last year along the Saint John River smashed previous records.

35,35,FL-2019-000179-CAN,What is flood insurance? | Insurance Business - Insurance Business,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/guides/what-is-flood-insurance-117640.aspx,"Types of water damage

There is an important distinction between the main types of events causing water-related losses: flood (explained above), sewer backup, and water damage. Sewer backup can happen when sewer systems experience an influx of high volumes of water from snowmelt or rainstorms, and as a result, wastewater or freshwater then backs up into a home through toilets or drains. Most home insurance policies offer coverage for damage related to sewer backup, though it may also need to be added. Customers can be confused by the difference between sewer backup coverage versus overland flood, which brokers can help address during conversations with insureds about their home insurance policies.

Water damage refers to the sudden or accidental flow of water into a property, and is caused by events not related to flooding or sewer backup, such as a pipe bursting, an overflowing tub, or a windstorm ripping a roof off a structure, causing rainfall to enter. Most home insurance policies also offer coverage for this type of damage, though policies tend to not include water that leaks into a structure, which can, for example, come from cracks in a foundation.

Causes of flood damage

While home insurance policies have not tended to cover the risk of overland flood, an increase in severe weather is causing more water-related damage and insurance claims, and has encouraged the insurance industry to re-evaluate its role in mitigating this risk. In September 2018, a thunderstorm brought 72 millimetres of rain to Toronto with over 70% of it falling during one hour, causing $80 million in insured damage from extensive flooding. The flood event in Windsor in August 2017 was, meanwhile, the largest catastrophic loss for Canadian insurers that year, with insurers paying out claims worth $165 million to those affected and the province of Ontario paying out close to $1.5 million through its Disaster Recovery Fund.

“Water has become the new fire,” said IBC’s director of consumer and industry relations for Ontario Pete Karageorgos. “There’s now more payouts for water than fire, which used to be the top source of claims. We’ve seen this across the province and the nation.” Climate change along with the disappearance of wetlands, aging infrastructure, and unfinished basements have contributed to the surge in claims, added Karageorgos.

From all of the extreme weather events that impact Canadians, flooding is currently the costliest, ringing up millions of dollars in property damage, according to a study from the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo. Using data from IBC, the study also outlined that 58% of catastrophic insurable loss claims from 2008 to 2015 were a result of water damage, demonstrating the rising threat that flood waters pose to Canadians.

What coverage is offered by home insurance policies?

An IBC public opinion poll in 2018 found that almost 45% of homeowners in Canada who have a ground-level home believe they have flood insurance included in their regular home insurance policy, while 26% don’t know if they have it or not. Adding to this, only 37% say they feel confident in their understanding of what is covered in their home insurance policies.

“The fact is that most Canadians are not financially protected against flooding, and they may not realize it,” commented Craig Stewart, IBC’s vice president of federal affairs. “Climate change is not a future threat – it’s happening now. Over the past three decades we have seen an increase in insured damages, and it is up to all of us – the insurance industry, governments and citizens – to do our part in responding to the effects of climate change.”

Brokers can help educate policyholders by first outlining the type of insurance they have in place for their home, condo, or rented property. All-risk or comprehensive policies will protect against all losses except for what’s excluded, which commonly lists flood. If that’s the case, brokers can guide insureds to purchase additional protection for water damage stemming from flooding. Allstate, for instance, offers an enhanced water damage endorsement that includes sewer backup as well as water overflow from a freshwater source, rainfall, or accumulation of ground or surface water.

These add-ons also often take into account the location of a home. Desjardins’ base policy includes protection for water damage events and optional coverage with ground water losses or sewer backup. Customers in low-risk areas can also receive protection for damage caused by overflowing waterways or dam breaks, but those located in medium-risk areas will have to purchase coverage for an added premium. IBC estimates that more than 1.7 million Canadian homes are at risk of flooding, and has worked with the provinces to provide a complete list of flood maps to help consumers and insurers understand the level of flood risk facing properties.","Fri, 30 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://us.res.keymedia.com/files/image/iStock_insurance-flood-house-realestate-coverage_000026727662_Small.jpg,"['water', 'coverage', 'claims', 'sewer', 'flood', 'damage', 'flooding', 'policies', 'insurance', 'backup']", ,none
36,36,FL-2019-000179-CAN,How climate change gave added urgency to a $1.25B project to prevent flooding in Toronto - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-flooding-climate-change-1.5290037,"In May 2017, record-breaking levels in Lake Ontario left much of the Toronto islands underwater throughout the summer.

The following year, a powerful storm hit the city in August, dropping more than 64 millimetres of rain in just a two-hour span.

The rising water washed out roadways, backed up sewage, submerged vehicles, flooded basements, and trapped two men in a north-end elevator filled with six feet of water — leaving them only a foot of air to breathe when they were finally rescued by police.

Before many residents had finished clearing liquid muck from their homes, another round of torrential rain flooded buildings and basements all over again a week later.

Is this the new normal for residents in Canada's largest city?

""We know that storms are getting stronger. They're becoming more frequent,"" said David Kusturin, chief project officer for Waterfront Toronto, the organization tasked with revitalizing the city's waterfront area.

'We know that storms are getting stronger. They're becoming more frequent,' says David Kusturin, chief project officer for Waterfront Toronto.

For Kusturin, bracing for the next crisis is top of mind as he leads a $1.25-billion flood-protection project in Toronto's Port Lands district, a man-made, 100-hectare contaminated chunk of waterfront property.

The massive, years-long effort will create a new river system capable of preventing catastrophic flooding in the surrounding area. And the project becomes increasingly important as the city keeps experiencing record-breaking lake levels and powerful storm systems, which city officials warn could get worse thanks to climate change.

For Toronto, preventing the next potentially disastrous flood is increasingly urgent. And it's a reality facing many Canadian communities as they try to brace for the impacts of a changing climate in the years ahead.

A city on alert

Three months after last year's double whammy of storms, flooding was on city officials' minds yet again as representatives from all three levels of government attended the groundbreaking for the Port Lands flood-protection project in November.

The project aims to prevent flooding throughout a nearly 300-hectare chunk of land surrounding the mouth of the Don River — a flood plain that's around the same size as the downtown core — while allowing for new development.

Dubbed ""one of the most ambitious construction programs in Toronto's history"" by Waterfront Toronto, the effort was more than a decade in the making.

""It was being developed for the 100-year storm,"" explained Coun. Paula Fletcher, whose riding includes the Port Lands. ""But we are certainly having storms that are very big, more often.""

There's growing concern among municipal officials that one-in-a-century rainfall events, such as Hurricane Hazel in 1954, could happen more often.

(CBC) The two graphs above are based on what the Climate Atlas of Canada calls a high-carbon scenario, which assumes that world greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase at current rates through the end of the century. (CBC)

Research, including a 2011 city report, suggests mid-latitude cities such as Toronto could experience fewer storms in the future overall, but those that hit could be more extreme.

""This may result in more severe weather occurrences, including extreme rain and snowfall events, as well as damaging winds,"" the report said.

This expanse, currently filled with heavy machinery, will one day be the site of a one-kilometre river valley in the Port Lands. The new river will connect with the Don River. (Lauren Pelley/CBC News)

Data from the city's resilience strategy, released earlier this year, also suggests the annual precipitation is expected to jump from around 790 millimetres to more than 850 millimetres by the year 2051.

And when it comes to heavy precipitation days — where more than 20 millimetres falls in one go — the number each year could jump from just over 6½ days to close to eight in the same period.

That's a particularly concerning trend for the Port Lands. The area is a huge expanse of concrete, built overtop wetlands once forming the natural mouth of the powerful, 38-kilometre-long Don River, which weaves through the city from the north.

During a major storm, water rushes down the river, and when it hits the Port Lands, an industrial area now mostly known for crumbling roads and dilapidated buildings, the water has nowhere to go, forcing it to surge into homes and businesses to the north and east.

""As soon as the first few drops of rain fall on the Don River watershed, it's like turning a tap on — the river starts flowing right away,"" said river science specialist Joe Desloges, a professor of geography and earth sciences at the University of Toronto.

""It's not just the fact you have an urban river that's very responsive to any weather event,"" he said. ""Now you've added the extreme event of climate change on top of that.""

Preventing disaster

To prevent a future disaster, hundreds of workers are spending roughly six years creating a new river valley.

""We are extending the Don River and creating new areas for the flood waters,"" Kusturin said.

Decked out in a hard hat and reflective vest, he's standing on ground that didn't exist this time last year.

The rocky area on the northwestern edge of the Port Lands was created by shipping in around 240,000 cubic metres of shale bedrock from other construction sites.

Along one stretch of the rebuilt shoreline, water flows from Lake Ontario through a grate — designed to keep out invasive fish species — and into a manufactured pond filled with dead trees, which will slowly decompose and create a new aquatic environment.

This area of the development will provide five hectares of land and shoreline, which will one day feature park spaces and wetlands — returning the area to its natural state while creating an elevated, protected area for new homes and businesses.

The project's goal is to protect a huge chunk of land from flooding by transforming the Port Lands from a concrete jungle to a river valley. On the northwestern edge, new land is being created by shipping in around 240,000 cubic metres of shale bedrock from other construction sites. Workers are also building a river to stretch across the area and collect surging storm water from the mouth of the Don River to the north.

Further east, an expanse currently filled with heavy machinery will be the site of the one-kilometre river valley.

The winding route will start at the mouth of the Don River at the north end of the Port Lands and stretch west, creating a new island ecosystem to the south.

What that means is river water will gain another entry point to Lake Ontario alongside the man-made Keating Channel, which requires water to make an unnatural, hard right turn before it reaches the lake.

Set to open in 2024, the river valley will allow flood waters to take a meandering course through a natural environment — and the banks will be reinforced to withstand fast-flowing waters if there's a big storm.

Workers using massive drill rigs are building the concrete supports for the river.

""We've been under construction on this part of the project for about 12 months ... the work that's happening all around us is constructing cut-off walls to act as structure when we excavate the river,"" Kusturin said.

The 38-kilometre-long Don River, seen here alongside a stretch of Toronto's Don Valley Parkway, winds from the Oak Ridges Moraine all the way south to Lake Ontario. (Lauren Pelley/CBC News)

That excavation will involve moving more than a million cubic metres of soil to build up the valley walls, elevate the land, and create wide swaths of parkland, he said.

When the project is finished, those involved hope the Port Lands will be transformed from a concrete wasteland to a new community, balancing natural and urban environments, providing a new space for living and leisure — and, most crucially, keeping the water at bay.

While there are years of work ahead, one climate change expert says Toronto's billion-dollar effort could inspire other cities.

Canada is warming at two to three times the rate of the rest of the world, said international climate change specialist Elliott Cappell, Toronto's former chief resilience officer, which means regions across the country need to be bracing for the impact of rising temperatures.

But the specific approach depends on the area, he said.

Most of the country's population lives in major cities, which could face issues like basement flooding and dangerously high summer heat in older apartment towers. In the coastal regions, rising sea levels pose a threat. In the North, the big concern is permafrost melting.

For Toronto, Cappell said, a single waterfront project won't change the grim reality — in the decades ahead, the city is going to get ""hotter, wetter and wilder.""

""We need to make climate change part of everything we do,"" he said. ""It has to be part of how we maintain our roads, how we plan our city blocks and buildings, how we maintain parks.""","Mon, 30 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5296234.1569421401!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/toronto-port-lands-drone-shot.jpg,"['added', 'project', 'port', 'flooding', '125b', 'torontos', 'lands', 'waterfront', 'change', 'water', 'climate', 'toronto', 'city', 'gave', 'area', 'river', 'prevent', 'urgency', 'don']", ,flood

Once again, from coast to coast to coast, 2019 proved to be another record weather year for Canada.

Here are the top 10 weather events for Canada in 2019, compiled by Phillips.

1. Another record-setting Ottawa River flood

In the No. 1 spot is the spring flooding of the Ottawa River.

It was a perfect set-up along the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers: Temperatures were below normal for seven straight months — from October 2018 to April 2019 — meaning the ground never experienced the gradual thaw that often comes with spring, nor could it absorb any falling rain. Upstream, the heavy snowpack was unable to thaw, and the region experienced several rounds of heavy rains over five weeks.

On May 1, the Ottawa River swelled, breaking the previous record in 2017. More than 6,000 residents were flooded out of their homes in Ottawa and Gatineau, Que., and hundreds more from Pembroke, Ont. to Sherbrooke, Que. not to mention the flooding of precious farmland. As a result, two people died.

2. Active hurricane season as predicted

The 2019 hurricane season was a particularly active one, just as the Canadian Hurricane Centre and the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration had both forecast.

Post-tropical storm Erin was the first to reach Canadian shores, on Aug. 29. It triggered flash flooding, though it was a bit of a blessing to farmers who had endured a dry summer until then.

But it was Dorian that will be most remembered. The powerful Category 5 hurricane produced winds of 300 km/h over the Bahamas and lingered, almost at a standstill, for 24 hours. Eventually, it made its way to Nova Scotia, transitioning to a post-tropical storm with winds of 155 km/h. It knocked out power to nearly half a million people across Atlantic Canada. The Insurance Board of Canada estimated that Dorian caused $140 million to insured property, with most of it in Nova Scotia.

3. (S)no-good Prairie fall

The West is no stranger to early snowfalls, but 2019 turned out to be a dinger. At the end of September, Calgary experienced a harsh, early, snowy surprise. Over four days, 32 cm fell in the city, the greatest depth of snow left on the ground in 65 years.

Southern B.C. wasn't left out of the snowy mess; 35 to 50 cm of snow was dumped across many mountain passes. And a few weeks later, it was Manitoba's turn. From Brandon to Winnipeg, snow blanketed the area. States of emergency were declared in 11 communities and more than 6,000 people were evacuated from First Nations communities.

4. A brutal FFFFebruary in Canada

February is often thought of as the harshest month of winter, and 2019 certainly lived up to that expectation.

Though the planet was experiencing an El Niño event — a warming in a region of the Pacific that typically brings milder weather to parts of Canada — the Arctic air took an icy grip on the country and wouldn't let go.

In B.C., along the coast, reaching into the Interior, it was 9 C below normal. In Calgary, February was the coldest month in 83 years. And southern Alberta could just forget about the Chinook: in 2019 it was 14 C colder than normal in the region.

Meanwhile, Toronto received a year's worth of snow in January and February alone. And Atlantic Canada? The region experienced its coldest February in 25 years.

5. Record heat continues in Arctic

Unfortunately, nothing changed in the Arctic.

Once again, 2019 proved to be another record warm year. In September, the Arctic sea ice reached its yearly minimum at 4.15 million square km, the second-lowest on record, tied with 2007 and 2016.

""The North is the most important story,"" Phillips said. ""It will be the most important story of the century.""

And it wasn't just the climate — it was the weather itself, he said.

On June 2, an EF-1 tornado was spotted near Fort Smith, N.W.T., just the fourth confirmed north of 60 degrees latitude in Canada. In mid-July the Canadian Forces Station in Alert, Nunavut, recorded a searing temperature of 21 C — 14 C warmer than average. And on Aug. 10, there were several lightning strikes within 500 km of the North Pole, a true rarity indeed.

6. Too dry early, too wet later on the Prairies

While weather may just be an inconvenience to most people, for farmers it can mean the difference between putting food on the table or not.

And in the Prairies, farmers had to deal with some truly inconsistent weather in 2019.

Even before the growing season began, farmers struggled with some of the driest conditions since record-keeping began 133 years ago. Edmonton had its driest spring on record, Regina had its driest March and Winnipeg its driest first half of the year with a measly 91 mm of precipitation (its average is 235 mm from January to June).

But once the rains started, they didn't stop.

Edmonton recorded 55 days of rain through June to August, tying for the most number of days since 1881. And it wasn't just the rain: Alberta and Saskatchewan had an early, mid-September snowfall with more of the same — including rain — in October. As a result, many farmers lost large amounts of their crops.

7. How the Grinch stole...Halloween?

Sadly, instead of a treat, many children this Halloween received a nasty trick.

Unfortunately, for kids in the East, it was donning a snowsuit, carrying an umbrella or, well, no Halloween at all.

It was wet and windy in southern Ontario: the town of Stratford received the most with 109 mm of rain. In Port Colborne, winds topped 129 km/h.

Meanwhile, in Chibougamau, Que., 30 cm of snow fell. And there was snow and rain across Newfoundland.

But it was a delayed Halloween for 20 municipalities across Quebec, including Montreal, as the festivities were postponed by a day.

8. Spring missing in the East

Spring means longer days, the sight of green grass, budding trees and warmer weather. But that just wasn't the case in much of Canada in 2019. And once again, it was the dreaded Polar Vortex who squelched our fun.

Across the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Basin, it was the coldest spring in 22 years. By the end of May, less than five per cent of Ontario farmers' crops had been planted.

In April, the Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia had endured almost triple the month's rainfall with some of the coldest soil temperatures in two decades.

In New Brunswick, Moncton's average May temperature was almost three degrees colder than average. And once again, farmers felt the crunch across the region.

9. Saint John River floods again

Persistent rain and snow and a lack of thaw was behind the flooding of New Brunswick's Saint John River once again.

At the New Brunswick-Maine border, the river had its largest stream flow in 67 years. In Fredericton, the river reached its peak at 8.37 metres, breaking 2018's record, and coming in second highest after 1973.

It was particularly difficult for residents as they desperately tried to protect their property. Canada's military was eventually called in to assist after 1,500 people were evacuated. Ultimately, 16,000 homes and buildings were damaged by floodwaters with 145 roads were shut down.

And while the province is no stranger to floods, Phillips points out that the last two floods — both the 2018 and 2019 ones — were considered to be once-in-a-hundred-year floods. However, the past year saw less of an impact than the year previous.

""There are lessons to be learned from some of these [stories], too, that we realize that the 100-year storm is becoming the 10-year storm,"" Phillips said. ""So we need to do things differently. We just can't sit there and [say] 'Oh,well Mother Nature is going to get us.' We need to do something about it.""

10. Fewer fires, more burning

After an intense fire season in 2018, it was a fairly quiet fire season in 2019, with fires down 40 per cent across the country.

Roughly 422,000 lightning strikes were recorded in B.C. — which experienced its worst season in history in 2018 — far surpassing the average of 266,000. But the good thing is, it was accompanied by wet weather.

Though there were fewer fires than in 2018, the 2019 season was still a memorable one for Alberta and Ontario. (Ben Nelms/CBC)

But it was Alberta that broke from the trend, where fires consumed an area roughly 14 times that of the average. It was the second-worst season on record. By the end of May, 10,000 people had been evacuated from their homes.

Ontario also experienced severe forest fires. In northwestern Ontario, forest fires caused poor air quality in several First Nation communities for almost two weeks, resulting in 2,500 residents being evacuated.

In the end

Phillips said there's a message to be taken away from these weather events.

""There's no region that I would say had the worst weather,"" said Phillips. ""It's not new weather, though … it's the same old weather that our grandparents talked about, but it's just that the statistics are different: the frequency, the intensity, the out of season, out of place, anything like that that just seems to make it different than it was.""

And he reminds Canadians: ""Mother Nature holds all the trump cards.""

In March, however, Federal Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale announced that Environment Canada would restart the project in collaboration with the private sector.Updated floodplain maps, which would reflect current changes in climate and topog­raphy, would allow the government, developers and insurers to take pre-emptive action to save homeowners from building in vulnerable areas and save them millions of dollars in water damage costs.However, according to Dr. Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, flood maps could actually do more harm than good to consumers.“Floodplain maps are politically toxic – nobody wants to take the lead in developing them and releasing them publicly,” Feltmate said at the 2017 Flood Risk Summit. “Governments that would support developing floodplain maps would take a lot of heat from current homeowners, who may be now identified as being in a floodplain. All of a sudden you have a $1 million home that is stigmatized and devalued down to half its current value, where it’s unsellable.”As controversial as the decision is, it provides an opportunity for MGAs and the industry as a whole to play a more active role in protecting properties from flooding.“There isn’t anything we can do about the unpredictability of the seasons, which is why it’s so important that brokers help their customers understand what they could be exposed to and assist them with choosing the right coverage for their needs,” said Barry Owen, Aviva Canada ’s assistant vice-president of personal lines propositions. “Brokers now have several markets offering flood insurance, but not all products are created equal, so they need to understand the differences.”","Thu, 07 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://us.res.keymedia.com/files/image/flooding-labelledforreuse.jpg,"['floodplain', 'homeowners', 'save', 'maps', 'environment', 'canada', 'updated', 'feltmate', 'flood', 'coming', 'understand', 'current']", ,flood

Federal biologist Francis Lavoie says it's important to dry wet walls and belongings within 48 hours, but that's not always possible in the case of flooding.

""You need to remove anything that has been too wet for too long that's not dryable,"" he said.

""Cushions, carpet, drywall, mattresses, box springs, stuffed toys, insulation material -- everything that has been exposed to water and cannot be dried -- needs to be thrown away or discarded.""

He said plastic toys and some furniture can be cleaned up if it is just surface mould.

Lavoie said often by the time people can get back into their homes, mould is already growing.

""Mould is the most common indoor air contaminant in Canada.""

He said people in homes with mould are more likely to have eye, nose and throat irritations, coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.

Lavoie said it's important a cleanup be thorough, because water can seep under floors and into walls.

""We usually recommend using professionals for such extensive work. In the case of a flood, it's a lot of clean-up,"" he said.

For those doing their own clean-up, Health Canada does not recommend using bleach. Instead it says dish soap or spray soaps work just as well to clean up mould, and don't have the kind of strong vapours that can burn your eyes or irritate your throat.

The Canadian Red Cross is distributing free clean-up kits to homeowners affected by flooding.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health, said anyone doing their own clean-up needs to take proper precautions.

""Wear rubber boots, gloves, eye protection and a face mask when cleaning and disinfecting. Always wash hands with soap and clean water after clean-up activities even if wearing gloves,"" she said.

Russell recommends having wells tested if they may have been impacted by floodwaters.

Lavoie said homeowners should not drop their guard even long after the clean-up has been done.

""Keep an eye on the rooms where there was mould. If you see that it is coming back, that may mean it wasn't cleaned up properly,"" he said.

Lavoie said many of the health symptoms related to mould are similar to those of allergies, so people can often ignore them if they believe they're just the result of pollen or other springtime allergens.

The International Lake Ontario—St. Lawrence River Board, a joint Canada-United States body, warned Tuesday that people who live near parts of the Ottawa River, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River should prepare for “major coastal flooding."" The warning comes on the heels of one of the wettest Aprils on record that saw Lake Ontario rise 44 centimetres. Flooding has threatened hundreds of residences in the region, and more than 130 homes were evacuated in Gatineau, Que. across from Ottawa as of May 4. Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. Île Mercier, a small island off Montreal, was submerged by floodwaters, while Rigaud, a town in southwestern Quebec at the junction of the Ottawa River and the Rigaud River, declared a state of emergency.

“Water levels are going to go higher, because the inflows are still coming in more than we can release,” said Gail R. Faveri, an engineer with Canada's national hydrological service inside Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the secretary of the joint Canada-U.S. board. ""It's just too much water everywhere"" Inflows, such as snow melt from the upper reaches of the Ottawa River, continue to mix with a high volume of rainfall, adding to the torrent of water, she said.

Faveri’s board is in charge of regulating the flow of Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River. The main control structure for this is the Moses-Saunders Power Dam near Cornwall, Ont. It’s one of four dams between Lake Ontario and Montreal. The board has been adjusting the flow every day, sometimes twice a day, since the beginning of April, she said, to try to provide maximum flood relief to people who live along the shoreline of Lake Ontario and downstream. The dam hasn’t seen this much action since 1993, the last time Lake Ontario was this high. But the system can only handle so much. “This rainfall has been coming up from the Gulf of Mexico, swinging along and hitting Lake Erie, hitting Lake Ontario, going down the St. Lawrence river valley, and in the process hitting Ottawa,” she said, where snow melt has been mixing in with the river. “It’s just too much water everywhere.” Up to 70 millimetres of rain is expected this weekend in Toronto and surrounding areas, the same amount that usually falls over the entire month in the region, according to a Global News meteorologist. Scientists say extreme weather like flooding is likely to become more frequent in some regions due to climate change. Changing climate conditions are likely being caused by human activity, scientists say, and could be mitigated by reducing global consumption of fossil fuels, deforestation and changes to land-use. Faveri said it was difficult to draw a direct connection, but climate models do point to more extreme weather.","Thu, 04 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/img/2017/05/03/pch101403668.jpg,"['canadas', 'ottawa', 'water', 'river', 'ontario', 'emergency', 'hitting', 'lake', 'climate', 'st', 'lawrence', 'flooding', 'dam', 'board', 'heart']", ,none
41,41,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"From Fires to Floods, Extreme Weather May Be Shaping Canadians' Views on Climate Crisis - TheTyee.ca",https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/09/12/Fires-Floods-Canadian-Climate-Crisis/,"With an election looming and climate change a burning issue, will Canadians’ experience of extreme weather shape the outcome?

Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives seem to be betting it won’t. Others are counting on biblical floods and the clouds of smoke from wildfires to push voters into the arms of parties promising radical action.

New research by EcoAnalytics, a non-profit initiative of university researchers and Canadian environmental charities, suggests the latter might be nearer the mark; but it’s complicated — and that many are allowing preconceptions to cloud their judgment.

Our surveys show that Canadian public opinion is on the move. From 2011 to 2018, the percentage of Canadians who believe there is solid evidence of climate change rose from 80 to 90 per cent, and the belief that human activity causes climate change rose from 40 to 65 per cent. Scholars consider the latter a “gateway” belief, because those who hold it tend to support actions and policies to reduce carbon pollution.

Concerns about climate change and the environment are rising. In October 2018, the environment and climate change ranked first and third in the minds of a random sample of 1,200 respondents who were asked: “What is the most important issue facing Canada today?” Usually they have ranked much lower.

But is experience with extreme weather responsible for this increase?

The answer is complicated. Data from the EcoAnalytics and the Université de Montréal show that Canadians are increasingly likely to cite unusual weather as a reason to believe that global temperatures are on the rise.

However, whether people are actually changing their beliefs based on extreme weather is less clear. In fact, the evidence is also consistent with people selectively interpreting local weather in a way that reinforces their pre-existing beliefs about this increasingly political topic.

We examined the attitudes of Canadians, for example, according to their degree of confidence that “the temperature on Earth has been increasing” or “has not changed.”

We then asked respondents a question about temperatures in their region the previous summer and compared the responses with the actual Environment Canada records.

What we found is revealing. When average summer temperatures were unusually low (two degrees below the 30-year norm), nearly all respondents accurately reported lower temperatures in their local area.

But as the average summer temperature trended upward to four degrees above the norm, those with a high level of confidence in the reality of climate change were almost certain to recall a warmer summer. But only 30 per cent of climate change skeptics accurately recalled a warmer summer.

In other words, the less you believe in climate change, the more likely you are to ignore climate signals like warmer temperatures.

Psychologists and political scientists refer to this as “motivated skepticism” — a phenomenon exploited by some politicians who play to the cognitive biases inherent in human decision-making to justify inaction on climate change.

We also wondered whether experience of other forms of extreme weather alter our beliefs and behaviour. To find out we looked at perceptions of flood risk.

We examined whether people who reported a recent experience of flooding believe they live in an area at risk of flooding. Again, the results are telling. Among a majority — 77 per cent — of Canadians who reported no recent flood experience, 81 per cent said they did not live in an area prone to flooding. Yet, of the 23 per cent who had recently experienced a flood, no less than 52 per cent said they did not live in an area vulnerable to flooding.

As more intense flooding, fires and droughts occur, however, people may be connecting the dots. Recent research, based on 2018 data from New Brunswickers who had experienced a record-breaking flood event, shows them more willing to discuss climate change adaptation and, yes, mitigation — and alter their attitudes and behaviours.

To Win, Politicians Must Woo Voters with Action on Climate read more

New Brunswickers with recent experience of flooding also showed higher levels of belief, and agreement that climate change is “a very serious problem” and already harming Canadians. They were also 10 per cent more likely to say they would purchase additional insurance — at both $10 and $20 per month. And, across the sample as a whole, those who reported recent flood experience were 10 per cent more likely than others to strongly support a carbon tax.

We cannot say whether these effects are large, long-lasting or causal, but they point in the same direction.

Though some Canadians may interpret extreme weather through the prism of prior beliefs and values, actual experience of floods and, possibly, other climate-related natural disasters, might increasingly drive us to update our beliefs about the severity of climate change, alter our behaviour and support policies that seriously address this global threat.

Politicians would be wise to take heed.","Thu, 12 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/09/11/CalgaryFloodCopCar.jpg,"['recent', 'change', 'views', 'shaping', 'experience', 'weather', 'floods', 'fires', 'cent', 'crisis', 'canadians', 'climate', 'flood', 'extreme', 'flooding']", ,flood

43,43,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"Rain-on-snow flood risk to increase in many mountain regions of the western U.S., Canada - Science Daily",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180806162726.htm,"Flooding caused by rain falling on snowpack could more than double by the end of this century in some areas of the western U.S. and Canada due to climate change, according to new research from the University of Colorado Boulder and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

The greatest flood risk increases are projected for the Sierra Nevada, the Colorado River headwaters and the Canadian Rocky Mountains -- places where residents are no strangers to flood concerns. Conversely, lower elevations in coastal regions of California, Oregon, Washington and maritime British Columbia could see decreases in rain-on-snow flood risk.

The findings were published today in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Rain-on-snow events vary widely in timing and scale but can cause costly and damaging flooding as rapid snowmelt triggered by heavy and prolonged rainfall converge in a cascade that can overwhelm downstream rivers and reservoirs. In 2017, California's Oroville Dam nearly failed catastrophically due to such an event, leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people and $1 billion in infrastructure damages.

""Rain-on-snow events can be intense and dangerous in mountainous areas, but they are still relatively poorly understood,"" said Keith Musselman, lead author of the study and a research associate at CU Boulder's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR). ""We can infer a little bit from streamflow, but we want to get better measurements and model more of the variables involved.""

To study the past, present and potential future of rain-on-snow events, the researchers turned to a state-of-the-art weather modeling dataset developed at NCAR. Known as CONUS 1, the dataset contains weather simulations across the continental U.S. in the current climate and a warmer future based on projected climate trends. The enormous data trove -- which took NCAR's Yellowstone supercomputer more than a year to compile -- offers unprecedented detail and resolution.

""This high-res dataset allows us to resolve mountains in granular fashion and examine the factors that combine to melt the snowpack when a warm storm comes in and hits cold mountains like the Sierra,"" Musselman said.

The authors found that in a warmer climate, less frequent snow-cover at lower elevations would decrease the risk for rain-on-snow flood events in areas like the U.S. Pacific Northwest. By contrast, at higher elevations where winter snow will still accumulate despite climate warming (such as in the High Sierra and much of the Rocky Mountains), rain-on-snow events could become more frequent due to increased rainfall that might once have fallen as snow. The events will also become more intense.

The rain and melt produced during rain-on-snow events is projected to increase for a majority of western North American river basins as rain rather than snow affects more mountain watersheds, increasing the corresponding flood risk by as much as 200 percent in localized areas and potentially straining existing flood control infrastructure.

""We were surprised at how big some of the projected changes were,"" Musselman said. ""We didn't expect to see huge percentage increases in places that already have rain-on-snow flooding.""

The findings represent an important first step toward better understanding rain-on-snow flood risk in the context of anthropogenic climate change, which could significantly shift the timing and extent of future flood regimes.

The researchers hope that continued investment in snowpack monitoring networks and efforts such as NASA's Airborne Snow Observatory will provide additional ground information, allowing hydrologists and climate scientists to verify their models against observations and better inform flood risk assessment now and in the future.

The study was co-authored by NCAR researchers Flavio Lehner, Kyoko Ikeda, Martyn Clark, Andreas Prein, Changhai Liu, Mike Barlage and Roy Rasmussen.

Preparing for future floods

After an exceptionally snowy winter, Quebec municipalities are again watching the forecast closely, fearing another round of flooding.

In some communities hard-hit by floods in 2017, officials are also thinking long-term, preparing for future disasters.

""As a mayor, I took a position that climate change will have an effect on flooding,"" said Normand Marinacci, mayor of Montreal's L'Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève borough, which includes Île Mercier.

His borough was among the worst-hit areas of Quebec two years ago.

Île Mercier was covered in flood water in May 2017. Situations like this may become more frequent with climate change, experts warn, and it's time to plan for flooding. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)

""There was a lot of stress, and it wasn't easy,"" Marinacci said. ""When you see water pouring in your house, it's very difficult for those people.""

It's something Marinacci hopes never to see again. Several homes in the borough were so badly damaged, they had to be demolished.

The province said it would not permit those homeowners to rebuild, because of the high risk of future flooding.

Earlier this month, the borough took another preventative step when it passed a bylaw extending the no-build zone. The bylaw prohibits anyone from building or expanding on land that could flood within the next 100 years.

""Why take a risk? Why give a permission to a person to build in a zone that is at risk?"" Marinacci asked.

Guilbault opposes the bylaw, which prevents some of her neighbours from renovating their existing houses. It also means some vacant properties can no longer be developed.

She's relieved she was allowed to fix her home and stay.

""There is a cost in terms of stress that goes with it, because the water isn't far,"" she said. But in her eyes, it's worth it.

""I'm attached to this place because it's closer to nature.""

In her case, Guilbault said the damage to her house was valued at $150,000, and the province compensated her for part of that.

Now that she has added pumps, rebar-reinforced concrete and lifted the building's foundation, she is confident the house can withstand another flood.

Taxpayers, insurance companies on the hook

The debate around building on flood plains is happening in communities across the country, as local governments try to balance residents' attachment to their homes and the desire to live near water with the realities of future flooding.

""Even with a stable climate, flooding has always been the major natural disaster in Canada and because of climate change, it's going to increase,"" said Alain Bourque, executive director of Ouranos, a Montreal-based climate change research organization.

""It is the most important natural disaster to watch for.""

The Insurance Bureau of Canada has been working with the federal government to try to ensure Canadians are better prepared.

The IBC said insurance companies are losing money from payouts after natural disasters and that taxpayers are also on the hook after events such as flooding, due to public infrastructure repairs and the cost of compensating homeowners.

""You may be able to put a home on stilts or absolutely encase it, but your support services are also at risk,"" said Craig Stewart, president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

""We know that municipalities rely on the tax dollars from developing in these attractive places, but we need to resist the urge to put people in harm's way.""

Adapting to a changing climate

Plumbing contractor Olivier Ishii-Landry is also planning for more floods in the future.

He saved his own home on Île Mercier two years ago by outfitting it with a network of pumps and generators. He said his business now focuses mainly on that kind of prevention — what he calls ""climate change adaptation.""

""It's going to happen more and more often to more and more people,"" he said. ""'I'm there to protect and keep dry a lot of people's most expensive investment.""

Pier-Luc Cauchon, who has lived in the borough all his life, has circulated a petition against the borough's bylaw expanding the no-build zone because he wants residents on the island to have the chance to adapt.

""A lot of people are frustrated,"" he said. ""If you build in a flood zone with the right regulations, you won't receive damage.""

Still, Marinacci, the borough mayor, said it is a necessary change.

45,45,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Canada 'much closer' to national flood program: IBC - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/canada-much-closer-to-national-flood-program-ibc-1004161513/,"The industry is making progress on getting a national flood insurance program, but a key challenge is getting all provinces, territories and Ottawa to agree on how it should work, the Insurance Bureau of Canada’s CEO suggested Tuesday.

Unlike Britain and the United States (which have Flood Re and that National Flood Insurance Program respectively), Canada does not have a national backstop for overland flood insurance.

“In Canada, with the federal government, 10 provinces and three territories – we have to get them all to somehow agree to a national program, which has not been an easy task. We are much closer to that today than we were, say, five years ago,” IBC CEO Don Forgeron told a room full of industry professionals at Swiss Re’s Canadian Annual Outlook Breakfast.

He was asked by Canadian Underwriter whether Flood Re – which the British government rolled out in 2016 – is a good model for Canada to follow.

“For many years I have been saying we are the only G7 country without a flood program, but the other six didn’t work,” Forgeron said at the breakfast, held at One King West in Toronto’s financial district. “I am going to change that now because the British one is probably the closest to a functional model we have been able to find.”

He did not go so far as to recommend that Canada put something similar in place.

With Flood Re, the British government is trying to have the vast majority of properties at low flood risk subsidize a small minority of properties at high risk. Every home insurer in the U.K. must pay a levy towards flood Re. On top of that, when a primary insurer covers flood for a given home, Flood Re then charges that primary insurer a premium tied to the home’s council tax band, which in essence is a tool used in Britain to put a value on the property for tax purposes.

“We have been over to the U.K. to look at Flood Re model and the federal government has also been over to look at it,” Forgeron said Tuesday during the Swiss Re breakfast. “In all the jurisdictions we have looked at, where they fail is with the high risk properties. That’s where the vast majority of their losses come from, and the question becomes, how do you price that? If it’s not full risk-based pricing, who pays it? And how is it paid? That’s usually where these programs fall down and that’s what the federal government has asked us to take a look at in terms of some sort of high-risk pool.”

For its part, the United States brought in the controversial National Flood Insurance Program in 1968. In order to qualify for flood insurance under NFIP, the property must be in a community that has joined the NFIP and agrees to enforce sound floodplain management standards.

NFIP owed the federal treasury US$30 billion by 2017, at which point $16 billion was forgiven. But NFIP borrowed billions more to cover losses from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico respectively in late 2017.

Some critics say properties insured by NFIP should pay a premium that more closely reflects actual risk. A law intended to do exactly that was passed in 2012 but later repealed after politicians complained some constituents saw huge increases in their home insurance rates.

In Canada, managing flood risk is more important with the increasing frequency of severe weather events, Forgeron said Tuesday.“These events are no longer affecting only areas that have traditionally been exposed to risk. Twenty per cent of Canadian households some vulnerability to floods and that figure is increasing.”

IBC urges governments to spend more on educating consumers about their risk of water damage and to improve land use planning.

“Too many communities are still making bad decisions and everyone acts shocked when their low-lying subdivision wakes up to three feet of water.”","Tue, 02 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.canadianunderwriter.ca/uploads/2019/04/iStock-683452326.jpg,"['federal', 'properties', 'program', 'forgeron', 'closer', 'risk', 'ibc', 'nfip', 'national', 'canada', 'flood', 'insurance']", ,none
46,46,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Are sandbags effective? A look at the popular flood-prevention tool - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/are-sandbags-effective-a-look-at-the-popular-flood-prevention-tool-1.4401429,"For centuries, residents of flood-prone areas have looked to sandbags to stave off rising waters. Flood management experts say that while it's easy to understand why sandbags have become the first line of defence, they may not necessarily be the best one. Here's a look at sandbags and their effectiveness:

DO SANDBAGS WORK AS FLOOD-PREVENTION TOOLS?

It depends entirely on the type of flood. Tamsin Lyle, principle engineer at British Columbia-based flood management company Ebbwater Consulting, said sandbags can be very effective in situations where they won't have prolonged exposure to water. Examples she cited include flash floods or holding off ocean waves that only reach impacted areas at high tide. But Lyle said sandbags lose much of their value once they become saturated with water, making them relatively ineffective in prolonged floods such as those currently unfolding in much of eastern Canada.

WHY ARE SANDBAGS SO POPULAR?

Lyle said the primary benefits of sandbags lie in their low cost and ease of use. Nearly anyone armed with a shovel and the right materials can construct a temporary flood barrier for next to nothing, she said, adding that pre-filled sandbags can also be stockpiled at home with relative ease. According to the Water Security Agency of Saskatchewan, optimal materials include burlap or plastic sacs filled with relatively heavy rather than gravelly soil. These factors, Lyle said, confer other ""intangible benefits"" that contribute to the sandbag's popularity. ""It makes people feel like they're doing something,"" Lyle said of filling and deploying the barriers. ""It brings communities together. You feel like you're fighting the flood.""

WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES?

In addition to their lack of durability in longer-term flood conditions, Lyle said sandbags can easily spring leaks if not assembled or deployed properly. James Blatz, a University of Manitoba civil engineering professor who studied the effectiveness of sandbags, said their drawbacks become even more evident once floodwaters have receded. The bags are generally made of materials that are not resistant to UV rays, ensuring they degrade quickly. Once sand contaminated by dirty floodwaters are added to the mix, Blatz said the result is a single-use product that quickly makes its way to the landfill. He recognizes, however, that these disadvantages won't carry much weight for people in the midst of a flooding crisis. ""When there's a flood happening, you don't have time to sit and chat with the academics,"" he said. ""You put whatever you can in front of the water and do your best.""

WHAT CAN MAKE SANDBAGS MORE EFFECTIVE?

The federal government's guide to reducing flood damage contains numerous tips for effective sandbag deployment. It suggests digging a trench to support the sandbag dike, as well as covering it with some form of plastic sheeting to further limit its permeability. Saskatchewan's Water Security Agency and other municipal sites urge users not to fill homemade sandbags up beyond the halfway point and to ensure they overlap one another as the dike is built. Blatz echoed that advice and stressed the importance of tamping bags down with one's feet to further compact the sand inside.

ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES TO SANDBAGS THAT MIGHT WORK BETTER?

Yes, there are several, though they can't be deployed for the same low cost as sandbags. Lyle said an increasingly popular option is a sort of large rubber tube known as an aquadam that fills up with floodwater and creates a barrier in the process. Another option gaining popularity in Europe, she said, involves sets of interlocking blocks that can be stored in off-seasons and assembled between pillars installed outside a home. Lyle said both tools outperform sandbags, adding they also have the advantage of being reusable. But she said a crucial part of flood prevention involves governments and municipal planners being more proactive in ensuring communities are ready to react if floodwaters rise.","Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4401445.1556637765!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['tool', 'popular', 'water', 'work', 'wont', 'effective', 'look', 'sandbags', 'materials', 'flood', 'floodprevention', 'blatz', 'floodwaters', 'lyle', 'security']", ,none
47,47,FL-2019-000179-CAN,The Co-Operators Offers Storm Surge Cover for Homeowners Across Canada - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2019/01/07/514083.htm,"Montreal-based Co-operators is offering storm surge insurance for homeowners in Quebec and Manitoba, which completes the company’s product rollout to Canadian homeowners from coast to coast.

Co-operators described its comprehensive water insurance as the only product of its kind in Canada, which provides protection from the most common causes of residential flood and water damage including storm surge, overflowing lakes, rivers and creeks, and sewer or septic backup.

Storm surge, which includes rising water levels and waves caused by storms, presents a significant flood risk, especially in coastal regions where extreme weather patterns have intensified with the changing climate, said Co-operators.

“Overland flooding has been identified as the most pervasive and costliest cause of damage to Canadian homes, yet most are inadequately protected against this growing risk. As a co-operative, it’s our priority to protect the financial security of Canadians. This is why we first introduced overland flood insurance in Canada,” said Rob Wesseling, president and CEO of The Co-operators. Co-operators is a multi-product insurance cooperative with more than C$42.5 billion (US$31.8 billion) in assets under administration.

“Today, we are thrilled that this product is available to all Canadian homeowners, even those at the highest risk, adding another layer of protection and providing peace of mind for those who need it most,” he added.

According to a study by Partners for Action Network, 94 percent of Canadians living in high-risk flood zones are unaware of their risk. To get a personalized flood assessment and find out about available coverage, Canadians can visit water.cooperators.ca.

In 2015, The Co-operators said it became the first Canadian insurer to offer overland flood insurance in Alberta and expanded this coverage to Ontario in 2016. It is now the only insurer to offer Canadian homeowners protection against damage caused by storm surge, the company said.

More than a quarter of a million Canadians are currently covered by the organization’s Comprehensive Water product, Co-operators noted.

48,48,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Read “I discovered water damage in my home. Will insurance cover me?” - MoneySense,https://www.moneysense.ca/spend/insurance/home-insurance/home-insurance-coverage-leaks-flooding/,"A: While water damage is almost always the same—destroyed floors, mouldy drywall, and potentially destroyed electrical and heating systems—the cause can significantly change whether or not the damage is covered by your insurance.

Turns out, how water enters your home dictates whether or not the damage will be paid by you, out of pocket, or covered by your home insurance policy.

This should cause all homeowners concern. Why? Because flooding happens so frequently. Setting aside the incidental floods, such as pipes breaking or washing machines leaking, natural floods, such as those caused by snowmelt runoff or raised river banks, occur fives times as often as wildfires. In fact, natural overland floods are the second most frequent natural disaster in Canada, according to Dan Sandink, director of research at the Institute of Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR).

Sadly, residents in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick are now intimately aware of how devastating a flood can be to both property as well as to someone’s financial well-being. In April 2019, CTV News calculated that 6,425 homes had been flooded in Quebec alone. Another 3,508 were surrounded by water. Another 21 Ottawa homes were voluntarily evacuated, while 80 roads in New Brunswick had been closed.

According to Canadian Forces, 2,000 troops were deployed to Eastern Canada to help with flood efforts, and more than one million sandbags were used in the nation’s capital, Ottawa.

This doesn’t bode well for homeowners across Canada, who will eventually feel the burden of rising premiums to cover insured losses. This is on top of the $1.9 billion in insured losses that Canadians already sustained in 2018—the fourth-highest amount on record, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

What’s worse is knowing that a standard homeowners’ policy (or tenant insurance) doesn’t provide coverage in the event of flood damage. While government relief may be available for uninsurable damage, that relief is often slow to materialize and insufficient to cover the cost of repair, leaving families to pick up the pieces.

You may be able to purchase flood insurance—known as overland coverage—depending on whether or not you live in a flood-prone zone. And even if it is available in your area, however, you must also purchase sewer back-up coverage, which is typically far more available.","Mon, 07 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.moneysense.ca/wp-content/themes/moneysense-2019/assets/images/apple-touch-icon.png,"['relief', 'water', 'natural', 'available', 'homeowners', 'floods', 'canada', 'flood', 'discovered', 'cover', 'damage', 'insurance']", ,none
49,49,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Canada's best province for flood risk management - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/catastrophes/canadas-best-province-flood-risk-management-1004133390/,"Five years after Albertans lost billions as a result of record floods, Ontario leads the nation when it comes to keeping properties out of high-risk areas, a catastrophe loss expert contends.

“Ontario has been most aggressive at trying to make sure that there is no new construction in a flood zone,” Paul Kovacs, founder and executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), said Tuesday in an interview.

Five years ago Tuesday, flooding started in southern Alberta, inundating downtown Calgary. The flooding caused total economic losses of about $6 billion and insured losses of nearly $2 billion, Insurance Bureau of Canada reported.

Alberta is in “better shape” than it was five years ago when it comes to managing flood risk, said Kovacs, who is also president and CEO of Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation (PACICC).

In Canada, property flood risk is partly attributable to lax zoning regulations that allow development on low ground where floods are inevitable.

“There is quite a number of houses and developments in Canada that are on floodplains,” Robert Harrison, chairman of the Insurance Brokers Association of Canada, told Canadian Underwriter earlier.

“Ontario has been a leader in terms of stopping new development [in flood zones] for more than 60 years now,” Kovacs noted Tuesday, suggesting part of this was due to Hurricane Hazel. That storm caused heavy flooding in the fall of 1954, especially on floodplains of the Humber River in the Toronto area.

Hurricane Hazel killed 81 people and caused damage of more than $180 million, wrote Zainab Moghal and Shawna Peddle in a paper, At the Front Lines of Flood: How Prepared are Ontario Communities?, published by the University of Waterloo.

The City of Mississauga “routinely refuses“ applications for development in floodplains, Mississauga city planner Michael Hynes told the Ontario Municipal Board in 3085 Queen Frederica Inc. v Mississauga (City), a ruling released Mar. 8, 2018.

That ruling was over a settlement between a developer and the city arising from an application to convert an existing 11-storey apartment building into a condominium. The development, first developed in 1969, is along Little Etobicoke Creek, about eight kilometres south of Toronto International Airport.

Every property on Queen Frederica Drive was flooded after a rainstorm hit the western Greater Toronto Area in July 8, 2013 , witnesses told an OMB hearing in February. The storm caused Canada’s fourth most expensive insured catastrophe, with industry-wide losses reaching nearly $ 1 billion.

The OMB approved the settlement agreed to by 3085 Queen Frederica Inc., the City of Mississauga and the Toronto Region Conservation Authority. As part of the settlement, the developer agreed to dozens of conditions – including “installation of measures to protect openings in the building from flooding and to ensure that owners of condominium units are provided with a flooding manual, engage in evacuation drills and receive annual updates relating to flooding matters,” OMB member Justin Duncan wrote in the ruling.","Wed, 20 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.canadianunderwriter.ca/uploads/2017/11/iStock-471860809.jpg,"['told', 'canadas', 'caused', 'province', 'mississauga', 'risk', 'best', 'canada', 'settlement', 'management', 'flood', 'city', 'toronto', 'development', 'flooding']", ,none
50,50,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Manitoba spent big money to fight flooding. Could its solutions work in Eastern Canada? - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-spent-big-money-to-fight-flooding-could-its-solutions-work-in-eastern-canada-1.5117566,"As parts of Eastern Canada struggle with record flood levels, Winnipeg is unusually dry. That's partly because of a long, slow spring melt, but also because of major investments in dikes, dams, diversions — and something called Duff's Ditch.

It raises the question: Could Manitoba's flood-protection solutions work elsewhere in Canada?

To answer that, we first have to understand the recent history of flooding and infrastructure investment on the Red River, one of the few in North America that flows north.

In 1950, the Red River inundated one-eighth of Winnipeg. In low-lying areas, the water was 4.6 metres deep. It forced 100,000 residents from their homes.

""You only have to look at the pictures from 1950 to know that having that happen again to the city of Winnipeg wasn't an option,"" said Jay Doering, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Manitoba.

So, after more than a decade of debate and studies, Manitoba constructed a 47-kilometre, $63-million ditch, known as the Winnipeg Floodway, to divert floodwater and spit it out safely back into the river on the north side of the city. Now known as the Red River Floodway, it's also sometimes called Duff's Ditch, after then-premier Duff Roblin.

Pumping stations and 114 kilometres of dikes were also built within the city.

See how bad the flooding got in Manitoba in 1950 CBC News 0:58 That flood eventually led to the creation of the Red River floodway, which has saved the province billions 0:58

In the 1970s, the province constructed a $30-million diversion channel and reservoir on the Assiniboine River to keep water out of the city from the west.

Then came 1997 and the Flood of the Century. It was substantially larger than the 1950 flood, but resulted in far less property damage because of the flood-control measures in place. Still, it strained the floodway's capacity.

The overflowing Red River became the largest in North America, covering an area the size of Prince Edward Island.

Doering says it was another wake-up call ""that we probably didn't have the level of protection that the city of Winnipeg needs.""

So, another $630 million was spent to expand the floodway. It's now meant to defend the city against a one-in-700 year flood.

Before 1997, eight communities in the Red River Valley were protected by ring dikes. After that flood, an additional eight were built.

""Whether it's climate change or whether it's just normal events, the reality is we have these events and they're not going to go away, so we need to look at options for protecting communities so that the damages are minimized, the anguish is minimized,"" said Chris Hamblin, deputy mayor of Morris, a town south of Winnipeg along the Red River that's surrounded by a ring dike.

""When you see the damages and the millions of dollars to get those people back to their normal life states, you know the investment isn't as big as it is it seems.""

The main highway connecting the United States and Winnipeg was raised to protect it from flooding.

Homeowners were told to rebuild in accordance with flood-protection standards or they would not be eligible for compensation after any future floods.

The thinking was: ""We can't keep compensating. We need to be proactive on managing floods in the Red River Valley,"" Doering said.

There have been two major floods since 1997. Both times, Winnipeg stayed largely dry.

As of 2013, the floodway had saved an estimated $32 billion in damages, according to the Manitoba Floodway Authority and a 2014 TD Economics report.

That means it has paid for itself 40 times over, and counting.

""That would be a large amount of money in roughly 1960 dollars, and at the time, Premier Duff Roblin took a lot of heat for those investments. But when we reflect back now on the billions and billions of dollars that they have mitigated, obviously it was a visionary move,"" Doering said.

""We have come a long way in terms of being proactive with our floods, keeping the communities and keeping the city of Winnipeg protected.""

But could it work elsewhere?

Last week, New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs raised the idea of constructing a type of floodway at the south end of the St. John River. He's looking into a preliminary assessment to determine whether a spillway would make sense.

""We can do something in the Saint John area to spill more water out into the Bay [of Fundy],"" he told CBC News.

""It could be a tunnel pipeline that would be able to connect around the falls and directly to the bay.""

Area residents were ferried to their homes in Darlings Island, N.B., on Saturday. The area is cut off when the Kennebecasis River, a tributary of the Saint John River, rises above the road leading to the community. (Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press)

A spillway could work structurally, says Slobodan Simonovic, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Western Ontario who spent much of his career in Manitoba and lived through the 1997 flood.

However, he says, cities in New Brunswick may not have enough population to justify the infrastructure cost that has made economic sense in Winnipeg.

""That kind of cost-benefit ratio would be very different.""

The Ottawa River Valley, meanwhile, has a different set of problems to consider: too many communities to protect and hydropower development that conflicts with flood control. Any changes would also affect the St. Lawrence River.

""I don't think that a single structural solution will work in that particular area,"" Simonovic said, especially considering there are also jurisdictional complications in dealing with two provinces, Ontario and Quebec, and two countries, the U.S. and Canada.

Cities like Montreal can get some useful ideas from Manitoba's network of dams, dikes and diversions, but ""finding the best way of managing the system and co-ordinating among different players will be definitely the solution,"" Simonovic said.

Calgary is also dealing with flood mitigation and protection projects.

Moving to higher ground

With flood threats becoming more common and more costly, Simonovic says the only solution for some cities may be to move people out of flood plains.

What's important, he says, is politicians should not wait for the next disaster, but ""use the time in between to come up with the solutions that will be minimizing the future impacts.""

Jay Doering agrees. He says at-risk communities need to be forward-thinking.

""They need to ask what level of compensation is being paid out? What's the cumulative compensation and what might we do now to be proactive in order to offset that?

""Because I would suggest to you that compensation alone for flood after flood after flood is not a plan.""

Last week, Quebec Premier François Legault said homeowners with flood-damaged properties would be eligible for up to $100,000 in compensation. But beyond that, the government would offer a maximum of $200,000 to buy the property.

""We cannot [offer] every year compensation to solve problems, but only on a temporary basis,"" he said. ""We really need incentives to move the people when it's happening every year or almost.""","Wed, 01 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5117853.1556680323!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1138761766.jpg,"['money', 'manitoba', 'red', 'eastern', 'flooding', 'spent', 'flood', 'floodway', 'winnipeg', 'fight', 'city', 'doering', 'work', 'compensation', 'river', 'big', 'solutions', 'canada', 'need']", ,flood
51,51,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Climate change and poor planning are fuelling more floods. Here's what we can do about it - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/climate-change-floods-1.5115447,"For most people, the early days of spring conjure pleasant thoughts: blue skies, singing birds, sunshine, warmth and blooming flowers. But for many, the spring thaw is a time of dread. It's a time of floods.

Over the past few weeks, communities in New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec have made headlines as severe flooding forced many people to abandon their homes.

The spring flood season isn't anything new to Canada: the Red River consistently floods in Manitoba, as does the Bow River in Alberta.

But what's different, experts say, is that spring flooding is becoming more common and will likely get even more severe in some parts of the country.

""The extreme rain, precipitation events that are occurring now are going to continue and indeed are going to get worse going forward for sure,"" said Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

""Because a certain proportion of that which is driving these events is climate change itself. So we're getting more storms of greater magnitude, of greater intensity [and] higher volumes of water coming down over shorter periods of time.""

Feltmate is also the chair of the federal government's Expert Panel on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience, which has been examining the role climate change is playing — and will continue to play — across the country.

But there are other factors to consider, including how we're using our land.

In cities, for example, all that concrete helps prevent water from being absorbed quickly.

Rural areas may look greener, but land used for agriculture has changed the landscape and prevented natural vegetation that might have otherwise absorbed melting snow and rainwater.

Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, works with groups across the country on adapting to climate change. (uwaterloo.ca)

""Here in Ontario — and the trend is the same right across Canada — we've lost 73 per cent of the original, natural infrastructure that was here 100 years ago: forests, fields, wetlands, marshes,"" Feltmate said. ""That's disappeared. That's either been paved over or turned into agricultural development such that when the big storms hit, water isn't absorbed quickly on these new surfaces.""

David Phillips, senior climatologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada, said that while Canada has experienced these kinds of floods before, for some areas, it's been the level of extended cold that's made all the difference.

In Ottawa, for example, the city has had six months that have been colder than usual. So, instead of a warmup that might see some gradual melting, the snow is melting all at once, and much of that water has nowhere to go.

According to the recently released Canada's Changing Climate Report, increasing precipitation levels are expected in the winter months rather than the summer, which could make spring flooding even worse.

Next steps

While leaders may be discussing climate change, there needs to be more action, many experts say.

""At the level of communities, what we should be doing is looking at how we can use things like berms, diversion channels, holding ponds, cisterns, bioswales … to direct water to safe locations where it can be stored or discharged downstream,"" Feltmate said.

We should also be looking to preserve natural infrastructure. For example, along riverbanks, it's wiser to keep trees, bushes and grasses that have been there historically to hold back the water rather than to clear it for development.

Residents in low-lying areas of Rigaud, Que., are dealing with floods for the second year in a row. (CBC)

But of particular concern is the fact that most flood plain maps are out of date, allowing houses to be built in flood-prone areas.

""We don't yet have flood plain maps that are updated across the country,"" said Deborah Harford, executive director at the Adaptation to Climate Change Team at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C. ""We should put more pressure on the federal government to produce those, because those impacts are happening already.""

Some governments have offered incentives to encourage people to move away from areas at risk of flooding.

In High River, Alta., the provincial government bought homes that were damaged in the 2013 floods and built $100 million worth of berms, floodgates and dikes to protect against any further flooding.

But solving the problem is not as simple as buying out homeowners, Harford said.

While some larger municipalities may be able to offer incentives or the opportunity to buy back land, that may not be so for smaller communities, she said.

""Certain locations where it's going to be untenable, the question is how do we deal with the property loss that owners would face?"" she said. ""That is a national discussion.

""There is a central question, which is: what are we going to do about the places we can't keep saving?""

All levels of government need to work together to determine the best means of planning for the future of a changing climate, she said.

""The goal posts are continually moving, every year. The events are getting worse and bigger. It's time to stop talking about climate as though it's a separate thing and just mainstream it through all of our urban planning.""","Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5114751.1556576553!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/que-flooding-20190427.jpg,"['change', 'water', 'fuelling', 'poor', 'heres', 'going', 'river', 'floods', 'canada', 'feltmate', 'climate', 'flood', 'planning', 'spring']", ,none
52,52,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Flood risk awareness: Dialogue around “re-location” has arrived - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/climate-change/flood-risk-awareness-dialogue-around-re-location-has-arrived-1004165991/,"Canadian P&C insurers believe they are starting to make headway with national and provincial governments on the climate change adaptation file. This has put the industry in the thick of a relatively new political dialogue about re-locating Canadians who live in high-risk flood plain areas.

Silvy Wright, president and CEO of Northbridge Financial Corporation, has just become chairwoman of Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), a national trade association representing Canada’s private home, auto and business insurers. In a wide-ranging discussion about IBC’s priorities during her upcoming term, Wright noted that the P&C insurance industry will continue to support the work of national, provincial and territorial governments in advancing the cause of climate adaptation.

“Climate change is a societal challenge, not just an industry challenge,” Wright said. “IBC is focused on working with the government to drive increased investment in climate change resilience. That includes developing a national flood plan.”

Working on the flood plan is at the centre of identifying areas in Canada at high risk of flooding. Wright said four key points have emerged from discussions with governments and other stakeholders about updating the plan.

“We have to begin raising awareness about high-risk areas,” Wright told Canadian Underwriter. “We believe we still have consumers who are not aware of that risk and, unfortunately, are left in dire situations when a catastrophe event [like a flood] occurs.

“Second, we have to deal with re-location of property in high-risk areas. This isn’t just the insurance industry; we are working with governments to support that.

“The third key item would be to advocate for a moratorium on new buildings in flood plains.

“And of course, investing on needed infrastructure. Using our [P&C industry] data and our mapping gives governments the data intelligence to make proper decisions and help consumers manage their risk.”

IBC president and CEO Don Forgeron says governments now see the P&C industry in a leadership role when it comes to adaptation to climate change. He noted that the industry has been talking about climate change for 30 to 40 years, but the issue has become prominent over the last decade.

Severe weather has caused almost $1-billion worth of insured catastrophe losses annually for most of the past 10 years. This year, as Wright noted, the industry has paid out $600 million for damage losses due to severe weather – and there has not been a single major catastrophe yet this year.

The industry is continuing to find success working with governments to improve the country’s flood maps, Forgeron said. Such maps are important for showing which Canadian areas and properties are at high risk of flood. That in turn allows Canadians living in high-risk flood areas to protect themselves — or even move out.

Flood maps are at the root of a new political dialogue – echoed within the insurance industry – about whether damaged property in flood zones should be rebuilt in the same high-risk areas, or simply re-located into to a lower-risk area.

“[Re-location] is a new concept in Canada,” Forgeron said in a conference call with Wright. “At other times, it was about rebuilding everybody in the same flood plain, where they’ve been flooded in three out of the last four years. Now we are talking about actually moving them out of there. I think that’s an indication of how serious the issue has become.”

From New Brunswick to Quebec, through Ontario, Manitoba and to British Columbia, Canadians have been coping with flooding or bracing for torrential downpours.

And yet, flood insurance is still a relatively new concept in the Great White North.

Overland flood insurance, which covers damage from water flowing above ground and seeping in through windows, doors and cracks, only became widely available in the last couple of years, according to Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

Until then, Canada was the only country in the G8 group of advanced economies not to offer overland insurance. That was because flooding used to be such a rare occurrence in this country, said Feltmate.

But that all changed in June 2013, when heavy rainfall in Calgary turned into the worst flooding in Alberta’s history.

Floods became more frequent in Canada and the problem is only going to grow worse due to climate change, Feltmate told Global News.

“Part of the reason we’ve seen insurance companies offer flood coverage is that there’s a demand now because people are seeing that from the Calgary floods [onwards],” Pete Karageorgos of the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), which represents Canada’s private home insurers, explained.

The average damage from severe weather stands at $400 million in Canada per year. That’s up from $100 million before 2008-2009, according to Karageorgos.

Urban flooding alone resulted in over $20 billion in damage over the ten-year period between 2003 and 2012, according to the federal government.

Here’s what homeowners need to know:

Who should be worrying about flooding? Pretty much everyone across Canada, according to Feltmate.

You don’t need to live close to a creek, river or lake to be at risk, he said.

Flooding often happens because cities’ sewage systems become backed up and start overflowing into basement drains, Feltmate noted.

Flooded basements replaced house fires as the most expensive source of home insurance claims in the 1990s, according to a study on climate change adaptation that Feltmate chaired in 2012.

Homes located in downstream and low-lying areas are particularly exposed, Feltmate said.

Make sure you’re covered

There are two major types of insurance against flooding: regular flood insurance and overland flood insurance.

Story continues below advertisement

Provinces don’t regulate these types of insurance so pricing depends on the provider, your address and your property, said Feltmate.

“The first tip or trick is to shop around,” said Karageorgos.

“It’s a very competitive environment […] so don’t assume they operate in the same way,” he added.

It’s also important to read the fine print and be aware of whether there is a cap on the amount of damage covered, said Feltmate.

A flooded basement costs an average of $42,000 in major cities – and not all insurers will cover 100 per cent of the damage, he noted.

Flood insurance

This kind of coverage has long been available in Canada but it isn’t necessarily included in regular home insurance. Many Canadians don’t know that they’re not covered when floods happen, Feltmate said.

Much attention has focused on the need for overland flood insurance in the aftermath of the Calgary floods. But plain-vanilla flood insurance is what you need to protect you from the risk of sewer back-up.

Overland flood insurance

Not every insurance provider offers coverage for overland flooding, said Karageorgos, so that’s another reason to take a look at multiple home insurers.

If you aren’t covered or can’t get insurance

Across the country, many Canadians are finding out that their homes either can’t be insured against flooding or that premiums are so high they can’t afford to buy coverage, Feltmate said.

This is mostly the case for older homes built in areas where the risk of flooding has become extremely high, he explained.

Homeowners who don’t have insurance coverage can still make a claim with the federal Emergency Management Office of the Public Safety Minister.

Citizens can apply for Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements, which are funded by the federal government but distributed by the provincial government.

How to protect your home from flooding

Flooding is very stressful and disruptive even if you have insurance. There are several easy and low-cost steps you can take to reduce that risk in your home:

Story continues below advertisement

Make sure all downspouts discharge at least three metres away from your home’s foundations

Ensure sewer grates are open and clear away debris like dirty and leaves

Place plastic covers over window wells

When it’s raining, go out and inspect your house to see if water is pooling anywhere around it. If it is, regrade the perimeter of your home so that water flows away from it

Install one or more sump-pumps, which remove water that accumulates in the so-called sump basement, generally found in basements. You should also have 10 hours’ worth of battery backups to make sure they will continue to work even in case of a blackout, which often happens in conjunction with flooding

You might also need a backwater valve, which helps to prevent flooding from sewer backup. These valves cost between $2,500 and $3,000 but many municipalities offer large subsidies for homeowners who decide to buy one

More information can be found on the Public Safety Ministry’s Flood Ready webpage.

How to mitigate the damage

What do you do if you’ve already been flooded? The first step is to document what’s been damaged.

“A lot of times individuals, if they’re faced with flooding in their basements, they start throwing things out. And if they do have insurance policies that cover them for damage they want to document what is part of the claim… furniture, appliances, carpet or hardwood flooring,” Karageorgos said.

It’s also useful to inventory your basement beforehand, he explained, so you can check if your policy will have enough coverage for all the things that could be damaged – as well as accounting for disposal and replacing.

According to the CBC, Saint-Marie regularly experiences high rainfall in the spring, but this year’s downpour surpassed normal levels, resulting in flood damage that cut electricity and stranded residents in the area.

With flood waters now receded, Bimbo Canada, Vachon’s owner, said more than 75 bakery employees and other Canadian associates are assessing damage and working to get the Saint-Marie facility up and running to resume pastry and cake production. Operations are scheduled to recommence in eight weeks if employee safety and quality assurance measures can be met.

“We deeply appreciate everyone who has supported us through this challenging time — our dedicated associates, our management team at the bakery, our customers, our loyal consumers, numerous public safety municipal, provincial and federal partners, and the Sainte-Marie community,” said Marie-Ève Royer, vice-president, national sales, Bimbo Canada. “We are committed to the community and appreciate the skills of our Sainte-Marie associates. We are a proud contributor to the local and regional economies and intend to remain so in the years to come.”

Over the next few days, Bimbo Canada will meet with Vachon employees to update them on the plant’s status and answer any questions they may have. In addition, the company said it is working with union representatives and the Canadian government to support personnel.

Bimbo Canada has partnered with the Red Cross to raise funds for those affected by the flooding and will be matching donations.

In Grand Forks, B.C., a community about 520 kilometres east of Vancouver, homes are submerged in brown, murky water. The Regional District of Kootenay Boundary said fire rescue technicians have rescued more than 30 people by boat in the town.

Two days of intense rain caused the flooding in Grand Forks. It’s the worst the region has seen in 70 years, roughly two feet (0.6 metres) higher than ever recorded.

“I thought we were safe here because we’re higher than the river, but it was like a sneak attack,” said Derek Fillion, who was evacuated as the water began to surround his home.

On Saturday, Fillion was able to visit his home for the first time since he was forced to leave. He trudged through knee-high water to rescue a computer he needed.

“You almost can’t recognize the place from when we moved in,” he told CTV Vancouver.

Residents are being reminded to keep all sand bags in place as unseasonably hot temperatures across southern and central B.C. are expected to melt some of the snow pack and bring an second surge of flooding to the area.

The Salvation Army arrived in Grand Forks on Friday in hopes of providing some reprieve. Ginny Kristensen, a major with the organization, said a reception centre has been established to provide a safe place for displaced residents to sleep.

“There is some fear, with the warm weather. They’re not sure what’s going to happen in the next few days. Is there snow pack going to melt? Are the rivers going to rise again?” Kristensen told CTV News Channel on Saturday.

The general feeling among residents, Kristensen said, is “guarded optimism.”

“It ranges from total despair to almost a guilt where their homes have not been hurt,” she said.

Osoyoos prepares for melt

In Osoyoos, B.C., roughly 125 kilometres west of Grand Forks, Mike Campol, the acting mayor for the town, said between 60 and 80 homes have been evacuated due to flooding. Two hotels in the town have also been impacted.

“We’re doing all we can and making the best of it,” Campol told CTV News Channel. “The majority of people are all hands on deck, helping those who need help. This is typical of Osoyoos.”

“Everyone seems to be getting the help they need from those that are able-bodied and who aren’t affected. Whether it be local businesses, residents, local trades. Everybody’s been helping each other out.”

Campol said sandbags are being delivered around the clock and residents have been helping to place them where they’re needed most.

The worst might be yet to come for Osoyoos as temperatures this week are expected to hit 30 C, meaning snow on the nearby mountains should begin to melt.

“We may not see the effects of that melt until the middle of next week,” said Campol. “So potentially we could see levels rise again by the middle of the week.”

Residents are warned to leave flooded areas, avoid fast-moving waters, and not drive through waterlogged areas.

That will come when the adrenaline fades, the military packs up, the waters recede and they're left with the damage.

Hundreds of people in Ottawa and Gatineau, Que., faced a hard choice after the devastating floods in 2017: stay on the floodplain and rebuild the homes they loved, or pick up and move elsewhere.

Many chose to remain, to use their insurance, disaster recovery aid and/or help from family and friends, and start construction.

For some, that work was still ongoing or had only just finished when the waters rose again this year, two springs later, shattering records kept by the organization that has monitored the Ottawa River basin for more than a century.

See the Ottawa-Gatineau flooding from above CBC News Ottawa 1:44 CBC News captured aerial footage of the recent flooding in Gatineau, Que., and Clarence-Rockland, Ont. 1:44

Many of those records had just been broken in 2017.

David Proulx in Gatineau's Masson-Angers sector is part of one of the hundreds of families hit twice by floodwaters in the National Capital Region. They decided to renovate after what happened in 2017, and finished the majority of that work only a month and a half ago.

Then, the water rose to about half a metre on the main floor of their home.

""It's discouraging because you went through it [before]. You did all the renos, you worked for it, and then you ask yourself, 'Why did I go through all that, why did I work so hard for all this if this happened?'"" the father of two asked the CBC's Hannah Thibedeau on April 30.

""We are tired, physically and mentally, and I think that's the worst feeling right now, is knowing that you still lost the house after all that.""

But the idea of leaving now — even after this second flood and grim warnings about climate change and an increasing number of environmental disasters — just doesn't appeal to him.

""I guess we start all over again,"" he said. ""...We have to. I have a family, and family is first, you know? And this is their place.""

Renaud Arnaud's family made the opposite call in 2017, accepting a provincial government buyout and demolishing the home they'd bought only four months before the flooding hit Gatineau's Lac-Beauchamp sector, taking the heavy loss on the new mortgage.

Now, they live in a fourth-floor apartment, far above any flooding danger.

Standing Thursday on the land where his former house once stood, Arnaud repeatedly broke down. When the waters receded two years ago the family initially thought they could stay, but as the costs grew and grew, they decided to leave.

""Beyond the financial loss, which is significant, it's your home. It's the neighbourhood where we planned to raise our kid, and everything that you dreamed of is gone. You close a chapter of your life, and then you have to move on. So we moved on,"" Arnaud said.

""And I think it was the wise decision. When I see the water back again, we probably made the right decision by moving on.""

In his family's experience, the worst part of the whole ordeal was having to decide what to do once the water had receded.

""The flood is something, but it is the aftermath that, in our experience, was the most challenging.""

Final tally to come

It will be weeks before the cities of Ottawa and Gatineau have recorded all the damage, and residents and governments have tallied their bills. Water levels are expected to remain high for the next two weeks at least, and could even rise again if there's a significant amount of rain, the Ottawa River Regulation Planning Board said Friday.

In Ottawa, 155 homes had been evacuated and more than 1.6 million sandbags had been distributed as of Friday.

In Gatineau, 111 homes had been evacuated, 923 damaged and more than 885,000 sandbags had been distributed as of Friday.

After the 2017 flooding, the province of Ontario approved 108 applications for assistance under the Disaster Recovery Assistance Ontario program in defined parts of Ottawa, Clarence-Rockland, Alfred and Plantagenet and Champlain.

In total, the program has provided about $3,469,000 in those areas for people who couldn't receive other forms of help, such as insurance.

In nearby Renfrew County, 89 of 114 applications were approved and about $1,725,000 has been doled out.

So far this year, the program has been activated for Renfrew County, including Pembroke, Ont., and a section of Bolton, Ont. It's expected that more areas will be added.

When flooding ravaged parts of southern Alberta in 2013, banks and other lenders took notice.

“We would be asked on every deal, ‘Is it in the flood zone?'” Mike Boyle, president of Calgary-based The Mortgage Group, told Global News.

Lenders didn’t want to get involved with addresses that turned out to be in the disaster areas, he recalled.

Six years later, with the flood a “distant memory,” that’s no longer an issue, according to Boyle. But he worries about homeowners in regions like southeastern Ontario and Quebec, where rivers seem to be overflowing with alarming regularity.

“You can’t get a mortgage if you can’t get insurance,” he said.

Speaking from the Ottawa-Gatineau area, which is experiencing its second major flood in the span of 24 months, licensed insolvency trustee John Haralovich shares the same concern.

“We have seen lenders not agree to renew the mortgage,” said Haralovich, a senior vice-president at debt consultancy firm MNP.

Those have been rare cases so far, he said, but that could change.

“In 2017, they said (the flood) was a once-in-100-year occurrence, and two years later, it’s happened again,” he said.

Homeowners who discover they can’t continue their insurance coverage may also hear from banks that they won’t keep servicing their mortgage once it comes up for renewal, he added. With no insurance to protect the collateral, mortgages on homes in flood-prone areas may become too risky for mainstream lenders, he said.

Several experts who spoke to Global News are concerned that a growing number of Canadians may find themselves facing this issue after the latest round of spring flooding.

The trouble with overland flood insurance

Some 1.7 million Canadian households, or roughly 20 per cent of the population, are exposed to the risk of so-called overland flooding, in which the water flows in from windows, doors and cracks in the walls, usually from an overflowing river or lake.

The good news for them is that overland flood insurance, which didn’t exist for residential dwellings during the 2013 Alberta floods, is now increasingly available in Canada.

The bad news is that no kind of private insurance is meant to cover homeowners from natural disasters that keep happening.

READ MORE: ‘You have a fear of more rain’ — Flooding haunts homeowners for years, study finds

Between eight and 10 per cent of Canadian homeowners live in areas where the likelihood of recurrent flooding is so high that insurance coverage is not available or would come at an “outrageous” cost, Robert Harrison, chairman of the Insurance Brokers Association of Canada, told Canadian Underwriter.

Story continues below advertisement

But even homeowners who have been able to buy overland flood coverage can’t necessarily rest easy. If they ever make a claim on that coverage, it is “entirely possible” that they will see their coverage reduced or their insurance costs increased at renewal, said Anne Marie Thomas of InsuranceHotline.com. And if there is a high enough risk that they will be flooded again, they may not be able to continue their coverage at all, she added.

Insurance is meant for events that are “sudden and accidental,” said Pete Karageorgos of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

“You don’t necessarily meet that threshold … if you’re living in a floodplain and odds are it may flood again,” he said.

Canadians who have another type of flood coverage called sewer backup insurance also face a similar conundrum. Filing a claim because backed-up city pipes caused water to flow back into your basement may cause your insurance provider to rethink the terms of your policy when its term is up.

Story continues below advertisement

But homeowners dealing with a flooded basement can take several steps to help limit the risk and extent of future water damage and keep their insurance company happy, Thomas said. That includes measures such as installing a sump pump, which helps pump out water accumulating under your home, or a backwater valve, which prevents water in sewage pipes from backing into your house.

Those measures, though, only go so far when you have water breaking in through your windows and doors from nearby rivers and lakes, Thomas said.

“You can’t stop Mother Nature,” she said.

Floods, mortgages and bankruptcies

Eventually, floods can lead to debt defaults, Haralovich said.

Story continues below advertisement

Lenders’ refusal to renew mortgages, of course, is one potential trigger. If homeowners are asked to pay off their outstanding mortgage balance and can’t cover those costs by selling their property, they may have no choice but to default.

Another plausible scenario is that they would be able to turn to alternative lenders, which take on riskier loans but also charge higher interest. That may be a temporary solution, but over time, higher mortgage costs could still push homeowners into debt restructuring, Haralovich said.

A third possible driver is repair bills.

Haralovich recalled seeing one family after the 2017 flood who was forced to file a consumer proposal, despite having some flood insurance.

The policy didn’t cover all the costs so the family used credit cards to finance the rest of the repairs. Within a few months, according to Haralovich, the bills and credit charges had spiralled out of control.

“There is an emerging risk facing Canada’s mortgage market, where flood-related mortgage arrears may become more frequent following flood events as saving rates remain low and more households are subject to repeated flooding,” reads a report by Natalia Moudrak and Blair Feltmate of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

That risk exists for sewer backup flooding, too. The average cost of a flooded basement is $43,000, while available insurance coverage is sometimes capped at less than half that in certain areas, Feltmate previously told Global News.

Meanwhile, surveys show almost half of working Canadians live paycheque to paycheque, the Intact study noted.

Where is the government?

For years, the expansion of the private flood insurance market after the Alberta floods coincided with an attempt by various levels of government to curtail their own responsibility toward property owners, according to Jason Thistlethwaite, a professor at the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development at the University of Waterloo.

In 2016, for example, British Columbia announced that applicants for disaster financial assistance who could “reasonably and readily” have purchased overland flood insurance would not be eligible to receive the government aid.

The idea was that promoting insurance coverage would help contain the flood-related costs borne by taxpayers. But private insurance alone is ill-suited to protect property owners in areas with a high risk of repeated flooding, Thistlethwaite noted.

“This lack of insurance availability in high-risk areas is likely to undermine the federal government’s goal of reducing the costs of publicly funded disaster assistance,” he predicted in a paper co-authored with Daniel Henstra for the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

That realization seems to have dawned on the government now.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month that residents in some areas will have to “move or rebuild differently,” while Quebec Premier François Legault has spoken about paying $200,000 for homeowners in the Ottawa River floodplain to move away from the area.

Buyouts have also been a topic of discussion in formal talks between Ottawa and provincial governments. Efforts are also underway to draw or update flood-risk maps. And policy-makers are speaking with insurers about creating a flood-risk insurance pool to fund coverage in flood-prone areas. Insurance companies would set aside part of the revenues to offer subsidized coverage in these areas in a model similar to what is used in Canada to offer auto-insurance coverage to high-risk drivers, Thistlethwaite said.

It makes for a stark contrast to the narrative politicians were using in the aftermath of the Alberta floods, in which the emphasis was on restoring things to the way they were before, Thistlethwaite said.

Now, he added, the language has changed.

The Fraser Valley was hit with a catastrophic flood that spring, a disaster that left a third of the region overwhelmed by dirty water.

More than 16,000 people were forced from their homes, many of which were destroyed. More than 22,000 hectares flooded.

The Toop family — three back then — had about 100 cows between them. Allan remembers shepherding them to higher ground after the nearby dike broke.

They milked the cows by hand for two weeks before they could go home. Toop, now 87, thought it was an adventure then.

Looking back, he sees the disaster for what it was.

""There was water right up to the eaves in many of the houses,"" he said.

""It was on the murky side, to say the least. I don't want to see it again, I can tell you that.""

This spring marks 70 years since that flood.

In late May of 1948, an enormous snowpack coupled with an unusually warm, late spring sent disastrous amounts of snow melt into the valley. It wasn't long before the Fraser River overflowed.

Abbotsford, Chilliwack and Mission were the hardest hit. Rich farmland disappeared beneath a sea of filthy, brown water. Hundreds of houses were swallowed up.

The Canadian National Railway line and the Trans-Canada Highway rail lines were flooded, cutting southwestern B.C. off from the rest of Canada.

Canadian Armed Forces were dispatched to help fix overwhelmed dikes and lay more sandbags. The Red Cross was called to provide fresh food and clean clothes to sodden evacuees.

When the waters receded two weeks later, people returned home to black sludge coating their walls. Damages came to about $20 million — around $215 million by today's standards.

It would take years for the agricultural region to recover.

Historian Jane Watt interviewed more than 100 people for a book about the disaster, High Water. Many lived through the flood or had family who did.

She said the flood changed the way the region saw the Fraser River. Towns invested more in flood prevention work to prevent another catastrophe.

""People took the river for granted then,"" Watt said. ""Then people start to respect it again.""

Watt said nearly all of her interviewees — like Toop — remember hometown resilience before anything else.

Toop still lives in the same area of Chilliwack today. His son and grandson have taken over the family farm.

And while people surround their homes with sandbags, there are some important health hazards to keep an eye out for, in order to stay safe.

Here are some of the biggest health risks during — and after — a flood.

During the flood

As the water rises, some of the biggest risks are related to injury, according to Dr. Vera Etches, Ottawa’s medical officer of health.

“One of the major risks of flooding is actually drowning and injury due to electrocution when water and electricity come into contact,” she said. “So if you have a generator or hydro on when your property is flooded, that’s dangerous.”

Never assume any area of your property affected by flooding is safe, the Electrical Safety Authority said in a press release. If you have to leave your home during a flood, they recommend switching the main breaker to the “OFF” position. If you suspect water has risen above electrical outlets, baseboard heaters, your furnace or near your electrical panel, they say to stay out of your property as electricity can move through water or wet flooring and give you a serious shock.

High waters can also conceal hazards beneath the surface, like open manhole covers or other things, and people are also at risk of drowning during a flood.

“Absolutely avoid areas that are flooded,” Etches said.

“That may mean leaving your home sometimes. That’s very difficult to do, but it’s not safe [to remain] and your safety has to be the top priority.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""That may mean leaving your home sometimes. That's very difficult to do, but it's not safe [to remain] and your safety has to be the top priority.""

The other major hazard is the water itself. Flood water is not very clean, which brings a risk of infection, she said.

“Flood waters themselves can carry bacteria or viruses, and when some of these rural areas have wells and septic systems, when the ground gets flooded, the drinking water can be contaminated with bacteria and viruses. So we certainly want to make sure that people aren’t drinking that water or that they boil it before they drink it.”

The most common flood-related illnesses are gastrointestinal infections, according to the Government of Manitoba. This is usually caused by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food, and results in symptoms like stomach aches, vomiting and diarrhea.

Sherry Beadle, manager of health protection with Ottawa Public Health, said that if your drinking water comes from a well and the water has risen over the top of the well, it’s potentially contaminated.

“Our recommendation then is to use an alternate drinking water source until such time that the flood waters recede and their well can be disinfected and testing can be done to ensure that there’s no bacteria,” Beadle said.

Cuts or sores on your skin can also be infected by dirty flood water, so you should wash with soap and water and apply an antibiotic ointment if your cuts touch flood water, the Manitoba government says.

If you’re sandbagging or helping with flood relief, you should wear protective clothing like gloves, boots and overalls, and wash your hands with soap and water after coming into contact with flood water or handling objects contaminated with the water. If you accidentally get flood water in your eyes or mouth, you should rinse with clean water.

You should also be prepared to evacuate, Beadle said, and keep a 72-hour supply of clean food and water just in case.

After the flood

Once the waters recede, they leave behind a lot of wet stuff. Some of it can be dried out and salvaged, and some can’t.

The City of Calgary recommends that you think about tossing out soft things like bedding, clothing, upholstered furniture and carpets, on its flood information website.

You should always throw away food, cosmetics, medication, rugs, mattresses and pillows, it says.

The Electrical Safety Authority recommends you get a licensed contractor to inspect your home’s electrical system if your house got flooded, and not plug in any appliances that have been touched by water until they have been checked by an expert.

It’s important to then clean and disinfect your home room by room, then dry everything out as quickly as possible by opening doors and windows and using fans and dehumidifiers. Beadle warns, though, that running equipment like gas-operated generators and water pumps indoors can cause a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

You want to get the drying done quickly, to prevent the growth of mould. Mould can appear as a discolouration on walls and ceilings, but can also grow on almost any organic material, like wood, paper and fabric, according to the Government of Manitoba. It also has a musty or earthy smell.

Mould can appear on damp materials in just 48 hours, the province says.

It can cause stuffy noses, irritated eyes, wheezing or skin irritation. More seriously, it can exacerbate asthma symptoms or cause difficulty breathing, or even lung infections. People with allergies, asthma and other breathing conditions or immune system deficiencies, as well as pregnant women, children, and the elderly, are most likely to be affected, the government said.

Finally, after a flood, mental health can be a concern. “When people work really hard to protect their homes, the long hours and the stress of it can give rise to the need for mental health supports,” Etches said. People might also be displaced from their homes or face other issues, and it can take weeks to recover, she said.

She wants people to know that it’s OK to reach out for support if you feel too stressed, she said. The City of Ottawa has a website listing various mental health resources for the Ottawa area and beyond. Ottawa Public Health also has a website addressing common flood-related concerns.

The survey on flood risk, commissioned by RSA Canada and World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF-Canada), produced some seemingly self-contradictory findings. For example, despite nearly a third (31%) of respondents telling the study that they’re worried about a flooding event affecting them, 93% indicated that they don’t believe they live in an area prone to flooding.

The study also uncovered the public’s lack of knowledge around how to protect themselves from flood. Nearly half (47%) said they don’t know how to protect their homes, even though nearly three-quarters of Canadians acknowledged that flooding has increased.

Climate change was identified as the biggest reason for flooding (77%), with a lack of green space to absorb water (47%) also getting the blame. The study identified some confusion around the causes of flooding. For example, 27% were unsure if paved surfaces lead to greater rainwater runoff, and nearly one-in-five (19%) are unsure if flooding only happens following heavy rains.

While releasing the results of the survey, RSA Canada and WWF-Canada announced a partnership to look at vulnerabilities and create adaptation plans to build climate-resilient communities.

“I’ve seen first-hand the destruction and disruption that flooding can cause,” said Anthony Black, RSA Canada’s national catastrophe manager, in the announcement. “In many cases, Canadians don’t even know that they are at risk and aren’t even sure what they could have done to protect themselves. We have to band together as an industry, as a community, and with all levels of government, to do a better job in helping people recognize the risks they are exposed to and providing them with tools that result in immediate and sustainable solutions.”

The announcement pointed to the Saint John River (SJR) watershed in New Brunswick, where RSA Canada is supporting and funding WWF-Canada’s efforts to work with communities in the area to improve flooding resistance. In Florenceville-Bristol, N.B., the town is looking to implement nature-based solutions to build resilience like restoring wetlands and installing rain gardens.

“Building resilience is critical, as it goes beyond adaptation and sees communities over a large geographic area coming together to ensure they can ‘bounce back better’ from impacts like flooding,” says Simon J. Mitchell, lead freshwater specialist at WWF-Canada. “Our work in the SJR watershed is helping build a model that will empower local communities to enhance their flood resilience and respond to the impacts of climate change.”

The work done in the SJR watershed is an example of how government, industry and local communities can come together, WWF-Canada and RSA Canada said, and the two groups hope these efforts can be replicated in other communities across the country that are at risk.","Fri, 11 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.canadianunderwriter.ca/uploads/2019/07/21055456.jpg,"['flooding', 'work', 'watershed', 'risk', 'confused', 'communities', 'canada', 'canadians', 'flood', 'rsa', 'wwfcanada', 'nearly', 'study', 'finds']", ,none

This year, his crews are busy raising a road in Fort McMurray that runs alongside the Clearwater River, one of two major waterways running through town. Once it is elevated, it will do double duty as a dike and a major arterial road – all part of a network of flood defences currently under construction or being designed in this northern Alberta city.

This race is one that Mr. Hough intends to win.

Asked what existed before, he laughs, before saying, “Nothing. There simply wasn’t these kind of defences in place.”

If all goes according to plan, in a few years Fort McMurray will be a walled city. The anticipated cost: nearly $300-million.

To put that figure into perspective, consider that a 2006 provincial committee recommended a suite of flood-mitigation measures across the entire province – safeguarding 54 municipalities – whose total cost was just more than $300-million. The price tag for Fort McMurray, which Wood Buffalo will pay almost entirely on its own, is also more than double the tab for relocating buildings out of floodways across the whole of southern Alberta after devastating floods ravaged the province in 2013.

Fort Mac’s dikes might be the largest Canadian flood-prevention project you’ve never heard of.

The project is also something of an anachronism. “The era of big structural defence developments was really the 1950s and sixties,” says Jason Thistlethwaite, professor at the University of Waterloo’s School of Environment, Enterprise and Development. “None of these structures offers absolute protection. So there’s been a real move away from building these defenses and a shift toward what the Dutch are doing: ‘Making room for the river’ "" – an approach that includes government-funded buyouts of properties in flood-prone areas, and measures to prohibit new development that would sit in harm’s way.

But retreat is no longer a viable option for Fort Mac. Having allowed development in its floodplain for decades, half of its downtown, often referred to as the Lower Townsite, now lies there. If the city “made room for the river,"" there wouldn’t be much room left for anything else.

If it seems absurd that a community would knowingly build itself in harm’s way, Fort McMurray’s situation is by no means unique in Canada. Neighborhoods in Fredericton have long existed in the floodplain of the Saint John River. Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Que., although inadequately protected by an existing dike, expanded onto an area vulnerable to flooding from the Lake of Two Mountains. And hundreds of homes and small businesses along the Ottawa River, including in the nation’s capital, are dangerously exposed. All those communities experienced severe flooding this spring.

Fort McMurray’s story illuminates how and why communities of perfectly rational people can build directly in harm’s way – and illustrates, as well, the high costs of addressing the mistake of doing so.

Fort McMurray’s dilemma has been 150 years in the making.

The city sits near the confluence of the Athabasca and Clearwater rivers, where the Hudson’s Bay Co. set up shop in 1870 to take advantage of these crucial transportation corridors.

But the site was not without its drawbacks. According to municipal documents, Fort McMurray has suffered at least 15 notable floods since 1835 – all but one of them caused by ice jams. As ice along the two waterways breaks up and moves downstream in spring, chunks of it can pile up where the rivers meet. That can cause water levels to rise swiftly, as many as several metres along the Clearwater River, inundating the Lower Townsite.

Over the decades, various options were explored for controlling river ice, including hydroelectric dams, water-storage basins and diversion projects along the Athabasca River. Dikes were contemplated several times, including in the early 1980s, and again around 2000.

Nothing came of any of those plans.

And although some Canadian communities have turned to specialized heavy machinery to manage spring breakup, Wood Buffalo deems such methods ineffective. “We’re really at the mercy of nature,” Mr. Hough says. “There’s no use in explosives or punching holes in the surface [of the ice]. There’s no potential for breaking up the river ourselves.”

(It’s unclear how a warming climate will influence future ice-jam floods in Fort McMurray; academics who have studied this question have found that their severity might actually be reduced. In any case, there are too many variables, and too much uncertainty, to make a reliable forecast.)

But if building on an unprotected floodplain seemed unwise, Fort Mac had few alternatives. The surrounding region features large tracts of muskeg and unstable slopes, leaving little viable land for development.

And so what began as a handful of small log buildings gradually morphed into an assortment of big-box stores, condominium complexes and houses with finished basements. Then, after 2000, things really took off: The city’s population doubled over the subsequent decade. Development in the Lower Townsite intensified even as new subdivisions sprouted on higher ground to the northwest.

All levels of government knew what was happening.

Back in the 1990s, Alberta joined a federal initiative called the Flood Damage Reduction Program. The underlying bargain: In exchange for federal funding for flood-mapping initiatives, the province would discourage further development in high-risk areas.

As part of that initiative, in 1993, Alberta’s Environment Ministry recommended that 250 metres above sea level be adopted as the design flood level for Fort McMurray – a move that would have effectively halted further development in the Lower Townsite, large parts of which lie below that elevation.

But that designation of floodplains as flood-hazard areas never happened.

Merwan Saher, Alberta’s Auditor-General, warned in a March, 2015, report that although Alberta Environment had identified and mapped 48 flood-hazard areas, most – including Fort McMurray – hadn’t been officially designated as off-limits for development. Politics, he said, was to blame. “The lack of designation often reflects a lack of local community support,” Mr. Saher noted, “and the department’s reluctance to impose designation of a community that does not want it.”

By effectively surrendering floodplain regulation to municipalities, Alberta made the same mistake that virtually every Canadian province has made at some time or another, often repeatedly. For local officials, the impulse to allow development in vulnerable areas can be almost irresistible. In the words of one federal document, local authorities “are subject to perverse incentives; they benefit from property development fees and annual property taxes."" Meanwhile, it’s the provinces and the feds who get stuck with most of the tab for helping flooded communities recover.

To assess what’s at risk in Fort McMurray, The Globe and Mail acquired high-resolution satellite imagery of the Lower Townsite from 2017 (as well as of the flood-prone Waterways neighborhood immediately to the southeast). We imported that imagery into Picterra, a web-based machine-learning tool that we used to identify buildings (everything from homes, garages and apartment buildings to office and industrial buildings, shopping malls and big-box stores). We then manually added buildings that the tool missed. All told, we identified more than 3,300 structures.

The Globe also acquired data from the provincial government depicting areas expected to go underwater during a 1-in-100 year flood – that is, a flood that has a 1-per-cent chance of occurring in any given year. Using ArcGIS Pro, a geographical-information-system software package, we identified more than 730 structures within the floodplain. We found another 560 structures within the so-called “flood fringe” – where floodwaters would be shallower and slower moving, and thus less threatening.

It appears that approximately 40 per cent of the structures in the Lower Townsite and Waterways are directly in harm’s way.

Several years ago, the municipality began pondering how to revitalize the downtown, increase its population fourfold (to 48,000) and create an arts-and-entertainment hub that would be “the envy of most other large urban centres” across the continent. The municipality wanted more shops, office buildings and homes. Plans grew increasingly ambitious over time, with visions of a $580-million, 6,200-seat sports arena and extensive waterfront development.

The official plan did nod to the city’s history of flooding: It included raising a road along the Clearwater River to double as a dike. But at 248.5 metres above sea level, according to one municipal document, this would provide only “basic flood protection for the 40-year flood level.” (A flood with a 40-year return period has a 64-per-cent probability of occurring in any 40-year period, and an 83-per-cent chance of occurring within 70 years.) In other words, the municipality essentially accepted that occasional catastrophic flooding would remain a fact of living in Fort Mac.

That attitude, however, became untenable after Alberta suffered the worst floods in its history, in June, 2013. The damage in Fort McMurray from the swelling Hangingstone River (one of the city’s smaller rivers, which empties into the Clearwater) amounted to a relatively minor cost of millions of dollars. Heritage Park, a collection of relocated historic buildings showcasing the region’s pre-oil history, turned into a muddy bog. Old wooden floors and foundations suffered extensive damage. The park did not reopen for four years.

This was no ice-jam flood. But those communities in southern Alberta that had similarly allowed unchecked floodplain development suffered recovery costs estimated at more than $5-billion, including more than $200-million in disaster-assistance payments.

That stung.

As often happens after major disasters, politicians vowed to learn from past mistakes. The province committed itself to the principle that it’s easier to keep people away from flooding than it is to keep floodwater away from people. Henceforth, development in high-risk areas would be restricted.

But for Fort McMurray, it was too late to reverse course. Blocking floodplain development there would have meant abandoning the city’s vision for a revitalized Lower Townsite. And Alberta’s emerging regulatory environment granted significant exemptions to certain municipalities, including Fort McMurray, that had “special circumstances.” Don Scott, then the local MLA, told local news media that the province didn’t want to “sterilize” the city’s downtown.

For McMurray’s aversion to retreat was further demonstrated after the cataclysmic 2016 wildfires that destroyed 2,400 homes. More than 200 of those burned in the flood-prone Waterways neighborhood, creating a rare opportunity to remove people from harm’s way. And yet, Wood Buffalo rejected the idea out of hand. “The [municipality] will not be entertaining buyouts from residents within the flood hazard area,” reads one municipal presentation given to Waterways residents in December, 2016. To encourage rebuilding, the municipality even repealed a bylaw that required special flood-proofing measures for newly constructed homes.

Instead, the city committed itself to the principal of keeping the floodwater away from the people: Fort Mac manned the barricades. The municipality hired a consultant to design a series of dikes, elevated roads and retaining walls around the Lower Townsite and Waterways neighbourhoods, to be completed by 2017.

But even that plan was soon interrupted – by falling oil prices. Oil sands companies significantly reduced investment, which rippled throughout the regional economy. Tax revenue began falling well below expectations, a trend that’s expected to continue.

So, Wood Buffalo considered other options. Officials briefly mooted creating a city-backed flood-insurance scheme. Mindful that dikes block views of the river, they also considered demountable transparent walls that would be erected every flood season; that idea was discarded after it became apparent how heavy the walls would have to be to withstand the awesome power of ice jams. And some suggested building to the lower 1-in-40-year standard, a move that would have saved an estimated $60-million in outlays – but that still played chicken with fortune.

Fort McMurray is topping its new defences at 250.5 metres above sea level – slightly above the 1-in-100-year flood level. Even then, it’s taking a gamble. During the worst flood on record, in 1875, rivers peaked at an estimated 252 metres. If floodwaters ever did overtop them, the dikes could make matters worse by trapping water inside the city.

But that disaster has been estimated as a 1-in-350-year event. Karl-Erich Lindenschmidt, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan’s Global Institute for Water Security, who specializes in river ice, thinks Fort Mac is building its dikes to a reasonable elevation. He has modelled ice-jam floods in the community and determined that there’s a limit to how high waters could rise before the force would overwhelm an ice jam and flush it downstream: It’s about 250 metres. “I think that’s a very viable and defendable water level,” he says.

Flood defences on this scale are rare in Canada, but they can work.

Manitoba’s Red River Floodway was completed in 1968 at a cost of $63-million, equivalent to about $450-million in today’s currency. It’s been called one of the largest, most important infrastructure projects in Canada’s history, and multiple studies suggest it has paid for itself many times over. Alberta is now planning new reservoirs on the Elbow and Bow Rivers to protect Calgary, a similarly massive undertaking. Calgary bets it will avoid $10 of flooding damage for every dollar it spends on its own massive infrastructure project.

One certain bet: Fort McMurray will be living with the implications of its decision for generations.

Tim Haney is a sociology professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary who studies how neighborhoods and communities respond to floods and other disasters. He acknowledges that buyouts and zoning restrictions enjoy little political support. But structural defences have their own problems, he says, one being that they encourage developers, municipalities and homeowners to take even greater risks than they did before, because they assume the new berms, dikes and floodwalls will work.

That false sense of security is often compounded, over time, by the fact that flood defences tend to be inadequately maintained – a situation that’s been repeated right across the country.

According to a 2015 analysis by Vancouver-based Ebbwater Consulting, 315,000 people live on the floodplain of the Lower Fraser River in British Columbia. Richmond, Delta and Coquitlam were found to be particularly vulnerable. The dikes protecting many low-lying neighborhoods, the study said, were built decades ago and have been long neglected. Governments must now decide whether to upgrade or replace them, at great expense.

Ontario’s Conservation Authorities operate more than 900 dams, dikes and other structures worth an estimated $2.7-billion. A 2013 report by Conservation Ontario, a non-profit association that represents the authorities, claimed that they received less than half the amount necessary to adequately maintain them. Now, they’ll have to make do with even less: This year, the Progressive Conservative government of Doug Ford slashed their flood-management funding in half.

Protected from the Lake of Two Mountains by a small dike, Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Que., expanded over the past few decades from a resort town to a small city of 18,000. This spring, thousands of homes flooded after that dike failed. The mayor promised a taller, stronger dike.

Some argue that Canadians’ faith in engineered solutions has become excessive. “What I’d very much like to see is, around Canada, for us to have a more useful discussion about where that build/no-build line actually is,"" Prof. Haney says. “Maybe there are certain places we just shouldn’t be letting people live.”

He may get his wish. Few Canadian communities can afford what Fort McMurray is doing – even when higher levels of government offer to help pay. A year ago, the federal government unveiled a $2-billion Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund to support projects costing more than $20-million. And yet, by the time the application period closed on May 31, Infrastructure Canada had approved only $1.2-billion in disbursements, most of that going to large cities such as Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto. Earlier this year, federal officials expressed surprise that they hadn’t received more applications.

Deterred by the costs of large-scale projects, “the lower-tier governments aren’t interested in applying for it,” says University of Waterloo’s Prof. Thistlethwaite. “I think we’re seeing the end of that emphasis on these bigger structural defences.""","Sun, 16 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/yRNROlypicMd0E0zXtiTrIqKC3k=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PVLS3G2WORC2DOT75A6VREN4OM.JPG,"['building', 'dikes', 'floodplain', 'lower', 'mcmurray', 'river', 'buildings', 'moves', 'rivers', 'capricious', 'development', 'waterways', 'fortress', 'city', 'flood', 'fort', 'protect', 'decades']", ,flood
64,64,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Who should bear the financial risk of flooding? Report lays out three options - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/who-should-bear-the-financial-risk-of-flooding-report-lays-out-three-options-1.4471632,"OTTAWA -- The federal government could help mitigate the cost of flood damage by creating a ""high-risk"" insurance pool to help lift the burden off the public purse, says a report released Tuesday by the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

The high-risk scheme is one of three options laid out in the report, a product of months of work by a national working group co-chaired by the bureau and Public Safety Canada.

About one-fifth of homes in Canada are considered to be at risk of overland flooding, but many don't have coverage for the damage. For those that do, insurance payouts have surged to about $1 billion per year over the past six years, based on estimates in the report.

Meanwhile, federal payouts to help communities recover from flood damage have quadrupled over the last four decades to about $3.7 billion during the first four years of this decade, compared with just $300 million during the 1970s.

""Taxpayers cannot continue bailing out people who live on floodplains,"" said Craig Stewart, a vice president at IBC and co-chair of the working group.

The three options laid out in the report include a pure market approach where risk is solely borne by homeowners, another where the government is more involved, and finally the creation of a high-risk pool of funds to help manage the financial risk.

The report suggested the high-risk scheme fares better than others at being affordable for homeowners, efficient at payouts, and accessible to homeowners -- but the report stops short of making a recommendation on which option the country should follow.

The advantage of the high-risk scheme is that it allows insurers to pass on risks to a larger pool of available money fed by premiums from homeowners. If a homeowner makes a claim, the insurance company would pay out to the customer and then seek reimbursement from the pool.

Homeowners might not even know they're in the high-risk pool, Stewart said, but it would allow insurance companies to avoid some of the financial risk involved with insuring people whose homes may be flooded.

Premium costs would be based on the risk of flooding, Stewart said. If premiums are capped, the pool would need another source of money to make up the loss, he said, suggesting property taxes or insurance premiums might be options for both that stream of money and the pool's startup costs.

Over time, the high-risk pool would no longer be necessary as homeowners do more to protect their properties, decreasing the risk of damage and insurance payouts. The U.K. took a similar approach in 2016 and projects its high-risk pool will no longer be needed after 25 years.

""For that to happen,"" Stewart said, ""you need to have significant government investment in mitigation over those 25 years.""

While the federal government has promised $2 billion for disaster preparedness, the report noted ""ongoing funding"" is needed, without putting a dollar figure to it. Stewart said the IBC is working with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to figure out the cost to make Canada resilient to flooding, as well as other natural disasters.

More money from the government is one of several key factors the report says are needed to address flood risk.

Another is the possibility of moving people out of high-risk flood zones by paying them to relocate, the report said.

More immediately, improving the quality of data, such as mapping flood risk zones, is ""the single greatest thing the federal government can do,"" Stewart said.

Better mapping is essential to help homeowners take action because many don't even know they live in high-risk flood zones, said Jason Thistlethwaite, an associate director of Partners for Action, a research network committed to reducing flood risk.

""If you are trying to encourage demand for this product, you first need to convince people that they need it,"" he said.

Solving issues like the lack of flood mapping data, poor public awareness and insufficient investment in risk mitigation are essential ""preconditions"" to creating a viable flood insurance system, said Thistlethwaite, who is also a professor at the University of Waterloo.

""It doesn't matter what type of flood insurance model you have -- unless you have the right conditions in place, it isn't going to work,"" he said, adding that first and foremost means more aggressive investment and leadership from the federal government.

""The report is on flood insurance, but it's actually the government that needs to do most of the heavy lifting.""","Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4095916.1537068852!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['federal', 'report', 'flooding', 'bear', 'homeowners', 'risk', 'financial', 'stewart', 'highrisk', 'flood', 'lays', 'help', 'options', 'insurance', 'pool']", ,none
65,65,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Bigger floods coming to Canada: Intact Centre head - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/bigger-floods-coming-to-canada-intact-centre-head-1004129866/,"If you think the most expensive floods in Canadian history were big, you haven’t seen anything yet. “The manifestation of climate change and extreme weather events is still yet to come,” said Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, Monday.

“I personally do not believe the Calgary floods, the Toronto floods, the Burlington floods – those are not the big floods,” Feltmate said at a panel discussion hosted by the Economic Club of Canada in Toronto.

By the Calgary and Toronto floods in 2013, he was referring to Canada’s third- and fourth-largest disasters respectively. Burlington, Ont residents experienced flooding in early August of 2014 when about 200 mm of rain hit that city, located immediately northeast of Hamilton.

“Those are a prelude to the bigger floods that are coming,” Feltmate said during the panel, titled Climate Change and the Financial Sector. The event, held at the Royal York Hotel at the south end of Toronto’s financial district, was moderated by Don Forgeron, president and CEO of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

In June 2013, heavy rains caused widespread flooding in southern Alberta. That resulted in the evacuation of the entire town of High River and the inundation of much of Calgary’s central business district, including the Saddledome, which serves as home ice for the Calgary Flames.

Industry-wide insured losses were about $1.7 billion, making it the third most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history after the 2016 Alberta wildfire and the 1998 ice storm.

Canada’s fourth-most expensive natural disaster arose July 8, 2013 when two separate storm cells hit the western Toronto area. Effects were widespread, including a flooded commuter rail line that stranded hundreds of riders for hours as well as a flooded transformer station.

Flood is “one of the biggest natural disaster risks” facing Canadian consumers today, Forgeron warned Monday. Climate change “is affecting Canadians now,” Forgeron added. “We are feeling its affects across the country and on the bottom lines of many businesses and organizations.”

Canadian society has to adapt to climate change “in quick order,” Feltmate told Economic Club of Canada attendees Monday.","Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.canadianunderwriter.ca/uploads/2018/04/iStock-471860809-370x246.jpg,"['change', 'head', 'natural', 'centre', 'forgeron', 'disaster', 'floods', 'expensive', 'canada', 'feltmate', 'coming', 'climate', 'toronto', 'bigger', 'canadian', 'intact']", ,none
66,66,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Time to build an ark? More flooding expected in the future - constructconnect.com - Journal of Commerce,https://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/infrastructure/2018/05/time-build-ark-flooding-expected-future,"As a winter without end finally gives way to warm spring temperatures, rivers choked with ice and swollen with runoff are causing floods in many parts of Canada.

At the beginning of May, parts of Alberta, Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and, especially, New Brunswick were under water.

As soggy as the situation is now, many regions of Canada are likely to experience more flooding in the future, says Shawna Peddle, director of Partners for Action in the University of Waterloo’s Faculty of Environment.

“There are many reasons,” said Peddle.

“For example, changing weather patterns and an increase in the number of storm cell events. In addition, there is more and more development and paving-over of formerly empty ground, so there are fewer wetlands to absorb run-off.”

On top of that, says Peddle, much of Canada’s water infrastructure is old and out of date, and unable to handle the increased water volumes caused by up-stream development.

Although some regions of the U.S., such as the lower Mississippi River valley, and some countries, such as the Netherlands, are more often under water than Canada, flooding is still the number one cause of insurance and personal losses in this country.

“Most people remember such major floods as Winnipeg in 1950 and 1997, and Calgary in 2013, but they might not know that every province experiences flooding each year,” said Peddle.

“Some of the floods take place in rural areas where relatively few people are affected, and those events might not make the news.”

Although no city or region can be made 100 per cent flood-proof, the risks of a good soaking can be reduced in a number of ways, says Peddle.

Examples include upgrading water-related infrastructure, updating building codes and encouraging closer inter-jurisdictional cooperation.

“Measures can be taken at all levels,” she said. “Everybody has a role to play.”

Another measure the country could take to keeping dry is to equip itself with up-to-date flood maps, says Tamsin Lyle, principal engineer at Ebbwater Consulting Inc. in Vancouver.

According to a report of the National Floodplain Mapping Assessment commissioned by Public Safety Canada, the country has mapped the geography of only 28,000 kilometres of waterways.

And although some provinces use once-in-100-years as the flood-risk standard, others use a more conservative once-in-500-years yardstick.

“The risks of flooding in many parts of Canada are growing because the country is growing and people and buildings are being added to vulnerable flood plains every year,” said Lyle.

While there are certainly benefits to living in cities that happen to be located on flood plains, there are also costs, and we need to become more conscious of them and take them into account as we build our cities, she says.

“And when we’re designing our solutions, we need to consider all of the potential natural disasters that could happen in the area, so that we don’t inadvertently worsen the fall-out from another kind of catastrophe,” Lyle said.

“We could, for example, put buildings on stilts, to keep them above water in the case of a flood. But those buildings could collapse if an earthquake struck.”

Dave Murray, a principal and water resource engineer in the Victoria office of consulting engineers Kerr Wood Leidal Associates Ltd., says Canada should look abroad for ideas on flood mitigation.

“We need to study the Netherlands’ Room for the River flood plain management program,” Murray said.

Keeping their heads above water has been a preoccupation of the Dutch since people started settling on the marshy soil near the North Sea.

Two-third of the Netherlands is below sea level. And the rivers which flow through the country on their way to the ocean overflow regularly.

In 1993 and 1995, severe flooding resulted in mass evacuations and left thousands of acres of farmland under water.

As a result, the Dutch government developed a program that enabled the rivers to safely handle greater volumes of water than in the past.

This was a major shift in Dutch flood mitigation thinking.

Before the 1990’s floods, the Netherlands relied primarily on dikes and berms to keep flood waters at bay.

The Dutch program creates “room for the river” in a number of ways — increasing stream depth, storing water, relocating dikes, creating high water channels, and lowering into the river structures that disrupt water flow.

The program allows land lying along rivers to act as natural water sponges in the event of a flood.

Since it was developed, the Dutch have taken the Room for the River program to other countries, including the Philippines.","Mon, 14 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/05/Hampton-NB-flooding-web.jpg,"['water', 'program', 'future', 'dutch', 'river', 'netherlands', 'rivers', 'number', 'canada', 'flood', 'ark', 'build', 'expected', 'flooding']", ,none
67,67,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Is climate change causing the recent floods along the St. John River? - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/future-floods-new-brunswick-climate-change-1.5134035,"As water levels rose along the St. John River this spring, many New Brunswickers had two reactions.

First, they prepared urgently for the flood.

Then they asked themselves whether this was evidence of climate change — whether two major floods in two years proves that human activity has altered the forces of nature.

""Things have certainly changed,"" Elaine Price of Mill Cove said as she watched the water rise toward her home last month.

In Chipman, Rhonda Saulnier was asking the same question.

""It's unbelievable,"" she said.

""So now that it's happened two years in a row, like everybody I'm afraid it's the new norm. I'm praying it's not.""

Water levels peaked in Fredericton on April 23 at 8.36 metres, compared with a peak of 8.31 metres last year. In Saint John, the peak was 5.53 metres compared with 5.76 metres last year.

For the second straight year, homes were evacuated. For the second straight year, the Trans-Canada Highway was closed downriver from Fredericton.

Even officials who oversee flood response seemed taken aback.

Is flooding along the St. John River the new norm? CBC News 1:27 For two years in a row, floodwater reached historic levels along the lower St. John River system. 1:27

""When this event happened last year, we were under the impression this was a historical event, and two years in a row, the historical event happened,"" said Ahmed Dassouki, the director of operations at the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure.

""It's a new day, and two years in a row is telling us we can't just do the same thing,"" Premier Blaine Higgs told reporters.

Yes, this is climate change — probably

Is this climate change?

The answer isn't straightforward, but the consensus is: yes, probably, likely.

""You can't attribute one event to climate change,"" said Barrie Bonsal, a senior research scientist with Environment Canada, who co-authored a major report on climate change released last month.

""But as we warm the atmosphere, and we see associated impacts, we are increasing the probability of certain types of events that are associated with warming.""

But if climate change was a factor in the back-to-back floods, so was luck.

""Climate change is a larger trend that says that these kinds of things will happen more often,"" said Jasmin Boisvert, a provincial hydrologist. ""With two floods of this magnitude, there has to be an element of bad luck, for lack of a better word.""

Bonsal said with warming temperatures, it's likely there'll be less snow pack at the end of most winters.

But when there happens to be a lot of snow pack, as there was this year, the trends caused by climate change — those warmer temperatures and increases in extreme rain — make flooding more likely.

Human activity causing warming

The report Bonsal co-authored, Canada's Changing Climate Report, says temperatures in Canada warmed by 1.7 C between 1948 and 2016 and will continue to get warmer.

More than half of that trend is ""likely"" due to human activity, the report adds, and that trend ""has increased the likelihood of some types of extreme events.""

Scientists have been forecasting the impact of warmer temperatures for decades, but until recently their projections felt abstract and theoretical, and not very local.

Now it's real. Recent weather events, Bonsal said, are ""eerily consistent"" with those previous projections.

'Entirely attributable'

Those whose businesses depends on knowing what is coming agree.

""What we have seen is entirely consistent with what global modelling has predicted,"" said Craig Stewart, a vice-president with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, which has seen flood and wildfire payouts soar in the last decade.

""They have predicted that we would see increased annual precipitation and incidents of extreme rainfall in eastern Canada, and more droughts and wildfires in western Canada, and that is exactly what we are seeing play out,"" Stewart said.

""So in our minds, we attribute current events to climate change. The trends we are seeing are entirely attributable to climate change.""

More rain, bigger floods

What happens next? It gets worse.

""We'll see more flooding like this,"" Boisvert said. ""That is the general trend.""

In worst-case scenarios, precipitation in Atlantic Canada is expected to increase five per cent by 2050 and 12 per cent by the end of the century.

Among the federal report's other forecasts:

Across Canada, extreme-precipitation events that happen once every 20 years will occur every 10 years between 2031 and 2050 if carbon dioxide emissions continue to grow.

By the end of the century, extreme events that happen once in 50 years will happen every 10 years. ""The more extreme the event, the more frequency will change,"" the report says.

In New Brunswick, there will be an ""increase in flood and drought frequencies"" in Saint John, Nashwaak, Canaan, Kennebecasis, Restigouche and Miramichi watersheds.

The federal report cites a study by University of Moncton professor Nassir El-Jabi, who teaches hydrological engineering.

The rate and magnitude of climate change under high versus low emission scenarios project two very different futures for Canada. - Environment and Climate Change Canada

El-Jabi estimates ""low-return"" floods in the province — frequent minor floods — will see water levels increase 30 to 55 per cent.

""High-return"" floods like the ones seen in 2018 and 2019 will grow more slowly, but could still be 21 per cent bigger by the year 2100.

Some caveats

There are caveats to all of this.

""These changes take effect slowly, over time, and the nature of weather is that it is very variable,"" Boisvert said.

""You might get extreme years in some years and not in other years.""

A river system is dynamic, so other factors — such as forestry and agricultural run-off, or construction that affects drainage — can play a role.

Rather than link specific events to climate change, scientists are focusing on a new field called ""event attribution.""

It looks at how the probability or intensity of a single extreme weather event changed because of greenhouse gas emissions.

For example, they concluded that in the major 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alta., climate change led to ""the increased likelihood of extreme wildfire risk and the length of fire seasons.""

The 100-year-flood

The two consecutive St. John River floods in 2018 and 2019 have been called, often with astonishment, two ""100-year-floods"" — as if climate change has thrown all our statistical models out of whack.

That's because this is not a well-understood concept.

A ""100-year-flood"" is simply a flood that has a one in 100 chance of happening in any given year, based on historical data. But they can happen more often.

""A one per cent chance last year is still one per cent this year,"" said climate researcher Louise Comeau in a recent tweet.

A moving target

Bonsal said the phrase has ""always bothered me a little bit. 'One in a hundred years' gives a perception that we're good for another 100 years, but really it can happen any year.""

The 100-year flood is also a moving target.

El-Jabi said that what constitutes such a flood is constantly evolving. Once data from 2018 and 2019 are added, the definition of a 100-year flood will shift.

A flood with only a one-in-100 chance of happening will be a bigger flood. Meanwhile, a flood as big as this year's ""may be a one-in-50 flood, or a one-in-10 flood,"" Bonsal said.

Costly consequences

These trends are already proving costly. Last year's flooding cost the New Brunswick government $74 million and counting.

Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said recently that Ottawa spent more on disaster relief in the last six years than it did in the 40 years before that.

Flood claims paid out by insurance companies in New Brunswick grew from $59 million in 1996 to $144.3 million in 2015, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

To put that 2015 figure in context, it's larger than the average annual flood payout for all of Canada — between 1990 and the early 2000s.

""That gives you an idea of how quickly this has escalated, and why insurers have been saying climate change is a real and present danger,"" Stewart said.

It's not too late

Another startling element of the recent federal report is that while climate change would be difficult to reverse, it's not too late to avoid worst-case scenarios.

""The rate and magnitude of climate change under high versus low emission scenarios project two very different futures for Canada,"" the federal report says.

For example, precipitation in Atlantic Canada will increase by 12 per cent by the year 2100 under the ""high-emission scenario,"" a model that Bosnal calls ""business as usual"" — continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions.

But in a low-emission scenario in which Canada and the rest of the world agree to emissions reductions called for in the Paris agreement, precipitation will be only 4.7 per cent higher.

""Future warming is unavoidable,"" Bonsal said. ""We will have to be prepared for that warming. We will have to adapt to certain events and impacts associate with that warming.

""But as we go farther into the future, we do have some choices. If we can mitigate greenhouse gas scenarios, we can certainly reduce the impacts.""

Better prepared

With this year's floods, the talk has turned to how to prepare for more frequent events.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada now aims to make data from its private climate forecasting available to the public.

""We've been having increasing conversations about how to get the data that these models provide into the hands of the public,"" Stewart said.

One idea is a searchable federal ""flood portal"" that would provide ""a window into risk for homeowners.""

Whether there's a third straight big flood in 2020 or not, Stewart said, ""we as a society need to figure out a way to adapt, to lower our risk and to move people out of harm's way when necessary.""

Bonsal said Canadians should take a closer look at the report he worked on.

""We shouldn't be surprised in the future,"" he said. ""These events that we have not seen in the past can certainly come in the future. So we should certainly be prepared for surprises.""","Tue, 21 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5110289.1576681088!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/nb-flooding-20190424.jpg,"['recent', 'change', 'causing', 'report', 'river', 'floods', 'canada', 'climate', 'st', 'john', 'flood', 'events', 'extreme']", ,flood
68,68,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Where Canada sits with overland flood insurance - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/canada-sits-overland-flood-insurance-1004132703/,"Five years after massive flooding caused more than $4 billion in uninsured losses in Alberta, more than a dozen insurers representing about three-fourths of Canada’s property insurance market are now covering overland flood.

Sixteen insurers representing 77% of the market now offer overland flood coverage, Craig Stewart, vice president of federal affairs for Insurance Bureau of Canada, said in a recent interview.

In 2015, Aviva Canada, The Co-operators and RSA Canada were among the first insurers to announce they would cover overland flood. Until then, only sewer backup was generally available. The 2013 southern Alberta floods led to economic losses of about $6 billion, but only about $1.7 billion of that was covered by insurance (mostly sewer backup).

Water damage coverage is still a concern because overland flood is not available at affordable rates to hundreds of thousands of Canadian homeowners, mainly because they live in areas deemed by insurers to be at a high risk of flooding, Stewart told Canadian Underwriter.

IBC is not naming all 16 carriers offering overland flood. Those who publicly advertise it include Aviva, The Co-operators, RSA, Gore Mutual, Wawanesa, Economical, Desjardins (whose brands in Canada include State Farm and The Personal), Intact, and Coachman.

Flood coverage was among the topics of conversation during a meeting of politicians on May 25. That meeting was co-chaired by federal public safety minister Ralph Goodale and Alberta municipal affairs minister Shaye Anderson.

Ministers attending that meeting asked IBC to “continue to further refine options for managing the financial costs of high-risk properties,” including drawing from international practices such as Flood Re in Britain, a Public Safety Canada spokesperson wrote Tuesday in an e-mail to Canadian Underwriter.

IBC recommended earlier that Canada have insurance for homes at high risk of flood where the coverage is administered by insurers but the capital is provided by government.

“It remains to be determined what the mechanism would look like,” Stewart said. “We don’t believe that low-risk insurance policyholders should be subsidizing those who have been permitted to continue living in harm’s way.”

Contacted by Canadian Underwriter, Public Safety Canada would not confirm whether the federal government agrees that it should provide capital for flood risk for high-risk properties.

69,69,FL-2019-000179-CAN,'Urgent action needed' to preserve wetlands and mitigate flood risk: report - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/urgent-action-needed-to-preserve-wetlands-and-mitigate-flood-risk-report-1.4099915,"The Insurance Bureau of Canada is calling for “urgent action” when it comes to preserving Canada’s wetlands as a way of limiting flood risk.

A new report, issued Tuesday in partnership with the Intact Centre and the International Institute for Sustainable Development, indicates restoring ponds and wetlands can be a more cost-friendly and effective way of preventing flooding than man-made alternatives, such as dams or levies.

“Often, we overthink solutions,” Craig Stewart, the IBC’s vice-president of Federal Affairs, told CTV News. “We have a lot out there already buffering us from harm. In terms of our coastal wetlands, our inland wetlands, our forests, we need to be doing a better job of protecting these in the places where they protect us.”

Flooding has become a growing issue in the country. Insurance loses from extreme weather in Canada -- primarily flooding -- averaged $405 million annually from 1983-2008, but has since skyrocketed to $1.8 billion annually over the last decade.

In some areas of the country, maintaining or restoring waterways and wetlands has already proven economically beneficial.

In Gibsons, B.C., about 46 kilometres northwest of Vancouver, ponds are saving the community up to $4 million in annual rainfall storage. Meanwhile, in Manitoba, a restored wetland is helping save the surrounding area roughly $3.7 million annually in flood prevention and water filtration.

Despite the apparent benefits of maintaining Canadian wetlands, they are disappearing to development at staggering rates. According to the IBC, southern Ontario has lost 72 per cent of its wetlands to construction, while the southern Okanagan region of British Columbia has lost 85 per cent.

Both regions have been hit with costly flooding thus far in 2018.

In May, British Columbia’s southern interior was hit with catastrophic flooding that lasted several days. Torrential rain mixed with melting snow from the mountains forced thousands of people to evacuate and damaged hundreds of homes in the process.

In early August, a flash flood in Toronto submerged cars and flooded basements, leaving an estimated $80 million worth of damages in its tracks.

Anne Hammill, director of the Resilience Program at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, says wetland areas can also be effective in protecting urban areas from flooding.

“The vegetated lands can help buffer and sort of prevent water from moving as quickly and accumulating in places that are greater risk,” she said.

The federal government has committed $2 billion to build traditional infrastructure and restoring natural protections. In the Paris Agreement, it acknowledged the ability of natural ecosystems to protect against extreme weather.

The IBC says if the government truly intends to uphold its international promises, time is of the essence.

“If Canada remains committed to the Sendai Framework and the Paris Agreement, it needs to act now, in innovative and unprecedented ways, before it cannot act at all,” the report states.

70,70,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"'The water passes and we're moving on' — but there are lessons in 5 of Manitoba's worst floods, expert says - CBC.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-5-worst-floods-1.5047030,"Flood forecasters predict a potentially devastating deluge for parts of the province this spring — but even if it's as bad as expected, it will be far from the first time a Manitoba flood has left a trail of destruction in its wake.

Late last month, provincial forecasters released the first detailed flood outlook of 2019, and warned of widespread flooding along the Red River — at least as bad as 2011.

That was before heavy snow and rain hit south of the border, also bringing significant moisture in the form of snow to part of the basin in southern and eastern Manitoba, CBC meteorologist John Sauder said.

Since then, officials here have warned Manitoba flood levels could be even worse than 2009 — the second-highest since the Red River Floodway was constructed, surpassed only by the ""Flood of the Century"" in 1997.

Governments and landowners here in Manitoba have invested heavily in flood control systems over the years to improve water management and reduce the risk of damage.

But as University of Alberta assistant history professor Shannon Stunden Bower writes in her book Wet Prairie: People, Land and Water in Agricultural Manitoba, flooding remains a perennial problem in the province.

""This isn't a problem that can be solved — this is a problem that's every bit as fluid as the very water that you're trying to manage,"" Studen Bower said.

That means it can also be hard to narrow down which floods are important to look back to, she said.

""One of the challenges in determining which [flood years] are most worthy of attention is the fact that often, it would vary depending on your identity and your positioning — geographical and otherwise — within the province.""

But five of the worst Manitoba flood events over the past two centuries, she said, hit in 1826, 1950, 1997, 2009 and 2011.

1826 flood

Plaques beneath the canopy at The Forks serve as high-water marks and reminders that 193 years ago, all of it was metres underwater.

A series of blizzards in the winter of 1825-1826 preceded the greatest flood in the recorded history of what is now Manitoba — a flood that nearly destroyed the Red River Colony in minutes.

""It was challenging in part … because this was a relatively recently arrived settlement without a whole lot of resources after the flood,"" said Stunden Bower.

The area where Winnipeg stands, and the south in general, was in transition at the time. It was still dominated by Cree, Anishinaabe and other Indigenous nations that lived and moved through the territory, said Stunden Bower.

Just a few years before the flood, though, a group of primarily Scottish settlers established themselves at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers.

In one of the only accounts that exists from that time, Hudson's Bay Company clerk Francis Heron chronicled the devastation of the 1826 flood on the colony in his journals.

""About 2 p.m., the ice in the Red River at length broke up, with an awful rush; carrying away cattle, houses, trees and everything else that came in its way,"" reads an entry dated May 5, 1826.

""The houses of the settlers were one instant seen standing, and the next not a vestige was to be discovered, to denote their situations. Forty-seven dwelling houses were thus carried off by the first rush, in the short space of half an hour, and many others afterwards.""

No actual damage cost estimates are available, but were a flood of this scale to hit Winnipeg today, the Manitoba government estimates it would cause $5.8 billion in damage in the city (in 2019 dollars).

That severity is largely due to the lack of flood control infrastructure in place at the time.

Some of the settlers sought refuge on higher ground, like Stony Mountain north of Winnipeg, but the flood convinced many in the area to pack up and leave.

""Some settlers who had lived through it just chose not to come back. Basically they'd been flooded out and they weren't going to try to rebuild,"" Stunden Bower said.

Historians estimate waters rose to a height of 764.87 feet above sea level in 1826 — seven feet higher than in the 1950 flood.

1950 flood

Flood levels in 1950 hit 757.85 above sea level and caused an estimated $1 billion in damage in 2019 dollars, according to the province.

It was the highest level water had reached in Manitoba in nearly a century.

One person, Lawson Alfred Ogg, died in the flood and more than 100,000 Winnipeggers — roughly a third of the population — fled the city.

""There was, in fact, a plan to evacuate everybody if things went really bad,"" said Stunden Bower.

Millions of sandbags were no match for the combination of heavy fall rain, a long winter, lots of snow and more rain in the spring, leading up to the flood that wreaked havoc from April through June.

An area covering 1,500 square kilometres from the U.S. border to Winnipeg was underwater. The Canadian Armed Forces were called in to help with sandbagging and evacuation efforts.

CBC video from the time shows old cars making waves as they tried to drive out of Winnipeg, and people being ferried from homes in motor boats.

""The 1950 flood was interesting and dramatic in part because of the media technologies that prevailed at the time, and international interest in sort of broadcasting the Manitoba experience,"" said Stunden Bower.

Watch black and white video from the 1950 flood:

After the 1950 flood, she said, different levels of government began seriously considering investment in the flood controls that would later be built: the Red River Floodway, the Shellmouth Reservoir and the Portage Diversion.

""You also really see in 1950 the clear emergence of a government focus on safeguarding the concentration of wealth and power in the city of Winnipeg,"" she said.

""This was an episode that put the city at risk … in terms of its infrastructure, in terms of its population — and there was the emergence of this idea that this cannot be allowed to happen again.""

The floodway was built between 1962 and 1968 at a cost of $63 million. It was colloquially referred to as ""Duff's Ditch"" after then-premier Duff Roblin, who was the driving force behind the floodway.

Watch and learn how the Red River Floodway works:

How does the Red River Floodway work?

The province activated the Red River Floodway on March 31 to control levels within the city. 0:24

The province says the floodway has prevented billions of dollars in damage in Winnipeg since completion, including during its first test in the 1979 flood.

The peak flow at James Avenue in Winnipeg that year was roughly the same as in the 1950 flood. The flood controls helped limit levels on the Red River to 5.8 metres (or 19.1 feet).

Without the system, James Avenue levels would have been closer to 9.2 metres — or 30.3 feet, the province said.

1997 flood

It all started with an unusually frigid winter, punctuated by a spring blizzard that grounded planes and closed highways in all directions. As much as 50 centimetres of snow dropped in the Red River Valley in 24 hours on April 5, 1997.

As all that heavy, wet snow melted, the waters began to rise in Manitoba and North Dakota.

""There was this dramatic tension that built,"" said Stunden Bower. ""The flood of 1997, of course, was really devastating in Grand Forks.""

It led to direct or indirect floods in at least 24 Manitoba communities. About 25,000 people evacuated their homes in Manitoba, and about 1,000 homes were damaged.

Thousands were told to leave their homes south of Winnipeg. Some of those evacuations may have been unnecessary.

Close to 8,000 soldiers — one-tenth of the Canadian Armed Forces— were brought in to help with sandbagging and evacuate rural communities. A ring dike around Morris was sealed, making the town a veritable island on the Prairies.

The flood caused an estimated $500 million in damage provincewide.

Without the flood controls in place by 1997, levels at The Forks could have been as high as the flood of 1852. The Red River crested at 24.5 feet at James Avenue in Winnipeg; the province says without the flood controls, it would have hit 35 feet.

""It did raise a lot of alarm in the city of Winnipeg, and there were urban spaces that were profoundly devastated and urban people who whose lives were profoundly transformed,"" said Stunden Bower.

""But I think one of the most significant things that came out in the aftermath of that flood was a commitment to more substantially ring dike the urban spaces in southern Manitoba,"" she said.

The province also moved to expand the floodway after the 1997 flood, more than doubling its capacity — to 140,000 cubic feet per second from 60,000 cfs. The expansion was designed to protect against a one-in-700-year flood event, the province said.

Were the flood controls not in place in 1997, levels on the Assinioboine River, pictured here, and Red River would have been high enough that the red steel tower at the right would be partly submerged. (Bryce Hoye/CBC)

That speaks to the severity of the event: it was the most serious Red River Valley flood to hit Manitoba since 1852, says the Manitoba government. As a result, the term ""Flood of the Century"" came into being.

Stunden Bower said Manitobans need to constantly consider whether current flood controls suit our needs — or run the risk of getting caught off-guard in future floods.

""Just like our relationship with non-human nature needs to be revisited and managed in a year-to-year way, so does our relationship to infrastructure require that sort of tending,"" she said.

2009 flood

Manitoba Emergency Services Minister Steve Ashton told media in 2009 amid flood-fighting efforts that it was the third-worst Manitoba flood in 100 years — worse than the 1979 flood, though not as bad 1997 or 1950. It ended up being the fourth-highest flood of the Red River since 1826.

Among other factors, a November 2008 rainstorm played a major role. Ground frost during the winter meant the soil was unable to absorb much moisture in the spring.

Choked-up ice flows led to blockages in the river drainage systems. Overnight, levels shot up nine feet on the Red River after ice jams in the Breezy Point and St. Peters Road areas, north of the floodway.

By the first days of spring, the Red was within one foot of 1997 levels.

The river crested at 22.5 feet at the James Avenue Pumping Station in Winnipeg in mid-April, though the province says it would've hit 32.5 feet (two feet below 1997) without the floodway.

""The greatest success of the 2009 flood was the protection provided by operation of major flood controls,"" the province says on its website. ""[They] reduced the crest in Winnipeg by 10 feet, preventing billions of dollars in damages.""

That bold retrospective — the word ""preventing"" is actually bolded on the government website — suggests the province in some ways views its management of the chaotic flood as a success.

""It does tend to be cast in this celebratory vein, like, 'Look, we managed this massive flood without significant disruption,'"" said Stunden Bower.

""I always wonder when I hear celebratory renderings, where did the water go? Who was affected? If those in charge are seeing this as a huge success, where might we see different narratives?""

The flood caused just under $7.5 million in damage in Winnipeg, a city spokesperson said — a drop in the bucket compared to 1997, 1950 or 1826.

Zoom outside city limits and the impact was much greater in economic terms — across Manitoba, the flood caused $70 million in damage, according to the province.

2011 flood

Just two years after the 2009 flood, Emergency Services Minister Ashton would characterize the 2011 flood as an ""unprecedented, one-in-350-year flood.""

Thinking in those terms may not always be the most useful, Stunden Bower said, as the Prairie climate is naturally prone to sustained wet and dry periods.

""What's interesting from 1997 onward — and especially 2009, 2011 — is that we're being forced to grapple with the fact that these are not 100-year floods, that this is clearly more of a year-to-year management,"" she said.

""It makes clear that the challenge isn't … 'Survive this and then move on with our lives,' but to figure out how we are going to manage our relationship to water, and to each other, in the context of a flood-vulnerable place.""

Distinguishing features of the 2011 flood include the fact it was driven largely by the bloated Assiniboine River in western Manitoba, and Winnipeg remained relatively unscathed.

Officials were concerned old dikes along the Assiniboine — built by the provincial and federal government even before the 1950 flood — weren't robust enough to withstand potentially ""catastrophic"" flood levels, Premier Greg Selinger said in 2011.

There were also worries the Assiniboine dike system could concentrate the water and speed the flow east.

So, in one of the defining moments of that spring, the NDP government made the unprecedented decision to flood one rural area to protect urban Winnipeg and other more populated communities.

Tractors and front-end loaders intentionally severed a dike that doubled as a road at the Hoop and Holler bend near Portage la Prairie, about 80 kilometres west of Winnipeg. Nearby farm fields were instantly flooded.

The move was later criticized for not being as effective as advertised. Less water spilled from the Assiniboine into adjacent farmland than expected.

The 29-kilometre Portage Diversion helped channel flood water north into Lake Manitoba, raising the levels on the lake.

As with 2009's flood, the significance of the 2011 flood depends on location and experience.

If you were a farmer near Portage la Prairie, the 20-metre-wide Hoop and Holler dike cut wasn't welcome news. The province would later pay locals for damage to their property, though some landowners accused the province of failing to fully compensate them.

""In lots of ways, flooding is a mirror, and how we manage it and deal with it tells us stuff about our society,"" Stunden Bower said.

""The people … who tend to do the worst through flood events, tend to be people who are already disadvantaged. Flood management means making decisions that benefit some people in areas at the expense of others,"" she said.

""But it's also only a reasonable way to proceed if the next step is to have a serious and forthright discussion about how to compensate those who were negatively affected, and I think often that is where we lose our energy sometimes.

""The water passes and we're moving on.""

An emergency channel was made to lower levels on Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin. (Province of Manitoba)

Stunden Bower said 2011 is ""unquestionably the flood of record"" for Indigenous people who live near the shores of Lake Manitoba.

About 4,000 people were forced from Pinaymootang, Little Saskatchewan, Dauphin River and Lake St. Martin First Nations due to floods that year.

Many were forced to relocate to Winnipeg and live in hotels initially; some were never able to return home, said Stunden Bower.

Others developed mental health and addictions issues during their time away from home.

Affected residents launched a class action lawsuit against the federal government seeking compensation. A judge approved a $90-million settlement last year, though there continue to be delays and residents still haven't seen any of that settlement money eight years after the evacuation.

Many from Lake St. Martin — nearly 100 as in six years — died from illnesses the community associated with stress and lifestyle changes after they were displaced.

""If we're serious about mitigating flooding we need to pay attention to who wins and who loses, and to recognize how people who lose tend to … be those who are already disadvantaged,"" said Stunden Bower.

""2011 is the most egregious example of this,"" she said.

""These communities that have suffered through the various ills of settler-colonialism are now forced to bear the water that is diverted from the province's centre of power and economic prosperity.""

Lake Ontario is higher than average and expected to keep rising.

The International Lake Ontario – St. Lawrence River Board is controlling the amount of water it lets through the Moses Saunders dam at Massena – balancing the high lake waters with flooding downstream at Montreal, where the Ottawa River is contributing to a state of emergency.

Board member Tony David says as long as flows from Ottawa River remain high, release of water through the Moses – Saunders dam near Massena will continue to be restricted.

According to David, “Those constraints to outflows from Lake Ontario - looks that they will continue to apply in the coming days.”

David says water levels in the lake are still significantly lower than two years ago, when there was major flooding.

But that’s likely to change in the coming days.

David said, “Given the situation with the reductions in outflow, we are actually expected to get caught up to where we were in 2017 fairly quickly to where in the next seven to 10 days.”

David said the international board can try to influence high water in Lake Ontario, but it can’t control the lake’s level. It can only manage outflows based on conditions in the St. Lawrence River.","Thu, 02 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.wbfo.org/sites/wbfo/files/styles/medium/public/201905/morgan.jpg,"['relief', 'water', 'river', 'ontario', 'high', 'saunders', 'upstream', 'canada', 'slows', 'daysdavid', 'lake', 'st', 'outflows', 'lawrence', 'flooding']", ,none
72,72,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Liberals pledge $150M for climate change preparedness flood mapping | News - Daily Hive,https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/liberals-flood-insurance,"The federal Liberals unveiled promises Wednesday to help homeowners prepare for damage from climate change with low-cost national flood insurance and zero-interest loans for green home renovations.

Leader Justin Trudeau was in the yard of a home in Delta, BC, in greater Vancouver, to announce additional climate-change-related measures.

“We recognize that people are facing increased flooding because of the effects of extreme weather events and increased impacts of climate change,” Trudeau said.

Trudeau said helping people figure out whether or where to rebuild after a flood is a difficult conversation, so his mitigation plans will start with $150 million to complete flood mapping in every province and territory, to identify land that’s at greater risk of inundation.

He is also promising a low-cost flood-insurance program, delivered via the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and a national plan to help homeowners relocate if they are at risks for repeated flooding.

“We recognize first of all that many people can’t get insurance, flood insurance any more,” he said. “We know that the government does need to step up.”

Parts of eastern Ontario, western Quebec, and New Brunswick were hit with major flooding for the second time in three years last spring, prompting a number of experts and governments to suggest climate change requires a rethink of disaster planning. Quebec Premier Francois Legault said earlier this year his government was capping flood compensation at a total of $100,000, but would offer people $200,000 in one-time help to move to less flood-prone areas.

For those who have suffered floods or forest fires that forced them from their homes, or left them unable to work, Trudeau said a re-elected Liberal government would create a national employment-insurance disaster-benefit program.

“If you’ve just been through a wildfire or a flood you should be focused on rebuilding your life, not on how to pay for the damage or how to pay the bills after time away from work,” Trudeau said.

He was flanked by a number of BC Liberal candidates, including Carla Qualtrough, his public-services and procurement minister, in whose riding the announcement was made.

Trudeau also announced plans for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to provide interest-free loans of up to $40,000 for homeowners or landlords to make green renovations, ranging from new windows and furnaces to the addition of solar panels or geothermal energy systems. The government would also support training programs for workers to do the renovations.

The Liberals claim the total cost of all the measures announced Wednesday would be $370 million starting in 2020-21, rising to $432 million by 2023-24, most of which would come from CMHC. The Liberals said about $70 million would come from general revenues in 2020-21 to pay for the training program and flood mapping, dropping to $20 million by 2023-24.","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.dailyhive.com/20190501070128/lake-ontario-flooding.jpg,"['liberals', 'change', '150m', 'homeowners', 'trudeau', 'insurance', 'million', 'national', 'flood', 'preparedness', 'climate', 'help', 'mapping', 'pay', 'pledge']", ,none
73,73,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Are federal politicians and the P&C industry aligned on flood prevention? - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/how-do-the-federal-parties-stack-up-for-flood-mitigation-plans-1004169283/,"Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) has “been very vocal” throughout the federal election campaign on the need for a national plan to reduce flood risk, Craig Stewart, the group’s vice president of government affairs told Canadian Underwriter in a recent interview.

Here are the property and casualty industry’s five key wants from the next Canadian government, according to IBC:

Strategic retreat measures to move those at the highest risk out of harm’s way

A high-risk insurance pool to offer insurance to those who are deemed a high risk

Investments in flood mitigation measures to de-risk Canada

Investments in flood mapping to better predict risk and address it collaboratively between insurers and governments

A prohibition on future building in flood zones

IBC won’t comment during the middle of an election on which political party platform is closest to the mark regarding the industry’s wants. And so Canadian Underwriter asked the four major political parties what they planned to do to mitigate flood risk.

The Liberals pointed to their climate plan, which appears to promise many of the items IBC wants. The party’s said it wants to create a low-cost national flood insurance program through the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation for homeowners at high risk of flooding and don’t have adequate insurance protection; complete all flood maps in the country and have them available in an online database; and develop a plan to help homeowners at risk of facing repeating flooding with relocation.

The New Democratic Party of Canada told Canadian Underwriter that, if elected, it would expand funding to help communities respond to disaster and adapt infrastructure to withstand flooding and other extreme weather events by $2.5 billion.

“We will also work with the provinces, territories and local governments to ensure that the Disaster Mitigation and Adaption Fund meets the needs of communities,” an NDP spokesperson said in a email, adding that they would continue uploading flood plain maps and keep them updated “to ensure we have the information we need to prevent flooding and properly plan our communities.”

The Green Party’s platform includes items like retrofitting buildings to make them energy efficient. Under its infrastructure plan, the party wants the Canada Infrastructure Bank to invest in climate-proofing key infrastructure and make upgrades to drinking water and wastewater systems a priority in order to protect against flooding, droughts and contamination. It also includes plans to restore natural buffer zones along waterways.

“The simple answer is a Green government would invest in infrastructure and land to minimize and prevent flood damage and our renovation programs would also cover floodproofing in appropriate areas,” a spokesperson in an email.

The Conservatives did not respond to Canadian Underwriter’s request to discuss their platform or policies on flood mitigation. The party has, however, released a plan for climate change, which states that it would look at government investment in infrastructure. It would include low-cost options for enhancing or constructing wetlands to prevent floods and droughts. The party believes managing wetlands can provide protection from floods and droughts, noting that they will support the completion of the Canadian Wetland inventory.

“IBC is encouraged by the attention paid to flood so far in the election campaign. And we’re encouraging voters to take a closer look at the flood measures in party platforms and use that to inform their choice,” Stewart said.","Fri, 04 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.canadianunderwriter.ca/uploads/2019/10/Federal-Election-leaders-French-debate.jpg,"['federal', 'industry', 'infrastructure', 'underwriter', 'risk', 'prevention', 'aligned', 'party', 'plan', 'wants', 'flood', 'pc', 'politicians', 'canadian', 'flooding', 'insurance']", ,none
74,74,FL-2019-000179-CAN,What U.S. flooding could mean for Canada's Prairie farmers - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/flooding-crops-farmers-1.5143828,"Flooding across the U.S. agricultural belt continues to thwart the planting of key crops in that country — something that could help some Canadian farmers fetch better commodity prices.

New data this week revealed several states are well behind schedule for planting thanks to weeks of rain, with more wet weather in the forecast for some regions.

Some of the greatest concern is over corn and soybeans.

As the week began, only 49 per cent of corn crops in 18 key states had been planted when more typically it might be 80 per cent. Less than a fifth of soybeans had been planted when it might normally be closer to half, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.

While it's still too early to tell if the poor conditions will persist or exactly how crop yields will be affected, one analyst says the impact of the flooding is already rippling into the market.

""In the last couple of weeks, we sort of have a market that's ... almost maybe woken up to some of the weather threats here that were building,"" said Jonathon Driedger, a senior market analyst with FarmLink in Winnipeg.

Corn and soybeans are key to the American farm sector.

Corn is widely used in grocery products, animal feed and fuel. Soybeans are a leading agricultural export in the U.S., worth $22 billion US in 2017.

Though the outlook for both crops could improve in the coming weeks if weather improves, the poor conditions in the U.S. have traders considering what the supply picture might look like later in the year.

For example, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that the July contract for U.S. corn recently climbed by 13 per cent in just seven sessions.

""The U.S. corn crop is so integral to the world markets that, you know, they get a sniffle and we all get pneumonia,"" said Barry Prentice, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Manitoba.

Canada exports only a fraction of the corn and soybeans that its southern neighbour does, though they're still important crops for a number of Canadian farmers.

More broadly, as Driedger explains, farmers on the Prairies could benefit from what he calls the ""spillover"" effect.

While poor weather has had an adverse effect in parts of Ontario, Driedger said that, generally, seeding progress in Western Canada has not been far outside what farmers might expect at this time of year.

""Corn is so influential on pricing, soybeans are influential on pricing, that as those prices rise for those crops, it sort of helps elevate other crops as well,"" Driedger said.

For example, the price of barley could also climb with corn as it is a direct substitute into livestock feed, he said.

""That's sort of the domino effects that I think traders are trying to assess and process right now, because at this stage of the game, in terms of the production side, we're still playing a game of 'what if,'"" Driedger said.

Where there may be a more direct impact for Canadian farmers is on wheat, he added. There are concerns about the impact heavy rain has had on the U.S. winter wheat crop and the planting of spring wheat, he said.

'The U.S. corn crop is so integral to the world markets that, you know, they get a sniffle and we all get pneumonia,' said Barry Prentice, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Manitoba. (Lyzaville Sale/CBC News)

He said wheat prices have been improving in Western Canada over the last couple of weeks.

Derek Brewin, head of the department of agricultural economics at the University of Manitoba, said wheat prices also move up and down with corn because some grades of wheat compete with corn as livestock feed.

""And then there's the higher quality wheat,"" Brewin added. ""If there is a shortage of that, the difference between the high quality and the low quality gets wider. They get really good prices.""

Some believe canola prices could get a small lift if soybean prices rise.

Canadian canola farmers are already feeling pressure because of China's boycott of the crop. If soybean prices improve, it could also drag canola prices up ""a little bit,"" Driedger said.

However, Prentice thinks poor U.S. weather could ultimately be a drag on canola prices. He said if American farmers switch from planting corn to soybeans, which take less time grow, that could affect oilseed prices.

""If the Americans grow more soybeans, that means that we're likely to see lower prices for canola,"" Prentice said.

It will take weeks — or even months — for the situation to unfold as farmers, traders and analysts get a clearer picture of the impact on the number of acres planted and the health of those crops, Driedger said.

""Maybe we wake up six weeks from now and all the weather cleared, the crop got in a little bit late but conditions were excellent, and so maybe that so-called scare isn't so much of a scare,"" he said.

""Or, you know, things [could] get progressively worse.""","Thu, 23 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5145711.1558567805!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/congress-disaster-aid.jpg,"['canadas', 'weeks', 'mean', 'farmers', 'corn', 'crop', 'prairie', 'driedger', 'weather', 'prices', 'soybeans', 'crops', 'wheat', 'flooding']", ,none

More military personnel were deployed throughout the region and municipalities called on volunteers to help replenish the supply of sandbags as parts of the Muskoka and Kawartha regions remained under water thanks to surging lakes and rivers.

Local authorities said the rapid rise of water levels had begun to slow but the spectre of intensified flooding surfaced in the latest Environment Canada forecast.

A special weather statement covering much of central Ontario called for between 20 and 40 additional millimetres of rain to fall beginning on Wednesday, placing potential new strains on the handful of communities that have already declared states of emergency.

In Bracebridge, Ont., where an emergency declaration was issued last week, residents prepared to welcome additional military members brought in to help manage flood conditions.

Mayor Graydon Smith said 30 more soldiers were slated to join the 60 had that arrived in the area on Sunday, adding all would spend their time filling and deploying sandbags while helping with emergency evacuations as needed.

""We were very pleased to see support from our Canadian military,"" he said. ""We appreciate it greatly, and you're making a profound difference to the folks here in Bracebridge.""

Smith said that while a drinking water advisory issued by the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit remains in place for those consuming well water, municipal water sources have not been contaminated by the flooding.

Bracebridge was one of three municipalities in the Muskoka District to declare a state of emergency after spring runoff and heavy rainfalls drove water levels to historic highs.

The district declared its own state of emergency for the whole area in addition to the local ones in place in Bracebridge, Huntsville and Muskoka Lakes Township. The community of Minden Hills, east of the Muskoka area, also declared a flooding emergency.

Muskoka Lakes Township issued an update Monday saying water levels had begun to recede in Huntsville and stabilize near Bracebridge, but noted the Moon River had risen 16 centimetres in the past 24 hours. Lakes Muskoka, Rosseau and Joseph rose modestly by between two and six centimetres, the township said.

Despite the slower rise, the township issued a call for volunteers to come fill sandbags for two hours on Monday afternoon. It also urged those living near the Moon River to consider evacuating from their properties.

Ontario Natural Resources Minister John Yakabuski issued a statement of support for cottage-country residents that also outlined measures the Progressive Conservative government previously took in anticipation of higher water levels, including removing logs to ensure water flow and drawing down lakes in the area.

""This is a very challenging time for many residents in Muskoka who are experiencing high water in their community and flooding in their homes,"" Yakabuski said. ""I want to assure residents that my ministry has taken action to mitigate flooding and will continue to do what we can to assist.""

77,77,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Flood insurance difficult to obtain for homeowners at repeated risk - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/flood-insurance-difficult-to-obtain-for-homeowners-at-repeated-risk-1.4409568,"More Canadians have flood insurance than ever, but homeowners at repeated risk still face the most difficulty obtaining coverage, according to lobbyists.

Insurance for “overland flooding,” from rising water levels rather than sewer backups or roof seepage, has only been offered by insurers across the country since 2015. Now, about a third of Canadians have it, according to Craig Stewart of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

But homeowners in high-risk flood zones who may require repeated claims have limited options.

“Presently there really is not affordable high-risk insurance available for those that are going to be at repeated risk of flooding,” said Stewart in an interview with CTV’s Your Morning. Stewart, who leads a task force of insurers, realtors and local governments, presented recommendations to ministers earlier this year on how to protect high-risk homeowners.

“For those that are at repeated risk, we are recommending to governments that they take a hard look at strategic retreat, getting those people out of harm’s way,” he said.

Any official final solution based off the task force recommendations is likely a year away, he added. Until then, homeowners facing repeated risk of flooding have few options, as their needs would have to be subsidized by taxpayers or other policy holders, he said.

Some homeowners in that group have taken “drastic” measures to avoid risk, he said, such as putting their homes on stilts. Stewart recommends it.

“Or you just absolutely reduce your risk by either moving or just making sure you’re taking everything out of your low lying area or your basement that’s going to reduce any future claim,” he said.

According to a 2017 report by the Munk School of Global Affairs, flood-related losses have surpassed fire and theft as the primary source of property insurance claims. Despite increasing claims, a lot of Canadians aren’t even aware they live in a floodplain until they get flooded, said Stewart.

“Canadians first and foremost should understand what their risk level is,” he said.","Mon, 06 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4397915.1556370346!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['homeowners', 'risk', 'claims', 'difficult', 'stewart', 'repeated', 'highrisk', 'canadians', 'flood', 'task', 'obtain', 'flooding', 'insurance']", ,none
78,78,FL-2019-000179-CAN,How brokers can stop a flooded basement - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/how-brokers-can-stop-a-flooded-basement-1004162024/,"A recent study suggests brokers have a golden opportunity to talk to homeowners one-on-one about how to protect homes from basement floods.

With the right information and often for less than $500, homeowners can protect themselves from the increasing risks of basement floods, according to a report from the University of Waterloo. The study suggests homeowners are looking to people they trust — such as brokers — to provide the right information.

“Our project tested the effectiveness of various outreach approaches to motivate residents to address basement flood risk,” said Cheryl Evans, director of the Home Flood Protection Program (HFPP) at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation. “Sending out flyers and posting tips on social media helps to raise awareness, but that is not enough. Residents trust advice from flood-impacted neighbours, insurance providers and even informed staff at hardware stores…

“One-on-one conversations with people they trust make all the difference for many people.”

What information can brokers provide to their clients about basement flooding?

The HFPP studied results from home flood risk assessments completed by flood risk assessors at more than 500 homes in southern Ontario and Saskatchewan in 2017 and 2018. Based on the study, the report reveals the Top 10 ways for homeowners to protect themselves against basement flooding; several of the items cost less than $500 and can be done over the weekend.

Home assessments in Ontario found a number of common issues inside the home, including:

no backup sump pump, or backup power to run the sump pump in case of emergency (85%)

basement furniture and electronics at risk of water damage (71%)

lack of maintenance of backwater valves (53%)

failure to maintain sump pumps (40%)

Outside the home, the assessments revealed:

window wells lower than 10 to 15 cm above grade (82%)

downspouts that deposit water less than two meters from the foundation (78%)

poor grading that directs water towards the foundation (69%)

cracks or gaps in the basement windows (63%)

Homeowners in the study cited cost as the Number 1 reason why they did not complete the repairs or installations necessary to prevent basement floods. But the price tag paled in comparison to the average price to repair a flooded basement — $43,000 in 2018.

Sixty percent of study participants reported completing actions that cost under $500 and could be done by a “handy” homeowner generally within a day. Examples included: storing valuables in waterproof containers or removing them from the basement; cleaning out eavestroughs; installing window well covers; and extending downspouts and sump pump discharge pipes to a minimum of two metres away from the foundation.

Forty percent of participants completed actions that were more complex, costly and often required the support of qualified contractors. The cost of completing these actions ranged widely from $500 to over $10,000. Some of these actions included installing a backwater valve, backup sump pump or backup battery; re-lining or replacing a sewer lateral; installing a sewer lateral cleanout; replacing basement windows; replacing eaves troughs; replacing a driveway; and installing window wells.","Tue, 16 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.canadianunderwriter.ca/uploads/2019/04/Floods.jpg,"['pump', 'homeowners', 'brokers', 'risk', 'sump', '500', 'basement', 'flooded', 'installing', 'replacing', 'flood', 'study', 'stop']", ,none
79,79,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Ontario cuts conservation authority funding for flood programs - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-flooding-cuts-conservation-1.5105897,"Ontario conservation authorities say the provincial government has cut their funding for flood management programs in half.

Conservation Ontario, which represents the province's 36 conservation authorities, said impacts of the cuts will be felt immediately, particularly in smaller and more rural areas.

""Cutting natural hazards funding is particularly problematic right now in light of the fact that — like everywhere else — Ontario is experiencing stronger and more frequent flood events as a result of climate change impacts,"" general manager Kim Gavine said in a statement.

""Using a watershed-based approach, conservation authorities deliver effective and cost efficient flood management programs across the province, partnering for many years with the province, municipalities and others.""

Ontario had given $7.4 million to the conservation authorities for that work, but they say that has now been reduced by 50 per cent.

Conservation authorities forecast flooding and issue warnings, monitor stream flow, regulate development activities in flood plains, educate the public about flooding and protect natural cover that helps reduce the impacts of flooding.

Natural Resources and Forestry Minister John Yakabuski said the government is trying to eliminate the deficit — currently at $11.7 billion — and has asked conservation authorities to focus on their core mandate.

""Flood control is part of that core mandate and we've asked them to focus on that,"" he said.

""Across the province we average less than 10 per cent of conservation authorities' funding. In fact, some of them are as low as 2.5 per cent provincial funding. And we've heard from different conservation authorities across the province that have said that this will not affect their ability to deal with flood management.""

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said it's short-sighted, when a flood on one day in August last year in Toronto cost $80 million in insurable losses.

""I don't think there's any way to reconcile saying, 'Focus on your core mandate and then we're going to cut your core mandate in half,' especially at a moment in time when we know the intensity of storms is going up, the risk of flooding is going up, the costs associated with that are going up,"" he said.

The chief administrative officer of Quinte Conservation said his organization has relied on the province's transfer payment to fund essential flood programs throughout its 6,000 square-kilometre watershed.

""The government has been very clear about its goal to reduce costs, but a 50-per-cent reduction in payments that support government mandated responsibilities will have a significant impact on how we can deliver our programs and services,"" Brad McNevin said in a statement.","Mon, 22 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.4140287.1496264370!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/toronto-islands-flooding.jpg,"['province', 'mandate', 'ontario', 'going', 'funding', 'authorities', 'core', 'conservation', 'cuts', 'authority', 'flood', 'programs']", ,none

81,81,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Updated flood plain maps will send the housing market underwater: Neil Macdonald - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/flood-plains-1.5135336,"Note to outraged conservative readers: this opinion column was not assigned by Katie Telford. (The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

Five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

More on that next week.","Tue, 14 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5121929.1556902478!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ottawa-flooding-20190427.jpg,"['plain', 'housing', 'market', 'risk', 'maps', 'canada', 'underwater', 'updated', 'homes', 'flood', 'feltmate', 'value', 'macdonald', 'send', 'neil', 'insurance', 'begin']", ,none
82,82,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Provinces asking feds for $138 million to help buy out flooded properties - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/provinces-asking-feds-for-138-million-to-help-buy-out-flooded-properties-1.4424615,"OTTAWA -- Flood-ravaged provinces are asking the federal government to provide almost $138 million to move or buy out homeowners affected by previous years' inundations, according to new data that gives a glimpse into the national costs of helping residents leave floodplains.

Calculations based on previous experience suggest that the total cost of giving up on 100,000 of the most endangered structures could run into the billions.

Only four times in the past decade have provinces turned to the federal treasury for help to move homes -- twice in New Brunswick, and once each in Quebec and Yukon.

In New Brunswick's case, the federal government picked up more than 80 per cent of the $1.8 million spent to buy out a combined 36 properties after flooding in 2008 and 2010.

Public Safety Canada says provinces and territories have asked for $137.9 million in federal money to help cover costs related to 10 floods, but the dollar figure is only an estimate and doesn't include this year's.

The department says it expects to get more requests for financial help to relocate homes as the frequency of extreme flooding increases and wants to know how much provinces and territories have spent on it without federal help.

All that data will feed into a debate governments are having about whether it's better to move people off floodplains rather than repeatedly pay for repairs.

Federal help for disaster relief kicks in once costs surpass what lower levels of government could reasonably be expected to cover on their own.

Within the program, called the ""Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements,"" is a provision that allows provinces to claim the cost of relocating residents to areas less prone to floods or other disasters. Federal funding can also be used to buy out affected homeowners and dismantle damaged buildings.

How much gets doled out depends on the design of the buyout program, which has become a point in discussions between Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and his provincial and territorial counterparts.

A program could provide money up to a pre-set maximum, which is what Quebec's government is offering this year -- up to $200,000 to anyone with severe damage to their homes. Or it could pay the full estimated value of a home before it was flooded, as Alberta did after flooding there in 2013.

In that case, about one-third of homeowners who were offered buyouts took them within a year of the offer, costing the province $81 million in 2014. Alberta covered the bill itself, without federal assistance.

Based on the data available, the federal government has paid, on average, about $41,000 for each property owner who accepted previous buyouts in New Brunswick.

This year, New Brunswick is offering up to $160,000 for each home where damage exceeds 80 per cent of its pre-flood value. Owners can sell their buildings and have them demolished and levelled but retain their land. They can also sell out entirely, or take up to $160,000 to use on repairs -- in exchange for giving up any future disaster aid.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates about 100,000 homes -- out of the 14 million dwellings Statistics Canada counted in the 2016 census -- are at the highest risk of repeat flood damage. A buyout program for those properties could cost the federal treasury hundreds of millions of dollars based on the limited information available about previous federal disaster help, in addition to what provincial governments put up.

""No government bailout program or insurance program is going to be able to deal with those repeated cases where you're going to have repeated claims in a short period of time. That's where you may focus buyouts,"" said Craig Stewart, vice-president of federal affairs with the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

""In our view, the calculation is buy out a few and then protect and insure the rest.""","Thu, 16 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4397915.1556370346!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['federal', 'properties', 'buy', 'program', 'asking', 'disaster', 'feds', 'provinces', 'million', 'homes', 'flooded', 'help', 'previous', '138', 'insurance']", ,flood

About 2,800 homes had been struck by flooding as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Public Security officials. Urgence Quebec said more than 1,400 people have been forced out of their homes across the province and some 2,100 properties remain isolated because of washed out roads or landslides.

Authorities said they expected water levels to peak by Wednesday. But flooding risks remain high across southern Quebec, particularly the corridor between the Outaouais area west of Montreal and the Beauce region south of Quebec City.

Public Security Minister Genevieve Guilbault visited Sainte-Marie, Que, in the Beauce area, and met with several mayors of towns affected by the overflowing Chaudiere River.

Several hundred people left their homes in that town and nearly 1,000 residences and commercial buildings were flooded. Last week, Beauceville, just down river, saw its downtown core overrun with water, hitting 230 homes and businesses.

""As you can see, the downtown of Sainte-Marie was badly hit by flooding in the last few days, as well as the Beauce region in general,"" Guilbault said. ""It's a very sad situation and our thoughts are with citizens who've been affected or will be in the coming days.""

About 350 kilometres west of Sainte-Marie, right by the border with Ontario, the mayor of Rigaud said he's warning residents to be prepared to play the long game. ""It's going to be drawn out over several weeks before this is all over,"" said Hans Gruenwald Jr. ""We wish it will be shorter, but that's what it is.""

Rigaud fire chief Daniel Boyer told reporters the rain over the next few days could be telling.

""With the rain that's coming, so far, I think it'll get a little worse,"" Boyer said. He said experts, however, no longer believe the water will rise to historic 2017 levels. ""Is it going to get worse? I hope not, but our job is to get ready for the worst.""

Hundreds of Canadian troops have been deployed to Quebec and New Brunswick to help with flood relief.

84,84,FL-2019-000179-CAN,The province said to lead Canada in physical flood defences - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/catastrophes/province-said-lead-canada-physical-flood-defences-1004133481/,"Half a century after the completion of the Red River Floodway, Manitoba still provides the best examples of overland flood defence work in Canada, the founder of a property loss think tank suggests.

The Manitoba government estimates that the Red River Floodway on the outskirts of Winnipeg – has prevented about $40 billion in flood damage since the project was completed in 1968.

“Manitoba’s leadership has been on the physical protection defensive side,” Paul Kovacs, founder and executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), told Canadian Underwriter Tuesday in an interview. “That’s where they are second to none in Canada.”

Both Manitoba and Ontario are provinces that can serve as an example to Alberta, which was hit five years ago with record flooding that put the Scotiabank Saddledome in Calgary under water. While Manitoba has good flood defences, Ontario’s strength lies in strict zoning regulations that prohibit development in the riskiest areas, noted Kovacs, who founded ICLR.

“More than 250 mm of rain fell over a 36 hour period in the foothills west and southwest of Calgary and began rapidly flowing east through the province’s river valleys,” ICLR noted in a release on Tuesday marking the fifth anniversary of the disaster. “This was the largest riverine flood damage event ever experienced in Canada.”

Economic losses were about $6 billion while insured losses were about $1.7 billion, the Insurance Bureau of Canada reported earlier of the 2013 Southern Alberta floods.

In Winnipeg, which is situated on the confluence of the Assiniboine and Red Rivers, a 1950 flood resulted in damages of about $1 billion (adjusted to today’s dollar) and the evacuation of about 100,000, the Manitoba government reports.

A much larger flood hit Manitoba in 1997, but the number of properties affected was lower because much of the flood water was diverted into the Red River Floodway. In 1997, the Red River Floodway was expanded such that it is now designed to handle a one-in-700 year flood. Before 1997, the Floodway was said to be capable of handling a one-in-160 year flood.

Overland flood was generally not covered on residential property insurance policies until 2015, which is why insurance did not cover most of the economic losses from the 2013 Alberta floods.

Also in 2013, Toronto was hit July 8 by a torrential downpour that caused nearly $1 billion in sewer backup losses. The following year, Burlington, Ont. got hit with nearly seven inches of rain on the Civic Holiday weekend.

“I personally do not believe the Calgary floods, the Toronto floods, the Burlington floods – those are not the big floods,” Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation, said this past April during Climate Change and the Financial Sector, a panel hosted by the Economic Club of Canada. “Those are a prelude to the bigger floods that are coming.”

Canadian society has to adapt to climate change “in quick order,” Feltmate added at the time.","Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.canadianunderwriter.ca/uploads/2017/03/iStock-182772951.jpg,"['hit', 'province', 'defences', 'river', 'manitoba', 'floods', 'insurance', 'canada', 'physical', 'billion', 'flood', 'red', 'floodway', 'lead', 'losses']", ,none

As the earth warms, Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets melt and sea levels rise steadily – just a third of a centimetre a year or so, but it adds up, and it isn’t slowing down.

What will our shorelines look like by the year 2100? Well, it depends – on how much the climate warms, whether air pollution goes on unchecked or reduces, on whether the West Antarctic ice sheet has begun an unstoppable collapse (the maps below assume it hasn’t).

But even under the most cautious scenarios, the shapes of coastal cities will change.

The worst effects will be felt in Asia, where Shanghai, Osaka and Hong Kong are under threat. Globally, 275 million people live below five metres above sea level, and 60 million within a metre.

But some communities on both of Canada’s salt-water coasts will start to feel the effects of rising sea levels, maps produced by Climate Central, a scientific non-profit based in New Jersey, predict.

The maps below show sea levels “locked in” by different levels of carbon pollution.

Here are two places in Canada, thousands of miles apart, that will see serious challenges – and questions about the value of land that may have expensive answers – as the century unfolds.

1. Richmond and Delta, B.C.

Even the most conservative flood maps show Richmond, Delta and parts of rural Abbotsford and Coquitlam permanently underwater by 2100.

But it’s not going to look like that, predicts earth sciences professor John Clague, who teaches earth sciences at Simon Fraser University.

“It ignores the social reality that we protect areas like that from flooding and inundation, which has to be taken into account when we assess the risk that people face from sea level rise.”

Too many people live in the area and there’s nowhere else for them to go, given the constraints of Vancouver’s geography.

Instead, he argues, we are eventually going to be forced to spend billions of dollars on a massive system of flood defences.

“That’s critical real estate,” he says. “It’s home to 250,000 people who live basically at, or close to, sea level. It’s where the international airport is located, and we have one of the largest bulk export facilities in North America located on that surface. There are all sorts of reasons why that surface would be protected.”

“I’m not going to live to see it, but it’s going to be a problem future generations have to face.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""I'm not going to live to see it, but it's going to be a problem future generations have to face.""

A gradual sea level rise of 3.5 millimetres a year is easy to ignore, he says. The crisis would build slowly but express itself in a violent storm, driving the now-raised water levels.

Global warming, in addition to raising sea levels, causes more, and more drastic, storms.

“We don’t know if we’re seeing the largest, most severe storms that we can see. We think that the past is kind of a metric of where we’re going in the future. There are some scientists that think that as oceans warm we could experience unprecedented storms – frequent severe storms.”

“My guess is that we will spend $10 billion, given what’s at stake on that surface. The alternative is to abandon it.”

“But it’s going to cost us a huge amount of money to basically provide protection for the infrastructure and people who live there now.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""But it's going to cost us a huge amount of money to basically provide protection for the infrastructure and people who live there now.""

“You’re talking 250,000 people now, but it’s a rapidly growing municipality. By mid-century, when we’ll have to begin to take action on this, I can imagine it will be double that. So you’re talking half a million people, roughly. And where are they going to go? There isn’t enough space in the Fraser Valley to accommodate that number of climate refugees.”

Whether sea defences would work well into the 22nd century is open to question, though.

“This is kind of a disaster that’s playing out in slow motion, so people wouldn’t take it as seriously as they would the danger of an earthquake, but the implications of this are so large that it does require a concerted effort to deal with it. We can kind of postpone the inevitability of abandoning the present shoreline, but we can’t totally prevent it at some time in the future.”

2. The Tantramar Marsh in New Brunswick

In the 17th century, Acadian settlers in the Maritimes built aboiteaux, earth dams designed to keep the tides out of marshland and turn it into productive farms. One area they settled was the Tantramar Marsh at the top of the Bay of Fundy, between modern-day Sackville, N.B. and Amherst, N.S.

If you’ve gone to or from Nova Scotia by road or rail, chances are you’ve gone though the marsh – the Trans-Canada Highway and the rail line cut a straight line across the flat land, protected by a dyke.

By the end of the century, however, the highway, the marsh (and much of the town of Sackville) may be permanently underwater. Humans may not have taken the land from the sea, in the long run; rather, we borrowed it for a while.

“$45 billion of trade passes through that corridor,” Mount Allison University geography professor David Lieske warns. “Stuff from the port of Halifax passes through our region. It also includes rail, it includes tractor-trailer traffic and just people commuting between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and PEI too, because that corridor is all kind of interconnected.”

Possible solutions include raising the dykes, moving the highway and rail line to a much higher and more massive causeway, or moving the land transport links between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick well to the north, to higher ground.

With the right combination of conditions, storms would combine with higher sea levels and the Bay of Fundy’s enormous tides to create sudden, serious flooding, Lieske says.

“The Bay of Fundy has a high tidal range, one of the highest in the world. The problem comes when you have combinations of events – when you have a typical average high level and then you get stuff piled on top of it.”

Improving the existing dykes might deal with the problem in the medium term.

“You’d be looking at acquiring rural land and modifying the dykes, which would be an investment. That’s a scenario that could buy a window of time. But past a certain point, if you start adding four metres or five metres, you’d be looking at replanning that corridor.”

The land connections could be moved to higher ground, but that route would be longer and more indirect than the modern one.

The first map shows a driving route from Moncton to Halifax today. It takes about two and a half hours.

A route around and above the marshes would add 39 kilometres and 37 minutes to the drive (assuming no new highways were built on new routes that don’t exist now.)

“Total abandonment would be something that would be done at the very end scenario,” Lieske says. “Let’s say you built a causeway, and you found that the cost of maintaining the causeway was unsustainable. So you might try an interim measure, and if flood levels and frequency proved to be so high, you might and up saying ‘We can’t even maintain the corridor.’”

The scenes last year of widespread flooding in Quebec, the Ottawa region and then the ""500-year flood"" in Houston were stark reminders of the risks – and massive human and physical costs – of these natural disasters.

Up to 10 per cent of Canadians live in high-risk flood zones. They live in floodplains, urban areas with inadequate storm-water drainage or in low-lying coastal areas subject to saltwater inundation.

Story continues below advertisement

Mapping of flood risk in Canada is inconsistent and may not be widely available. Many property owners have chosen to live or work in these areas based on inadequate and incomplete historical information. While mapping is improving today with more sophisticated technology, risk mapping and flood-risk information are not managed or distributed under an integrated system.

How is flood-risk managed? Today, it is a combination of public-, private- and personal-risk management. This is still a nascent market for insurers, who have begun to offer flood coverage in Canada over the past two years. Properties in high-risk flood zones are very difficult to insure because of the exceptional risk and, if coverage is available at all, the premiums are usually very expensive as a result.

The perceived availability of disaster relief – de facto free insurance coverage – may deter at-risk property owners from seeking flood insurance in advance. And flood risk is poorly understood by the general public – in a recent survey by the University of Waterloo, only 6 per cent of Canadians surveyed were aware they live in a designated flood-risk area.

Moreover, extreme weather related to climate change appears to be increasing the frequency and severity of flooding events. This trend has enlarged existing flood zones and even created new flood-prone areas previously thought to be risk-free. It is hard to ignore the growing relationship between climate change and the resulting impact of severe flooding events.

There is no easy fix for destruction and damage from flooding. The responsibility and incentives for managing property development and for reducing flood risks are not well aligned. There are differences in property-development management practices between, and even within, provinces. Local governments approve property development, and receive development fees and property taxes. But they do not always assume responsibility for land-use planning nor do they bear the full costs of flood relief.

All orders of government incur costs during immediate disaster response. Canadian government spending on floods and recovery have increased dramatically since 2000, reaching a high of $2-billion in 2013-14. Flood-recovery costs have been projected by the Parliamentary Budget Office to remain high for the federal government, at $700-million annually.

In short, Canada's system for managing flood risk is a patchwork, a legacy built up over time. So where to start improving the flood-risk management system? A number of critical elements ought to be addressed:

Story continues below advertisement

Risk identification and awareness

There is a vital need to raise the ""flood-risk IQ"" of Canadians through education and regular communication on flood risk. A collaborative framework might include a formal program of public education on the risk and costs of flooding, and how it could be better managed.

Risk reduction and mitigation

Policy measures that could be designed and implemented in advance include:

Comprehensive mapping and information-sharing;

Improved land-use planning and building codes;

Investment in flood-prevention infrastructure;

Mitigation by communities and property owners.

It should be emphasized that risk-reduction measures are a necessary, but not sufficient, precondition for improved flood management. Even if all the elements of risk reduction identified here are acted upon, some existing properties in flood zones will remain at risk.

Financial-risk management

Story continues below advertisement

Although the insurance industry is increasing its capacity to provide flood coverage, coverage is uneven and properties in high-risk flood zones are difficult and expensive to insure. A public-private risk-sharing partnership (as has been developed in other countries) that draws on the strengths of all parties will likely be required to improve overall Canadian flood-risk management, while also improving incentives for property owners to mitigate their own specific flood risks. A U.S.-style system, in which the government provides the high-risk flood coverage, but under-funds evenutal liabilities, should be avoided, however.

Disaster management and recovery

It is reasonable to expect Canadian governments to aspire to best-in-class practice for managing disasters, as is the case in many areas of public policy. The ideal goal could be to build a co-ordinated and integrated pan-Canadian response and recovery plan for floods and other potential disasters.

A national conversation on improved flood management has begun among Canadian governments, the insurance industry, academics and think tanks and other stakeholders. This conversation is an important starting point, but much more analysis, discussion, concrete decisions and action will be required if Canada is to reduce the risks and improve the management of flooding.","Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/HlACLqWg2js8Gu9G2u7R5FZ9DTg=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7DOT534JBFC4FGMPAY2WJLZQOQ.JPG,"['coverage', 'zones', 'better', 'risk', 'costs', 'areas', 'floodrisk', 'canada', 'mitigate', 'management', 'flood', 'property', 'flooding']", ,none

Sandbags protecting a neighbourhood in the Lacroix Bay area near Pembroke, Ont. were overwhelmed in recent weeks when the Ottawa River rushed in, leaving residents completely surrounded by water.

Now, they can only access their homes by boat.

“It’s a challenge,” resident Lynda Rose told CTV News. “We all take turns using the boat.”

Rose only visits her home on weekends to drop off groceries and other supplies for her husband, who stayed back to help other residents and care for the family cat.

“The army is in every day. They come in and ... make sure that we have medication -- whatever we need,” she said.

The region declared a state of emergency due to the floods at the end of April. The isolated community is a mix of permanent homes and cottages.

Kevin Collins said the waters just keep rising.

“It will take two weeks to even go down to 2017 levels where you might be able to start using the road again,” he said.

How quickly the waters recede will depend on how much it rains, and more is in the forecast.

The Ottawa River Regulating Committee said on Saturday that residents of the Mattawa area could face even higher water levels this weekend. Levels are expected to peak on Saturday in Pembroke, Westmeath and Lac Coulonge.

The City of Pembroke declared a state of emergency on Thursday and soldiers from a nearby base were deployed Saturday to protect homes. Soldiers worked together to build a sandbag wall at a park near the water.

About 25 homes are at risk. Shawn Bergeron’s is one of them. His family built a retaining wall around their home after flooding in 2017, but now the wall is under water.

“It’s very scary,” he said.

Last night, the Bergerons received news that their insurance will not be renewed.

“Knock on wood we don’t need it,” he said. “But it’s just a kick in the you-know-where at the wrong time.”

The province's Emergency Measures Organization says that while water levels are slowly dropping along the Saint John River, communities from Fredericton to Saint John remain above flood stage.

Heavy rain caused the river level to rise slightly in Fredericton on Saturday night, but the forecast is for it to fall below flood stage by Thursday.

Greg MacCallum, the provincial EMO director, said it's important that people remain patient.

""The precipitation that we got has to work its way through the system. It's a slow thing to get this much water out of the river basin, so we once again are asking people to be patient,"" MacCallum said Sunday.

The Trans-Canada Highway remains closed between Oromocto and River Glade, forcing motorists travelling between Fredericton and Moncton to make a long detour through Saint John.

EMO spokesman Geoffrey Downey said while water levels are dropping, a lot of debris on the highway still has to be removed before it can reopen.

Ahmed Dassouki of the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure said there were 84 road closures across the province as of Sunday afternoon.

Even though water has begun to recede, he warned people against driving on flooded routes.

""They could be undermined, or there could be debris. You don't know what's down there,"" he said.

MacCallum cautioned residents from trying to return to their homes or check on cottages too soon. He said it is still not safe to be on the water.

""We don't want people putting themselves in harm's way and compounding the problem by making a move too early.""

He said some homeowners may be worried about looting, but that has not been an issue.

""I want to reassure people that in those areas where people have evacuated -- even if it is just the occasional homes -- we are maintaining a security presence on boats throughout the day and night,"" MacCallum said.

So far this year, 437 households comprising 1,095 individuals have registered for help with the Canadian Red Cross, and 487 of those people have been given accommodation in hotels. Other evacuees have opted to stay with family and friends.

The Red Cross has begun distributing free household clean-up kits.

Bill Lawlor, New Brunswick director of the Canadian Red Cross, said a fundraising effort was launched Friday, but he didn't know how much was raised over the weekend. A similar effort last year raised $1.6 million.

""Each household, if they were evacuated, received $300 of emergency cash injection to help offset some of the expenses incurred through their displacement. In the second round, a smaller number of families received $975 that was more of a transition and returning back to your home,"" he said.

Lawlor said in the third round, which is still underway, eligible households could received up to $50,000 to help repair and rebuild.

He said the third round has taken time to process because homeowners must first determine what they could get in disaster financial assistance and insurance.

Members of the military have been assisting with flood efforts in New Brunswick by helping to fill sandbags and provide access to flooded areas.

""I'm going up in the mountains,"" Robert said Tuesday in Sainte-Marie, in Quebec's Beauce region.

""I won't have to deal with this anymore. There comes a time when you have to take a decision and move to higher ground. Forget about the river, and start all over again.""

Climate change means floods like those that have devastated parts of Quebec this spring are likely to become increasingly common — and everything from viewing riverfront property as prime real estate to the way bridges are constructed will need to be re-examined.

For a tenant like Robert, it's easy enough to walk away.

For people whose dreams and life savings are tied up in a home built on a flood plain, leaving home for good is a tougher sell.

Enticement to leave

Quebec Premier François Legault tried to make that decision a little easier earlier this week, when he toured Pointe-Gatineau, a flood-damaged neighbourhood of Gatineau on the Ottawa River across from Canada's capital.

Legault said the province will offer a cumulative total of $100,000 to any home damaged by flooding — effectively putting a lifetime limit on government compensation. Alternatively, the province will offer residents up to $200,000 to give up their homes.

Quebec Premier François Legault said the province will limit the lifetime compensation it will pay for flooded properties to $100,000 — and give homeowners the option of walking away and pocketing up to $200,000. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

While Legault stopped short of saying there would be any mandatory evictions, the increased likelihood of flooding means living by a river will be problematic over the long term, said Pascale Biron, a professor of geography, planning and environment at Concordia University.

""They are flooded, and that's costing a lot of money for all of us, because at the end of the day we compensate as a society,"" Biron said.

""In addition, it's preventing water from being stored naturally in these areas. So really, encouraging these people to move from these critical areas will be beneficial to the people living downstream.""

The idea is to provide ""freedom space for rivers"" in the form of parks or wetlands, she said. The term is used by geographers to denote an area naturally equipped to absorb flood waters.

Flooding vs. property taxes

Experts have for years been warning about the potential consequences of building on flood plains. But municipalities have been reluctant to shut down a source of property tax revenue.

Now, though, it appears a shift is underway.

Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said Tuesday her city and surrounding municipalities are looking at ensuring neighbourhoods are more ""resilient"" when it comes to flooding.

""We're looking at water parks and doing landscaping in a certain way,"" she said. ""But it's not a one-fit-for-all, let's put it that way. We need to be cautious about that.""

At the federal level, Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne said he is willing to fast-track reviews of projects that could help communities in Quebec and elsewhere deal with floods as part of an offer to provinces and cities.

Rethinking the riverside

Daniel Oligny, the head of a consulting firm that helps municipalities with emergency preparedness services, agreed towns and cities were readier this year for potential flooding. Critical questions remain, however.

""We will have to redefine the way we manage the urbanization of our cities and communities,"" he said.

""We will have to think, what is our relationship with the rivers? Where can I live while seeing the river without being on the river?""

While planning has been better this time, Biron said the government still needs to come up with a clear approach to flooding, overseen by a single ministry.

Right now, the ministries of Public Security, Environment and Municipal Affairs all play a role.

""It's more difficult to have a coherent plan when you are splitting the various tasks in relation to flood preparedness,"" Biron said.

Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault said the Quebec government will explore all options, after the water recedes.

""It's certainly not today that we'll be making those sorts of decisions,"" she said Tuesday, on a tour of the flood damage in Sainte-Marie.

""But if there are things that can be done, obviously we'll do them,"" said Guilbault.

While sandbags are the most commonly used line of defence against invading water -- due to their relatively low cost and availability -- they’re not always the most reliable, according to flood management experts.

The sandbags can become saturated with water if they’re exposed to it for too long, Tamsin Lyle, a principal engineer at Ebbwater Consulting, told The Canadian Press last month. She said the sandbags become relatively ineffective during prolonged flooding events and they can easily spring leaks.

So what are the alternatives?

When the Ottawa River reached historic highs at the end of April, a couple of neighbours in the hard-hit community of Cumberland, located in Ottawa’s east end, pooled their resources to buy an aqua dam.

The large rubber tube fills with floodwater to provide a protective barrier, but it’s not cheap.

The neighbours spent $70,000 to purchase the aqua dam and the investment appears to have paid off, as the homes remained relatively dry with only minor flood damage in the basements.

“The barricade seems to be holding up very well,” Genevieve Landry told CTV News Ottawa of the aqua dam they purchased.

The aqua dam also appears to be more convenient, only taking approximately 45 minutes to fill a 30-metre section.

The Cumberland residents are not the only ones trying out the rubber tubes. The province of Manitoba spent millions of dollars on 300 aqua dams to use during the devastating floods there in 2011. Arranged side-by-side, the rubber tubes would have covered nine kilometres of land.

The city of Courtenay, B.C., located on the east coast of Vancouver Island, bought its first aqua dam in 2015.

“It’s probably, compared to some of the other things we could do, a much lower cost, and if it works, a beneficial sort of system,” Mayor Larry Jangula said.

Back in Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson said it’s up to the province to purchase protective flood barrier equipment, such as aqua dams.

On the national level, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale entertained the idea while visiting the aqua dam in Cumberland.

“It obviously seems to have performed remarkably well for one particular neighbourhood so yes, we need to look at all of those possible innovations for the future,” he told reporters last week.

Landry said she welcomes the government taking inspiration from the aqua dam she purchased with her neighbour.

“Clearly, our government or authorities are seeing this as a priority as an urgency,” she said.","Tue, 07 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4403427.1556729681!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['told', 'ottawa', 'water', 'future', 'tubes', 'sandbags', 'preventative', 'canada', 'rubber', 'aqua', 'relatively', 'flood', 'dams', 'tools', 'flooding', 'dam', 'exploring']", ,flood

Twenty per cent of Surrey, B.C.could be under water according to current long-term climate forecasts, so Mayor Linda Hepner is pursuing a flood adaptation plan to protect her coastal city.

Estimating the plan at $1.5 billion dollars, the economic and political cost is high. But with the existing dikes safeguarding Surrey, B.C., predicted to fail by 2070, she sees no alternative.

""We are very vulnerable, and our planning of over 100 years ago — the features that worked well then — will not protect us and did not anticipate the demand that climate change is bringing.""

With the effects of climate change being felt across the country, the old systems for managing extreme weather are proving inadequate. And with flooding being the most costly of natural disasters in terms of property damage, the stakes for its proper planning are particularly high.

But ecologist and environmental policy analyst Gord Miller says the unpredictability of weather in an era of climate change demands a rethinking of how we manage extreme weather, and this includes, in some circumstances, accepting inevitable flooding.

'The numbers are no good'

For about half a century, engineers planned their cities' flood prevention systems in a straightforward manner. Predictable rainfall patterns allowed for statistical calculations about how best to build.

FLOODING FACTS About 20 per cent of Canadian households are at a high risk of flooding.

In 2017, floods caused over $590 million in insured damage across Canada. This doesn't include the financial costs to governments and Canadians without flood insurance.

Flooding is now the most costly hazard in terms of urban property damage, surpassing fire and theft as the main source of property insurance claims.

""They'd say ... 'here is the height of the bridge we should make. And here is the size of the flood plain we would expect for a storm once every 100 years'. They had a really good handle on that and they could design things for … a statistically predictable climate,"" he told The Current.

Miller says flooding hasn't been a problem in the last few decades because of the success of this planning system — but that's changing.

With sea-level rise and more extreme weather, existing infrastructure is rapidly becoming out of date.

But the point Miller emphasizes is this statistical approach to flooding management — the way in which we have weathered the storm for so long — does not suit our new climate of weather instability.

""It's not just that the climate has changed, it is changing and continuing to change … The reality is five years from now [an engineer's] best guess is no good because the climate continues to change and alter in unpredictable ways.""

What is predictable is the significant financial cost Canadians will incur from increased flooding. Expanding flood plains mean declining housing values. Over the next five years, flooding is expected to cost the federal government's disaster assistance fund more than $650 million a year.

Chatham, Ont., was the latest Canadian community to suffer massive flooding.

""You can't take comfort as we did for most of my life that these strange and serious floods won't affect most of us. In fact they're going to affect far more of us than ever before and we can't really predict where and when it's going to happen,"" said Miller.

How do we address the problem of flooding — how do make long-term plans — if the future remains a haze?

Miller says we have to adapt our approach and adjust our expectations.

Reconsidered and redesigned

In Surrey, Mayor Linda Hepner is looking to improve dike control and sea damming. She is considering building sea barriers or small islands along the coast to mitigate flooding. Hepner admits these large-scale infrastructure projects will be ""expensive,"" but figures it's cost effective in the long-run.

""The cost of not investing will be far more damaging and far more disruptive,"" she told host Anna Maria Tremonti.

But Miller says the we need to be ""extra cautious"" about where we spend our money in our new weather climate.

""For many years we've been really confident that what we were building was going to be safe for a 100 years. Now we can't be confident,"" he told The Current.

Thirty years ago we'd say 'we can pretty well protect you from flooding.' Now we have to say, 'no we have to make you resilient to the flooding that's apt to come at any time.' - Gord Miller

Miller concedes there are ""key areas"" that need to be reconsidered and redesigned. But he says that has to accompany a change in planning that accepts inevitable flooding.

""Thirty years ago we'd say 'we can pretty well protect you from flooding.' Now we have to say, 'no, we have to make you resilient to the flooding that's apt to come at any time.'""

""Let's make sure that we spend money on the main roads, where to have the ambulances and fire trucks running for instance, right? Let's make sure that we have the main key bridges high enough and strong enough.""

Surrey Mayor Linda Hepner is taking action to fight flooding the age of climate change. (CBC)

Mayor Hepner has incorporated resilience into her planning. In what she calls ""manage retreat,"" one adaption strategy begins from the starting point that key areas in Surrey will not be able to avoid flooding.

Considering the magnitude of these changes, Hepner says community engagement is essential.

""It's very tough. But it's the reality that we're living in. And making sure that we bring our residents along as we're developing our plan is really fundamentally important. Our residents have very well received the kind of process we're going through and I think that is critical to those that are looking at adaptation plans.""

Hepner is also working with stakeholders to move adaptation plans forward, but she says in terms of the economics, municipal communities will not be able to do it alone.

""We have to come up with the plan and then we'll process our plan options with those governments that are more senior than local — in terms of what it's going to cost — because it is not going to be able to be absorbed by a local government.""

92,92,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Drone footage shows extent of flooding in Ontario cottage country as further rain looms - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-cottage-country-rainfall-warning-environment-canada-1.5116321,"Officials are warning communities in Ontario's cottage country that more devastating flooding could be on the way Wednesday as thousands of residents are ""fighting a pretty tough battle"" to save their homes.

Environment Canada issued a rainfall warning for the Muskoka Region on Tuesday, saying localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible. The alert covers Bracebridge and Huntsville, part of which are already under water as a result of surging lakes and rivers.

Here's what the flooding in Bracebridge looks like CBC News Toronto 0:58 Bracebridge is one of several Ontario cottage country communities that have declared an emergency over the last week due to record-breaking flood conditions. 0:58

Between 20 and 35 millimetres of rain could fall by Thursday morning, and that's in addition to a marginal amount of snow and ice pellets expected due to plummeting temperatures.

The ground, already saturated following days of heavy rains, has limited ability to absorb more water, the federal agency cautioned.

Water levels along rivers and lakes in Bracebridge have already climbed beyond heights seen during 2013 — the last time the community was hit by significant flooding that submerged numerous roads and properties.

Bracebridge Mayor Graydon Smith predicts the number of houses and seasonal properties inundated by the floods will ""easily exceed"" those in 2013.

During that time, about 1,092 permanent residences and some 1,020 seasonal properties were affected. Smith could not provide specific figures for the current flooding, but did say they're waiting for aerial support to catalogue the damage.

Worst believed to be over

Flows in the Muskoka River strengthened over the weekend, threatening homes and cottages along its banks.

The rapid rise of floodwaters, however, had started to subside Monday in the north branch of the Muskoka River, authorities said. Dry weather over the last few days offered a chance for conditions to stabilize somewhat.

Lake Muskoka has risen six centimetres in the last 24 hours, but authorities say the flooding situation there has begun to subside. (Lorenda Reddekopp/CBC)

At a news conference on Tuesday, Smith called the slowing of the water a relief, saying he believes the worst of the washout is over but water levels remain extremely high.

""It's expected right now that any amount of rain will raise Lake Muskoka a marginal amount, but because outflows are matching inflows at this point ... hopefully the impacts will be marginal,"" he said on Tuesday.

The north branch of the Muskoka River flows through the downtown core before it meets the south branch and drains into Lake Muskoka.

The rapid rise of water in the south branch and lake has crested. But water upstream filtering down along the bloated river is still causing headaches for nearby residents. Homes in this area have suffered the most, Smith said.

Flood conditions are expected to linger until the end of the week, he continued.

""We are hoping that we don't see as much rain as is forecast.""

4 communities under state of emergency

Bracebridge is one of several cottage country communities that have declared an emergency over the last week due to record-breaking flood conditions. The others include Huntsville, Minden Hills and Muskoka Lakes.

A group of reservists with the Canadian Armed Forces fanned out across Bracebridge on Sunday afternoon to fill and distribute sandbags, and help authorities traverse across water-laden roads that are currently impassable to most passenger vehicles.

Currently, some 100 troops are doing flood mitigation work in the town's hardest-hit areas that sit adjacent to the Muskoka River. Another 60 military personnel are expected to arrive this afternoon.

Reservists have helped fill some 45,000 sandbags and distribute them to vulnerable residents. (Fred Thornhill/Canadian Press)

Large swaths of the shoreline in the Beaumont Drive area, where the river funnels into the lake, have begun to disappear from erosion, Smith explained.

""We probably won't have a full scope of the changes that Mother Nature has decided to make in the river until the waters recede.""

Authorities have amassed roughly 45,000 sandbags for vulnerable residents to use to barricade their properties likely to be affected by more flooding.

""There is a concern that the ground water might swell again and we're trying to get sandbag walls up in front of people's houses to protect them in the event that the water levels rise,"" Lt.-Col. Graham Walsh said on Tuesday.

Officials in the neighbouring township of Muskoka Lakes advised residents near the Moon River on Monday to evacuate their homes voluntarily.

Water levels in the Moon River have climbed 16 centimetres in the past 24 hours.

Poor watershed management to blame

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry is responsible for controlling water levels in the lakes, and Muskoka Lakes Mayor Phil Harding blames poor management and negligence for allowing spring floodwaters to become dangerous.

""If the water levels are kept higher at times, the risk and chance of flooding is great,"" he said in an interview with CBC Radio's Ontario Morning.

The Muskoka Watershed Management Plan hasn't been updated since 2006 to reflect changing watershed conditions and climate change.

There have now been four major floods throughout the Muskoka Region since 2010.

After the devastating floods in 2013, Harding said communities in the area appealed to the province to revise the Muskoka River Water Management Plan.

""We identified some significant limitations within it and part of that is some physical choke points that water cannot move through the system fast enough,"" said Harding.

The previous Liberal government was slated to update the document in 2016, but instead extended the plan by five years.

Harding says he is looking to the Progressive Conservatives to ""step up and really help"" overhaul the region's flood management system.

Province cuts funding for flood programs

Ontario Natural Resources Minister John Yakabuski outlined measures the province has taken to combat spring flooding as a result of higher water levels. This included removing logs to improve water flow and drawing down lakes in the Muskoka Region.

""Every precaution was taken by officials,"" he told Ontario Morning.

""Once all the logs are removed there's nothing you can do to increase the rate of draw down. It's whatever nature will allow. You can only push down what the system below it will accept.""

Bracebridge declared a state of emergency last week, warning residents that the current situation is more than a typical spring thaw. (Jean-Francois Morissette/CBC)

Since he took office in November, Yakabuski says he has not received any requests to review the Muskoka River Water Management Plan.

""It's wonderful to think that this could have been prevented, but Mother Nature has quite frankly thrown us a huge curve this year,"" he said. ""Right now we're doing what we can to deal with the situation at hand.""

Last week, Premier Doug Ford said climate change is among the reasons that much of the province is under water.

The Ford government recently slashed funding for Ontario flood management programs in half when it delivered its first budget.

The decision has drawn sharp criticism from several politicians and environmentalists.

Conservation Ontario, which represents the province's 36 conservation authorities, has said the impacts of the cuts will be felt immediately, particularly in smaller and more rural communities.

At Queen's Park on Monday, Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner told reporters the move is short-sighted, when the province is experiencing stronger and more frequent flood events that are fuelled by climate change.

The premier surveyed flooded areas in Ottawa last week. Ford, whose family has a cottage near Bracebridge, vowed the province will do everything it can to support communities in the Muskoka Region. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

Meanwhile, Official Opposition Leader Andrea Horwath said she fears Ontario communities will increasingly face flooding problems as a result of the cuts. She said the conservation authorities will no longer have the tools to develop or keep up with climate change.

""You can't say that you agree that climate change exists and then take away flood management planning capacity for municipalities, and take away the 50 million tree plan, and take away the things that actually help us to mitigate the climate change results,"" she said on Monday.

""It makes no sense whatsoever... We're going from bad to worse when it comes to climate change.""

The government is insisting the decision will not hamper flood management efforts because conservation authorities receive other sources of money. Yakabuski points out the province contributes less than 10 per cent to their overall funding structure.","Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5114544.1556471976!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bracebridge-flooding-water.JPG,"['cottage', 'communities', 'management', 'extent', 'rain', 'muskoka', 'flooding', 'footage', 'flood', 'drone', 'looms', 'water', 'levels', 'ontario', 'shows', 'climate', 'river', 'week', 'country']", ,flood

Around 300 people turned out to a meeting with provincial officials Tuesday night to get a sense of how a new provincial program will compensate them to either make repairs to their homes or walk away from them.

""I lived through it … two years ago. I'm living it through it now. I don't want to go through this again,"" said Louise David, who put $47,000 worth of work into her home on rue René in Pointe-Gatineau after the 2017 floods.

Others in her neighbourhood weren't allowed to rebuild, with the city holding public consultations on what it should do with that land this winter.

After two floods in three years, David said she doesn't believe she'll be able to sell her home again and plans to walk away.

""Give me the money and I'll run to the bank. I'll buy a condo, very high up,"" she said.

""[$250,000] in my pocket is better than zero in my pocket and having to live through this again.""

Louise David says she's ready to walk away from her home and is hoping for a buyout from the province so she can move to higher ground. (Kimberley Molina/CBC)

Under a new provincial program, the Quebec government is offering up to $100,000 to homeowners for flood damage compensation or a $200,000 buyout for them to move outside flood areas.

The province can also compensate residents an extra $50,000 for the land around their homes, said Mathieu Lévesque, the MNA for Chapleau.

Anyone who chooses money to repair their home won't be eligible for future renovation compensation, he said, though they could be eligible for the buyout if another flood occurs.

Appointments with claims officer begin Wednesday in temporary offices at the Campeau Arena on rue des Sables.

MNA Mathieu Lévesque says the repair and buyout are one-time offers, though if you take the repair money it doesn't stop you from taking a buyout in another flood. (Raphael Tremblay/Radio-Canada)

Louise Duplessis is also looking for a buyout for her home on boulevard Hurtubise.

She said she had planned to walk away from her property after the 2017 floods but a deal with the government for a buyout never materialized.

She's now been told she'll have to restart her claim.

""We have to start at zero once again and we do not have the capacity or the energy to redo all this,"" she said.

She's lived in Gatineau since 1991 but doesn't know where she'll go if she gets a buyout, but knows she can't stay where she lives now.

Her home needs to be lifted and the foundation repaired for $260,000, she said, far more than the $100,000 she might be eligible for.

""We have no choice. At my age I cannot start with a debt of $100,000 or $60,000 and that's how much damage I have.""

So how can homebuyers reduce the risk that the biggest investment of their lives will at some point end up under water?

You wouldn’t necessarily know it from the headlines. With extreme weather events now happening with alarming frequency, flooding is becoming increasingly common, even for homes that are nowhere close to waterways. And a basement flooded by sewer backup after a torrential downpour wouldn’t make the news.

READ MORE: Flooding, flooding everywhere – do Canadians have insurance for it?

Flooding has overtaken fire as the No. 1 cause of home insurance payouts, with claims for flooded basements averaging $43,000 in major cities. And yet, there isn’t much in Canada that would help homebuyers assess that risk, says Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

Home inspectors aren’t trained to spot flood risks

A home inspection, for example, will likely tell you little about whether you should waterproof the basement or regrade the perimeter of your future home so that the water flows away from the foundations.

“Home inspectors receive virtually zero training on flood risk assessment,” Feltmate told Global News.

And the process of changing that is just getting underway. Feltmate’s own Intact Centre is developing a flood-risk crash course for home inspectors that will be rolled out in Ontario this September and throughout Canada at the beginning of next year.

Municipal flood plain maps are usually outdated

Large municipalities and conservation authorities across Canada generally have maps that prospective homebuyers can ask to see to check whether a property lies in a known floodplain.

But those drawings are often 25 to 30 years old and woefully out of date, Feltmate said.

The Trudeau government just released guidelines to harmonize flood maps across Canada last year.

Homesellers don’t necessarily have to tell you about past flooding

Don’t think your homeseller will let you know about past floods. Often, the onus of finding that out lies squarely with the homebuyer.

Story continues below advertisement

Editor’s note: The following sentence has been modified to reflect the fact that homesellers have an obligation to disclose latent defects.

In general, homesellers have an obligation to disclose so-called latent defects, including those that “wouldn’t be readily identifiable by a reasonable person doing an inspection of the property,” said Michael Abrams, an Ottawa-based lawyer at Kelly Santini.

“If [a home] floods every spring and [homebuyers] are looking at the property in July, it might not be readily apparent that there is a flooding issue. But if the seller is aware of it and it happens on a regular basis, then that’s something they’d have an obligation to disclose,” Abrams said.

And homesellers can’t lie if you ask them direct questions, he added.

“There’s a duty of good faith that exists that you have to provide complete and truthful answers to those questions.”

READ MORE: Here’s how much climate change can cost homeowners in damages

But homeowners don’t have to volunteer information about properties that are located in a known floodplain or an instance of flooding, whether it was from overland water seeping in through doors and windows or old city regurgitating sewage into the basement.

Story continues below advertisement

Those, at least, are the common-law principles that apply throughout Canada, Abrams said. Each province has its own regulations on the matter, and private law in Quebec is governed by French-inspired civil law.

What homebuyers can do

Canada is catching up when it comes to flood insurance, with a growing number of insurers now providing both sewer-backup and overland insurance, which are generally treated as additional coverage.

But buying flood insurance is no substitute for doing your due diligence before signing on the dotted line. A growing number of homes throughout Canada are becoming uninsurable due to repeated instances of flooding, Feltmate said. And even a single instance of water seeping through your basement drains could lead to drastically higher insurance premiums or denial of further coverage, as Global News has previously reported.

Your best bet? Asking pointed questions of homesellers and their neighbours.

“Spend time in the community,” Feltmate said. The extra legwork could really pay off in the long term.

Federal and provincial ministers responsible for emergency management have been discussing the growing cost of natural disasters, and how to build infrastructure to better withstand extreme weather, Goodale said.

Quebec's premier has also opened the discussion about offering homeowners financial incentives to move.

François Legault said his government would compensate homeowners in neighbourhoods such as Pointe-Gatineau up to $100,000 for flood damage, but $200,000 to move to higher, dryer ground.

Could the federal government offer similar incentives?

""We're not taking anything off the table at this stage,"" Goodale said.

Should people be allowed to build on flood plains? CBC News Ottawa 1:02 Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says all levels of government are responsible for managing flood plains, though Mayor Jim Watson said the City of Ottawa couldn't afford to offer buyouts to residents. 1:02

The case for buyouts

Buyouts should be ""an essential part of the toolkit"" for managing flood risk, according to Daniel Henstra, a political science professor at the University of Waterloo who studies climate change adaptation and emergency management policies.

""The upfront cost of a buyout program, although high, is undoubtedly less than the long-term costs of repeatedly rebuilding properties in high-risk areas when we know they're going to flood again,"" Henstra told Ottawa Morning.

Henstra said the voluntary buyout Quebec is offering is a good start.

""For many people ... the offer probably won't be enough to cover their mortgage. But I do suspect that many who have been flooded multiple times would jump at the opportunity.""

Alberta offered similar voluntary buyouts after the extensive flooding in 2013, and Henstra said about one-third of eligible homeowners took the province up on the offer.

For those unwilling to leave, Henstra said governments will need to have ""tough conversations"" about the conditions under which they're allowed to stay.

We're human. I keep saying my community is the most resilient, but at some point it's a little bit too much. - Coun . Eli El-Chantiry

Instead, Watson said such a buyout would have to come from the Ontario government.

""If this is going to happen every couple of years, it's extremely stressful on the families and it's very expensive for governments,"" Watson said while surveying the flood damage in Fitzroy Harbour earlier this week.

John Yakabuski, the MPP for Renfew–Nipissing–Pembroke, said those discussions will happen.

""I think there will be a good opportunity when this disaster has been dealt with,"" Yakabuski told Ottawa Morning.

Local rules

In Ottawa, developers aren't allowed to build within the boundaries of a one-in-100-year flood plain, which are mapped by local conservation authorities.

The story is different for existing homes, which would typically have to be rebuilt on the same footprint, in the same location. Residents affected by the 2017 floods were given special permission to rebuild in such a way that their homes would be safer from future flooding.

Now, after the second flood in two years and last fall's destructive tornadoes, some west end homeowners are wondering if they should bother trying again.

Their councillor, Eli El-Chantiry, said some residents have had enough.

The first thing to know: most home insurance policies don't include flood insurance at all, explained Pete Karageorgos, director of consumer and industry relations with the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

Since about 2013, when Toronto experienced a record-breaking storm that flooded hundreds of basements, insurance companies have begun offering overland flood insurance, ""typically as an add-on,"" said Karageorgos.

In other words, if you didn't sign up for it, it's likely you don't have it.

Are you covered after a flood? News 4:28 While most Canadians pay home insurance, many don't know they're probably not covered for this kind of disaster 4:28

Karageorgos points to a 2016 flood in Windsor and Tecumseh, Ont., to illustrate how expensive flooding can be for homeowners — and how common it is for people to be caught unaware by their lack of coverage.

""In many cases there weren't policies that had flood insurance, and those that did, there were usually limits,"" he said.

One Windsor resident's house sustained about $50,000 of damage, but his insurance policy only covered one-fifth of that.

Don't be fooled by wording, cautions Karageorgos: many policies might list coverage for water damage, but that refers to incidents like burst pipes or overflowing toilets, not severe weather and flooding.

He said homeowners should also be aware that if water is entering the basement by a crack in the foundation, for example, it falls under the category of seepage and could signal a maintenance issue that would also prevent an insurance payout.

Few Canadians know their flood risk

The introduction of overland flooding insurance to the Canadian market is having another effect, said Jason Thistlethwaite, director of University of Waterloo's Climate Change Adaptation Project: Canadians are less likely to qualify for federal government disaster assistance.

Federal legislation, he explained, stipulates that if ""insurance is readily and reasonably available,"" then you don't qualify for disaster assistance — even if you never actually purchased the insurance, or didn't even know it existed.

""That language is interpreted differently by the provinces, but it's confusing and it's inconsistent, and it can be taken advantage of in the aftermath of a flood event,"" he said.

Thistlethwaite is concerned that few Canadians have been given the opportunity to opt into overland flood insurance and that many are confused about what their policies cover.

His university conducted a survey of 2,300 Canadians about how they perceived flood risk, finding that 70 per cent of respondents had not been approached by their insurance provider about overland flood insurance.

They also found very few homeowners saw themselves as being at risk or knew if they were covered or not, ""despite the fact that we know for the next 50 years that flood risk is going to increase.""

There's a small silver lining though, at least if you live in Ontario — the provincial government is available to provide some disaster assistance.

""What Ontario has said is that their disaster assistance programs will cover costs that are not covered by insurance,"" said Thistlethwaite.

But that won't mean restoring your home to its previous lustre. ""This is bare minimum replacement costs,"" he said.

""There's an incredible amount of paperwork, red tape and delays. … It pays to call up your insurance company.""

Problem will get worse, so be prepared

Extreme weather is expected to increase substantially in the next half-century, leading Karageorgos and Thistlethwaite to urge that people review their policies carefully and take steps themselves to protect from flooding.

Short-term actions to mitigate damage include pointing downspouts away from the house foundation, taking valuables out of the basement, and making sure sump pumps are working and that you have a backup in case the power goes out.

Thistlethwaite also recommends a list of large-scale actions including renovating with flood-resistant materials and raising the electrical box or heating materials to the second floor.

If all that sounds expensive, consider the cost of extreme weather in Canada so far.

Between 1983 and 2008, natural disasters cost about $100 million, said Karageorgos. Since 2009, ""it's gone up 400 per cent.""","Sat, 06 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.3785640.1572282483!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wdr-flooded-basement-windsor-flooding.JPG,"['wont', 'disaster', 'weather', 'floods', 'covered', 'overland', 'canadians', 'flood', 'likely', 'basement', 'karageorgos', 'protect', 'policies', 'insurance', 'know']", ,none

Associated Press

CHAMPLAIN, N.Y. - They have come from all over the United States, piling out of taxis, pushing strollers and pulling luggage, to the end of a country road in the north woods.

Where the pavement stops, they pick up small children and lead older ones wearing Mickey Mouse backpacks around a ""road closed"" sign, threading bushes, crossing a ditch, and filing past another sign in French and English that says ""No pedestrians."" Then they are arrested.

Seven days a week, 24 hours a day, migrants who came to the U.S. from across the globe — Syria, Congo, Haiti, elsewhere — arrive here where Roxham Road dead-ends so they can walk into Canada, hoping its policies will give them the security they believe the political climate in the United States does not.

""In Trump's country, they want to put us back to our country,"" said Lena Gunja, a 10-year-old from Congo, who until this week had been living in Portland, Maine. She was traveling with her mother, father and younger sister. ""So we don't want that to happen to us, so we want a good life for us. My mother, she wants a good life for us.""

The passage — just across Lake Champlain and a little north of Burlington, Vermont — has become so crowded this summer that Canadian police set up a reception center on their side of the border. The center is in the Quebec community of Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, about 30 miles south of Montreal, or almost 300 miles north of New York City.

It includes tents that have popped up in the past few weeks, where migrants are processed before they are turned over to the Canada Border Services Agency, which handles their applications for refuge.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are adding electricity and portable toilets. A Canadian flag stands just inside the first tent, where the Mounties search the immigrants they've just arrested and check their travel documents. They are also offered food. Then shuttle buses take the processed migrants to their next destination. Trucks carry their luggage separately.

The Canadian military said Wednesday that about 100 soldiers began arriving to prepare a site for tents to accommodate almost 500 people. The soldiers will also install lighting and heating equipment.

How this spot, not even an official border crossing, became the favored place to cross into Canada is anyone's guess. But once migrants started going there, word spread on social media.

Under the 2002 Safe Country Agreement between the United States and Canada, migrants seeking asylum must apply to the first country they arrive in. If they were to go to a legal port of entry, they would be returned to the United States and told to apply there.

But, in a quirk in the application of the law, if migrants arrive in Canada at a location other than a port of entry, such as Roxham Road, they are allowed to request refugee status there.

Many take buses to Plattsburgh, New York, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south. Some fly there, and others take Amtrak. Sometimes taxis carry people right up to the border. Others are let off up the road and have to walk, pulling their luggage behind them.

Used bus tickets litter the pavement, their points of origin mostly blurred by rain that fell on nights previous. One read ""Jacksonville.""

One Syrian family said they flew into New York City on tourist visas and then went to Plattsburgh, where they took a taxi to the border.

The migrants say they are driven by the perception that the age of Republican President Donald Trump, with his ban on travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries, means the United States is no longer the destination of the world's dispossessed. Taking its place in their minds is the Canada of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a member of his country's Liberal Party.

Most of the people making the crossing now are originally from Haiti. The Trump administration said this year it planned to end in January a special humanitarian program enacted after the 2010 earthquake that gave about 58,000 Haitians permission to stay temporarily in the U.S.

Walking toward the border in a group on Monday, Medyne Milord, 47, originally of Haiti, said she needs work to support her family.

""If I return to Haiti, the problem will double,"" she said. ""What I hope is to have a better life in Canada.""

Jean Rigaud Liberal, 38, said he had been in the United States for seven months and lived in Florida after he left Haiti. He learned about Roxham Road from Facebook and said he thinks ""Canada will be better than America.""

""We are not comfortable in America,"" said Liberal. ""We are seeking a better life; we don't want to go back to Haiti.""

On the New York side, U.S. Border Patrol agents sometimes check to be sure the migrants are in the United States legally, but they said they don't have the resources to do it all the time.

Besides, said Brad Brant, a special operations supervisor for the U.S. Border Patrol, ""our mission isn't to prevent people from leaving.""

Small numbers continue to cross into Canada elsewhere, but the vast majority take Roxham Road. U.S. officials said they began to notice last fall, around the time of the U.S. presidential election, that more people were crossing there.

Francine Dupuis, the head of a Quebec government-funded program that helps asylum seekers, said her organization estimates 1,174 people overall crossed into Quebec last month, compared with 180 in July 2016. U.S. and Canadian officials estimated that on Sunday alone, about 400 people crossed the border at Roxham Road.

""All they have to do is cross the border,"" Dupuis said. ""We can't control it. They come in by the hundreds, and it seems to be increasing every day.""

Canada said last week it planned to house some migrants in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. It could hold thousands, but current plans call for only 450.

In most cases, once the migrants are in Canada they are released and can live freely while their claims for refugee status are processed, which can take years. Meanwhile, they are eligible for public assistance.

Brenda Shanahan, the Liberal Party member of Parliament who represents the area, visited the site Monday. She is proud of her country for being willing to take in the dispossessed, she said, but there is no guarantee they will be able to stay in Canada.

""It's not a free ticket for refugee status, not at all,"" Shanahan said.

Opposition Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel said the Trudeau government lacks a plan to deal with the illegal crossings, even though a summer spike had been anticipated.

""All that we have heard is that we are monitoring the situation,"" she said. ""The government needs to come up with a plan right away to deal with this.""

It will further backlog a system in which some refugees are already waiting 11 years for hearings, Rempel said. Canadians will question the integrity of the immigration system if the ""dangerous trend"" of illegal crossings continues, she said.

Trudeau himself recently said his country has border checkpoints and controls that need to be respected.

""We have an open compassionate country, but we have a strong system that we follow,"" he said. ""Protecting Canadian confidence in the integrity of our system allows us to continue to be open, and that's exactly what we need to continue to do.""

Inancieu Merilien, originally of Haiti, moved to the United States in 2000 but crossed into Canada late last month. U.S. authorities, he said, are trying to scare Haitians by refusing to guarantee they'll be able to stay.

""There's a big difference here. They welcomed us very well,"" he said after leaving the Olympic Stadium to begin looking for a home in Montreal's large Haitian community. ""They're going to give us housing in apartments. I hope everything goes well.""
