1,1,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Over 80% of PH economy prone to natural disasters - ADB - Rappler,https://www.rappler.com/business/more-than-80-of-the-philippine-economy-prone-to-natural-disasters-adb,"MANILA, Philippines - About 85.2% of the Philippine economy is prone to natural disasters, according to a study released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Tuesday, November 13.



In a Special Evaluation Study titled ADB’s Response to Natural Disasters and Disaster Risks, the ADB said 50.3% of the country's land area is economically at risk from multiple hazards such as floods, typhoon, and earthquakes.



This means some 81.3% of the country's population or around 76.6 million Filipinos are prone to economic impacts brought by natural disasters.



In terms of mortality risk, the report stated that 88.6% or some 83.5 million Filipinos face life-threatening risks from natural disasters. This means that 76.6% of the total land area of the Philippines are at risk of human losses caused by various disasters.



Some 13.8% of Filipinos are exposed to earthquake-related risks every year, while 0.9% of the population are exposed to flood risks every year.



""(Some) 20 of the 44 DMCs (Developing Member Countries) have been rated as 'mortality hotspots,' and 14 of them as 'high economic risk,"" the ADB said. ""Relatively speaking, the countries at highest risk of human losses and economic damage are Viet Nam, Bangladesh and Philippines.""



Disaster funds lacking



Despite this risk, the ADB said assistance that go to the Philippines for disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) have not been enough.



The ADB admitted that while many DMCs receive funding, Kyrgyz Republic and the Philippines are the two contries that either did not receive technical assistance (TA) or got very little.



The Philippines only received one technical assistance worth $225,000 in disaster risk financing. Kyrgyz Republic did not receive any. The ADB extended a TA to the country for the project Developing a Public-Private Earthquake Pool in the Philippines.



""Many of the countries that were ranked high in the Global Risk Hotspots Analysis are supported by ADB, but some did not receive TA, or got very little, notably, Kyrgyz Republic and Philippines. Many countries have not yet been supported by TA for either natural disasters or climate change. This may need to be looked at,"" ADB said.



However, when it comes to projects funded by loans and grants, the Philippines was among those that had high numbers of natural disaster projects. There were 7 projects in the country that were funded by loans and grants, the same level as Sri Lanka.



Apart from the Philippines and Sri Lanka, ADB said DMCs that had at least 3 loan or grant based projects included China (18), Pakistan (16), Bangladesh (12), India (12), Indonesia (12), Viet Nam (6), Tajikistan (4), Cambodia (3), and Kyrgyz Republic (3).

They did what they could to protect their houses, stayed indoors, and waited.

Every year, the ‘3/3’ or ‘third of the third’ wind would come roaring up the Congo River on cue, batter the village for a day or two, and then disappear.

But things are changing. The 3/3 wind is no longer living up to its name. It’s becoming unpredictable. This year, it came in February and blew ferociously for a week. People weren’t ready; crops and buildings were destroyed, and two children were killed by falling trees.

“When the wind came, it caused panic among the animals because it was an unusually strong wind,” says Lukolela sheep farmer Frederic Nkakeduta.

“Some animals died, and some of our houses and the sheep enclosure were destroyed.”

Lukolela is a small isolated town on the banks of the Congo River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 540 kilometres from Kinshasa.

Several days by boat from the capital, and with no connecting roads, it feels a long way from international debates about climate change.

Yet while governments dither over what action to take, Lukolela residents are already feeling the effects of a changing climate – and planning ways to reduce its impact on their daily lives.

A quest for solutions

Anne Marie Tiani stands under a frangipani tree, discussing these changes with fishermen, farmers, women’s groups and local administrators. She’s a senior scientist with the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and manager of the Climate Change and Forests in the Congo Basin: Synergies between adaptation and mitigation project (COBAM) that is setting up pilot studies in six Congo Basin landscapes, including the area around Lukolela.

“For the past 10 days, we have been listening to the people,” she says.

“Firstly, to understand how they cope with climate change; how it impacts their activities, health, as well as their lives. Then to work out some possible solutions to these problems and how, together as a community, they could implement them.”

“We are here to accompany them in the quest for solutions.”

Vulnerability

Over the past ten years, Lukolela residents told the CIFOR team, the area has experienced a series of climatic changes that are making life harder. In addition to the unreliable wind, the dry season has been getting longer, affecting agriculture and causing health problems due to reduced access to clean water.

In recent years, they have also noticed a mini dry season inside the wet season, which has been disastrous for the maize and cassava crops so many rely on for income.

The drier climate means average river levels are lower, too, and the fishermen say this is affecting fish stocks. Some key fish species rely for reproduction on floodwaters reaching wetland breeding habitats – but now, some years, the water doesn’t make it that far.

Whether these changes are local climate variations or part of the broader pattern of human-induced climate change has not been established – however what is clear is that even the slightest changes in the environment dramatically affect the lives of these people.

Mélie Monnerat, DRC coordinator of the African Model Forest Network, is working with CIFOR on the project. Lukolela is part of one of the ‘model forests’ the organisation has set up in the country, which encourage the sustainable management of forest landscapes by local communities.

Monnerat says people living in villages like this one are extremely vulnerable to climate change.

“They observe these changes, and they don’t know what to do about it. They just get poorer and poorer. And because they totally depend on their ecosystems for their livelihoods, at the slightest change, they feel it. It has an immediate impact on their everyday life,” she said.

“Dad comes back and there is no fish on the table tonight.”

Carbon sink – and kitchen cupboard

The second largest tropical forest in the world, the Congo Basin has received global attention for its huge potential to slow the pace of climate change.

It is estimated to store 25 – 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, which if released through deforestation or forest degradation would raise global temperatures even higher. In an effort to ensure that that carbon stays locked in the trees and out of the atmosphere, 16 REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) pilot projects are operating the region, forming part of a global scheme that aims to pay developing countries to keep forests standing.

But, says Anne Marie Tiani, CIFOR research has pointed out that the forest is not just a carbon sink providing a global good, it is also a home and a larder for nearly 80 million people, most of whom are very poor, dependent on forest resources to survive, and vulnerable to climate disturbances.

The COBAM project aims to explore whether efforts to decrease carbon emissions can also help those living in the forest to adapt to a changing climate – and vice versa.

“The international community is promoting a synergy between adaptation and mitigation – but this has not yet been tested,” Tiani said.

“So we want to carry out pilot projects like this one to see how the synergy between adaptation and mitigation could work on the ground.”

Lukolela’s Green Belt

In Lukolela, during the community workshops conducted by the COBAM team, villagers decided to reforest the riverbank and plant a ‘green belt’ around their town.

This, says Tiani, in addition to contributing to climate change mitigation through carbon storage, will also have multiple adaptation benefits.

Trees will reduce erosion, and act as a buffer against increased flooding and the violent winds. If certain species are planted, they will supply the village with fruits, edible caterpillars, firewood and charcoal – reducing the need to cut further and further into the forest for these purposes.

“We all know that it’s not enough to just plant trees – if there are no trees around the town, it is because people are cutting them down,” Tiani says.

“So we also discussed with the community how to protect the trees that would be planted.”

“It’s one of the objectives of the project to raise awareness on the importance of trees, so that when people preserve the forest, they do not think that they are doing for others but firstly for themselves.”

“They are not planting for us. They plant for themselves because they have understood the importance of trees.”

The scientists acknowledge these measures can’t solve all the villagers’ problems – and that the causes of those problems may not be simple. But they say adaptation techniques are still worth sharing.

“Despite the fact that we are not a hundred percent sure that all the issues they have raised are directly linked to climate change, we will still work on adaptation. This is because adaptation is close to development. We will assist the people in overcoming their difficulties to be able to better manage their environment,” says Tiani.

“The vision that I have is to come back to Lukolela in ten years’ time and see a town all green, a beautiful town. To see that people are proud to have achieved this by themselves, and others will come here to see, and replicate what they have seen here somewhere else.”

“That’s my dream for Lukolela.”

(STRINGER/INDONESIA/REUTERS)

Yingluck Shinawatra, Thailand’s prime minister, has insisted that she has a firm grip on policy as defends herself against critics who claim she remains in the shadow of her elder brother, Thaksin, the exiled former leader.

“People didn’t know me the first day when I stepped from the business environment into politics,” Yingluck told the Financial Times. “I was new to politics, but I was not new to the business side. After some time, I think I have proved I can handle and overcome all surprises.”

Since her election in August 2011, Yingluck, 45, has survived a legal challenge to her government, an economic downturn and Thailand’s worst flooding in half a century.

The army has stayed in its barracks despite fears of yet another coup, and the revered king, 84, has fought off illness, postponing what could become a constitutional crisis over royal succession.

“More than one year has passed. We understand how we need to improve each policy and how we would like to move Thailand forward,” she said in an interview in the ornate reception room of Government House in Bangkok.

Yingluck, who will meet Prime Minister David Cameron in Britain next week, recently named a new cabinet that bears more of her own imprint.

Critics point to the elevation of some Thaksin loyalists after the recent expiry of a five-year court ban on their political activities. But her promotion and retention of favored ministers outside the Thaksin camp, including finance minister Kittirat Na-ranong, showed growing assertiveness, according to Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor at Chulalongkorn University.

“Yingluck has increasingly come into her own,” he said. “She listens to Thaksin, but he controls [the ruling] Pheu Thai party more than she does. It’s like he is chairman of the board and she is CEO.”

Thitinan said Yingluck could become a “bridge builder” between pro-Thaksin “red shirt” supporters and “yellow-shirted” monarchists. So far, the opposing camps have avoided a repeat of their bloody clashes in 2010 but tensions remain.

The opposition Democrat party has criticized what it describes as Yingluck’s populist policies, including a minimum wage and a generous rice subsidy scheme. The most recent national Abac poll shows that 53 percent of voters would reelect Yingluck’s party against 36 percent for the Democrats.

Yingluck said her new cabinet — dubbed Yingluck 3 because she has already reshuffled ministers once — would be forward-looking and would disprove notions that she is just a front for her brother, who was ousted in a 2006 coup.

“Be fair to me and let me prove I can run the country,” Yingluck said.

Thaksin, who speaks frequently of his desire to return to Thailand, continues to undermine his sister’s authority by suggesting he runs the government from his self-imposed exile. He hopes to overturn a two-year jail sentence on corruption-related charges that he claims were politically motivated.

This week, Thaksin abruptly canceled a planned gathering of his “red shirt” supporters in a Burmese town on the Thai border, citing security concerns.

Thitinan said the former prime minister had “done Thailand a favor” by staying away. Many fear his return could plunge the country back into the political violence that for years pitted his “red shirt” supporters against “yellow shirt” royalists.

“So far he has been willing to stay in exile and run Thailand virtually by remote control,” he said.

Yingluck for now appears to have abandoned attempts to secure her brother a pardon, which would clear the path for his return. While she praised her brother’s “many good policies,” she stressed that she was running the country.

“We have new policies . . . he hasn’t the chance [now] to run the country,” she said.

She said she had gone some way toward closing the red-yellow divide. She made light of a no-confidence motion later this month, saying it was a positive sign that political battles were now being fought in parliament rather than on the streets.

Yingluck’s premiership has been shaken by last year’s floods, which killed more than 500 people and badly damaged Thailand’s manufacturing base, especially car and computer production. Her government, though criticized for its handling of the floods, took extraordinary measures to help companies, particularly the Japanese manufacturers that dominate Thai industry.

Far from leaving Thailand, as the government had feared, Japanese companies appear to be increasing investments, due to the strong yen and, in some cases, to relocate production from China amid a growing anti-Japan backlash over a maritime dispute. This month, Nissan became the latest to expand its Thai production base, announcing a new $380 million car plant near Bangkok.

Yingluck’s much-criticized handling of the flood-related crisis was among her only regrets, she said. “We lost about three months solving the problem of flooding. I wish I could gain this time back, because we have many things to do.”","Thu, 08 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/11/08/Foreign/Images/2012-11-08T114609Z_01_JAK14_RTRIDSP_3_INDONESIA.jpg?t=20170517,"['thailands', 'shes', 'insists', 'prime', 'brothers', 'minister', 'yingluck', 'supporters', 'puppet', 'run', 'thailand', 'exiled', 'thaksin', 'thai', 'shirt']", ,none

6,6,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Battered New York City Looks For Ways to Hold Back the Sea - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/battered_new_york_city_looks_for_ways_to_hold_back_the_sea,"The scenario might have been different: As weather reports confirmed that an incoming nor’easter would drive Hurricane Sandy inland, New York City would have begun watching the rising waters and preparing to respond. When, as predicted, the storm surge showed signs that it would begin to inundate the shorelines of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, the emergency system would have kicked in: Across the Verrazano Narrows entry to New York Harbor, across the upper East River, across the entrance to Jamaica Bay, the floodgates would have begun closing.

Like massive garage doors between pilings 10-stories high, the gates would have fallen into place. In the Verrazano Narrows at the mouth of the harbor, huge gate-like storm barriers, through which ships normally pass, would have pivoted slowly together. Within an hour, the surging seas would have been shut out. Rains and winds would cause their damage, but New York City would have been protected from the storm surge that ended up inundating its vulnerable infrastructure.

In recent years, officials have contemplated such plans as scientists increasingly warned that New York City — and densely populated areas worldwide — faced a growing threat of catastrophic damage from major storms, as sea levels rose and storms, powered by rising ocean and air temperatures, intensified.

Hurricane Sandy has sparked a realization that the defenses of old are no longer adequate.

Then, a week ago, Hurricane Sandy struck, killing 106 people on the U.S. east coast (40 in New York City), causing an estimated $50 billion in damage (roughly $17 billion in New York City alone), and flooding large parts of the region’s infrastructure, including tunnels, subways, and power stations.

Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York City had been working on gradually protecting its infrastructure from the long-term threats of climate change, including a predicted sea level rise of more than three feet this century. But what Hurricane Sandy showed is that New York City may not have the luxury of time. The storm easily overwhelmed many of the relatively minor adaptations that New York had already put in place.

For Malcolm Bowman — an oceanographer at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, and a member of the mayor’s Climate Change Adaptation Task Force — and for other scientists, the destruction wrought by Sandy demonstrates that the time has come for rethinking the city’s strategy. While gradually building resilience into the system is an admirable goal, says Bowman, it can only go so far. “It’s like a boxing match in which you get punched in the nose, return to your corner, patch it up, and get back into the ring,” said Bowman. “But now the city’s been dealt a knockout punch.”

Scientists, engineers, and public officials say that Hurricane Sandy has sparked a realization that the defenses of old are no longer adequate. Whether the “superstorm” was largely the result of the vagaries of weather, or is indicative of a new normal brought on by climate change, officials are warning that New York and other cities can expect more of the same and had better harden their defenses.

“After what has been happening in the last few years, I don’t think anyone can sit back anymore and say, ‘Well, I’m shocked at that weather pattern,’” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last Tuesday. The following day, Cuomo spoke of building sea walls or other protective structures, adding, “Climate change is a reality. Given the frequency of these extreme weather situations we have had, for us to sit here today and say this is once in a generation and is not going to happen again, I think would be shortsighted.”

And Bloomberg, a global leader in helping cities begin to adapt to climate change, said only a few days after the storm, “Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it may be — given the devastation it is wreaking — should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.”

The question now is, what kind of action? And what lessons should New York City should learn from Hurricane Sandy? The mayor and the governor face a wide array of options, ranging from efforts to recreate marshes and oyster beds along the city’s 510 miles of coastline, to locally protecting infrastructure such as subway stations, to building billion-dollar networks of storm surge barriers.

‘For us to say that this is not going to happen again would be shortsighted,’ said Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

While no one could have predicted the unique meteorological phenomenon that was Sandy, the terrible scenarios that played out as the storm battered the New York City region should have sounded eerily familiar to Mayor Bloomberg, utility companies, and city, state, and federal agencies. The inundated coastline and desperate evacuees, the flooded roads, tunnels, and subways — they’d seen them all in computer models and PowerPoint presentations about the future impacts of climate change, and they had discussed them in interagency meetings with oceanographers, geologists, and climate scientists.

The problem was that what they were seeing was not supposed to be happening now — not for perhaps another 20 years when, they’d been told, rising sea levels due to climate change would turn the storm surges of ordinary nor’easters or low-category hurricanes into devastating tidal torrents.

It wasn’t as if they’d been derelict in starting to plan. New York City and its agencies had consulted an elite group of government and university scientists, economists, and risk management specialists to study how climate change would affect the city. In 2008, the New York Panel on Climate Change concluded that given steadily rising seas, today’s 1-in-100-year flood could occur once every 35 to 55 years by 2050, and once every 15 to 30 years by 2080. The panel also concluded that atmospheric changes would likely increase the intensity of storms and bring more rain to the region.

Recent storms have shown it may be time to consider solutions more in scale with the risks.

With the science in hand, the city formed a Climate Change Adaptation Task Force to determine how best to adapt infrastructure to withstand the effects of future climate challenges. The task force recommended a gradual approach to protecting the city’s assets: improve shoreline land management; consider building new wetlands out into the harbor to better absorb the power of storm surges; and build higher seawalls, jetties, and dykes to protect subway entrances, highway tunnels, and power stations. To keep the costs manageable, these changes would be made gradually. The cost would be in the tens of millions of dollars a year, but given time, New York would become the very model of a “climate-resilient” city that protected its people and its critical infrastructure.

But what recent storms have shown, including Hurricane Irene last year, is that it may be time to consider solutions more in scale with the risks. A decade ago, Bowman’s Storm Surge Research Group at the state university at Stony Brook conceived a system of large barriers and sea walls that would protect the city’s most vulnerable shorelines from storm surges. One would stand by the Whitestone Bridge on the upper East River, another by the eastern entrance to Jamaica Bay, and a third — and most ambitious — would be capable of sealing off the lower harbor and stretch from Brooklyn to Staten Island parallel to the Verrazano Narrows bridge.

One proposal calls for a storm surge barrier across the Verrazano Narrows between Brooklyn and Staten Island. ARCADIS

Had such a system been in place, says Bowman, it would have stopped Sandy’s storm surge from reaching the city. And though it would have cost some $13 billion, it would have been cheaper than the current estimated damages from Sandy.

These are not untested technologies. Storm surge barriers have protected the Netherlands for centuries, with the most recent built to withstand a 1-in-10,000 year flooding event. Rotterdam began to work on its storm barriers after more than 1,800 people died in a 1953 flood. (The system of dikes, dams, and storm surge barriers is now a major tourist attraction.) St. Petersburg, Russia, last year completed a 15-mile sea surge barrier across the Gulf of Finland. Begun in 1978, it is designed to protect the city from tidal surges up to 16 feet.

Venice is building its own storm surge barriers, and London has a North Sea storm barrier. Examples of storm surge barriers already exist just north of New York City, where they protect the cities of Providence, R.I.; Stamford, Conn.; and New Bedford, Mass. As Sandy’s tidal surge increased, Providence shut the gates on its 3,000-foot long Fox Point Hurricane Barrier. The barrier, said a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman, “performed flawlessly.”

Bowman and colleague Douglas Hill have no illusions that the construction of a system of barriers around New York City will be a quick, easy, or even complete fix. But, says Bowman, it’s time to begin considering this regional approach to flood protection and engage the Army Corps of Engineers, the environmental community, and local and port authorities. These projects, he points out, take decades to build — not because of difficulties with construction, but due to the many studies necessary to reckon with a complex tidal ecosystem.

Piet Dircke of ARCADIS, a Dutch corporation that recently built some of New Orleans’ post-Katrina dikes, also provided Bowman with a rough concept of a storm surge barrier across the Verrazano Narrows, one that would allow for large and small ship traffic and for natural tidal flow when no storms are present. New York City, says Dircke, faces the same problems that climate change poses for delta cities around the world, whether it’s Bangkok, Jakarta, or London. In those cities, as in New York, populations and economic assets are growing (New York City’s economic value grew some 40 percent between 2001 and 2012), while sea level and the threat of catastrophic flooding also rise.","Tue, 06 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png,"['climate', 'sandy', 'sea', 'hurricane', 'battered', 'ways', 'change', 'city', 'barriers', 'looks', 'york', 'storm', 'hold', 'surge']", ,flood

New York at ‘medium risk’ despite exposure to natural hazards



Multinational companies operating in the Asian growth economies will be exposed to spiralling environmental risks over the coming decades, according to Maplecroft’s 5th annual Climate Change and Environmental Risk Atlas, which identifies Dhaka, Manila, Bangkok, Yangon, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City and Kolkata as the cities facing the most risk from the onset of climate change.



Maplecroft’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI), which forms a central pillar of the Atlas, classifies seven cities as ‘extreme risk,’ out of a list of 50 that were chosen for their current and future importance to global business. Dhaka, Bangladesh, (ranked 1st), Manila, the Philippines (2), Bangkok, Thailand (3), Yangon, Myanmar (4), Jakarta, Indonesia (5), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam (6) and Kolkata, India (7) emerged as the most at risk from the changing temperatures and weather systems that are forecast to take hold in the coming years.



The CCVI has been developed by Maplecroft to identify risks to populations, company operations, supply chains and investments in 197countries down to a level of 25km². It evaluates exposure to climate related natural hazards; the sensitivity of populations; development; natural resources; agricultural dependency; research and development; government effectiveness and education levels.



Asian growth economies posing long-term risks to business



With strong economic growth of above 5% forecast for countries such as the Philippines, Viet Nam, Indonesia and India in the next few years, the relevance of climate change to populations and business in the major commercial centres should not be underplayed, states Maplecroft in its analysis.



“As global corporations expand into the emerging growth markets, their operations and supply chains will become exposed to a complex set of climate risks that have the potential to disrupt business continuity,” states Maplecroft’s Head of Maps and Indices, Helen Hodge. “It is essential for them to identify where suppliers, assets and personnel are most at risk and plan for the long term.”



‘Extreme risk’ cities may see an increase in frequency and severity of key hydrological and meteorological events. Recently, we have seen major flooding in Yangon in 2008, Bangkok 2011 and Manila 2012, and such events could become both more frequent and severe in the future. Long-term changes in temperature and rainfall patterns could have devastating effects on ecosystems, human health, industrial processes, supply chains and infrastructure.



The vulnerability of cities in the growth economies stems not only from their exposure to climate related hazards, but also the sensitivity of their populations and the poor capacity of governments to support local adaptation measures to combat the potential effects of climate change. Maplecroft’s has been measuring these factors for all countries over three years, but there has been little discernible improvement in the host nations of the ‘extreme risk’ cities suggesting countries are slow to make progress in combating the oncoming effects of climate change. Disaster risk reduction programmes, more stringent building regulations, better education and improved communications networks are therefore essential to secure the future stability of these cities.



Superstorm Sandy shows US resilience to disasters



The effect of climate change on tropical storms is still under debate, but there is growing evidence that their intensity, and in particular the associated rainfall, will increase. Single storm events cannot be definitively taken as evidence of climate change; but recent events on the East Coast of the US demonstrate the region’s exposure to climatic events.



New York, which took the full brunt of Superstorm Sandy, is ranked 41 of the 50 cities considered in the CCVI. Despite the city’s exposure to natural hazards, it is only categorised as ‘medium risk’ due to the USA’s ability to adapt to a major climatic event. The country’s strong economy and infrastructure, coupled with the extensive preparations before the storm’s landfall, enabled a relatively rapid return to operations for many businesses and services, with some of New York’s major airports and the New York Stock Exchange reopening only two days after the storm. In contrast Haiti and Cuba who were also impacted by Hurricane Sandy will take considerably longer to recover from the impacts of storm.



Manufacturing sector exposed to ‘high risk’ Chinese cities



A further 19 cities are classed as ‘high risk’ in the CCVI, including the important commercial centres of Mumbai (8) and Delhi (20) in India; Lagos, Nigeria (10); Johannesburg, South Africa (13); Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (21); and Hong Kong (14), Guangzhou (18), Shenzhen (19), Wuhan (23) and Shanghai in China (24). Chicago, London, St Petersburg, Paris and Madrid, meanwhile, were the only four cities to be classified as low risk.



The appearance of so many ‘high risk’ Chinese cities is of particular concern to companies using the country as a manufacturing base. Water stress is already a risk in China, due to the needs of industry and the agricultural sector, alongside swelling urban populations. Should climate change place further pressure on the country’s water resources by increasing the risk of drought, water intensive industries could find their ability to operate restricted.

Hurricane Sandy was the largest Atlantic hurricane on record, and possibly the costliest hurricane in U.S. history, causing damage in excess of approximately USD 50,000,000,000 and claiming the lives of at least one hundred ninety-three (193) individuals.

On October 28, 2012, the USCG Captain of the Port of New York and New Jersey set port condition YANKEE for all commercial waterways requiring, inter alia: (1) commercial deep draft vessels greater than 500 gross tons to evacuate all port piers by 6:00 p.m. local time; and (2) all vessels to evacuate Bay Ridge, Stapleton, and Gravesend Bay anchorage grounds by 6:00 p.m. local time. On October 29, 2012, Sandy’s storm surge hit New York City flooding streets, tunnels and subway lines and causing massive power outages throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It is estimated that litigation arising out of delays and damages caused by Hurricane Sandy will be voluminous as insurance claims continue to mount and disputes over coverage under various policies have already begun.

As individuals and businesses continue to deal with the effects of Hurricane Sandy, many have questioned the applicability of force majeure clauses in charter party contracts, specifically, whether Hurricane Sandy qualifies as an “Act of God,” excusing the non-performance of one (1) or more parties. While each clause is unique and subject to fact specific review, force majeure clauses, in general, will be upheld by Courts of the United States “to relieve a party from its contractual duties when its performance has been prevented by a force beyond its control or when the purpose of the contract has been frustrated.” Phillips Puerto Rico Core, Inc. v. Tradax Petroleum, Ltd., 782 F.2d 314, 319 (2d Cir. N.Y. 1985) (internal citations omitted).

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals (the Federal Circuit governing New York and Connecticut) and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (covering New Jersey and Pennsylvania), have each held that the burden of demonstrating force majeure is on the party seeking to have its performance excused, and the non-performing party must demonstrate its efforts to perform its contractual duties despite the occurrence of the event that it claims constituted force majeure. Phillips Puerto Rico Core, Inc., 782 F.2d at 319 (citing Gulf Oil Corp. v. FERC, 706 F.2d 444, 452 (3d Cir. 1983), cert denied, 464 U.S. 1038, 79 L. Ed. 2d 164, 104 S. Ct. 698 (1984)). In reviewing whether the non-performing party has met these burdens, the Court will conduct a factual review of the specific language and requirements of the contract and the force majeure clause at issue.

Specific issues which deserve consideration include, inter alia, (1) whether a storm, hurricane or weather event was specifically included in the force majeure clause (for example a hurricane can be treated differently in the U.S. Gulf, an area in which such storms are frequent, as opposed to New York and New Jersey); (2) whether Hurricane Sandy actually caused the non-performance; (3) what are the notice requirements (if any) to declare force majeure; (4) when does the force majeure event end thereby allowing performance to be completed; and/or (5) any obligations of the parties to mitigate damages, including whether steps were (or could have been) taken prior to, during, and after the storm which would have enabled the performance of the contract.

In short, before declaring force majeure, or accepting a force majeure declaration from another party under a particular contract, parties should give close consideration to the causal relationship between the storm and the type of performance for which excusal is sought. If the non-performance of a specific contract was not directly related to Hurricane Sandy, it is arguable that force majeure would not apply.

The flow alarmed Turkish officials and led their prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to vent at the five permanent members of the Security Council for what he called their failure to respond decisively to the crisis after nearly 20 months.

The United Nations reported that 11,000 Syrians fled to neighboring countries Friday, the vast majority clambering for safety over the Turkish border, in one of the largest single-day torrents of refugees since the Syria conflict began. It came as mayhem and deprivations were worsening inside the country, its president more determined than ever to stay and his fractious enemies still politically paralyzed.

''The world cannot be left to what the five permanent members have to say,'' Erdogan told a conference in Indonesia. ''If we leave it to the five permanent members, humanity will continue to bleed.''

Panos Moumtzis, the UN refugee agency official coordinating the response, told reporters in Geneva, where the agency is based, that the latest surge included 1,000 Syrians who reached Lebanon and 1,000 who reached Jordan, bringing the number of registered refugees to more than 408,000 in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. Agency officials said a few weeks ago that they anticipated more than 700,000 Syrian refugees to be living in these countries by year's end, straining their resources just as the cold Middle East winter intensifies.

The agency's figures do not include Syrians who have fled without registering, a number believed to be in the tens of thousands in Jordan alone.

Turkish officials said more than half the Syrians who fled into Turkey on Friday had been seeking to escape combat between insurgents and loyalist forces near Ras al-Ain, a northeast border town where fighting has raged for days.

The arrivals through the Turkish border crossing of Reyhanli in Hatay province included 26 Syrian Army defectors, with two generals and 11 colonels among them, the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency of Turkey reported.

The increased exodus coincided with new signs of defiance by Syria's president, Bashar Assad, in an interview with Russia Today, a government-run news service in Russia, a steady defender of Assad. In portions of the interview that were first released Thursday, Assad said that he intended to remain in Syria and warned that any foreign invasion would be a costly catastrophe.

In the complete version released Friday, Assad denied that Syria was consumed in a civil war and insisted that his forces could ''finish everything'' within weeks if foreign suppliers stopped sending weapons to the insurgents, whom he universally categorizes as terrorists.

Assad also denied that Syrian forces had shelled targets in Turkey and accused Erdogan — a former friend and now one of Assad's biggest critics — of coveting Syrian territory.

""He personally thinks that he is the new sultan of the Ottomans and he can control the region as it was during the Ottoman Empire under a new umbrella,'' Assad said.

The surge in refugees came as agencies of the United Nations and other groups met donor governments in Geneva to report on the crisis and seek greater financial support for the emergency fund for Syrian refugees, which has only received one-third of its intended goal of $488 million.

''There is more violence, more humanitarian suffering, more displacement and more losses,'' said Radhouane Nouicer, the refugee agency's coordinator based in Damascus.

The United Nations has also estimated that more than 2.5 million people inside Syria need humanitarian assistance, including 1.2 million displaced by the conflict.

John Ging, the director of operations for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that 4 million Syrians may need help in the country by early next year.

""It's just getting a lot worse very rapidly for the ordinary people,'' Ging said.","Sat, 10 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/zpu5c7FHaLA4VhsjX7uoz8zUMWo=/506x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HSECJCBKZMI6FL323YE5K2TUHE.jpg,"['officials', 'syrians', 'thousands', 'agency', 'united', 'flee', 'turkey', 'syria', 'refugees', 'turkish', 'syrian', 'assad']", ,none
13,13,FF-2012-000189-IDN,"The Congo Basin Forests: What policymakers should know - CIFOR Forests News - Forests Blog, Center for International Forestry Research",https://forestsnews.cifor.org/11469/the-congo-basin-forests-what-policymakers-should-know-2?fnl=en,"The pulse in the heart of Africa: The Congo Basin contains the second largest expanse of tropical forest in the world, covering 200 million hectares and spanning six countries. These forests support the livelihoods of 60 million people, generate income from timber exploitation, store huge amounts of carbon, comprise a unique biodiversity and regulate the flow of the major rivers across Central Africa. From the world’s largest swamps, to the mountainous regions in Cameroon and Eastern Democratic of the Congo, these diverse ecosystems support the people and wildlife found in the very heart of Africa.

A meaty issue: hunting for food in the Congo: In rural areas of the Congo Basin many communities depend on wild meat hunted in forests for up to 80% of the fat and protein in their diets. While over-harvesting and dwindling forests mean that current practices are increasingly unsustainable, banning such practices could lead to increased deforestation: for example, by clearing forest for pasture. A ban on the hunting of vulnerable species – like gorillas and elephants – while allowing people to hunt more resilient species, like duikers (small antelopes) and porcupines could be more effective.

Valuing the fruits, nuts and plants of the Congo Basin: NTFPs (non timber forest products), play a vital role in supporting rural and urban livelihoods. Their collection and sale contribute to food security, health, income generation and employment in the Congo Basin. The sale of NTFPs contributes, on average, to 25 to 40 % of household income and women are largely involved in the collection of fuelwood, Gnetum spp. and safou. However, much more research is needed to tailor strategies for sustainable management, starting with a definition and value of NTFPs, and a prioritisation of which ones need to be better monitored and managed.

Domestic timber trade: the impact of chain saw milling: Large-scale industrial timber production accounts for only 3% of global tropical timber production and its impacts are generally well documented. Conversely, the impacts of small-scale chainsaw milling (the on-site conversion of logs into lumber) on trade and on forests are less well known. In Cameroon, the domestic informal timber market is as large as the industrial export-oriented one. While the small-scale sector provides jobs and supports livelihoods, the lack of clear and well-adapted legislation can provide a fertile ground for corruption. Forest certification schemes and new legislation are encouraging smallholders to carry out sustainable practices, but policy change is needed to improve governance and bring informal markets inside the law.

Charcoal: fuelling the economy or deforestation? Fuelwood and charcoal represent 90% of all wood removal from forests in Africa and a third of the global wood fuel production. While Charcoal production increases deforestation and degradation particularly in heavily populated areas, it provides 83% of rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa with a renewable energy source for cooking, as well as income generating activities. Developing forest plantations for wood energy, developing sustainable management of forests, and improving energy processing could help balance its impact on forests.

The Congo Basin Forests: protecting people in a changing climate. The forests of the Congo Basin have enormous potential for helping adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Constituting 18 percent of the world’s tropical forests and locking away between 25 and 30 billion tonnes of carbon, the forests of the Congo Basin are of huge global significance to schemes that aim to reduce emissions from deforestation or degradation, such as REDD+. These forests also provide safety nets for millions of people, especially women, who are highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, fisheries, pastoral practices, and whose livelihoods may be threatened by changing weather patterns and resource scarcity.

Where have all the forestry experts gone? The lack of up-to-date and accurate information on the current state and evolution of forested areas in Central Africa is often seen as a limiting factor in the design of efficient forest management policies. Decades of war, underdevelopment and a lack of infrastructure and resources, have also hampered innovation and research in the sector. Much more effort is needed to improve regional and national capabilities and train new experts in forestry management to ensure that forests are protected in the future.","Mon, 19 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://forestsnews.cifor.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/FACT-SHEET-1.jpg,"['forests', 'livelihoods', 'timber', 'management', 'congo', 'policymakers', 'basin', 'forest', 'africa', 'production', 'know', 'practices']", ,tree

The producers of ""The Hobbit"" movies on Tuesday rejected allegations that animals died due to mistreatment during the making of Peter Jackson's highly anticipated Tolkien trilogy in New Zealand.

A giant Gollum creature from ""The ""Hobbit"" movie catches a fish on the ceiling of Wellington airport on October 31, 2012. The producers of ""The Hobbit"" movies have rejected allegations from animal rights group PETA that animals have died during the making of the highly anticipated Tolkien trilogy in New Zealand.

Animal rights group PETA said up to 27 animals, including horses, sheep, goats and chickens, died during filming, prompting it to plan protests against the movies, the first of which has its world premiere in Wellington next week.

Jackson and the producers said in a statement that the American Humane Association monitored all use of animals during the shoot and ""no animals died or were harmed on set during filming"".

""The producers completely reject the accusations that 27 animals died due to mistreatment during the making of the films,"" the statement said.

""Extraordinary measures were taken to make sure that animals were not used during action sequences or any other sequence that might create undue stress for the animals involved.""

It added that 55 percent of shots featuring animals in the three films, which were shot back-to-back with a budget estimated at US$500 million, were computer-generated.

PETA said most of the allegations it was raising did not occur on set while cameras were rolling, but at farms and stables where the animals were housed.

It said some wranglers involved in the project -- who the producers said had been sacked more than a year ago -- reported two horses died from broken necks after being forced off steep embankments by other animals in their paddocks.

PETA US senior vice president Lisa Lange said sheep and goats died from worms and after falling into sinkholes in rugged terrain, and a dozen chickens were mauled to death by dogs.

""This production's decision to use numerous live animals and allow them to suffer needlessly takes the entertainment industry a giant and disgraceful step backwards,"" she said in a statement.

PETA spokeswoman Claire Fryer alleged that during a location shoot a misbehaving horse was left on the ground for three hours with its legs tied together, suffering rope burns that were covered with make-up during filming.

The first of the three movies, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", premieres in Wellington on November 28 and will be released worldwide in December.

PETA said it would protest at the event and at premieres in the United States and Britain.

""It's important that movie-goers are made aware of this,"" Fryer told AFP.

The producers said they took animal welfare seriously and had pursued the highest level of care for those used in the films.

""We regret that some of these accusations by wranglers who were dismissed from the film over a year ago are only now being brought to our attention,"" they said.","Tue, 20 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/newdesign/assets/images/bg/world/images_world_1.jpg?v=0.1,"['animals', 'allegations', 'wellington', 'making', 'cruelty', 'animal', 'died', 'movies', 'wranglers', 'deny', 'producers', 'hobbit']", ,none

Thousands from around the world in Australia to witness total eclipse of the sun

Some hotels have been booked for more than three years to watch the spectacle

The last total solar eclipse visible in Australia was 10 years ago

SYDNEY (AP) — From boats bobbing on the Great Barrier Reef, to hot air balloons hovering over the rainforest, and the hilltops and beaches in between, tens of thousands of scientists, tourists and amateur astronomers watched Wednesday as the sun, moon and Earth aligned and plunged northern Australia into darkness during a total solar eclipse.

Stubborn clouds that many feared would ruin the view parted — at least partly — in some areas of north Queensland, defying forecasts of a total eclipse-viewing bust and relieving spectators who had fanned out across the region to catch a rare glimpse of the celestial phenomenon.

""Total eclipses are one of the most dramatic sites that you can ever see,"" said Terry Cuttle of the Astronomical Association of Queensland, who has seen a dozen of them over the years. ""I reckon everybody owes it to themselves to see at least one total eclipse in their life.""

Spectators whooped and clapped with delight as the moon passed between the sun and Earth, leaving a slice of the continent's northeast in sudden darkness.

Starting just after dawn, the eclipse cast its 150-kilometer (95-mile) shadow in Australia's Northern Territory, crossed the northeast tip of the country and was swooping east across the South Pacific, where no islands are in its direct path. A partial eclipse will be visible from east Indonesia, the eastern half of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and southern parts of Chile and Argentina. Totality — the darkness that happens at the peak of the eclipse — lasted just over two minutes in Australia.

Northern Australia is the only place where the total eclipse will be visible from land, said Geoff Wyatt, an astronomer with Sydney Observatory. The rest of its path crosses over the largely uninhabited South Pacific.

Gloomy weather across the northeast had left many scientists and eclipse-chasers who had traveled to Australia from across the globe anxious that they wouldn't be able to see a thing. But the clouds moved out of the way in time for many to watch as the moon blotted out the sun's rays and cast a shadow over the tropical landscape.

Some Queensland hotels have been booked up for more than three years and more than 50,000 people have flooded into the region to watch the solar spectacle, said Jeff Gillies, regional director of Queensland Tourism.

Skygazers crowded beaches, boats, fields and hot air balloons to watch the event. Fitness fanatics gathered for the Solar Eclipse Marathon, where the first rays of the sun re-emerging from behind the moon served as the starting gun. Some began partying days ago at a weeklong eclipse festival.

Scientists were studying how animals respond to the eclipse, with underwater cameras capturing the effects of sudden darkness on the creatures of the Great Barrier Reef.

But after his ousting in early 2011, some of the walls became a canvas for popular expression as artists inspired by the “25 January Revolution” unleashed a creative uprising of their own in an area near Tahrir Square, the main focal point of the protests.

Ever since, the capital’s Mohamed Mahmoud Street – one of the main arteries leading from the Interior Ministry into Tahrir Square – has effectively become an open-air gallery showcasing street art about a wide range of social issues.

Graffiti became increasingly popular after the “25 January Revolution”, and colourful murals began to appear across Cairo. Mohamed Mahmoud Street has become the centre of this activity. Its walls depict a plethora of the issues still affecting daily life in the new Egypt – the more than 12,000 unfair military trials of civilians, the battle against the sexual harassment of women, and abuse by the security forces of peaceful protesters.

It has also become a bitter reminder of the need for accountability for the 17-month rule of the military council that replaced Mubarak. During this period more than 120 protesters were killed as a direct result of unnecessary and excessive use of force by the security forces – more than 50 of them on Mohamed Mahmoud Street itself.

For six days starting on 19 November 2011 Egypt’s riot police, the Central Security Forces (CSF), violently suppressed protests in Mohamed Mahmoud Street, leaving 51 people dead.

The protests started after the security forces violently suppressed a sit-in of those killed or injured in the uprising in nearby Tahrir Square. Clashes erupted and images of dead bodies of protesters left on a pile of refuse were aired on television. Protesters flooded into Tahrir Square and nearby Mohamed Mahmoud Street.

At the time, Amnesty International blasted what it called a “brutal and heavy-handed response to protests [that] bears all the hallmarks of the Mubarak era”.

The paintings that sprang up in the wake of that violence took on an ever-deeper significance for Egyptians, as they criticized the then-ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces for ongoing abuses and clamoured for change as elections approached.

Today, they are a reminder of how little has changed, and how much needs to be done to hold the security forces to account. Despite the scale of the violence, only one CSF officer is facing trial. Meanwhile, 379 protesters are being tried – it remains to be seen whether they will benefit from a recent presidential amnesty.

Although the Egyptian authorities have on several occasions attempted to paint over the murals, many remain as a testament to the tumult and triumph during and after the “25 January Revolution”, as well as a memorial to the dozens who were killed in Mohammed Mahmoud a year ago.

“The concrete barriers along Mohammed Mahmoud Street were meant to block freedom of assembly. Today, they serve as a whole new outlet for freedom of expression – the creative criticism of the authorities,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Programme Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.

“A year after the protests that left such a deep impact on Egypt, many of these colourful murals remain not just as a memorial, but as a vital chronicle of the historic changes still taking place in the country.

26,26,FF-2012-000189-IDN,South Sudan: UNHCR warns that hepatitis E risk is growing - UNHCR,https://www.unhcr.org/509cedcd9.html,"With funding depleted for our operations in South Sudan, UNHCR is warning today that capacity to contain an outbreak of hepatitis E among the refugee population is increasingly stretched. The risks will grow if, as currently anticipated, we see fresh inflows of refugees from South Kordofan and Blue Nile states in neighbouring Sudan.

Due to insecurity and worsening humanitarian conditions in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, we expect thousands of new refugees to cross in the next weeks, as soon as roads become passable after the rainy season.

UNHCR and partners (Solidarités International, Goal, Oxfam, IOM, IMC, Medair and MSF together with the national health authorities) are already fighting an outbreak of Hepatitis E in Upper Nile and Unity states, two regions where the disease is endemic and where 175,000 Sudanese refugees are settled.

We have seen 1,050 cases of Hepatitis E in the refugee camps, a virus contracted and spread through consuming contaminated food and water. The disease damages the liver and can be fatal. To date, 26 refugees have died in camps in Upper Nile. This is 10 more deaths since mid-September.

The risk of infection is high in densely populated settings such as refugee camps. This is further exacerbated in the rainy season due to flooding and poor sanitation. Women and small children are the most vulnerable.

Early diagnosis is also crucial for the survival of patients. We are working with the US Centers for Disease Control which has sent six staff to test water and blood samples and conduct house-to-house interviews on hygiene practices.

To counter the spread of the disease among the 175,000 Sudanese refugees already in South Sudan, we are promoting better hygiene practices through hundreds of trained community workers. In all camps this community outreach exercise includes active case finding. We have also been working to improve the supply of clean water in the camps, as well as upgrade latrine stances, and provide more hand washing-stations and soap.

These measures have helped to slow the spread of the disease. However, we are struggling to meet the minimum humanitarian standards such as the provision of 15 to 20 litres of safe drinking water per refugee per day or building enough latrines so that each unit is shared by no more than 20 refugees.

The south Sudan operation is seriously underfunded. UNHCR needs a minimum of US$20 million until the end of the year to keep up basic lifesaving activities. Of our revised appeal for $186 million, only 40 per cent has been received so far. International NGOs also need additional funding beyond that amount to ensure that all activities can be carried out as needed.

Thoroughly brushing its teeth before indulging in a sleepy yawn, these pictures of a bleary eyed orangutan bear an uncanny resemblance to the morning routines of many human beings.

Siswi was captured demonstrating impeccable oral hygiene in Tanjung Puting National Park in Borneo, Indonesia.

The 34-year-old female likes to remain minty fresh by using a toothbrush to scrub its impressive set of teeth, and is regularly spotted sporting a mouthful of foam at the Camp Leakey wildlife refuge.

German photographer Jurgen Freund, 53, visited the national park while on a trip to observe the rainforest and its inhabitants in Indonesia.



'I thought these primates were so much like us,' he said.

'They are so intelligent and so observant of human behaviour.

'We saw Siswi brushing her teeth with a toothbrush and the toothpaste made her yawn,' he said.

Mr Freund, who said orangutans live semi-wild in the jungles of Central Kalimantan in Indonesia, said the creatures learn to mimic the mannerisms of tourists that flock to the region to catch a glimpse of the mighty apes.

'Tourists visit these remote places in river boats and as much as we ogle at them, they learn and imitate our behaviours in the most uncanny manner,' he said.

28,28,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Where Is All the Coal? - Slate Magazine,https://slate.com/technology/2012/11/coal-reserves-in-the-united-states-geology-explains-why-we-have-so-much-coal.html,"When you think of the vast expanse of wet prairies in Florida’s Everglades, the peat-filled wetlands of Georgia’s Okefenokee Swamp, or the Amazon River Delta, coal isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. But these landscapes are modern-day examples of the enormous, ancient inland seas and dense tropical swamps that turned into today’s coal beds. Much of the world’s coal dates back to the Carboniferous Period, some 318 million years ago, and contains plant matter and fossils from before the era of the dinosaurs.

Advertisement

Coal is America’s mighty rock. Because coal burns at a slow rate for a long time, it’s more efficient as an energy source than other fossil fuels. And the United States is naturally well-endowed with coal resources—25 percent of the world’s coal reserves are within our borders. Coal has been the leading electricity source worldwide, and over the past 10 years it has supplied one-half of the increase in global energy demand, growing even faster than renewables. And now it’s one of the most fiercely disputed fuels.

There is a dark side to coal. It produces more carbon dioxide when burned than other fossil fuels do and adds disproportionately to global climate change. Ecological costs are abundant, too, and range from mountain-top removal mining to air pollution to coal ash spills.

Advertisement

Coal exports from the United States this year are expected to reach 125 million tons, breaking the previous record of 113 million tons set in 1981. And according to the World Energy Council, the world’s coal use is expected to rise 60 percent by 2030, with developing countries responsible for 97 percent of this increase.

To understand the conflicts surrounding coal, it helps to step back and review how we came to have this contested resource. The two main ingredients in the recipe for coal are peat and time. Decayed plant matter and sediment accumulated in large basins in the Earth’s crust to form peat. Over millions of years, layers of mushy peat accumulated in geologic basins and were buried by sediment that accumulated little by little, from stormwater runoff or the wind, for instance. Over time, the basin of sediment sank below the Earth’s surface.

Depending on tectonic forces, such as the stability of the earth’s crust in the area or an uplift in mountain ranges, the peat deposits ended up deep underground or closer to the surface. As the buried sediment compacted under pressure, water was squeezed from the peat, natural heat from the earth’s core baked it, and coal formed, a process called coalification.

Advertisement

Peter Warwick of the U.S. Geological Survey says coalificaiton is like the cartoon image of Superman squeezing a chunk of coal to make a diamond. “It’s the same concept. You need to compact and squeeze this peat to form coal,” he said; coal is just “concentrated carbon.”

The United States had three major coal-forming periods: the Pennsylvanian (318-299 million years ago), which formed the Appalachian coal beds; the Cretaceous (145-65 million years ago), which formed coal in Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico; and the early Tertiary (65-35 million years ago), which led to major coal deposits in Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and Texas.

During these three periods, what is now dry land contained large inland seas and lakes. On the edges of these bodies of water were warm, swampy coastal plains that filled in with decaying plants. We don’t have those vast regions today, but places like the warm, wet coastlines of Indonesia and the Okefenokee are now accumulating peat, Warwick says.

During the geologic past, sea level was much higher at times than sea level today. The United States spans part of a continent that was flooded during the major coal-forming times, which led to the formation of broad coastal plains where peat could accumulate, Warwick says. “Add a warm climate and all this contributed to our coal endowment,” added Warwick. It’s a lucky past. Other continents may not have had all these conditions at the time, so peat and coal preservation many not have been as great.

Appalachia and the Illinois Basin have some of the oldest, largest coal deposits. Coal in these areas is found in seams a few hundred feet beneath the earth’s surface, and is mined underground from tunnels or in open pit mines, because it’s mostly deep. This coal east of the Mississippi is primarily a dense, high grade of coal, called bituminous, that contains up to 85 percent carbon. Pennsylvania’s northeast coal fields contain small deposits of the hardest, oldest grade of coal on earth, called anthracite, which is up to 98 percent carbon.

Advertisement

Western coal is younger and a different kind of coal altogether. It’s a much softer version, called sub-bituminous coal, that contains less than 45 percent carbon. Nearly one-half of the coal reserves in the United States are sub-bituminous, and most of it is located in thick beds near the surfaces. While sub-bituminous coal has a lower energy content than bituminous coal, it is mined cheaply in large quantities, making it a low-cost energy source. The Power River Basin in Wyoming, a surface mine, produced 40 percent of all coal mined in the United States in 2011. This coal releases less sulfur dioxide when burned, but power plants need to burn 50 percent more of it to match the higher energy content of Eastern coal.

In 2011, the United States had 259 billion tons of known recoverable coal reserves, more than any other country. But the United States is using less coal itself, so the industry is shrinking even as exports are up. While election campaign rhetoric focused on coal mine job losses in Central Appalachia, a variety of factors play a role in what’s happening to coal. The long, slow decline doesn’t have much to do with whatever economic incentives or regulations are batted about in political speeches. Near-record cheap natural gas has slowed coal use in some regions. In the next four years, 175 small, aging, less-efficient coal generators (accounting for 8.5 percent of total U.S. coal-fired capacity) are expected to close. The plants are located mostly in the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio River Valley regions.

In China and India, coal plants are being built left and right. In Europe, and especially Germany, which is retiring its nuclear power plant fleet, coal is experiencing a renaissance because it’s a cheaper replacement than natural gas.

The coal we burn today was millions of years in the making. We continue to extract and burn vast amounts of it. Given current trends, we’ll run out of it in 225 years or so. In human terms, we have a few generations to figure this out. In geologic time, it’s almost gone.","Tue, 13 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://compote.slate.com/images/10b7c5a4-645a-453e-8616-37cc2a4befa7.jpg,"['geology', 'explains', 'peat', 'sediment', 'states', 'plants', 'million', 'warwick', 'united', 'energy', 'coal', 'earths', 'reserves']", ,none

GENEVA, 16 November (UNHCR) - The UN refugee agency has helped more than 80,000 internally displaced Yemenis return to their homes in the south of their country, the first significant fall in the number of displaced in the area since fighting erupted 18 months ago.

""In southern Yemen, UNHCR is seeing growing numbers of internally displaced people returning to their homes,"" UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told a news conference. ""Over the past four months, and working with the Yemeni authorities, we have helped more than 80,000 people go home, and further returns are on-going. ""

The decline in displacement follows the re-establishing of government authority in the southern province of Abyan in July.

""This is the first significant displacement decline since May 2011 when fighting between government troops and militants erupted in the south of Yemen,"" Edwards said.

Initially, returns were slow due to the widespread presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance, as well as extensive damage to infrastructure. In many cases people also wanted to see more evidence of improved security. However, after de-mining by the Yemeni government and other improvements in security more families are now making the decision to return.

Many of the returns have been from Aden, where more than 23,000 of the 25,000 IDPs who were sheltering in schools and other public buildings have now returned to Abyan. This has allowed normal teaching to resume, although schools still need repairs after having served as IDP sites for over a year.

The 1,500 IDPs still living in Aden schools will be relocated into eight buildings that UNHCR, with the agreement of the government, is rehabilitating to serve as temporary accommodation.

The government has been covering transportation costs - around US$70 per family -- for people returning to Abyan. Security personnel man checkpoints along the route to ensure safe passage, and in Abyan itself UNHCR and other agencies are providing further support.

As the lead international agency responding to IDP and returnee needs for shelter UNHCR has distributed shelter repair kits to some 32,000 people, and non-food items packages to 33,000 people. These packages include mattresses, blankets, kitchen sets, plastic sheeting and tools. UNHCR plans to help 180,000 people in Abyan with shelter and non-food relief kits.

""Currently, the challenges include widespread damage to property and infrastructure, a still fragile security situation, and patchiness in provision of public services,"" said Edwards. ""Continuing international support and stable security will be essential for returns to become sustainable, and particularly if internal displacement in southern Yemen is to be brought to an end during 2013.""

Meanwhile in northern Yemen more than 300,000 people are still displaced from a conflict that has been running on and off since 2004 between Yemeni government forces and al Houthis. Insecurity continues to hinder returns there, while tribal clashes earlier in 2012 generated over 6,000 new IDPs in the northern governorates.

Despite the challenges it faces, Yemen remains one of the most generous refugee hosting countries with over 232,000 refugees, mainly Somalis. While 2011 saw a record new influx of 103,000 refugees and migrants, so far in 2012 there have been over 90,500 new arrivals, mainly Ethiopians.

UNHCR Yemen carries out its crucial humanitarian interventions throughout the country with nine offices and some 200 national and international staff on the ground, In 2011 UNHCR's national implementing partners Society for Humanitarian Solidarity (SHS) received the Nansen award for their life-saving assistance to the thousands of refugees and migrants who arrive on the shores of Yemen every year after crossing the Gulf of Aden by boat.","Fri, 16 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.unhcr.org/thumb1/50a639106.jpg,"['security', 'displaced', 'unhcr', 'yemen', 'shelter', 'internally', 'yemeni', 'abyan', 'schools', 'southern', 'return', '80000', 'returns']", ,none

KHARAZ REFUGEE CAMP, Yemen, 19 November (UNHCR) - Five years after fleeing to Yemen to escape tribal fighting that killed her mother in Somaliland, Faduma finally feels she has a proper, secure home, giving her renewed hope for the future of her three children.

The family recently moved into one of 300 new brick and timber shelters built by UNHCR in the Kharaz Refugee Camp. The new homes, constructed with funding received from the European Commission Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) are now providing permanent shelter for some 1,260 refugees, in particular the elderly and disabled, some of whom had been living in tents for six years.

Kharaz, located in the desert in southern Yemen, is home to almost 20,000 Somali refugees who fled their homeland and made the dangerous sea crossing of the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. In the camp, UNHCR and its partners provide people like Faduma and her children with food, shelter, medical care and education.

Faduma, now 35-years-old, was three months pregnant when she set off with her children to Yemen and was beaten by smugglers during their crossing of the Gulf of Aden. She suffered a miscarriage and a severely damaged kidney which left her in need of hospitalization for several months. Upon recovery, she moved to Kharaz with UNHCR's help.

She felt safe in Kharaz and happy that her children were able to go to school despite having to live in a tent for four years under scorching and humid temperatures. This harsh environment aggravated her medical condition and placed a great strain on the wellbeing and development of her children. Faduma's new home, though spartan with a room and a latrine, is a vast improvement on what she had to endure before.

Lack of sufficient shelter has been a problem in Kharaz camp, compounded by limited space and a substantial increase in the camp population. Since the beginning of 2011 the camp population has increased by 28 percent and now has nearly 20,000 residents, 96 percent of them Somali. Many urban refugees have also moved there over the past year because of difficult economic and security conditions.

UNHCR, with the support of ECHO, has also constructed two communal blocks of latrines and a drainage system for the health centre. In addition, it has improved the camp water supply system with three electrical submersible pumps. The UN refugee agency has also been working closely with the government on an expansion plan for the camp. Considerable challenges remain, not least for 3,000 refugees still living in tents and makeshift shelters.

Yemen hosts some 223,000 Somali refugees who have fled drought, conflict, political instability and human rights violations in their homeland. New refugees from the Horn of Africa continue to arrive in Yemen and many have settled in Kharaz camp.

""UNHCR remains committed to do whatever is possible to continue to improve the living conditions in the camp,"" staid Naveed Hussain, UNHCR's representative in Yemen.

For Faduma and her children the results are now tangible. After moving into their new house Faduma observed: ""Living in a tent caused me pain in my kidneys and it was difficult for my children. Now I can live and believe that life can improve for my children.""

MABAN COUNTY, South Sudan, November 8 (UNHCR) - Aneim has just reached South Sudan's newest refugee camp, Gendrassa, after fleeing a devastating mid-October air attack on his village across the border in Sudan's Blue Nile state.

For UNHCR, the arrival of the livestock farmer and his extended family of 11 people was a further sign that floodwaters are receding and people are once again making the journey to safety in South Sudan's Upper Nile state following attacks on their villages. The refugee agency is, accordingly, taking preemptive measures to cope with a likely accelerated influx.

In the last week of October, UNHCR staff registered 72 new arrivals in Gendrassa, mostly women and children. Although small, this was the highest weekly arrival figure since the rainy season began in May and indicated that the numbers were starting to rise with the changing weather pattern. Before, the flooding was simply too deep to cross, but the most desperate are now chancing their luck as the waters start falling.

Mireille Girard, UNHCR's representative in South Sudan, said that many more refugees were likely to cross the border if fighting between the Sudanese armed forces and the Sudan People's Liberation Army-North escalated during the coming dry season, which begins in mid-November. Food shortages would also be a push factor.

She said that UNHCR had started preparing a contingency plan to meet the most pressing needs of up to 30,000 new refugee arrivals in Maban County between now and the end of the year. It covers key areas such as shelter, health care, food rations and non-food items such as plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, hygiene sets and kitchen items.

UNHCR currently works in four refugee camps in Upper Nile state's Maban County, including Gendrassa, which hosts some 14,300 refugees and is the only one that has not yet reached full capacity. It has room for another 5,000 refugees. Girard said the refugee agency was in negotiations with the local authorities to open new transit centres and camps in other counties.

The only potential new camp site under consideration in Maban County is located at a 400-hectare site and could host between 20,000 and 30,000 refugees. Other locations under consideration, all outside Maban, are Melut, Beneshowa and Longichok.

Unlike the other camps in Maban, the proposed new site sits on a base of pebbles, soil and clay, which makes it easier to instal drainage systems for washing areas and latrines. It is also in an area of shrubs, grassland and trees that can be used for construction and firewood, but this needs to be carefully managed to avoid friction with host communities and to protect natural resources and the environment.

Harmony is vital and UNHCR and other aid groups have established forums where refugees and host communities are being engaged in initiatives to avert or resolve differences over land, resources and even the livestock that refugees bring with them and which graze on community land. Locals in this very remote and undeveloped area of South Sudan have been told that they will be able to access facilities in the new camp such as schools and health centres and possibly find employment.

If given the go ahead, UNHCR experts will search for underground water sources. In addition, water will be trucked to the proposed new site from a well situated 12 kilometres away from Gendrassa.

UNHCR has, meanwhile, stepped up border monitoring activities at several entry points. In the contingency planning, new transit centres may be established near border entry points. People will stay at these sites until they can be transported on to a camp.

The refugee agency has also embarked on an exercise to clear the backlog of people waiting to be registered as refugees. This will allow UNHCR's registration and protection staff to devote their time to any major new influx in the coming months.

A key UNHCR partner, the World Food Programme, is also preparing for the future. WFP has pre-positioned food for 15,000 new arrivals in Jamam camp, which is scheduled to become a transit centre. Extra stocks of corn soya blend have been pre-positioned to meet the nutritional requirements of infants and young children with moderate to acute malnutrition.

The farmer Aneim believes UNHCR is doing the right thing, predicting that refugees will soon start streaming across the border into Maban County from their hiding places in the mountains and forests of Blue Nile state.

""They are suffering terribly. But here they will sleep the night without worrying about exploding bombs,"" he asserted. ""Even if you have lost everything - as I have - this camp has given me the opportunity and the confidence to begin my life again.""

Today, large swaths of that forbidding wilderness remain intact. The country’s Northern Forest Complex, a 12,000-square-mile tract that runs along the border from India to China in Myanmar’s Kachin State, is home to tigers, bears, elephants, and hundreds of bird species. The heart of that forest, at nearly 8,500 square miles, is Myanmar’s Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, the largest tiger preserve in the world.

Now, as Myanmar cautiously embraces democracy and opens up to the world — President Obama will visit the country next week, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so — a key question is what impact an influx of outside capital and foreign expertise will have on the country’s wild lands, biodiversity, and natural resources. The sanctions imposed by Western governments in response to the military dictatorship’s brutal human rights record arguably helped to preserve Myanmar’s remote areas by denying access to credit and foreign investment that would have otherwise been used for road building in the northern jungles.

Some experts warn an influx of foreign capital into Myanmar might cause significant environmental harm.

But with Western governments now lifting sanctions to reward the government’s democratic reforms, some experts warn that an influx of foreign capital might open the floodgates to development and cause significant environmental harm. In a bid to expand regional trade routes, for instance, both the Chinese and Japanese governments are making plans to open transportation corridors through some of Myanmar’s far-flung jungles, paving the way for resource exploitation. The economic might of China, just to the north, is ever-present. In the Hukaung wildlife sanctuary, only 50 tigers are thought to survive, the rest victimized by an illegal wildlife trade with Chinese merchants who pay up to $30,000 for a single animal, dried and packed in a box.

The harsh sanctions also took a toll on Burma’s environment, pushing the country into abject poverty and driving villagers toward poaching and slash-and-burn farming practices that deplete soils and turn landscapes into wastelands. On a drive through the Taung-nyo public protected forest in Rakhine State — near the west coast and way off the beaten tourist track — I saw ragtag bamboo settlements dotting the roadside and a patchwork of charred hillsides and scrubby growth. My host, U Myint Aung, an ex-forestry official who now runs a homegrown non-governmental organization called Friends of Wildlife (FOW), said that the settlements were illegal but tolerated by forest rangers who allow villagers to remain in exchange for small bribes.

So far, Western conservationists in Myanmar are generally heartened by the strong environmental stance Myanmar’s rulers appear to be taking in advance of an expected surge in economic development. “They seem to be taking a much more measured approach to environmental planning, even without international pressure, and that’s to be applauded,” says Joe Walston, executive director of the Asia program of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).

In a well-publicized move last year, Myanmar postponed a massive China-sponsored dam that would have flooded more than 64,000 acres at the headwaters of the Irrawaddy River, citing environmental concerns. Mining along the country’s four major rivers has been banned. And during his inaugural speech in March 2011, President Thein Sein said, “We will pay serious attention to conservation of forests… and lay down a new policy in which we will work for economic development in parallel with environmental conservation.”

New money unleashed by the end of sanctions could help shore up the underfunded environmental sector.

Alan Rabinowitz, chief executive officer of Panthera, a big-cat conservancy group based in New York City, believes that new money unleashed by the elimination of sanctions could go a long way toward shoring up the country’s chronically underfunded environmental sector. In 2003, when he was working for WCS — the only foreign conservation group to maintain a consistent presence in Myanmar during the years of dictatorship — Rabinowitz spearheaded the creation of the Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary.

“There’s never been enough money or expertise or people to help with the defense of Myanmar’s protected areas,” he says. “For years, the World Bank has told me that it wants to help but that it can’t because of the sanctions. So I see the opening as a huge step forward for Myanmar’s ecology.”

U Than Myint, the WCS’s country program director in Yangon, the former capital, agrees that the lifting of sanctions will benefit NGOs in Myanmar’s increasingly active civil society. WCS helps train and fund park rangers and offers training and financial support for communities to shift to sustainable agriculture. “It used to be that all of us in the civil society struggled with limited funding sources,” Than Myint says. “But now with the political opening, we’re seeing more funding agencies and organizations coming here and what we hope is that with their help we can expand our activities.”

NGOs and environmental officials in Myanmar’s government published a report last April detailing a rich diversity of wildlife in the country, but also many critically endangered species, including white-bellied herons, now limited to the most remote waterways in the eastern Himalaya; snub-nosed monkeys; black musk deer; pangolin; and Sumatran rhinoceros.

However, chronic data shortages make it exceedingly difficult to quantify Myanmar’s diversity and natural resources. Kevin Woods, a Yangon-based Ph.D. candidate in environmental science policy and management at the University of California, blames rebel activity in particular for the lack of scientific investigations on the borders, where some of the best-preserved ecosystems remain. “It’s not possible to do any sort of survey in Kachin State,” he says. “Apart from the war, the Northern Forest Complex is extremely remote, with almost no roads. Moreover, the government is severely understaffed, underfunded, and it’s difficult for NGOs to get into that area because of the suspicion locals have towards outsiders.”

Similarly, the full extent of Myanmar’s forest resources — including the famous golden teak that historically accounted for much of the country’s timber exports — is difficult to gauge. In a 2011 report, Woods wrote that Myanmar’s government doesn’t collect or publish data that would be necessary for a “deeper analysis and understanding of the forest industry.” The report did conclude, however, that the forest sector has become increasingly corrupt; that governance systems affecting the forest sector are poorly designed, opaque, and subject to manipulation by military regional commanders and ethnic leaders; that the actual source of exported timber is often unknown; and that the influence of Asian countries looking for a stake in Myanmar’s timber trade — including China, India, Thailand, and Bangladesh — has grown as that of the U.S. and the European Union has waned.

One report concluded that Myanmar’s forest sector has become increasingly corrupt.

The most recent estimates published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicate that Myanmar’s primary forests occupy 10 percent of the country’s land area, mostly in the northern and eastern parts of the country. That’s a substantial amount, given Myanmar’s sheer size. (It’s the second-largest Southeast Asian country, after Indonesia.) According to the FAO, primary forest covers 35 percent of Thailand. But these figures do not tell the whole story: Thailand’s primary forests are more fragmented, and outside of strictly protected areas they are not as pristine as Myanmar’s, according to Jack Hurd, the deputy managing director for the Nature Conservancy’s Asia-Pacific program. Unlike other Southeast Asian nations, Myanmar also has not experienced the widespread conversion of primary forests to monoculture plantations of rubber, palm, and eucalyptus.

Hurd says that given the lack of infrastructure, particularly roads, Myanmar has been able to avoid the industrial deforestation that has occurred elsewhere in Southeast Asia. “What you see instead is lots of ad-hoc, opportunistic exploitation and deals cut among the Myanmar Timber Enterprise [a government body], state governments, and border logging interests,” he says. “So deforestation isn’t as widespread as it could have been if Myanmar’s borders were exposed to the forces of globalization.”

Jake Brunner, the Mekong program director with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, in Hanoi, says that Myanmar’s government needs to impose emergency measures to conserve highly threatened areas, including the Irawaddy River delta’s mangrove forests, which have been decimated by villagers making charcoal. But in the long run, he says, forest protections will depend on whether the country’s emerging governance structures can align national environmental goals with local interests.

Initial signs look promising, Hurd says. But as a country so poor and isolated that less than 2 percent of its 60 million people owns a cell phone, Myanmar faces many challenges. The main risk is that a Wild West mentality will take hold as companies emboldened by trade liberalization scramble to exploit the most valuable resources.

The experience of once-communist Cambodia is a cautionary tale. After free elections in 1993, much of the country was turned over to foreign timber interests. Within 10 years, 50 percent of Cambodia’s old-growth forests were gone. “Avoiding that is going to require political will, but it’s also going to require the necessary capacity and resources,” Hurd says. “The sooner the international community can help Myanmar’s government and civil society figure out how to implement a sustainable approach to resource management, the better.”","Thu, 15 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png,"['fate', 'opens', 'environmental', 'line', 'sanctions', 'conservation', 'world', 'myanmars', 'wildlife', 'countrys', 'forest', 'myanmar', 'northern', 'forests', 'country']", ,none
44,44,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Troops return to Chch from East Timor - Stuff.co.nz,https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/7963023/Troops-return-to-Chch-from-East-Timor,"New Zealand's last rotation of troops to East Timor arrived back in Christchurch last week. Military top brass and Timorese leaders say it's the right time to withdraw. Jimmy Ellingham travelled there for a look.

South of Dili, East Timor's hot, dry and dusty capital, a narrow pot-holed road snakes its way over the hills.

It clings to the sides of gullies and groans under the strain of four-wheel-drives and buses so full of people that some have to cling to the outside.

Their luggage and even the odd live goat somehow stay tied to the top as they make their way across the Southeast Asian nation.

A trip to Madabeno, about 50 kilometres from Dili, takes a couple of hours on this road. It's cooler in the hills and it's like taking a step back in time.

Homes are simple and, although new power pylons hang overhead, the electricity hasn't yet been turned on.

A high proportion of the area's 1665 people are young, but unlike in Dili, where there is more development, including a shopping mall, the locals haven't been living among United Nations peacekeepers and foreign forces.

After an on-and-off presence dating back to 1999, foreign forces are leaving East Timor, and its internal security is being left to the Timorese.

By the end of the year, police acting as UN peacekeepers will be gone. New Zealand's last rotation of 80 troops arrived home in Christchurch last week.

Timorese and the departing leaders seem confident that the country will be fine, that it has broken free of its troubled past.

The police force, which disintegrated in 2006, is now back together, while the military has even reached the stage where its members can go on UN missions overseas.

""It will be good so we can stand alone and serve our country,"" says the chief of Madabeno, Francisco Rodrigues Pereira.

""I believe that, with the training we've already got, they can serve this country peacefully.""

Further up the road, at Bandudato, the village chief, Mario Viera da Costa, says the 2006 trouble did not reach his area.

But the flow-on effects did, as people left the city to seek refuge or return to their districts.

That year wasn't a good one for East Timor, as Dili was swept up in a wave of violence. Rogue elements of the military revolted, the police force collapsed and the city was on fire.

New Zealand troops arrived to restore order, some running straight off a Hercules aircraft in full combat gear.

Fearful for their safety, New Zealand embassy staff locked the gates of their beachfront property and hid inside.

Kiwi police followed to act as peacekeepers. Some are still posted to the country as part of the UN mission that ends on December 31.

""I arrived to find that the rule of law had broken down in Timor,"" Superintendent John Spence recalls.

New Zealand, Australian, Portuguese and Malaysian police filled the breach. Since then about 300 New Zealand officers have served there.

""There were armed gangs wandering the streets of Dili. There was rebellion,"" Spence says.

For Timorese forced to flee from their homes, there were primitive refugee camps, which were ""hotbeds of trouble"".

""There were no police officers around, so villagers used to throw rocks at the IDP (internally displaced persons) camps and the camps would throw rocks back.""

The last of these camps was dissolved two years ago, as East Timor has transformed, but in 2006 and into the next year, instability was rife.

Lance Corporal Stu Triggs says in Dili and in the countryside, patrols would have to take arms off people - machetes, slingshots, guns and even poisoned darts.

When the first New Zealand troops arrived 13 years ago, the former Portuguese colony had voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975.

A wave of violence then swept though the country as pro- Indonesia militia, backed by that country's military, couldn't accept the result.

Horrendous crimes were committed, including a massacre in the southwestern city of Suai, where about 200 people were murdered as they sought shelter in a church.

And in 2000, Private Leonard Manning became New Zealand's first soldier to die since the Vietnam War when he was killed by jungle militia near the Indonesian border.

The situation calmed down again in the early part of the last decade, as independence was achieved in 2002 and foreign troops went home.

This year, East Timor held largely trouble-free presidential and parliamentary elections and it is felt the country can now handle its own internal security, so the stabilisation force and UN police are going home.

Since 2006, 13 rotations of New Zealand soldiers have travelled there on six-month tours of duty, costing about $100 million.

They leave behind only a small team to clean up, and five advisers working with the East Timorese military.

Similarly, while the New Zealand police have finished peacekeeping duties, senior officers will stay on for four years to advise on community policing.

The New Zealanders who just left stayed at a camp known as ""Kiwilines"", a well-established site on the southwest of Dili.

Six years ago makeshift camps were slung up wherever they could find spare land - a world away from life back in New Zealand.

Now one of the old camps is a deserted and crumbling building on the waterfront, home to a few families, chickens and some men selling art.

Their living quarters is a small square tin room, with no air- conditioning and no comforts of home. But there is still peace, something that seemed a world away at the turn of the millenium.

Major Tim Tuatini, the officer in charge of the final rotation of Kiwi soldiers, was first in East Timor in 2001.

Like many who have come back, he says the country has changed immensely.

""It's just the small things. There are a lot of children. There are a lot of scooters now, yellow taxis, vehicles moving up and down. It's the hustle and bustle I'd expect from any Asian city,"" he says.

""When I was here last time, if you saw an SUV or large vehicle moving around, it was normally an international who was driving it. Now, you have Timorese driving them.""

This isn't typical in a poor country, where many of the 1.1 million people are subsistence farmers who live in areas devoid of contact with the outside world.

A lack of jobs could be the spark that sets Dili off, says United States doctor Dan Murphy, who runs a stretched and busy medical clinic in the city.

He is ""sceptical"" about the withdrawal of foreign troops and police, saying the situation could turn bad again.

""People still aren't that professional. There's still a lot of self-interest. There are still a lot of problems from the past.""

During the past couple of weeks, Murphy has noticed gangs roaming the streets at night and the odd shotgun sound.

""It doesn't take much to start something,"" he warns. ""The whole thing could go down the drain again. Most people have no job and they don't have much to do. They're sitting around and they've got all this testosterone pumping through their veins.""

Dili is a city of about 200,000 people and it's growing quickly. There, the New Zealand military has remained, under the banner of the Australian-led International Stabilisation Force that officially ended its mandate on October 31.

It seems the Kiwi soldiers have left a good impression with the Timorese.

As a group of them have dinner at a restaurant in Dili, a boy passing by says ""Kia ora, bro"".

Others put it more simply: ""Kiwi, good"".

While East Timor may be more stable, it is not trouble-free.

Poverty and disease are rampant, unemployment is high and basic nutrition is lacking.

New Zealand Ambassador to Dili, Tony Fautua, has talked of moving the two countries' relationship away from one of enforcement towards trade, education and development.

He hopes future delegations to East Timor will be from businesses, rather than the military or police.","Sat, 17 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1353111446/293/7964293.jpg,"['military', 'east', 'timor', 'city', 'arrived', 'zealand', 'chch', 'camps', 'troops', 'return', 'dili', 'country']", ,none

The execution of soldier Muhammad Hussain has risked Pakistan’s hard-earned trading leverages with the European Union (EU) by breaking the four-year moratorium on death penalty which served as a condition for duty-free access to EU markets.





As a fatal coincidence, the penalty overlapped the coming into force of EU’s trade concessions which, after years of tedious dialogue, became operational on November 16. Facilitated trade required Pakistan to meet some human rights benchmarks, including the curtailment of the death penalty.It is hence feared that Hus­sain’s hanging in a Mianwali jail on November 15 may provide grounds to jeopardise Pakistan’s trade prospects with the bloc of 27 nations.Hussain, 45, stabbed a superior in Okara over a personal dispute in 2008. He was tried in the military court in Okara cantonment, which sentenced him to death on February 12, 2009. Hussain’s mercy petitions to the General Headquarters (GHQ) and the Chief of Army Staff were rejected. Senator Farhatullah Babar, the presidential spokesman, revealed that Hussain’s mercy petition to the president was also turned down.The break in the de facto moratorium undercuts recent announcement by the government of introducing legislation to abolish death penalty, said EU High Representative Catherine Ashton in a statement.Following the execution, EU headquarters in Brussels posed questions to the country’s mission, sought all relevant information, and said that EU trade agreements were tied to human rights bars whose violation increases chances of cancellation, said diplomatic sources.The EU is not willing to take the execution of the army soldier as an exception – an execution is an execution, whether ordered by a military court or a civilian court, said embassy officials. Chief of Army Staff General Kayani could have intervened to pardon the soldier, they said, adding that all available options were not utilised to exonerate Husain.The Nov 16 concessions were on 75 trade items for a period of roughly 14 months. The proposal for concessions was put forth after the 2010 floods to abet Pakistan’s economic recovery. It came into force after 26 months.It was agreed that quarterly reviews would decide the continuity of concessions.According to EU embassy officials, the recently proposed Generalised Scheme of Preferences, which will come into force from 2014, and promises duty free access of unlimited goods, is not attached to abolition of the death penalty.Officials added the worst scenario for Pak-EU trade relations would be a series of executions, with the recent one serving as a precedent.Published in The Express Tribune, November 19, 2012.","Sun, 18 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",http://i1.tribune.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/467905-Hang-1353275083.jpg,"['penalty', 'rights', 'eu', 'court', 'violation', 'human', 'hanging', 'soldier', 'pakistans', 'jeopardises', 'force', 'trade', 'hussains', 'death', 'soldiers', 'concessions', 'execution']", ,none
47,47,FF-2012-000189-IDN,What to Do About DDoS Attacks - BankInfoSecurity.com,https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ddos-vendor-a-5271,"What to Do About DDoS Attacks

Security Experts Offer Banks Tips

Leaders at four security technology companies say the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that have hit 10 U.S. banks in recent weeks highlight the need for new approaches to preventing and responding to online outages.

See Also: Live Webinar | The Role of Passwords in the Hybrid Workforce

""Attackers have broadened their toolkits, and DDoS is a not just a blunt instrument anymore,"" says Jason Malo, a fraud analyst CEB TowerGroup and former DDoS-prevention expert for domain-naming-system registry operator VeriSign.

These experts advise banking institutions to:

Use appropriate technology, including cloud-based Web servers, which can handle overflow, when high volumes of Web traffic strike;

Assess ongoing DDoS risks, such as through tests that mimic real-world attacks;

Implement online outage mitigation and response strategies before attacks hit;

Train staff to recognize the signs of a DDoS attack.

During a DDoS attack, a website is flooded with what security experts often call ""junk"" traffic - a saturation of requests that overwhelm the site's servers, preventing them from being able to respond to legitimate traffic. In essence, DDoS attacks take websites down because the servers can't handle the traffic.

Security experts interviewed for this story say most banks have failed to address this vulnerability to high volumes of traffic.

DDoS: Banks on Alert

Starting in mid-September, DDoS attacks have resulted in online outages at 10 major U.S. banks.

The hacktivist group Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has taken credit for the hits, saying the attacks are motivated by outrage related to a YouTube movie trailer deemed offensive to Muslims.

But security experts say DDoS attacks are often used as tools of distraction to mask fraud in the background (see DDoS Attacks: First Signs of Fraud?).

To reduce their risk of DDoS takedown, experts say banks need to address three key areas:

Layered user authentication at login, which consumes bandwidth;

at login, which consumes bandwidth; Reliance on Internet service providers not equipped to handle extreme bandwidth demands; and

The internal management of Web servers, which limits banks' ability to hand off traffic overflow when volumes are excessive.

Expert Advice

Fraud should always be an institution's top concern, meaning addressing DDoS threats should be a priority, experts say. ""DDoS protections have quickly become a new industry best practice,"" Malo says.

But DDoS attacks pose unique challenges for banks and credit unions. The additional layers of security institutions already implement, such as enhanced user authentication, transaction verification and device identification, demand more bandwidth. So when a bank is hit by a DDoS attack, bandwidth is strained more than it would be at a non-banking e-commerce site, says Mike Smith, a senior security evangelist at Akamai Technologies, which specializes in Internet traffic monitoring and cloud-based DDoS protections (see New Bank Attacks Expected Today?).

So what protections make sense?

BankInfoSecurity asked security vendors VeriSign, Prolexic, Cisco and Akamai Technologies for their top recommendations. They all stressed that no one-size-fits-all approach to thwarting attacks exists. Nevertheless, they identified several best practices.

Use Appropriate Technology

When it comes to selecting the right technologies to minimize DDoS-related outages, vendors advise:

Rely on the cloud. No internal server could be expected to handle the amount of traffic these recent DDoS attacks have pushed. Akamai's Smith says the average amount of traffic coming in during some of those individual attacks equaled about 65 gigabytes per second.

""Even at the height of the Anonymous attacks, we saw traffic coming in from 7,000 or 8,000 people [at approximately 1 gigabyte per second],"" he says.

By relying on cloud-based servers and systems, banks can expand their bandwidth. ""It's never a good idea to manage everything internally,"" says Joe Dallatore, senior manager of the Cisco Security & Research Information Group, which specializes in security threat monitoring and online event tracking.

Working with a cloud vendor also can help institutions more readily identify a DNS-server attack or other DDoS attack, Dallatore says.

Using DNS providers with the capacity to absorb an attack makes sense, because when DNS fails, all other services fail, says Akamai's Smith. ""This is why almost all the large banks use a DNS provider in some capacity, and it's a proactive defense that is always turned on by default,"" he adds.

Use virtual private networks. VPNs indirectly improve DDoS protections, says Matt Wilson, who oversees strategic technologies at VeriSign. Attackers target publicly available sites because they are public. But a VPN cannot protect an entire infrastructure. For complete protection, banks and businesses must continue to rely on other technologies for firewall management as well as server and router maintenance, he says.

A better solution, Akamai's Smith suggests, is VPN over MPLS [multiprotocol label switching] for critical or business-to-business functions.

Apply challenge-and-response. Malo says banks should encourage vendors to develop DDoS protections that ""challenge"" traffic. These protections, he says, could mirror challenge-and-response options, such as CAPTCHA images, used for online banking. A CAPTCHA image uses distorted letters or numbers that an online user is required to enter at login to help affirm authenticity.

""DDoS mitigation is not just about finding a signature and putting mechanisms in to filter or block traffic,"" Malo says. ""Mitigation also includes introducing challenge-response."" Challenge-and-response options would help banking institutions differentiate legitimate traffic from so-called junk traffic often associated with DDoS attacks, he adds.

But Akamai's Smith warns that challenge-and-response during a large DDoS attack could be dangerous, since challenge-and-response takes one request and turns it into four. ""This does not scale, and it sets you up for additional points of failure."" he says. For smaller attacks, challenge-and-response can be effective, however, ""where we are worried about denying legitimate users because of mega-proxies, corporate Internet access points,"" Smith says.

Don't rely on intrusion detection. Intrusion prevention and detection systems can be effective at picking up on anomalous traffic or behavior associated with a DDoS attack, CEB TowerGroup's Malo says. But that's not what those systems were primarily designed to do. While leaning on those systems can help DDoS detection, and in some cases help institutions thwart online outages, redirecting IPS and IDS can create new vulnerabilities.

""When protection systems are redirected, banking institutions inadvertently create new vulnerabilities,"" he says, because other defenses are weakened.

Scrub. Traffic scrubbing, which clears suspected botnets and junk traffic at the ISP, can be effective, Cisco's Dallatore says. The more bad traffic an institution can block at the outset, the better its chances of limiting an outage.

Assess DDoS Risks

Vendors stress that regularly assessing DDoS risks, such as through tests that mimic real-world attacks, is essential.

""Run periodic table-top exercises to model how an attack could hit and then test the accompanying remediation strategies you've put in place,"" says Stuart Scholly, president of Prolexic, which specializes in cloud-based services for website restoration after a DDoS attack.

To set the stage for remediation plans and testing, vendors recommend banking institutions first:

Know typical traffic patterns. To better assess risk, financial institutions must carefully determine what typical site traffic looks like, Malo says. That way, when a DDoS attack hits, atypical traffic patterns are more obvious.

Understand the infrastructure. Understand the Web applications, online bandwidth limits and any infrastructure elements that could affect site capacity. Akamai's Smith says network segmentation can limit the impact an attack has on other services inside the same infrastructure. ""At a minimum, critical sites should be provisioned onto their own, dedicated network circuits and border devices to limit the impact of both an attack against them and from attacks against other services in the same data center,"" he says. ""Brochureware sites,"" consumer transactional sites and business sites are good candidates to break out into their own infrastructure, Smith says, while redirect, typo and marketing-campaign sites can be run from shared infrastructure.

Mitigation and Response

DDoS mitigation strategies and response plans should be included in disaster recovery and business continuity strategies, Prolexic's Scholly says.

Those strategies also must include definitive communication and action plans, Cisco's Dallatore says. Communicating with employees and the public soon after a DDoS attack is critical for reputational preservation. ""You want to be sure operational people, for instance, can reach the decision makers or have the authority to make decisions when a site goes down,"" Dallatore says.

During the recent wave of attacks, banks' communication with the public varied. Some institutions acknowledged their sites went down because of DDoS attacks, while others only said their sites experienced intermittent outages.

Greg Nowak of the Information Security Forum says most institutions have been too quiet - fueling the public's fears about the outages. ""They seem to be regarding it as a secret,"" Nowak says. ""[The banks] should be taking the opportunity to explain to their customers the difference between a denial-of-service attack and some sort of hacking attack that actually puts information at risk.""

Provide Training

Training staff to recognize the signs of an attack is essential, vendors advise.

Bank and credit union employees must understand what DDoS attack traffic patterns look like, says Prolexic's Scholly. Front-line staff members also need to know how to respond if they start getting calls about a site being down.

BITS, the technology division of the Financial Services Roundtable, says banks and credit unions need to clearly communicate with customers and members that their financial information and accounts are secure.

Among BITS recommendations:

Explain that attacks have not resulted in unauthorized access to customer information;

Reiterate to consumers that banking institutions use sophisticated online security strategies to protect customer accounts;

Let consumers know that institutions continue to invest in technology to defend against potential attacks.

""We want the public to know that institutions are taking steps to address these attacks - with ISPs and other security providers - and there is a fair amount of collaboration going on with regulators and the Department of Homeland Security about the threats and how to address them,"" says John Carlson, executive vice president of BITS.

""You can't underestimate the importance of training, and the role it plays in your business continuity planning,"" Scholly says. ""When you are prepared, it makes a world of difference.""","Thu, 08 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://130e178e8f8ba617604b-8aedd782b7d22cfe0d1146da69a52436.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/what-to-do-about-ddos-attacks-imageFile-a-5271.jpg,"['security', 'smith', 'traffic', 'attacks', 'institutions', 'banks', 'ddos', 'attack', 'online', 'sites']", ,none

The New York-based rights group said in a report Tuesday more than 300 people have been killed in politically motivated attacks in Cambodia in the past two decades of Prime Minister Hun Sen's rule. The group says rather than investigate the crimes, Cambodia's government has instead ignored them and in some cases even promoted those believed to be responsible.



Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson tells VOA that President Obama, who next week will become the first ever U.S. president to visit Cambodia, is in a unique position to publicly demand human rights improvements.



""We're calling on President Obama to really strongly and publicly raise these human rights concerns, to press for accountability, and to insist that it can't be business as usual with the Cambodian government, given the gravity of these human rights violations,"" Robertson said.



The report praised the U.S. for being ""one of the most outspoken critics of the Cambodian government's human rights record."" But Robertson says Washington's actions have not always been consistent with its words.



""For instance, when the U.S. gave national police chief Hok Lundy an award [in 2006] for his contribution to anti-terror work. I mean, Hok Lundy was well-known throughout Cambodia as a brutal killer, someone who struck fear in the hearts of ordinary Cambodians. He was certainly no one who deserves any sort of accolade from the United States government,"" Robertson said.



During his 27 years in power, Prime Minister Hun Sen has repeatedly promised reforms, such as creating an independent judicial system and more accountable police force. But Human Rights Watch says he has not followed through on those promises, and that foreign governments have failed to hold him accountable.



Robertson says it is time for the U.S. and other governments and donors, which he says account for up to 50 percent of the Cambodian national budget, to insist on changes.



""The president should ... make it quite clear to Hun Sen that the U.S. is not fooled, that the U.S. is not having the wool pulled over its eyes, that it understands in a very clear way the human rights challenges that exist in Cambodia and that it is prepared to comment on those,"" Robertson said.



Cambodian officials have suggested that Prime Minister Hun Sen will hold bilateral talks with President Obama when the U.S. leader travels to Phnom Penh for the ASEAN and East Asia summits beginning next Monday.","Tue, 13 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/BAFE6466-8D7C-4A18-BADA-F93D7BB6B57A.jpg,"['abuses', 'rights', 'robertson', 'watch', 'cambodia', 'human', 'group', 'president', 'address', 'sen', 'prime', 'urges', 'obama', 'hun']", ,none

“I laughed and didn’t think much about it at the time,” Scott said.

Shortly after that, however, he took a hard look at going to culinary school.

“At 15, I had several years in (hospitality) and I thought ‘Maybe I should do this.’ I looked harder at it and decided this is what I would do. Thirty-four or 35 years later, here we are and I’m dean of education.”

These birds are one of the first the beginner photographer or birdwatcher can add to their life list; as the birds stop, scratch at the ground and search for hidden insects and other avian delicacies. Most prefer open forests and coastal areas.

The shamas, a shy bird, are usually spotted at twilight and dawn in primary and secondary forests. They are known for their long tails and melodious singing. They often imitate the sounds of other birds. The species is nearly extinct in Singapore because they are captured by greedy individuals and sold to the public as caged-songbirds. The birds are in major decline throughout the region because of the pet trade. They are purchased and live only a few months in captivity because the owners soon become bored and they are neglected.

Magpie robins and shamas are thought to have evolved in Southeast Asia from African relatives about 7.2 to 5.3 million years ago. How and why they arrived is not known but they are genetically closely related to their African, Middle Eastern and South Asian cousins.

Shamas

Once the shamas evolved, there are two possible scenarios for their further distribution on Southeast Asian islands. The varieties in the Philippines were the result of two invasions from Sundaland, the area that encompasses Indonesia to the Wallace Line and Malaysia. The first wave resulted in the white-browed shamas (Copsychus luzoniensis), an isolated population on the island of Luzon.

The second wave, from Borneo, landed on the islands of Palawan and Cebu. They eventually evolved into Copsychus niger and Copsychus cebuensis.

The second hypothesis on the distribution has the birds arriving very early, about 27 million years ago in the Philippines. From there, they diversified and re-invaded Sundaland via Borneo.

The white-rumped shama (Copsychus malabaricus) arrived and became isolated in eastern and western Sundaland. The Borneo variety morphed into two separate subspecies – the white-capped (Copsychus stricklandii) to the north and black-capped (Copsychus suavis) on the rest of the island.

Magpie robins

The magpie robins, as good dispensers, arrived from Africa en masse and populated the Indian Ocean and Sundaland. In the Philippines, they morphed into an all-black form (Copsychus mindanesis). Interestingly, they are not on the island of Palawan, maybe because of competition with the black shama (Copsychus niger).

The original birds of Borneo and Java were black-bellied while white-bellied types arose on Sumatera, the Malay Peninsula and the mainland. The black-bellied birds on Borneo further evolved into two subspecies, adamsi in Sabah and pluto on the rest of the island. There is a hybridisation zone in central Borneo where the black and white forms meet.

Refugia hypothesis

An idea came about in 1969 from Jurgen Hafferin describing a possible scenario on the rise of species and sub-species in the tropics. During the last ice age, the tropical rainforests were divided into islands by broad expanses of savannah and grasslands. This was because of a cooling and drying period. These isolated rainforests became known as refugia.

In each of these separated forests (refugia), the isolated flora and fauna became different, unable to move from one area to another and intermingle. As time passed, they evolved into separate sub-species and species. This occurrence has been used to explain the different orangutan subspecies as well as ant and rodent species among others.

However, the union of disparate land masses from low sea levels could also explain the spread of different species. Birds could fly over them stopping for food instead of over open water.

From Sumatera, the black-rumped shama (Copsychus suavis) could have spread east to Borneo meeting up with white-capped (Copsychus stricklandii). Remember, all the land was connected because the waters were tied up in ice. When the ice melted and warmer temperatures returned, the land bridges were flooded, returning to the familiar map of today.

A huge puzzle yet to be solved is why the lowland species of birds are different in Sabah and not on the rest of the island. For example, both the magpie robin (Copsychus saularis adamsi) and shama (Copsychus malabaricus stricklandii – possible separate species?) are found only in the north and nowhere else in the world.

The backyard gardener and amateur birder will get to know the magpie robins very quickly. They are familiar in most parts of open areas in Kuching. Our forest dwellers, the shamas, will require waking up a bit early or wandering around 7pm near the edge of the forest. Grab your binoculars and field guide and enjoy these birds that arrived from Africa many millions of years ago.

67,67,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Alexander as Zulqarnain - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/story/467252/alexander-as-zulqarnain,"There is, in rural Mandi Bahauddin district, a few kilometres from Phalia town, a village marked as Helan in the Atlas of Pakistan. The ‘a’ is pronounced as in ‘father’ and the ending is nasal as it would be in French. The village is known for a tomb dating to the reign of Akbar the Great . In May 2000, I paused there, met a local ‘historian’ and learned that the word was a mispronunciation of Helen!Now, it was well known that Helen of Troy , said the man, was the wife of Alexander the Macedonian. When she died, Alexander ordered this tomb. Inside, sits an ornate sandstone sarcophagus radiant with flowing curvilinear forms and calligraphy that tells us that the tomb is the last resting place of some Ali Beg. But that did not matter to my new friend.Later, in nearby Mong, the village that takes its name from the Scythian King Maues (1century BCE), known as Moga in Punjabi, I got another educational boost. Seeing that I was on the trail of Alexander, a rather contrary sort of middle-aged man took me under his wing. He spoke of the Macedonian’s victory over Raja Paurava (Greek: Porus) with admirable pride and how folks named their sons after the Macedonian. I asked if folks ever named a son after Paurava, he being one of our own. Pat came an angry, “Kyon? O koi Musalman cee?” Islam being nearly a millennium in the future, Raja Paurava was certainly no Muslim. But then neither was Alexander. On another similar occasion, my interlocutor burst out with an incredulous half-question, half-statement, “Alexander was Hindu?”Interestingly, even semi-educated persons in Pakistan cannot imagine a religion like the Greeks had, with a large pantheon of mostly fun-loving gods. They are caught in a mental box with four names — Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and a very distant and vague Judaism. No other religion appears on their radar.This man in Mong was smarter, however. He countered with the statement that Alexander was mentioned in the Holy Quran. The king we so desperately want to turn into Alexander is the Quranic Zulqarnain whose name means ‘Two-Horned’. He travelled across the great expanse of the world, ruled over a vast kingdom and was responsible for locking away the dreaded nation of Gog and Magog behind a rubble wall steeped in molten lead. This king, we read, travelled to the rising and setting places of the sun. That is, his sway extended across much of the known world of his time.But scripture does not reveal anything beyond this short reference. Now, there were two famous world-conquering kings in history who wore horns on their helmets. Cyrus the Great (ruled BCE 549-529) of Persia and, 200 years later, Alexander of Macedonia. Indeed, the latter’s depiction on coinage with diadem and ram’s horns is very well known.Now, both were great conquerors, therefore, either could be Zulqarnain. But mark: Cyrus established a kingdom only marginally smaller than Alexander’s.This kingdom lasted 200 years until Alexander unravelled it and became master of it. Alexander’s kingdom was larger. His governors presided on the affairs of men from Thrace (Bulgaria) through the Scythian steppes on the northern shores of the Black Sea, to the banks of the Jaxartes (Syr) River (in Uzbekistan) and across the entire Persian Empire, Afghanistan, Punjab and Sindh to Babylon. But it was a short-lived empire, lasting just over a decade until Alexander’s death in 322 BCE.So, really, which king was it that scripture refers to as the ‘Two-Horned’? If greatness were a measure in terms of longevity of kingdom, I would vote Cyrus. However, Alexander who did indeed embody traits that could arguably be termed ‘great’ left behind a kingdom that did not last beyond his own lifetime.But we, in Pakistan, embrace him. We stretch the words of scripture to make Zulqarnain fit into Alexander’s shoes. We do this only because he, an outsider, defeated a king of Punjab who, unfortunately, was a Hindu. We disregard the fact that Raja Paurava (of whose greatness of character I have written earlier in this column) was a Hindu because he predated Islam.Published in The Express Tribune, November 18, 2012.","Sat, 17 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",http://i1.tribune.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/467252-SalmanRashidNew-1353167789.jpg,"['alexander', 'king', 'zulqarnain', 'paurava', 'known', 'kingdom', 'scripture', 'tomb', 'great', 'village']", ,none

'As soon as Michel became pregnant, I began creating a video journal library, documenting my thoughts on life to pass on to Rivers,' Gleason wrote on his website. 'It’s an incredibly rewarding and productive activity.'

Gleason and his wife also document their lives on a blog, which they update frequently with pictures of them traveling around the country with their young son.

Totality - the darkness that happens at the peak of the eclipse - will last just over two minutes.

Forecasted cloud cover failed to ruin view of incredible cosmic display

Stargazers gather in northern Australia to witness it



From boats bobbing on the Great Barrier Reef to hot air balloons hovering over the rainforest, and the hilltops and beaches in between, tens of thousands of scientists, tourists and amateur astronomers watched in awe as the sun, moon and Earth aligned and plunged northern Australia into darkness.



Forecasters were predicting cloudy skies around dawn Wednesday, but it didn't materialise, allowing stargazers to experience it unhindered.



The eclipse began at 05.45 in the far north of the Australian state, with totality occurring at 06.38 on November 14 (20.38 GMT).

'Immediately before, I was thinking, `Are we gonna see this?' And we just had a fantastic display - it was just beautiful,"" said Terry Cuttle of the Astronomical Association of Queensland, who has seen a dozen total solar eclipses over the years.



'And right after it finished, the clouds came back again.

'It really adds to the drama of it.'



Spectators whooped and clapped with delight as the moon passed between the sun and Earth, leaving a slice of the continent's northeast in sudden darkness.

The three of them hopped on board a hot air balloon with other eager tourists and staff from Hot Air Balloon Cairns, crossed their fingers - and were rewarded with a perfect view.



'We gambled everything - drove through the rain and didn't even know if the balloon was going to go up,"" he said by phone from the hot air balloon as he and Harrison, 10, and Reilly, 12, watched the sun's rays re-emerge from behind the moon while kangaroos hopped on the ground below.

On a dive-boat drifting along the blue waters of the Great Barrier Reef, a cheer of relief erupted as the clouds moved away at the moment of total eclipse, followed by a hush as darkness fell across the water.



One scuba diver floated on his back in the sea, watching the phenomenon unfold as he bobbed in the waves. Birds on a nearby island, startled by the sudden lack of light, began to stir.



'It was absolutely amazing.



'We were coming out this morning and there was a wee bit of cloud around and we were apprehensive,' Adam O'Malley of the Passions of Paradise dive company said by phone from his boat.



'We got a full view - absolutely breathtaking.'

HOW IT HAPPENED

An eclipse occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun, which darkens the sky and causes temperatures to drop. The eclipse will cast its 150-kilometer (95-mile) wide shadow starting at dawn in Australia's Northern Territory and then cross the northeast tip of the country before swooping east across the South Pacific.

The Moon's penumbral shadow produces a partial eclipse visible from a much larger region covering the South Pacific (including Australia and New Zealand), southern South America, and part of Antarctica.

Many worried that they would miss a rare chance to view the celestial phenomenon.

'There will be breaks in (the clouds), but it's just a matter of the luck of the draw whether you get a break at the right time,' said Queensland state Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Andrew Mostyn.

The eclipse cast its 150-kilometer (95-mile) wide shadow starting at dawn in Australia's Northern Territory and then crossed the northeast tip of the country before swooping east across the South Pacific.



No islands are in its direct path, so northern Australia is the only land where the full eclipse could be seen, said Geoff Wyatt, an astronomer with Sydney Observatory.



A partial eclipse was expected to be visible from east Indonesia, the eastern half of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and southern parts of Chile and Argentina.



Totality - the darkness that happens at the peak of the eclipse - lasted just over two minutes.



Among those sweating out the forecast was U.S. astronomer Jay Pasachoff, who traveled to Australia in hopes of viewing his 56th solar eclipse.



Pasachoff, an astronomy professor at Williams College in Massachusetts, and a team of about 50 scientists and students fanned out across the region to improve the odds that at least some of them will see the eclipse.

The group is planning to study the sun's corona, the glowing white ring around the sun that is visible only during an eclipse.



Despite the anxiety over the weather and the long journey to get there, Pasachoff said he wouldn't miss it.



'Just imagine you were a heart surgeon and someone actually told you you could look inside a human heart only for two minutes, and only if you went halfway around the world, he said. 'You would do it.'



Some Queensland hotels have been booked up for more than three years and more than 50,000 people flooded into the region to watch the solar spectacle, said Jeff Gillies, regional director of Queensland Tourism.

Skygazers crowded beaches, boats, fields and hot air balloons to watch the event. Fitness fanatics raced in the Solar Eclipse Marathon, where the first rays of the sun re-emerging from behind the moon served as the starting gun.



Some have already been partying for days at a weeklong eclipse festival.



Scientists will be studying how animals respond to the eclipse, with underwater cameras capturing the effects of sudden darkness on the creatures of the Great Barrier Reef.



'It's an unknown with how they'll react,' Gillies said. 'A little bit of flora and fauna confusion, I would imagine.'



The last total solar eclipse visible in Australia was 10 years ago, in the South Australia Outback.

When one of her earliest Hollywood claims to fame was being labeled The Sweater Girl, it probably goes without saying that the professional film community wasn't overly impressed or frankly overly concerned with Lana Turner's acting ability. The young (as in--namely 16) girl caught the eye of a powerful publisher at a local soda fountain and got the girl an agent (Zeppo Marx, no less) almost within minutes of his discovery. Even the legendary Jack Warner simply assumed Lana was just another pretty face, and didn't put up much of a fuss when Lana matriculated to the much more glamorous ranks of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. But even at Metro Lana was thrust into roles that depended more on her physique than any intrinsic acting ability, and while she made any number of high profile films during her forties heyday, and was at least reputably professional in virtually all of them, few would ever accuse her of having the sort of innate performance abilities that some of her Metro cohorts did. Turner occasionally was able to hint at untapped depths in films like, but Metro seemed insistent on casting her in glitzy roles, and once her box office appeal started waning, and the studio system itself was on the verge of collapse, Metro didn't seem to know what exactly it wanted to do with her. It was toward the end of Lana's long contract with Metro that she made, a Fox behemoth that was in fact a remake of a 1939 Fox film that Lana had been considered for back at the beginning of her career. Turner had a long history of conflict with many of her leading men (she couldn't stand John Garfield in, for example), and that evidently was the case once again in this film, as she found Richard Burton intolerable. (It's ironic how bothandsimmer with sexual tension between the respective stars, so either Lanaa great actress or perhaps, to paraphrase a famous quote from, the lady doth protest too much.Lana and Michael Rennie portray Lady Edwina and Lord Albert Esketh, two jaded souls entangled in a marriage of inconvience. Edwina like Albert's classy sounding title, and Albert loved Edwina's fabulous fortune. Unfortunately the years have not been kind to the couple, and they barely tolerate each other, as is made clear in a blistering little opening scene where they lay their emotional cards on the table. They're on the way to Ranchipur, where Albert hopes to buy a prize show horse from the local Maharini (Eugenie Leontovich). Once they arrive, a ""childhood friend"" of Edwina's, local ne'er-do-well ""town drunk"" Tom Ransome (Fred MacMurray) shows up, seemingly riling Albert just a little. Tom on the other hand is being hounded every so nicely by sweet young thing Fern (Joan Caulfield), who feels with a little help, Tom can give up his nasty drinking habit and amount to something after all.Into this roiling melodramatic stew glides a young Indian doctor named Rama Safti (Richard Burton), a man who has already written a book which has made him an international celebrity and who has been hand picked by the Maharini to be her successor. Edwina is immediately drawn to Safti, first as a sort of exotic toy with whom she plays like a cat might with a mouse, but who soon actually captures her heartif she actually has one. This star-crossed love affair across a cultural divide may in fact remind some prescient viewers of another glamorous 1955 Fox production, one that is certainly better remembered than, namelyunfortunately falls far short of's more relatively stately depiction of this same general setup for a number of reasons. First of all, Edwina makes for an extremely unlikable main character, and the audience is basically rooting against her for the entire film, even when she shows certain traces of nobility of character (not many, mind you, but). There's also some (hopefully) unintentionally risible dialogue throughout the film (my personal favorite is when a well intentioned nursemaid offers Edwina some aspirin for her incipient malaria). But Jean Negulesco, never a director one associates with much subtlety, gives the film a positively Douglas Sirkian feel, one that is also fairly redolent of the kind of trashy big budget Ross Hunter fare that would soon become Turner's stock in trade.The big earthquake and flood scenes which cap the film's climax offer a temporary, if jolting, respite from the emotional turbulence that has filled the bulk of the film, ironically offering up a physical catastrophe in the place of one of the heart. Whiledid okay box office back in its day (though it was considered a failure due to its huge production costs), it's hard to imagine that many people left the theater feeling much of anything other than a sense of relief that they made it out of all the overblown melodrama alive.","Mon, 12 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.static-bluray.com/movies/covers/52513_large.jpg,"['ranchipur', 'metro', 'date', 'girl', 'lana', 'tom', 'little', 'edwina', 'young', 'bluray', 'albert', 'local', '13', 'film', 'rains', 'release']", ,none

82,82,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Evil: Plain and Simple - Dissident Voice,https://dissidentvoice.org/2012/11/evil-plain-and-simple/,"In a recent Real News piece, senior editor Paul Jay objected to talk of lesser evilism: “… I think this whole terminology lesser evil, it’s a terrible mistake to use such terminology. The problem is it’s turning this whole thing into some kind of moral debate, and neither Romney nor Obama are evil. They are the products of a social-economic system. They represent different sections of the elite…”

I still think Real News is the best progressivist video fare available, and Jay is one of the best news anchors, but Jay’s assertion still leaves me astounded. That his assertion is unfounded is fully refuted by Obama holding the US hand over Israel to prevent it from UN censure.

Evenhandedness is out the window on this slaughter as well. According to the Obama administration, Hamas is to blame.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney had this to say: “Well, we strongly condemn the barrage of rocket fire from Gaza into Israel, and we regret the death and injury of innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians caused by the ensuing violence. There is no justification for the violence that Hamas and other terrorist organizations are employing against the people of Israel. We call on those responsible to stop these cowardly acts immediately in order to allow the situation to deescalate.”

“… Hamas claims to have the best interest of the Palestinian people at heart, yet it continues to engage in violence that is counterproductive to the Palestinian cause. Attacking Israel on a near daily basis does nothing to help Palestinians in Gaza or to move the Palestinian people any close to achieving self-determination.”

It appears, at least, that Obama administration officials are reading from the same script. AP reports US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice had mouthed nearly identical words to the UN Security Council prior to the utterances by Carney at his press gaggle.

What exactly is Israel’s 24/7 siege on Gaza, if not violence that is counterproductive to peace between Israel and Gaza? Do Carney, Rice, and Obama insist that if the Gazans sit on their hands that the siege will be lifted?

The following video (purportedly from the Israeli assault on Gaza) depicts, what is undeniably, evil. WARNING: The video is very graphic.

Obama is not a lesser evilist; he is the man who enables evil. If this does not — in Paul Jay’s mind — call for a moral debate, then one wonders what does call for such a debate. The ongoing, repeated carnage and slaughter in Gaza (Syria, Bahrain, Afghanistan …) underscores the utter futility of pandering to lesser evilism. If one votes for a degree of evil, then one should not be surprised when evil results.

Progressivism demands that social justice activists repudiate evil. Consequently, insofar as media plays along within the parameters set by the socio-economic system and its evil, how progressivist can it legitimately claim to be?","Sat, 17 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://dissidentvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/obama_gaza_DV.jpg,"['hamas', 'video', 'jay', 'plain', 'violence', 'simple', 'palestinian', 'lesser', 'obama', 'evil', 'israel', 'gaza']", ,none
