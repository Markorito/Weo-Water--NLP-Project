0,0,FL-2020-000207-NGA,MATTERS ARISING: 28 states at risk of flooding -- how prepared is Nigeria? - TheCable,https://www.thecable.ng/states-risk-flooding-nigeria-2021,"Uche Igwe will not forget August 26, 2020 in a hurry. It had rained heavily that day in the capital city, Abuja. Trademore Estate in Lugbe, where Igwe runs a cybercafe business, was overrun by rainwater. The force of the flood pulled down the fence of Igwe’s office complex and destroyed a part of the building. In no time, the property was floating on water.

Igwe’s business was greatly affected as he lost machines and computers. It took his entire savings and the support of friends and family for him to be able to recover from the event of that day, he tells TheCable.

“I lost over two million naira worth of [electronics], my machines were all gone, my computers, everything. We didn’t expect such here,” he says.

Like Igwe, Victor Essang, a resident of Calabar, Cross River state capital, has also recorded losses to flooding.

First, his family lost a block of flats inherited from their grandparents, and later, his poultry business took a hit in 2016.

Igwe and Essang are just two of the many Nigerians who suffer the consequences of flooding that occurs yearly in different parts of the country during the rainy season.

SEVERE FLOOD PREDICTIONS

During the 2021 flood outlook presentation, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) announced that 28 states, including the FCT, will most likely experience flooding this year.

Similarly, the Nigeria Meteorological Agency, in its 2021 seasonal climate forecast, said the signals monitored by the agency in the last seven years show that things are changing on the climate front and that this year, Nigeria is expected to experience unprecedented heavy downpours.

The information is intended to alert Nigerians, government, relevant agencies and stakeholders of what is to come in order for them to prepare — prevent, mitigate and respond — for severe flooding.

Going by the alert, Igwe says he intends to raise his compound level to prevent rainwater from entering in the event of a flood.

On his part, Essang says he was already apprehensive about the severity of this year’s rainfall, even before the alert. He tells TheCable that he has relocated his belongings to a safer place.

“I have packed out my things to a safe place, I will bring them back when the rain stops. My only prayer is God will not let it bring our house down,” he says.

CLIMATE CHANGE A DRIVING FACTOR IN FLOODING

A report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) states that extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global climate change increase the likelihood of floods.

Chukwudi Njoku, a doctoral researcher on climate change at the University of Calabar, says flooding in Nigeria can be linked to both natural and human activities that influence changes in the climate.

“When there is high temperature, then there is increased possibility for evaporation – the process where water vapour is taken from the earth surface into the atmosphere — which can trigger much more rainfall,” he tells TheCable.

“The rising temperature here is a climate change feedback and when evaporation is increased, there is the possibility of more rainfall and when rainfall increases, simultaneously it could trigger flooding.”

Research by MOJ Ecology & Environmental Sciences (MOJES) has shown that human activities such as urbanisation, felling of forest trees and burning of fossil fuels, among others, lead to the emission of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.

According to the study, these activities distort the carbon cycle – the process in which carbon atoms move from the atmosphere to the earth and then back into the atmosphere. The activities also initiate climate change processes which involve a variety of changes including higher surface temperatures and changes to the hydrological cycle – the process in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and then back in form of rain.

Njoku believes that these human activities are what increases and make worse the impacts of climate change on humans and their environment.

“Such activities like urbanisation which is not properly done in a sustainable manner, for example, people building in floodplains and swampy areas which are supposed to serve as banks for water, thus reducing the ability of the environment to collect and keep excess water,” the researcher explains.

“Also, the clearing of forest areas for agriculture increases the extent of bare surfaces that would have hitherto collected runoff water and reduced the flow of water.

“These human activities are not sustainable and where they are not checked, they only go to increase the susceptibility of the people to flooding which appears to be inevitable at this time considering the increasing temperature and rainfall events.”

He advises that people living in flood-prone areas should be relocated and government should put laws in place to deter chaotic urbanisation, create more awareness about the potential increase in flooding events and their dangers, and also ensure that roads and drainages are constructed to accommodate the volume of water from the rain.

HOW IS GOVERNMENT PREPARING?

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), whose responsibility is to manage disasters, tells TheCable that the agency had information about imminent flooding since February through the seasonal climate predictions document made available by NIMET.

“Before that presentation by NIHSA, NEMA already had some information about the outlook of the rains and the consequences of the flood. So having the information, the agency had called together experts to analyse the predictions of NIMET and come out with a disaster risk management of the prediction,” says Manzo Ezekiel, public relations officer of NEMA.

“The secretary will soon convene a meeting of all the state emergency management agencies and relevant organisations that their activities or mandate have something to do with the management of floods.

“During that meeting, NEMA is going to communicate to them that this is the information we have and this information is going to cover your area of operation, what and what can you do about it. That is the next line of action that we have. That meeting will take hold very soon.”

The PRO said the zonal offices of the agency “are already on standby to take the information down to the specific communities that are at risk of flooding”.

He said the agency will ensure continuous engagement with Nigerians and create awareness at the federal, state, and local government levels to ensure that flooding does not take Nigerians by surprise.

“We are going to tell them that, this year there is a forecast of increased rainfall and this will likely interrupt your stay here,” he says.

SPEEDY MITIGATION EFFORTS NEEDED

While government agencies are still at the preparation stage, Igwe wishes they can speed up the process since the country is already in the rainy season.

He believes the annual flood events in his locality is a result of the lack of an adequate drainage system which the government had earlier promised to expand.

“I think the major cause is the drainage system. I wish the government could even rush down and do it for us today today today,” he says.

Igwe desires the speedy process because, according to him, the relief materials government agencies offer in the aftermath of flooding do not equate to the losses.

“When they were sharing their palliatives, I just refused; how can somebody lose about two point something million and you are giving him a pack of Indomie and small 5kg camping gas cylinder?” Igwe adds.","Thu, 20 May 2021 07:27:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FLOOD-PRONE-AREAS-IN-FCT1-1.png,"['information', 'water', 'process', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'arising', 'states', 'igwe', '28', 'nigeria', 'prepared', 'risk', 'agency', 'rainfall', 'matters', 'activities']", ,flood
1,1,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Expect greater floods this year, FG tells Nigerians - Guardian",https://guardian.ng/news/expect-greater-floods-this-year-fg-tells-nigerians/,"Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, has said that Nigerians should expect more floods this year based on reports by Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA).

He spoke at the public presentation of 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) tagged “Managing Flood for Sustainable Development in COVID-19 Era” organised by NIHSA, yesterday, in Abuja.

Adamu said that 302 local government areas in 36 states, including Federal Capital Territory ( FCT), would fall within moderate flood risk areas while 121 councils in 28 states would be within the highly probable risk areas.

“This year, like 2020, we will be grappling with the two threats of the COVID-19 pandemic and related hygiene challenges as well as the impending floods as predicted in the AFO. The 2021 floods levels will be higher than in the previous years but will not attain the levels of the 2012 that was devastating,” he said.

The minister also warned that states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue, including Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nassarawa and Kogi, are likely to experience river flooding.

Others are Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa states. Coastal flooding is expected to affect Rivers, Cross River, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states.

“Flash and urban floods from heavy inundation are predicted to occur in some major cities. The severity would depend on availability and adequacy of drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.”

Adamu, therefore, called on all stakeholders, including policy makers and agencies, to rise up to the challenge of impending floods and threats of COVID-19.

Director General of NIHSA, Clement Nzeh, said: “States and relevant authorities as well as farmers must take the flood outlook serious by putting in place measures to mitigated its impact.

“There is a greater awareness for this year’s outlook in terms of the level of participation and political will, looking at representation, including governors, senators and key agencies. I believe they are going to cascade this to the grassroots.”

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has identified 10 local government areas in Cross River State that fall under the probable flood risk areas in view of the Annual Flood Outlook for 2021.

The agency also identified two local government areas in the state that falls under the highly probable risk areas for 2021.

The Director-General of NEMA, Muhammadu Muhammed, said this in Ikom Local Government Area while distributing relief materials to victims of windstorm in the area.

Mr Muhammed, who was represented by Godwin Tepikor, the zonal coordinator of NEMA, South-south, urged the state government to immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities to mitigate the impact.

He mentioned the 10 local government areas to include Yakurr, Calabar Municipal, Akpabuyo, Obubra, Bakassi, Ogoja, Biase, Etung, Odukpani and Ikom.

He said the two local government areas in the state that fall under highly probable risks areas were Calabar South and Abi.

“The state should immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities so as to mitigate the impact of the predicted flood on the vulnerable local government areas,” he said.

The agency distributed relief materials to over 1,000 households affected by windstorm in four communities in Ikom local government area of Cross River.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the distribution followed the windstorm disaster that occurred on May, last year, in Ogomogom, Akorofono, Nkarasi and Abinti communities, all in Ikom Local Government Area.

The director general said the items were approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, following the recommendation from the agency as humanitarian assistance to the affected persons.

The items distributed were bags of rice, beans and garri, tomato paste, kegs of palm oil, wrappers, blankets, bundles of roofing sheets, cement, bags of nails, zinc and ceiling boards.

He urged the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the items.

In his remark, the Director General, Cross River State Emergency Management Agency, Princewill Ayim, thanked NEMA for its intervention.

The Chairman of Ikom Local Government Area, Kingsley Egumi, thanked President Buhari and NEMA for the timely response to the concerns of their people, pledging that the items would be judiciously utilised.

Mfam Akong, who responded on behalf of the beneficiaries, thanked NEMA for its assistance.

3,3,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Why Lagosians should heed flood alert | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World NewsOpinion — The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/opinion/why-lagosians-should-heed-flood-alert/,"Sir: On April 14, 2021, the Lagos State Government predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state, therefore, directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic Implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello, “…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm. It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

In downscaling the predictions of the flood alerts, the state government is therefore collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET). In addition to what the Environment and Water Resources commissioner said, the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe declared, “I…urge residents to support the government to achieve flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again being littered by residents.”

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.

4,4,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Rainy season: Fears over impending flood in the land - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/rainy-season-fears-over-impending-flood-in-the-land/,"In fact, the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, who released the prediction, warned: “…the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Jolted by the report, many residents told The Guardian that they fear for the worst, noting that they had not recovered from the devastating effects of last year’s flood.

A resident in Bello Street in Ilasamaja area of the state, Tomiwa Sulaimon, said while she would love to move to another area before the rains start, it was not financially possible for her at this time.

She recalled: “Last year when it was raining almost everyday, our street and house got flooded every other day. This street is a bit low and erosion has eaten a good part of the road and despite our little efforts to keep the flood at bay, the water always finds a way to get in. The worst part is that those refuse disposal trucks hardly come around, claiming that we owe them for several months but if they hardly come around, how do they expect to get paid? They come around only once in a blue moon and in the meantime, we have to find a way to help ourselves. I want to plead with the government to tell them to improve on their services so that people are not forced to dump refuse indiscriminately.”

x

A shop owner, who identified herself as Blessing Ogbe, lamented that residents in the area were responsible for the constant flooding in the area whenever it rains.

Ogbe said: “The landlords and agents are very greedy. Once they see one small space, they will construct shops on it, most times blocking the water channels in the process. At Taiwo Junction and Transformer bus stop, that place is a major water channel but go and see for yourself. They have built a row of shops there now, blocking the gutter. So, anytime rain falls, the water has nowhere to go.

“The residents themselves are always so eager to throw refuse into the gutter when it is raining or by the roadside, some of which also end up in the gutter. The roads are bad and gutters are very narrow; so the water has nowhere to go as such. This has been a recurring problem for many years now and we have been making private efforts but we need the government to step in for us now.”

An estate agent whose office is located along Okota road, Yusuf Isa, expressed fears that his office might not survive another rainy season, lamenting that floodwater finds its way into the office with the smallest rainfall.

He said: “No matter how shortly it rains, this side of Okota road leading to Jakande Gate always gets flooded. We have carried out several interventions by ourselves and would appreciate if the government can step in now. We tried to channel the flood through Akiti to connect it to the canal at Oke-Afa but there is a limit to what we can do on our own. Because of this, Okota and Akiti are usually flooded but what can we do?”

Many residents in Oke-Afa, Okota, Ibeju Lekki and Ikorodu areas of the state, who spoke with The Guardian, also recounted similar tales of woe. Lagosians who reside along flood plains of major rivers and drainage channels such as Owode, Iwaya, Makoko, Badia, Ijora, Isaalu, Pota and Shibiri, among others, could not be reached. But Bello had advised them to always be on the alert and ready to move to higher grounds when the need arises, adding that they would be duly notified at the appropriate time.

He stated that the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) of the ministry had been consistently de-silting and working on various linkages to the secondary and primary channels to enable them discharge efficiently and act as retention basins.

Bello also disclosed that the government was maintaining the long-established synergy with Ogun-Oshun River Basin Authority, which had ensured control and monitoring of the steady and systemic release of water from Oyan Dam to prevent flooding the downstream reaches.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, an engineer, also stated that the state government would dredge about 221 collector drains and 32 primary channels measuring about 72 km spread across the 20 local councils of the state to checkmate flooding.

He reiterated that EFAG would continue to de-silt various tertiary channels and manholes measuring about 100 kilometres across the state.

While restating the present administration’s resolve to find a lasting solution to flooding in the state, he called on residents to desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on the rights of way of canals, adding that it was regrettable that several of the canals recently cleaned up were being littered with refuse.

Lagos might appear on top of the situation. But the problem of flooding at the peak of the rainy season is not limited to the state alone; it is a national problem. Since 2012 when floods killed 363 people and displaced over 2.1 million others from their homes between early July and November 5, no year has passed without the natural disaster claiming lives and property worth billions of naira in the country. From Lagos to Delta, Anambra, Imo, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Osun, Taraba and Kebbi states, among others, flood wreaks havoc on homes and farms yearly with adverse effects on the economy of the country and health of citizens.

The most recent report on the natural disaster, which was released by the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Muhammadu Muhammed, in early December 2020, stated that, “the devastating impact of the 2020 flooding killed 68 people, affected 35 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 320 local councils and over 129,000 people.”

Now, the question is: With another rainy season at hand and with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) predicting that “the country is expected to have rainfall amounts from 400mm in the North to over 3000mm in the South,” what are communities and the state governments doing to avert a reoccurrence? The Guardian spoke with relevant stakeholders in Akwa Ibom, Osun, Imo, Delta and Cross River states on the issue. The stories are as follows:

Solution To Your Flood Problem Underway, A’Ibom Govt Re-assures Apprehensive Residents

From Inemesit Akpan-Nsoh, Uyo

AS the rains begin to set in, residents of flood prone areas in Akwa Ibom State have sent a Save Our Souls (SOS) message to the state government to come to their aid so as to avert the perennial flooding they have been experiencing year in year out.

In Uyo, the state capital, residents in areas like Abak Road, Atiku Abubakar, IBB Avenue, Esuene Street, Ukana Offot/adjourning streets, Atan, Use and Effiat Offot communities have appealed to the government to replicate the ‘magic’ it used to control flooding and erosion along Oron road by Nsikak Eduok and Edet Akpan Avenue in their areas.

x

The residents noted that controlling the flood in their areas would enable them to access their homes, have their properties secured and ensure that they would no longer live in fear whenever rain is about to fall.

Mr. Okon Etim of Ukana Offot street told The Guardian that the flooding on his street had for several years rendered many persons homeless.

According to him, the government had always given affected residents relief materials when their household properties were destroyed, with a pledge to find a permanent solution to the menace.

He, however, lamented that successive governments had tried to remedy the situation to no avail. Offot said the situation appears to have worsened as houses along Calabar, Port Harcourt and Esuene streets and parts of the Federal Housing Estate are no-go-area once the rains set in.

Other residents, including Mrs. Nkoyo Akpan and Augustine Effiong, among others, also called on the government to come to their aid, adding that they could not afford the money to relocate or construct another apartment at the moment.

Findings by The Guardian, which the residents acknowledged, indicated that structures in the areas were built on the right of way, thereby blocking free flow of floodwater.



Responding to the cries of residents, the state Commissioner for Environment and Petroleum Resources, Mr. Charles Udoh, said government was aware of the problem, noting that it has, in conjunction with the World Bank, awarded the contract that would address it to China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) at an estimated cost of N12 billion.

Udoh stated that the 7.2-kilomtre flood control project covers 17 communities in three local councils; namely Uyo, Nsit Ibom and Ibesikpo Asutan.

His words: “The reality is that the government cannot go everywhere to de-silt gutters. So, while the government is doing the common areas, the government is calling on residents and citizens to also embark on de-silting of gutters. Flooding sometimes comes from bad habits like dumping refuse into gutters. We are also calling on our people to desist from dumping refuse into gutters. The waste management agency of the state is embarking on massive de-silting of drains all over the state.



“This is in addition to the three major flagship projects of the ministry that talks about water collection and harvesting, erosion control project, one in Etim Umana, one in Anua and then the IBB erosion control. IBB will not be completed this rainy season, but this is the last rainy season that everybody affected on the IBB corridor will face flooding. Once that is done, the entire Atiku Abubakar, Abak road axis, Mechanic village, State Secretariat, Atan, Effiat and Use Offot communities will be evacuated.

“We will also evacuate water from Area ‘C’ Police Command. All the water will be taken to the outfall drain and also taking water at some point of Ring Road Two. But we cannot complete the entire process within this rainy season. The IBB project is 8.4 kilometres, the biggest flood control project ongoing in Nigeria now.”



We Don’t Want To Abandon Our Homes Again, Osun Residents Cry Out

From Timothy Agbor, Osogbo

Some residents in flood-prone areas in Osun State have cried out to the state government to assist them in mitigating the problem this year.

Speaking with The Guardian, residents in flood-prone areas like Rasco, Gbonmi and Gbodofon appealed to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to save them from losing their houses to flood this year.

A landlord at Gbonmi, Mr. Suraju Kamaruden, said many house owners and residents in the community always relocate to safe areas when the rainy season is at its peak, adding: “We don’t want to abandon our houses again. That is why we are begging our government to come to our aid and help us.”

x

A trader at Rasco area in Osogbo, Mr. Jude Okpara, said traders in the area face difficult times during rainy season as flood always submerges their shops.

“We don’t have any other place to go. If not, we would have left this area. Although the government expanded the waterways about three years ago, the water still overflows its boundaries and submerges our shops. We are tired,” he lamented.

Chairman of Olorunwa Sawmill in Oke-Baale community, Osogbo, Mr. Sunday Ajewole, said there was an urgent need for government to construct a bigger drainage channel that would accommodate much floodwater when the rain is at its peak.

He said: “For the past seven years, we have been battling with flood. Every time we are in the rainy season, we always lose our planks to flood. Our government would always clear and expand the waterways every year but we are still battling flood. Most times when government fails to do something and we are approaching rainy season, we hire some labourers to help us clear the waterways. Sometimes we contribute between N80,000 to N100,000 and give to the dredgers. Still, we are not safe.

“We have discovered that the problem is that we have only one ring that forms the bridge of the waterways. And the ring is very small. The water that gushes from Ona-Baba-Ona area and Arogunmosa community would divert at our area and the ring doesn’t have the capacity to make it flow, as it should. It usually bounces back to where we stay, sweep our goods away and even sack residents out of their homes.

“This year, to lessen the severity of the flood, the government has cleared the waterways for us but once it rains heavily, there will be flood. Until the bridge is re-constructed and a bigger ring is fixed, we may not be out of this flood problem. We don’t have the financial strength to construct a bigger bridge and that’s why we are appealing to government to come to our aid.

“We have lost millions of naira worth of goods and property to flood in this area. We are afraid that if nothing is done again this year, property or even lives may be lost to flood because we have started seeing signs that it will rain heavily this year.”

To prevent a reoccurrence of flood in the state this year, the Osun State Waste Management Agency said it has been sensitising members of the public on the need to desist from dumping refuse on floodwater channels.

T

he General Manager of the agency, Mr. Fatai Oyewole, told The Guardian in Osogbo that efforts were ongoing to rid major gutters of refuse.

“We have been mobilising people not to dump refuse on waterways and major gutters,” he said. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment has disclosed that it opened up some streams across the state during the dry season for easy flow of water. This, according to the coordinator of the ministry’s Department of Flood Control, Samorudeen Odesanmi, an engineer, was part of the state government’s efforts at preventing another incident of flooding in the state.

“This government is proactive. Before the advent of this rainy season, we optimised the opportunity of the dry season to open up series of streams across the state for easy flow of water. If at all we are going to do anything on flood control, it would be minimal.

“We have already marked off some areas we want to work on this year and they are waiting for governor’s approval. Much had been done before now and we are on top of the situation,” he said.

Imo Commences De-silting Of Drainages, Vows To Demolish Houses Built On Waterways

From Charles Ogugbuaja, Owerri

AS this year’s rainy season gradually sets in, residents in Imo State and the state government have commenced preparations to mitigate the likely effect of flooding.

x

The flood-prone local councils in the state are the riverine areas of Oguta, Ohaji/Egbema and Orsu, among others. The locals in these communities began to experience massive flooding since 2012, which has resulted in loss of lives and destruction of their property. The flood, which occurs at the peak of every rainy season, had forced many residents to abandon their homes and relocate to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), where both the state and national emergency management agencies lent them helping hands.

A resident in Oguta, Jude Igwe, who called for quick intervention by the government, told The Guardian that he would not want a repeat of his past experiences this year, likewise other members of his family. He said: “Since 2012, almost on a yearly basis, we living in riverine areas have been witnessing flooding. It is not something to behold. Now that the rains are setting in, we appeal to the state government to prepare and assist us in time. Some of us are poor. We shall be relocated to camps as usual. So, we are calling for early preparation in case such occurs.”

Also, an indigene of Orsu, who identified himself simply as Okechukwu, recounted how his family lost valuable property in previous years and called for help.

“I am not ready to allow flood engulf us again. We are preparing ahead of time. But government and good spirited individuals should please come to our assistance ahead of time. We also want government to build gutters that will channel water to the rivers,” he said.

A community leader in Ohaji, Saturday Ochia, however, urged residents to desist from blocking waterways with refuse. He said: “We want our people to adhere to the simple environment-friendly rule of clearing the waterways. We do not want to witness flooding this year in our community. We are educating our people.”

Speaking with The Guardian, the Commissioner for Environment, Dr. Ikechukwu Njoku, said the state government was not leaving anything to chances, adding that it has commenced public enlightenment on appropriate waste disposal and clearing of drainages by holding town hall meetings with the monarchs, local government officials, community leaders and residents. He also disclosed that the ministry has commenced de-silting of drainages in Owerri, the state capital.

According to Njoku, the government has marked structures built on waterways for demolition, stressing that they were constructed in contravention of the state’s master plan.

He also gave assurance that the government has put a robust plan in place to ensure flood-free environment in the state capital and other communities, stressing that the Governor, Hope Uzodimma, would ensure the construction of standard drainage systems in the state.

Delta Is Already Prepared To Tackle Flooding, Commissioner Says

From Monday Osayande, Asaba

DELTA State government has declared that it was fully prepared to mitigate the impact of flood in coastal areas of the state this year.

The Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Christ Onogba, made the declaration in an interview with The Guardian in Asaba. Onogba noted that the state did not have to wait for NIMET or other agencies’ prediction on the effect of flood before putting things right.

“Firstly, we keep on saying to everyone that we are in the era of climate change, so those communities living in the coastal line should find alternative homes before the rains set in,” he noted.

According to the commissioner, it was necessary for flood victims to have alternative abode because government was no longer ready to build camps for those that might be displaced by flood due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We cannot set up camps as it used to be, but that doesn’t mean we are sleeping. In fact, we have done a lot. We are resetting the drains, and very shortly, we will open one of the channels that is flowing into the River Niger, and good enough, the road side drain in Asaba is clean and working fine.

“The government is prepared and we will never be taken unaware in the issue of flood. And because we understand that because of climate change, flooding is something that must happen, we will not wait for any prediction before we start making our preparations,” he emphasised.

A resident in Ndokwa East council, Mr. Emma Agboma, lamented that several homes had collapsed in the area in the past as a result of flooding.

“I think now that we are approaching rainy season, government should exercise its power early so that we are not taken unaware. They should be alert so that they can relocate some of us to upland. Many are willing to leave their houses but it is not easy to relocate from where you are used to over the years.

“Government should do as much as possible to mitigate our suffering in riverine areas – Burutu, Bomadi and Patani. So, government should do the needful by building camps early enough for us to relocate,” he said.

For Dave Ogochukwu, while government should try to evacuate people in flood-prone areas to avoid loss of lives, residents should also not dispose refuse indiscriminately, thereby blocking waterways.

“The property that has been lost since 2012 till date is enormous and it is not good for the growth of the society. In recent times, several farmlands have been overrun by flood putting farmers in a difficult situation.

“Over the years, government has made efforts to relocate people from the flood-prone areas but some people have been adamant. However, government should continue to sensitise the people on the need to relocate before the flooding begins,” Ogochukwu added.

‘We Have Been Crying Out To Government For Help’

From Agosi Todo, Calabar

LAST year during the peak of the rainy season, many communities in Cross River State experienced heavy flooding that destroyed farms and homes. Over 300 residents in the state were left homeless and properties worth millions of naira destroyed due to heavy rainfalls.

The rains destroyed farmlands specifically in Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Biase and Boki local councils of the state.

Some of the residents at Ikot Eka Edem in Calabar Municipal local council identified building of houses on waterways as the cause of flooding in the area.

A resident, Mr. Gab Otei, said he was apprehensive ahead of this year’s rainy season, lamenting that he lost his valuables to flood last year.

Otei said: “Last year, the heavy rains wreaked havoc in the whole of this street. I lost my valuables because I was trying to save my little children from being taken away by the flooding.

“I cannot leave this place because this is my father’s house and I stay here with my family. For years now, we have been crying to government at all levels to come to our aid and open the canals for free flow of water, but no response.”

A resident in Kakwagom community in Boki local council, Mr. Augustine Ita, said: “Last year, most of the yam and cassava farms were basically destroyed. We lost everything and you know that hunger was the effect of it. What those of us who farm in the riverine areas are trying to do now is to either cultivate earlier or make your mounds to be bigger than what it used to be, because if the mounds are very big, and the crop are up there, if the flood comes, it starts from the bottom of the mound. If God is on our side, we will still have something to hold on to. It depends on the strength of your mounds and how heavy the flood will be.”

Speaking with The Guardian on measures the state government was taking to safeguard lives and properties against flood this year, the Director General of Cross River State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr. Princewill Ayim, disclosed that last year, over 510 persons were displaced by flood across the state.

Ayim stated that although the state had not received the yearly prediction from concerned government agencies on what to expect this year, the agency has started sensitisation campaign in communities in Calabar South, Calabar Municipality, Boki, Biase, Odukpani and Etung local councils that are prone to flood.

He lamented that people living in flood-prone areas refuse to relocate to safe areas because they insist on remaining in their ancestral homes.

Ayim explained: “The way we do it every year is that we get informed from the national bodies. They tell us when there will be heavy flood and what to expect. For now we have not gotten any prediction but we cannot keep on waiting. We need to be proactive by engaging ourselves in activities that can mitigate heavy flood.

“We have our local emergency committees spread across all the 18 local councils. They interface with the locals to inform them more about flooding and how to prepare for it. And at the same time, we are also collaborating with the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC). Luckily, we are among the states that installed emergency outfit; so if you are in distress and do not have airtime in your phone, you can dial the 122 free toll number through which help can come to you. That is in place already.

“Apart from that, we use the media houses to educate the public to clear their drainage channels and to cut the entire weeds on the waterways. If you go to Calabar South for example, you see some stagnant water that if you don’t look very well you won’t know there is an artificial pool there.”","Sat, 24 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rainy-season.jpg,"['rainy', 'residents', 'water', 'world', 'flooding', 'waterways', 'flood', 'impending', 'season', 'area', 'guardian', 'nigeria', 'land', 'state', 'areas', 'fears']", ,flood

Speaking at the public presentation of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency’s (NIHSA) 2021 annual flood outlook (AFO) in Abuja on Thursday, Adamu said the flood projection in different states are of varying severity.

He said states surrounding River Niger and Benue will experience “severe flooding”, adding that it will aggravate the problems created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This year, we will be grappling with the two threats of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the impending floods as predicted in the AFO,” NAN quoted him as saying.

“The flood projections show varying severity across parts of the country.

“In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 local government areas (LGAs) in 36 states including the FCT will fall within the moderate probable flood risk areas.

“It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the highly probable risk areas.

“The states surrounding Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience severe flooding.

“Floods come with attendant health risks through the contamination of potable water sources. The 2021 flooding will be exacerbated by the continuing ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The minister noted that the 2012 flood which brought massive destruction of lives and property across the country necessitated the creation of a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront a reoccurrence.

According to him, the NIHSA forecasts have increased citizens’ awareness and led them to take measures to prevent severe flood damage.

He urged stakeholders, including policy makers and tiers of government, to take appropriate measures such as clearing of waterways and flood paths to contain it.","Thu, 06 May 2021 17:12:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Flood-Gwagwalada.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'varying', 'states', 'minister', '28', '2021', 'covid19', 'afo', 'risk', 'severe']", ,flood
7,7,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Flooding as a disaster waiting to happen - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/flooding-as-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen/,"The rains are here again. Rather than being a blessing, the rains have become a curse to many Nigerians, especially to coastal states and communities living along the bank of Rivers Niger and Benue. The federal government has issued a flood alert. Will the 2021 predictions go the way of others? TONY AKOWE reports

Since the devastating flood in Nigeria in 2012, it has become important for the government and its agency to make an annual forecast of possible flood and its impact in the country annually. Since the first forecast was made in 2013, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, working with other government agencies, has consistently warned the nation of impending flood across the country and in most cases, the intensity of such flood. Unfortunately, warnings by the agencies have often been ignored by both the people and state governments and their agencies. This year, the government has said not less than 121 local government areas across 28 states are at highly probable risk of heavy flooding, while another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will experience some level of flooding.

Flooding is categorised into river flooding, coastal flooding as well as flash and urban flooding occasioned by poor drainages, blocked drainages and poor adherence to town planning regulations.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) said flooding accounts for 15% of all natural disaster related deaths across the globe.

Floods have since become annual phenomena not only in flood plains, but also in urban and semi-urban areas. Experts link urban flooding to inadequacies of drainage channels that have become too small to contain excess runoff, the use of river channels as waste repositories thus clogging the channels, poor compliance with or non-existence of land use zoning/building codes, poor waste management practices, and removal of vegetation that create resistance and minimise flood impact. Coastal areas of Nigeria are not spared from flooding as they may be worst hit by flood this year. Interestingly, more states in Nigeria are increasingly suffering from annual flooding due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Unfortunately, Nigeria is located downstream of Rivers Niger and Benue, and therefore abounds with water resources that become a menace by causing flooding and flood disasters, the worst of which was experience in 2012 when hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property loss running into billions of naira including massive farm lands and crops when water was released from the a dam in Cameroon.

A close study of the predictions revealed that all the 20 local government areas in Lagos State (as against 18 in 2020) are likely to be affected with eight of them being at higher risk of heavy flooding. Apart from urban and river flooding, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Delta and Ondo states stand the risk of heavy coastal flooding. In 2020, similar predictions by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency and advice to states and local government areas to take precautionary measure to mitigate the flood fell on deaf ears in most parts of the country. The consequence was the displacement of over 2.3 million people and the death of 69 others. The outcome was also the washing away of farm lands in Kebbi and Jigawa as well as livestock and other valuables. The agency has continuously expressed concern over disregard for town planning regulations leading to people building on flood plains.

Minister for Water Resources Suleiman Adamu, who announced the 2021 prediction on behalf of the agency, said 121 local government areas in 28 states and the FCT as well as another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will likely experience high and moderate flooding in 2021. Acting on information from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, the minister also said there would be heavy coastal flooding in Rivers, Cross Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states. He stressed the need for concerted efforts to mitigate the impact of the expected flood.

He said: “So far, the flood levels will be higher than in previous years, but will not attain the levels of the 2012 devastating floods. In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 LGAs in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will fall within the moderate probable Flood Risk Areas. It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the Highly Probable Risk Areas. The states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience river flooding. These states and the number of local government likely to be affected include Abia (9), Akwa Ibom (2), Anambra (5), Bauchi (2), Bayelsa (5), Benue (3), Cross River (2), Delta (8), Ebonyi (4), Edo (1), FCT (2), Gombe (7), Imo (3), Jigawa (9), Kaduna (2), Kano (2), Kebbi (4), Kogi (9), Kwara (2), Lagos (8), Nasarawa (2), Niger (5), Ogun (3), Oyo (7), Rivers (12), Sokoto (7), Taraba (7) and Zamfara (1).”

The list of states to be affected by one form of flood or the other in 2021 show that northern and coastal states are at a greater risk of flooding this year, with some states along the River Niger and Benue are also likely to be affected. Adamu said flash and urban floods from heavy inundation were predicted to occur in some major cities, the severity of which would depend on the availability and adequacy of the drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.

He said: “The information contained in the AFO 2021 is a Clarion call to all stakeholders, policy makers, Federal, States and Local Governments, Departments and Agencies to rise and set up appropriate mechanism such as clearing the waterways and flood paths as well as maintaining proper water disposal management practices to curtail the ravages of the impending flood and threats of COVID-19. The year 2012 is a landmark in the annals of flood occurrence in Nigeria. It brought with it massive destruction of lives, property and critical national infrastructure. The need arose therefore, to put in place a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront the menace of this disaster of flooding, hence the coming into being of APO in the year 2013. The 2021 Annual Flood Outlook built on the successes of the previous eight (8) years forecasts by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency. The outcomes of these forecasts have been the increased awareness by the citizenry with respect to measures that need to be taken before, during and after floods. This has culminated in the progressive reduction in the severity of flood and its harmful effects on lives and property. The timeliness in the release of these forecasts is quite commendable and deserving of every possible support by all of us.”

He believed that man’s interaction with natural process has been both helpful and harmful to some degree, adding that the negative impact of man’s activities can be observed in the heightened climate change being experienced globally by way of rising temperatures, intensified rainfall, more destructive storms and floods. He maintained that the annual prediction by the agency is designed to create awareness of the inherent dangers of flooding and to inform people about locations that are prone to Flood risk at a particular time and encourage them to take appropriate actions.

Drawing attention to the 2020 experience, the minister said: “The year 2020 saw the devastating impact of extreme flood across the country with practically every state of the federation affected in one way or the other. The flood affected 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 349 Local Government Areas (LGAs) within the 36 States were affected and over 2,353,647 people were displaced with a record of 69 deaths. Kebbi and Jigawa States were worst hit with regards to agricultural lands and houses destroyed. Apart from the physical damages, other indirect losses are often overlooked. These indirect and intangible impacts are generally associated with disruption to normal life as well as long term health issues and stress-related illnesses. We must recognise that extreme weather and flooding extents do happen and that we need to be well equipped to respond to them. I am confident that our communities, infrastructure and businesses will be better protected if due attention is given to the information contained in this 9th edition of the Annual Flood Outlook.”

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs. Didi Walson-Jack, said: “The overall objective of this event is to sensitise the nation (i.e planners, decision and policy makers, farmers, stakeholders) and the general public towards embarking on preventive measures to improve on safety and reduce potential damages to lives and property from predicted flood events.”

She said the event was expected to provide ample opportunity for enlightenment campaigns in the media for better Preparedness on flood mitigation, control and management in flood risks locations across the country. She maintained that the accuracy of the predictions over the years have been fairly high and reliable, stressing however that “the focus is rather on prevention and mitigation of possible flood disasters by increasing the awareness of the populace and prompting them to take appropriate preventive, adaptive and mitigative measures”.

The Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd), stressed the need to strengthen multi-agency approach to disaster risk reduction in the country.

Mohammed said: “To enhance flood forecasting and management in Nigeria, NEMA is currently supporting NIHSA in establishing three Automatic Weather Observation Stations which are at various stages of installation located in Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti and Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. These stations will be used not only for hydrological predictions but also to train students in the field of Geography, Engineering, Agriculture, meteorology, climate change and other sciences”. He said further that “one of the lessons learnt during the 2020 flood after action review meeting is the need for proper utilization of our dams in the country. When dams meant for irrigation purpose are used for dry season agriculture, they acquire more capacities to hold more water in the rainy season. In addition, a timely controlled release of water from dams will reduce panic release of water during rainy season that can lead to further flooding.”

The Director-General of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze said government at all levels in the country must take necessary steps to avert a possible disastrous effect of flood in 2021. Nze said as the rains begin to set in, the country was gradually inching towards the peak of rainy season with its attendant flood incidents. He said Nigeria’s geographical location downstream of all the countries in the Niger Basin places it at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollution from all countries upstream, adding that this explain why persistent flooding has become an annual event since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster.

He argued that the annual flood forecast was to enable states and local government as well as individuals take concrete steps now to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past few years including clearing of blocked drainages and canals, removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinth and floats on water channels. People living along water ways as well as those having socio-economic activities in such areas should be encouraged to relocate o safer areas before the peak of rains, while there should also be an improved system for flood monitoring, flood forecasting and early warnings. He stressed that states must intensify soil conservation measuring techniques on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and encourage ecosystem protection, while also enhancing the enforcement of town planning code to allow for the construction of houses and drainage structures.

He said further that while it was not possible to eradicate flooding, efforts should be made to either reduce or minimise it, adding that state governments must educate their people, insisting that states must make efforts to avoid a repeat of the incidences of 2020 which saw over 450,000 hectare of rice plantation being washed away in Kebbi state alone as a result of flooding. Nzeh lamented that while the agency has continued to give early warning signs, many states in the country have failed to listen to the recommendations of the agency, adding that at the moment, Jigawa state has set up a committee that is working to reduce incidences of flooding in the state in line with recommendations from the agency.

The NIHSA’s Director of Hydrogeophysics, Stephen Margima Jabo, said flooding has become a global phenomenon that has increased in frequency over the years. According to him, the effective management of flood risk should be a collective responsibility of all stakeholders from the federal, state, and local to individual levels, adding that the existing synergy between Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, stakeholders and other collaborative agencies involved in flood management and disaster issues should be further strengthened. He said government at all level should also put in place measures for better town planning and effective land use zoning, effective flood disaster management in the changing environment, improved biodiversity and ecosystem management for the enhancement of rapid and sustainable development in the country. States, he said should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers particularly, where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood waters will not be lost to the sea.

The agency said among others that “stakeholders in the water sector should carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas by the removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers to improve their conveyance capacities and from dams, lakes and reservoirs to increase their storage capacities for the containment of the incoming floodwaters; there is need for construction of weirs, small reservoirs on tributary, streams and rivers for conservation of flood water to be used during the dry season thereby preventing desert encroachment, increasing irrigation food crop production, improvement of grassland areas, nomadic settlement, peace and sustainable development by relevant government agencies; intensification of soil conservation measuring technics on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and increase ecosystem protection among others; enforcement of Town Planning Codes in the country to allow for the appropriate construction of houses, and drainage structures and constantly freeing the waterways from obstructions and provision of adequate refuse dumping facilities by relevant authorities.”","Tue, 11 May 2021 00:15:10 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Flood-1.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'happen', 'local', 'flood', 'waiting', 'states', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'country', 'state', 'areas']", ,flood

September 12, 2020, around 8:00pm, residents of Alapere area of Lagos State, raised alarm as another flooding tragedy struck. Two yet-to-be-identified children were swept away as people battled flood after a heavy rainfall that lasted for hours and led to destruction of properties.

This is just one of the horrific, heart-wrenching experiences Nigerians go through, following havoc wreaked by floods every year. Yet nothing is done by stakeholders to ameliorate the disaster.

Nigeria with a population of over 200 million people, faces numerous natural disasters, with flooding being the most common. Most states in the country are increasingly suffering from annual flooding during the rainy seasons. However unlike some natural disasters, rainfall flooding can be controlled with proper planning and the provision of necessary infrastructure.

Flooding in Nigeria is usually caused by climate change, river overflowing, dam opening, current poor urban planning practices, poor drainage systems that can’t cope and so on. In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the neighboring states.

Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals. The immediate impact of it include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases. These were seen recurring this year, in various states of the federation.

Havoc in Some States

In a report on October last year, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods since September have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across 22 states in Nigeria. Furthermore, around 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people were reported to be displaced.

According to the Red Cross, the overflowing Benue and Niger rivers caused severe floods in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara States from October 6, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. At least 57 people died, 473 were injured and 22,357 displaced. Flooding was also reported in southern parts of the country, Bayelsa, Anambra, Rivers and Delta States, were affected and fatalities reported.

One of the most devastating impact of floods was seen in Kebbi State. The flood swept away villages and peoples, displacing families and destroyed about 90 per cent of crops, putting the country’s food security at risk. Over 30 lives were lost, hundreds of houses destroyed and thousands of residents displaced by the devastating flood that sacked communities in the state.

The losses incurred by the farmers, particularly rice farmers in Kebbi State were colossal and immeasurable , they run into billions of naira . Thousands of hectares of fadama rice farms in the state were affected by the flood. Rice farms , other agricultural crops, livestock and even communities were not spared by the raging floods.

Chairman of the State Emergency Management Authority (KSEMA), Alhaji Sani Dododo, revealed that five different bridges had been washed away across the state.

The Birnin-Kebbi-Makera-Kangiwa road, an international highway, which runs from the state capital to Niger Republic, is at the risk of caving in at Duku. Some of the minor bridges and culverts along the highway are already caving in, following erosion caused by rising water overflowing the nearby River Rima.

Also, the Bagudo-Tuga-Kaoje route, which leads to Benin Republic border, including the Tuga Bridge, is also submerged, cutting border communities. Dododo, who confirmed the number of deaths recorded so far, said 10 people died in a boat that capsized at Ihiru in Jega Local Government.

“Only eight bodies have so far been recovered; a family of six – father, mother and children were wiped away in Arewa council area. We recorded one death in Yauri, among others. The numbers may increase, since we are experiencing rainfall daily. In Bagudo council area is the worst hit by the flooding, as it was learnt that 98 per cent of the villages were affected.

In Iwaro Oka community of Akoko South West Local Government area, Ondo State

a middle-aged man was swept away by flood. Sources said the motorcycle of the farmer, identified as Akede, was seen inside the river very close to a popular filling station, which made people aware that the farmer was missing. Family members were thrown into mourning when all efforts to find him proved abortive. His body was later recovered in a river very close to St Patrick’s College, Iwaro Oka.

In Lokoja, Kogi State, the road linking Kogi East and Eastern Nigeria to the state capital was flooded for days as canoe and boats were employed to navigate the roads which is meant for cars and other road users.

In Niger State, officials of the state government visited communities submerged by flood to ascertain the extent of damage and to enable government render assistance to victims.

In Kano State, the Kano Emergency Management Agency confirmed four persons killed and over 5,200 houses destroyed due to flooding in Rogo and Danbatta Local Government Areas of the state. He disclosed that two persons lost their lives and 200 houses destroyed in Rogo, while two other persons and over 5,000 houses were destroyed by flood in Danbatta.

Also the South-south and South-east were wreaked by flood havoc. South-south states like Delta had over 150 houses submerged by flood. In South-east, Anambra for instance, over 5,000 persons have been displaced by flood that submerged houses, schools and churches in the Ogbaru Local Government Area. The Chairman of the council, Arinze Awaogu, said about 1,000 of the displaced persons were being catered for at Internally Displaced Persons’ camps in the area, while many others trapped in their communities needed evacuation.

He said, ”Over 5,000 families have been displaced, while churches, schools and many residential houses have been submerged by flood, with farm crops destroyed and displaced persons seeking refuge in Onitsha and surrounding communities. At the moment, we are housing over 1,000 IDPs; we have over 5,000 persons who have been displaced; some are taking refuge in the residences of their relatives, who live upland, including Onitsha. We need the Federal Government’s assistance in the areas of donation of food items, non-food items, medical supplies, establishment of sick bays and sending enough medical personnel to help in handling the situation; our fear now is that of a possible outbreak of epidemic.”

Earlier in the year, heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

In Abuja, four Area Councils, Bwari, Gwagwalada, Abaji and Kwali which are prone to flood were affected by the disaster with Gwagwala being the worst hit in July as eight lives were lost, over 100 houses submerged and properties destroyed. On July 25, after a heavy downpour which lasted for hours, five residents were swept away and several houses and cars destroyed in Gwagwalada, Dawaki, Giri and Zuba where the flood cut the bridge linking Ikwa, Yimi and other villages.

The incidence was confirmed by the Director General of FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Idris Abbas who had said there was a building collapse in Dawaki as a result of the flood. Gwagwalada is flooded from Giri. A family of five were flooded at Giri.

“We got one body and still searching for four. We rescued six people and are in the hospital. The flood has damaged a lot of houses and property, especially at Gwagwalada. The residents are still saying some are missing but they cannot give us the identities of such persons who they claim to be missing. People should be careful when it is raining. They should not drive on water. They should not build on flood plain. They must respect the master plan of FCT and ensure that all drainages are clean. What happened in Giri-Gota was because people built on flood plain”, he said

Federal Lawmakers Laments

Back in September, the Kebbi State Caucus in the House of Representatives while commiserating with the government and people of the state on the recent flood disaster that ravaged the entire state, said the disaster is a major setback to the federal government effort to boost local rice production as part of measures to end rice importation.

The Chairman, Hon. Muhammad Jega, representing Gwandu/Aliero/Jega federal constituency, lamented that the disaster could not have come at a worse time for the farmers who were looking forward to a bumper harvest this year to reduce the rising cost of food items.

The lawmaker, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari and the state Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, for the prompt response to reduce the hardship caused by the flood, also urged them to as a matter of urgency send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state.

Jega further urged the federal government to commission a study with the aim of providing a lasting solution to the perennial flood disaster in the state.

According to him, “The flood is a serious setback towards addressing food security in the country; the government, therefore, needs to address the shortfall of the food supply chain to reduce the hardship and cost of food items in the market, and also address the severe environmental degradation caused by the flood. This may include adequate and early preparation for dry-season farming and reconstruction of major infrastructures affected in the state.

‘’The estimated cost of the disaster is over N10 billion across the state. We call on the federal government as a matter of urgency to send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state, as early preparation for dry season farming should commence in earnest with provision of seedlings, fertilizer and other inputs to be made available to the farmers in good time.’’

Also, a member of the House of Representatives, representing Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency of Delta State, Hon. Ossai Nicholas Ossai, decried the submerging of over 150 houses in Delta State, by devastating floods.

He said that since past two weeks, the Ndokwa East Communities of Delta State have been bedeviled by constant and frightening heavy downpour, being accompanied by excessive flooding and erosion, that is seriously and presently wreaking havoc in the Communities.

According to him, the affected communities are; Ossissa, Onyah, Ase, Ushie, Ibedeni; Asagba, Aballa-Uno, Agballa-Obodo, AgballaOshimili, Uchi, Okpai, Onuaboh, Inyi, Benekuku, Aboh, Onyah, Asaba-Ase, Ibrede, Ashaka, Afor, Abalagáda, Umuolu, Igbuku, Obettim, Obodo-Okolafa, Iyadama,0nuogboko, UtagbaOgbe, Utagba-Uno, Ogume, Onitsha-Ukwuani, Akarri, Umuolu, just to mention a few”.

He said he was disturbed that “schools, farmlands, health centres, places of worship have seriously been affected and over 150 households has been rendered homeless particularly children and women and more is still being affected daily. About 90per cent of the ommunities in the entire Ndokwa East Local Government Area has been submerged,and worse still is the deplorable economic conditions of the peasant farmers in these agrarian communities”.

He observed that these communities are often prone to serious environmental disaster as a result of vulnerability of constant coastal flooding and erosion from the River Niger”.

The legislator, pleaded with the Federal Governnment, to Direct the Ecological Fund office to conduct an environmental survey with a view to addressing the excessive flooding in these Ndokwa Communities and urge the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to urgently provide relief materials for the Hood victims in accordance with section 6 of NEMA Act.

NIHSA Flood Alerts

In February, the Director General of Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze, alerted the government, stakeholders and all citizens to use this period of dry season to prepare ahead for 2021 flooding.

Nze lamented that Nigeria currently doesn’t have enough dams, saying more dams would help to mitigate floods.

He explained that with the increasing global population and the expanding activities of man, flooding would continue to persist, hence the need to control human activities, environmental adjustment and purposefully adopting actions in certain areas that would make adjustment possible.

According to him, “Flooding problem is a global environmental issue which is faced by many countries worldwide, particularly in areas close to low lying terrains and river valleys. Over the past years, there have been increasing concerns that human actions and natural catastrophes have been adversely impacting the environment, posing serious ecological and environmental hazards.

“Though flood is a natural environmental phenomenon, it can be greatly accelerated by human-induced activities as it is the case worldwide. Some floods may result in major disasters involving structural and erosion damages, disruption of socio-economic activities, loss of lives and properties, displacement of people, destruction of agricultural land and contamination of water and environment in general.”

The director general said this is the appropriate time to construct drainages where they are necessary (but not provided), dredge river channels, clear blocked gutters and drainages, and pull down structures that are within the floodplains and flood paths.

“There is a reasonable time to do that before the rains set in. According to the 2020 Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public recently by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), February 24 and June 22 are the predicted onset of rainfall in the South-south and Northern states respectively, while the respective predicted cessation dates are December 28th and September 26th. This implies that Nigeria is likely to experience longer period of rainy season in 2020 compared to year 2019,” he added.

Again, in September, the agency warned members of the public to expect more floods in the months of September and October.

Nze, gave the warning at a press briefing in Abuja, saying that the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country.

Nze explained that any release of excess water from the dams in countries upstream Rivers Niger and Benue this year would have more negative impacts on Nigeria, which is located downstream of countries in the Niger Basin.

He identified the highly vulnerable states as Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa.

He said that the flood that ravaged Kebbi State just about a week ago left so many damages and noted that the current flooding situation called for vigilance on the part of all the stakeholders.

The director general called the states and local governments as well as multi-national companies and public-spirited individuals to join hands to save the country from the consequences of “twin pandemic” (COVID-19 and flood) in the year 2020.

Nze warned: ‘’The rains are finally here. The volume of river flows on our river is surging and river channels could no longer accommodate significant runoff as floodplains, which traditionally serve the alluvial plains and are rich in agricultural productivity, lost its retention capacity to give way to flooding of adjacent lands.

“Farmlands and crop yields are being lost to furry of floodwaters, livestock and ecosystem species are diminishing while hope for livelihood hang in the balance due to monumental economic losses.

‘’As a matter of fact, all the states of the federation have suffered several degrees of flooding since June 2020. The danger is not yet over. Information received from the regional Niger Basin Authority (NBA) by NIHSA, has it that as at 7.30am today September 10, 2020, the River Niger flood level in Niamey, Niger Republic, attained an unprecedented level of 7.02m (702cm). This is a far cry from the value of 6.60m which I reported in my last press briefing of August 25, 2020.

“Noting that the Red Alert Warning Zone in Niamey is 6.20m and above, the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country, Nigeria, which is at the Lower portion of Niger Basin within this month of September and October.’

‘’Based on the report of the expected flood coming down from Niamey and the projected contributions by the inland rivers, both Kainji and Jebbo Dams built on River Niger have continued to spill water downstream. The Shiroro Dam on River Koduno, with reservoir level at 381.48m as at 9.00am today, has been maintaining a regulated spilling into the River Niger. The effect of all these is that the communities in the states adjoining River Niger will continue to be highly inundated by River Flooding as is being witnessed in the recent time.”

Recently, The DG of NIHSA, briefing the press on March 24, 2021, again advised the three tiers of government and citizens across the country to prepare against impending devastating floods in 2021.

Nze, who gave the advice at a press conference in Abuja, said this was because Nigeria was at the receiving end of disastrous floods among the nine countries of the River Niger Basin.

He said, “There is still time for states/LGAs (Local Government Areas) and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

“As the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin which covers nine countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season with its attendant flood incidents.

He also advised Nigerians residing at waterways to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains, just as warned that Nigerians have about three months to prepare against the disastrous effects of flood.

He explained that the country’s geographical location is downstream of all the countries in the Basin, making it to be at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollutions from all the countries upstream.

The DG lamented that relevant authorities are frustrating the effort of the Federal Government by neglecting the predictions, as could be seen in the results of last year’s damages.

Nze while urging the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past years, noted that there is still time for stakeholders to take steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

Expectations from Stakeholders

In the last few months, President Muhammadu Buhari has been sending solidarity messages to some states affected by flood disasters with promises of federal aid. The president authorised needed assistance to 12 states worst affected by the seasonal rains. The states are: Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Edo, Anambra, Delta, Kano, Jigawa, Rivers, Bayelsa and Adamawa.

However, flooding in various state has become a recurring decimal for decades, all tiers of government are expected to put all hands on deck and come up with a permanent solution. Flood is a natural disaster, but lack of preparedness is a man-made disaster.

As Nigeria is months away till the next rainy season, stakeholders have ample time to do the needful and heed to flood warnings by various monitoring agencies in order to avert another impending tragedy.

One of the main strategies as stated by NIHSA is that, the 36 States and the FCT authority should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using the flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood water will not be lost to the sea to become saline water.

The agency is also urging state governments to pull down structures built on flood plains and expand the drainages for easy flow of water as one of the strategies mapped out.

Reacting to the development, the spokesman of the governor, Terver Akase told The Nation:

“It is the people’s wish so the governor won’t stop them. He finds such outings as well wishes.

“Governor Ortom has the mandate to govern Benue in the remaining two years and at the moment, that’s where his focus is.”

Some Nigerians have been reacting to the development via social media.

Adejoh Ochogwu Barnabas wrote on Facebook:

“Everything is possible in Nigeria. This is a place where failure is the right qualification to be in any public office.”

Oluwanbe Ogunmoyero wrote:

“A man without any achievement as a governor for eight wasted years... Benue remains one of the most backward states in Nigeria.”

Ukata Uche Ukata asks:

“How many of your people will be alive to vote for you then. At this rate killer herdsmen are killing your people will anyone be alive to vote?”

Goodnews Emeka wrote:

“By then, Nigeria would've shattered into uncountable fragments.”

Adesanya Damilare wrote:

“No state deserves to have a governor like Samuel Ortom. Man has been picking up the wrong battles and doesn't know how to carry out his duties as a governor. I won't be surprised if his people reward him with a Senate seat in the next election after all these stunts.”

Meanwhile, Governor Ortom on Monday, May 17 urged residents of Benue state to defend themselves against armed invaders.

The governor said those who don't have weapons required by the law, should go to their neighbours and get one.

Legit.ng had earlier reported that the Ortom-led administration on Thursday, May 6 approved the establishment of vigilante groups to combat the high rate of insecurity in Benue state.

Governor Ortom informed residents of the state when he briefed journalists attached to his office on the outcome of a recently expanded stakeholders’ meeting held at the new banquet hall of the Government House, Makurdi.

According to them, the foodstuff, meant for distribution to the vulnerable, is to cushion the ravaging hardship in the region. Flagging off the exercise in Yola, Adamawa State, one of the associates, Dahiru Hammadikko, said the gesture was courtesy of Tinubu’s associates in the 19 northern states.

He said over 10,000 households in the 21 local councils of Adamawa were targeted to benefit. He lamented that Nigerians were facing hardship, which informed the group’s move to ameliorate the suffering of Nigerians, irrespective of religious and political affiliations.

The national coordinator of the Tinubu support group said: “The gesture is to honour the national leader of APC, due to his philanthropic disposition, which is why the rice was branded with his image.”

He described Tinubu as “a detribalised Nigerian, in whom the Northern region relies” as the unifying factor.

“Today, we are flagging off the distribution of 5kg of rice to Nigerians from the northern region. We are targeting one million beneficiaries in the 19 northern states and the FCT.

“But here in Adamawa we are giving over 10,000 people,” he said.

12,12,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Many states not taking precautions against floods –NIHSA boss - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/many-states-not-taking-precautions-against-floods-nihsa-boss/,"The Director-General, Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, Mr Clement Nze, tells OKECHUKWU NNODIM that the devastation caused by floods in many states is as a result of the failure of the governments to adhere to warnings

What are the types of flooding being experienced in Nigeria?

There are three major types of flooding that we experience in Nigeria. The first one is river flooding, which is not just from rivers that are within Nigeria but from River Niger and River Benue, and these are trans-boundary waters. There is also urban/flash flooding, and these are caused by poor drainage systems or even non-existing drainage systems in many major cities in Nigeria. Lastly is coastal or tidal flooding for states that are within coastal areas such as Ondo, Lagos, Bayelsa and Rivers.

Now, it is important to state that our Annual Flood Outlook is a scientific prediction done using historical data physically collected in the field, some of them over 40 to 50 years ago. So, we use it to project and see what is going to happen tomorrow. And from what we have seen using international standards to predict, we have said that not less than 121 Local Government Areas in Nigeria, in 27 states actually, will be affected by flooding in the course of the year. Also, about 302 LGAs will experience different magnitudes of flooding. And about 351 LGAs may have a lesser severity of flooding. But like I said, it is a prediction, which we monitor closely by weekly publications. We are talking about the issue of climate change and so what you see today may not be what will happen tomorrow. So, as a result of that, we will be updating the media, states and others on what they are likely to observe in the course of the year.

How are you interfacing with the states with respect to predictions in the AFOs?

We will be doing sensitisation programmes and will downscale it to the states. We will tell the governors that these are the locations in your state that are likely to be affected in the course of the year 2021. We informed the public through the press some months ago, as preparatory to the unveiling of the 2021 AFO. And by protocol, it is the Minister of Water Resources who interfaces with the governors on behalf of the agency. Last year, for instance, the minister sent letters to each of the state governors in Nigeria and detailed the states that would be affected by flooding in that year. But what they did with it is another cup of tea.

Also, we go through other systems in the states such as their emergency management agencies, water resources and environment ministries. We interface with them directly, but what they do with our information is another issue.

Are you satisfied with what states are doing about the recommendations in the AFOs?

Frankly speaking, they are not doing as much as we expect from them, otherwise, the level of devastation that happens year in year out could have been avoided or eliminated. We’ve been telling the state governors that the tempo of political activities they embark upon during election periods should be deployed against activities that encourage flooding. Go to the grassroots, you have councillors in LGAs. They should be able to cascade this information and domesticate it in their own locations. But often time, it doesn’t happen. However, when a disaster occurs, they are quick to complain and cry out to high heavens and maybe get some support from the humanitarian ministry. But in terms of ameliorating the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.

I recall in 2016/2017, I engaged some state emergency management agencies one-on-one and we were told not to come to tell them what will happen in the course of the year except we are coming with relief materials. But we told them that that was not our jurisdiction. Ours is to inform you about what is likely to happen in your own state. If it happens, you have the National Emergency Management Agency that can support you, not NIHSA.

What are states likely going to face by failing to abide by the recommendations in the AFO?

Going by the law establishing the agency, the agency’s powers begin and stop at predicting and releasing the message. We don’t enforce anything. Each state has its own regulatory body, such as the urban planning department and emergency management agencies. They also have environmental laws and ministries that are supposed to be the regulators to ensure that the dictates of our prediction are followed. I may then say that NEMA could now insist by saying, ‘Since you failed to do the needful, don’t run to us for relief materials.’ This is because, if you recall, when the flood was very severe in 2012, the Federal Government gave out a lot of money. Some states got about N4bn to N5bn, depending on the degree of devastation.

Maybe such decisions could be taken by NEMA so as to encourage states that are doing well in terms of adhering to the predictions to ensure that lives and property are not lost. We, as an agency, can’t enforce anything; we can’t force any governor to do the needful. But the governors on their own should in the spirit of humanity protect and help those who voted them into power.

Are you collaborating with sister agencies on climate issues?

In fact, our relationship with one of them, NiMet (Nigeria Meteorological Services Agency) is very superb and cordial. First of all, at the international level, the meteorological agency is Nigeria’s permanent representative with the World Meteorological Organisation, and that falls on whoever is the Director-General. Also, whosoever heads the hydrological agency in any nation is an adviser to that permanent representative. So, in that wise, there is a very good collaboration between NIHSA and NiMet; for instance, we requested rainfall data from NiMet. And this was one of the major inputs in the model to use for predictions. They provide us those data at no cost. And once they are releasing their own predictions, such as the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction, which is now called Seasonal Climate Prediction, they inform NIHSA.

So, we collaborate a lot; they provide us with data that help us to do our prediction alongside other river measurements that we do by ourselves. We use so much data – about 12 of them, but the rainfall data are among the major data.

What are some of the recommendations in the 2021 AFO, and what advice do you have for farmers?

Farmers should heed our predictions. They should also abide by our warnings. Those who farm within the river banks should ensure that their crops have early maturity. This is to ensure that before the onset of the rainy season or flooding, the crops would have matured and be harvested. Flooding doesn’t come with the rains immediately, rather it is when the soil is saturated and its moisture content becomes high that flooding will begin to take place. So, if there is a way they can be helped to plant crops that can mature easily, it should be done, so that before the flooding starts they can harvest. And after the flooding, heavy nutrients are now brought within the flood plain, which can lead to enhanced yields when the farming starts again.

The Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, for instance, once mentioned that because of the heavy nutrients that the floods brought, they were able to regain what they lost in one of the farming seasons. That governor is very active, he works with us and comes from time to time to ask what could be done to improve farming activities in his state.

What are some of the things states should be doing now, considering the looming flood?

Like I said in our press briefing in March, there is still time for states, LGAs and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021. We made it clear at the briefing that as the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin, which covers nine countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season, with its attendant flood incidents. Nigeria’s geographical location, downstream of all the countries in this basin, places it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollution from all the countries upstream.

We know that the persistent flooding and flood disasters have become an annual event in Nigeria since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster in recent history. In 2012, hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property losses running into trillions of naira.

It is in the light of the above that NIHSA wishes to urge the states and the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly menace of flooding in the past years. We recommend that the three tiers of government should consider clearing drainage systems and canals and also embark on projects for improving hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows. They should carry out the removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinths and floats on water channels and on all avenues for river runoffs. We also encourage people living along the waterways and those having socio-economic activities on flood plains to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains.

Description of the disaster

On 6 October 2020, flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of the torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto, and Zamfara state (amongst other states) affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin, which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas. Table 1 illustrates the flood impacts of the worst flood affected states.

The situation in Kebbi – the country's biggest rice-producing state – is especially dire, as vast farmlands are completely submerged due to the most recent rains. Meanwhile in Jigawa state, a total of 18 out of 27 Local Government Areas (LGA)s have been affected, with Gwaram, Birnin Kudu, Kirikasamma, and Gumel as the worst hit. Wide swaths of farmlands have been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of Naira. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), with the support from the Federal Government, is scaling efforts to assist flood victims by providing emergency needs. So far, the agency has distributed 30 canoes to inundated communities, as well as materials to build embankments to control the floods.

Kwara State is also concerning as more than 5,000 households have been affected. The government estimates damage worth N10bn have been incurred. At least three lives in Ilorin are believed to have been lost. Scores of houses also had their roofs blown off by the raging storm that accompanied the heavy rains in the Ilorin metropolis while electricity poles were destroyed in Taiwo and Odota areas of the state capital. Telecommunication masts and building walls were also damaged in Olonkonla, Bobonkiri, Egba-Akota, Aberi, Akuji and Idiope, all in Ita-Ogunbo area, Alanamu Ward in Ilorin West Local Government Area, the worst hit.

Since September to date, torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across Nigeria. Some 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people are reported to be displaced. Most of the those affected are children. Wide swaths of farmlands have also been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of naira. These floods have so far impacted 22 states in the country’s six geo-political zones: North West (4 state), North Central (4 states), North East (4 state), South East (4 states), South-South (3 states) and South West (3 state). This earlier flooding had weakened Nigeria’s water supply and road infrastructure, killing dozens and leading to disease outbreaks.

A government team began the delivery of food palliatives to the Kwara North Senatorial District, beginning with Jebba town in Moro Local Government Area and Lafiagi in Edu Local Government Area. Over 15,000 households across 357 communities of the state are estimated to have been affected by the ugly incidents that also destroyed farmlands and human dwellings worth billions of naira. In the wake of the floods, over 100,000 hectares of rice, maize and millet farms in Kpata-Gbaradogi, fishing and agrarian settlement in Pategi LGA were destroyed. About 100 residential buildings were also submerged while 1,500 people were rendered homeless.

The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, warned flood-prone states to prepare for flood emergency, rescue and rehabilitation. According to the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rainy season is expected to continue until December 28th in the southern parts of the country. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), predicted that at least 102 LGAs in 28 states fall within the highly probable flood risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 states of the Federation, including FCT, fall within the moderately probable flood risks areas.","Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540152-Nigeria%20Floods%20-%20Emergency%20Plan%20of%20Action%20%28EPoA%29%20DREF%20n%C2%B0%20MDRNG030.png?itok=T4e01g_v,"['n', 'dref', 'affected', 'north', 'epoa', 'flood', 'local', 'floods', 'states', 'action', 'area', 'farmlands', 'plan', 'nigeria', 'state', 'mdrng030', 'areas', 'emergency']", ,flood
16,16,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Nigeria Loses a Quarter of Rice Production to Floods - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/nigeria-loses-quarter-rice-production-floods,"ARGUNGU - Farmers in northern Nigeria have lost more than two million tons of rice, a quarter of the country's projected harvest, due to flooding. Despite the loss, Nigeria is so far upholding a year-long ban on land-based imports of rice to crack down on smuggling and boost local production.

Ibrahim Adullahi is looking at what remains of his 350-hectare rice farm in Nigeria’s Kebbi state.

Abdullahi was expecting a harvest of 600 tons of rice, but weeks of severe flooding means he will be lucky to get 100.

“Since when I started farming, I have never experienced intensive cultivation of rice like now, because a lot of people are into the rice farming. But unfortunately, we experienced this intensive flooding that we are still experiencing now, and farmers are now counting losses because 90 percent of our farmers have lost what they have cultivated,” he said.

Nigeria’s biggest rice producing state, Kebbi, had projected 2.5 million tons this year.

But heavy September rains washed away two million tons. Local rice miller Mohammad Anuana said this could cause a further jump in the price of the grain.

“If rain has already washed away all the farm product, you know the goods will be rising up (in price) because the little one they have on ground - they will make sure they recover (the value of) the one that the water moves away. And, so they’ll double the price,” he said.

With Africa’s largest population, Nigeria annually imports billions of dollars of rice and wheat. But the country hopes to become self-sufficient.

Last year, the government banned land-based rice imports to crack down on smuggling and boost local rice production.

Despite the lost rice, the Nigerian officials say the ban will remain in place.

Chairman of the All Farmers Association in Nigeria John Wuyep said affected farmers will be compensated.

""The government and even the financial institutions have a machinery in force. So many who have lost now are already preparing for the dry season farming,” he said.

Nigeria’s farmers association says better groundwork is needed to prevent flooding and have a steady water supply during the dry season.

Flood reduction would also help save homes and the displacement of thousands of Nigerians from overflowing rivers.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2020-09/vlcsnap-2020-09-30-12h41m36s655.png,"['farmers', 'production', 'lost', 'flooding', 'local', 'quarter', 'price', 'tons', 'floods', 'million', 'nigeria', 'imports', 'loses', 'rice']", ,flood

Heavy rains have caused extensive flooding in Chad, Niger and Nigeria since the onset of rainy seasons in June. Chad’s rainy season, expected to last until October, is the heaviest in the past 30 years (OCHA 25/08/2020). Flooding in Niger has affected almost twice the estimated population. Flooding in Nigeria is less widespread than in 2019, but is still significant (NIHSA 06/2020; OCHA 21/07/2020).

Almost 60% of all affected people and over half of reported deaths from the three countries are in Niger, the country most affected by floods (UNHCR 15/09/2020). Flooding has affected more than 516,000 people across all eight regions, and resulted in at least 71 deaths (UNHCR 17/09/2020; OCHA 24/09/2020). Nigeria is at risk of crossborder flooding, given it is downstream from other flood-affected countries along the Niger River basin, including Niger (HNO 12/2019).

In all three countries, heavy rainfall and flash floods have resulted in the widespread destruction of shelters, driving displacement. Emergency shelters are overcrowded and unsanitary, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection and the spread of water-borne diseases (IOM 1/09/2020; OCHA 07/09/2020).

The Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region complicates flood relief efforts and increases protection concerns for highly vulnerable displaced populations in all three countries. The situation is most severe in northeast Nigeria, where over 2.7 million people are displaced and 10.6 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, especially food, shelter and WASH (OCHA 14/09/2020; UNHCR 31/07/2020). Additionally, cross-border violence from Mali affects northwest Niger and insecurity caused by banditry poses further risks to flood-affected populations in northwest Nigeria.","Wed, 07 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1538484-20201006_acaps_briefing_note_flooding_in_chad_niger_nigeria_.png?itok=WwqCv9xM,"['ocha', 'affected', 'chad', 'flooding', 'briefing', 'unhcr', 'shelters', '2020', 'countries', 'note', 'nigeria', 'widespread', 'risk', 'niger', '30', 'acaps']", ,flood

But during the rainy seasons, the city's streets can become almost impassable. Home to more than 24 million, Lagos is Nigeria's economic powerhouse, making it a destination for people seeking new opportunities. But that rapid growth creates pressure on the streets, and the environment.

The streets are often flooded, in part due to the dysfunctional disposal of the 6,000-10,000 tonnes of rubbish generated daily in the city. After a downpour, rubbish piles up in open gutters and makes moving around the streets difficult. “I worry when it rains, especially when it is heavy,” says Lagos resident Stephanie Erigha. ""It makes me anxious."" On one occasion when taking a taxi through a waterlogging-prone part of the city, she recalls the water gushing right into the back seat next to her.

While the overall climate in Lagos is expected to see less rainfall overall with climate change, the intensity of rain is expected to increase, bringing with it greater risk of flooding. Meanwhile, the low-lying city is also particularly vulnerable to water from another source: rising seas. If global warming exceeds 2C, the city is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100, according to research led by marine physicist Svetlana Jevrejeva, of the UK's National Oceanography Centre.

How, in the face of flooding, blocked streets and rising waters, is Africa's most populous city adapting?

Floating architecture

There is one part of Lagos that has extensive experience of dealing with high water. Much of the Makoko neighbourhood is not built on land, but rather sits on stilts above the waterline. Makoko, known as the ""Venice of Africa"", is a labyrinthine slum built on stilts and navigated by canoe. The slum has little access to electricity or clean sanitation, but it has also been home to innovations like the Makoko Floating School, a structure resting on recycled empty plastic barrels for buoyancy. The school's pyramid shape helped lower its centre of gravity and so increase its stability, while also being an ideal roof shape for shedding heavy rains.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/live/624x351/p094q1j4.jpg,"['afloat', 'water', 'rubbish', 'streets', 'slum', 'africas', 'staying', 'rising', 'lagos', 'stilts', 'shape', 'largest', 'city', 'makoko']", ,flood

The Edo State government said it has appointed a contractor for the flood control project at Ughoha community in Esan South Local Government Area of the state, signalling the commencement of the project.

The project coordinator, Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP), Tom Obaseki, made this known on Wednesday at Ugboha, while introducing the project contractor to the community.

Mr Obaseki assured the people that the best contractor was selected to handle the project because of the importance of the community to the state.

“Ugboha is very important to us and we thank the community for producing great men that have made so many positive contributions to the development of Edo State.

“We made sure that in the process of recruiting a contractor for the job, we went for the best of the best,” he stated.

Mr Obaseki solicited the support of the traditional head of Ugboha and members of the community for the smooth implementation of the project.

“We want to solicit the support of your highness and the entire people of the kingdom so that there will not be hitches down the line.

“Every time we waste or lose cannot be recovered. So, we want to seek your support in providing the enabling environment and security for the contractor,” he said.

The traditional head of Ugboha, Ukato Steven II, assured that the community would provide a conducive environment for the successful and timely delivery of the project.

Outrage as IDPs camps overflows with displaced residence



Governor raises the alarm as terrorists hoist flag in Kaore community

Affected communities speak out: “We don’t want Govt food or money but adequate security to enable us to return home

CAN goes spiritual; declares 3-day fast

By Wole Mosadomi

Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

“I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

“We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.”

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists’ presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. “Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don’t need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,” he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: “The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.”

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God’s intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

•We prefer to die in our ancestral homes than vacate for flood —Fishermen vow

•Why they refused to stay out of harm’s way — NISEPS

By Wole Mosadomi

A major calamity now looms in Niger State following the refusal of fishermen to vacate flood-prone areas already identified by the state government following an authenticated meteorological report that those areas would be worst hit by flooding once the rains set in.

The report can hardly be faulted since the state and the federal agency have always issued the advisory on a yearly basis in a bid to mitigate the catastrophic effect of heavy flooding in the state particularly in the riverine areas of the state with heavy fishing population.

Once the alarming scientific report was issued, the Niger State Government through its Environmental Protection Agency, NISEPA, quickly approached those who are likely to be hit by the looming flood, to vacate the flood plains and move to more secured locations.

If the agency expected an urgent compliance with its directive, it got it all wrong, as the potential victims largely ignored the protection agency and continued with their business of catching, drying and selling fish as if nothing is amiss.

Beyond the fishermen, majority of the residents living close to drains, have also ignored the advisory to move away from the endangered places, preferring to continue staying there and doing their daily business.

Most of them have even turned their drainage into dumping grounds, filling them with refuse with reckless abandon and thereby threatening their health and well being in the process.

But their recalcitrance notwithstanding, the Niger State Emergency Protection Agency, NISEPS, has continued to move from one street to the other, pleading with the residents to stop dumping refuse in drainage and to move away from endangered locations as the rains begin to thunder.

But those spoken to in Minna, the state capital, say they see nothing wrong in pouring refuse into drains and that they have not committed any known offence doing that. For this reason, women, children, men, boys and girls are routinely seen turning their refuse into the drains without any fear or shame.

“I am just an errand boy. I am only given a directive by my parents to go and dump the refuse into the drainage and I carry out the order,” a young boy, who stays in Minna with his parents, said without remorse when confronted by Arewa Voice.

“In fact, I really enjoy going into the drainage to even play after dumping the refuse there and as much as the drainage is big and deep, we will continue to use it as dumping site, more so that the rains will always wash it away,” he remarked with confidence.

However, NISEPA sees the action beyond a child’s play because of the devastating effects it has on the people.

The Director-General of NISEPA, Alhaji Ahmed Inga, in an exclusive interview with AV correspondent, said despite the annual sensitisation of the people on the inherent danger of indiscriminate refuse dumping into drains, the residents have continued to engage in the illicit act with ease.

Alhaji Inga said: “This year, we have started appealing and sensitizing the people, especially in the urban areas and those in the riverine areas to adhere strictly to advice of professionals on flooding.

“Waterways are being cleared and due to human activities; we have been calling and will still be calling on people to try as much as we can to change our attitudes towards our environment.

“It is our attitude that always put us into serious situations of flooding, and later we will be calling for help. If we observe now, the waterways are now being turned into dumping sites by people within the communities and these are the same people that will start calling for help during flood.

“In as much as we are not going to change our attitude towards environment, then we cannot get away from distress calls every time,” he remarked.

Drastic steps to be taken by government: “The state government has concluded plans to deal with those building on waterways which are the major obstacle to free flow of water in the drainages. Those people building on waterways are our major problem and recently government has taken serious measures because very soon, all buildings on waterways will have to give way because some people don’t care of what happens to their neighbours provided they are safe but government is not insensitive because government cares for everyone.

“There are Laws that go with such offences and the enforcement will soon take effect and there is a clear directive on that. We as an agency has the responsibility to supervise, identify, advise, monitor and see to all these and very soon, the distillation of waterways to ensure free flow of water in the drainages and will commence and there will be strict monitoring because there will be Community Vanguard that will watch over those drainage channels and anybody caught contravening the law will be made to face wrath of the law,” Inga declared.

People residing in riverine areas: The Director-General said that one of the major problems his agency is facing is on how to convince the people residing in the riverine areas to leave their abode temporarily to the upland to save their lives and properties from flood during the raining season.

Why they are adamant: “They remain unperturbed despite our sensitization to them to vacate their homes temporarily from the downstream to upstream and return back after the rains but they remain adamant.

“They are so attached to the riverine areas for some factors which have made them to get glued to those riverine communities.

“They claim that one of the reasons they don’t want to move out of the riverine area is that the soil gives them high yield; when there is flood or immediately after the flood any crop planted brings enormous yield than those in other areas of the state.

“Secondly, they said if there is flood, they use to harvest more fish and that brings to them a lot of money,” he said.

The DG, however, said that: “Government is planning to provide them with highly improved seeds for farming so that when the prediction for flooding start coming to pass, their crops must have been ready for harvesting and with this development, it is hoped that they will yield to our clarion calls from now.”

But the explanations so far made by NISEPA appear to have fallen on deaf ears, as the fishermen insist that they would rather die in their ancestral homes than vacate them.

Some of the fishermen, who spoke to AV, said that government should rather prepare a place to bury them after the flood than move them into any camp given the nasty experiences of those who have been taken into internally displaced persons’ camps across the state.

“We will rather die here in our ancestral homes honourably than being taken into slumps in the name of IDPs,” some of the fishermen stated.

For now, there seems to be a deadlock between the fishermen and the state government but it is not clear who will win the fight.

Speaking when the 2021 flood outlook was presented in Abuja, Nze said states have maintained a carefree attitude towards flood warnings over the years.

“Last year, the minister sent a letter to all the state governors in Nigeria and informed them in detail of what to expect, yet not too many states are doing something about it,” he said.

Nze urged state governors to use the same energy for political activities when tackling environmental challenges such as flooding.

He said: “It could be avoided or eliminated. The tempo of political activities they exhibited during the elections should be replicated in tackling this disturbing issue of flooding in the states.

“LGA councillors should be able to domesticate this information in their own locations but this doesn’t happen.

“Once the disaster occurs, they are quick to cry to high heavens, but in terms of reducing the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.”

The non-fire occurrences listed by the bill needing emergency rescue included flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters.

The sponsor of the bill is Rep. Adejoro Adeogun Akoko South East: South West Federal Constituency of Ondo State.

Leading the debate on the general principle of the bill at Tuesday plenary, Adeogun said that the bill when passed into law would provide stricter penalties for violation of building codes and fire regulations.

He said: “The fire service act (1963) saddled the Fire service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies. This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required.

Also read:

“This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.

“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”

According to the lawmaker, the goals of the bill are essential to prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters; encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by States, Local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies; establish the office of the Fire and emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the Fire and emergency service; empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilize resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies; and provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officer.

“Mr Speaker, Hon. colleagues, the major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency.

“It will also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through the engagement of able-bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.

“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating of future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources. I am therefore seeking the support of all distinguished Honorable members of this house for the second reading of this bill and eventual passage”, Adeogun submitted.

The bill eventually received the overwhelming support of the House majority when subjected to a voice vote by the presiding officer, Ahmed Idris Wase and passed for second reading.

This was disclosed by the NHSA Director-General, Mr Clement Nze, in a press briefing on Wednesday in Abuja. He urged that strict town planning codes be enforced, calling for constructions of flood walls, buffer dams, dykes and other infrastructure that can hold water and prevent flooding.

What the NHSA is saying

“Federal, states and local governments should clear drainage systems and canals, and embark on projects that will improve hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows… carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas through removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers, to increase storage capacities,” Nze said.

READ:

The NHSA boss revealed that Nigeria is stepping into the 2021/2022 hydrological year in the River Niger Basin, which includes a total of 9 countries, citing the yearly occurrence of flooding in the country since 2012.

“It then means that Nigeria is gradually inching closer to its peak rainy season with subsequent flood incidents,” he said.

“Nigeria’s geographical location downstream, of all the countries in the Basin, puts it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollutions from all the countries upstream,” Nze added.

In case you missed it: According to the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rising heatwave in the month of March just before the rainfalls was caused by NorthWestern and South Western air masses from the Sahara and Atlantic Ocean which generates so much heat during the transition month period of March-April.","Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Rainfall.jpg?fit=900%2C506&ssl=1,"['rainy', 'river', 'nhsa', 'urged', 'floods', 'peak', 'season', 'states', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'closer', 'nze', 'countries', 'expected']", ,flood

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beat/University of North Carolina PressWho doesn’t love a book with more than one index entry for possum? Two hundred of them were cooked at an Oklahoma City bash in 1923, along with 5,000 chickens, 10 bears, 500 beef cattle, 5 tons of coffee, etc. These are but some of the many fascinating facts in Adrian Miller’s new book Black Smoke: African Americans and the United States of Barbecue.Meet One of the First Barbecue Kings: Henry ‘Poppa’ MillerThe Lost African-American Bartenders who Created the CocktailThe book has 22 recipes (bison skewers, banana pudding, alligator ribs), 16 mini-profiles (such as barbecue king Henry “Poppa” Miller), and a big mission.In the 1990s, Miller worked as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton in the One America Initiative, which had the goal of fostering dialogue and helping communities reconcile racial divisions. Miller’s books could be seen as an extension of that experience. His James Beard Award-winning Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time expounded upon the social history of key soul dishes—fried chicken, chitlins, yams. In The President’s Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas, Miller researched the contributions of African Americans who worked in the White House kitchen.So faced with a whitewashed and one-sided representation of barbecue, Miller got to work. While most people agree that barbecue is a result of European influences dovetailing with Native American techniques in Southern kitchens where the cooks were African Americans—that barbecue, in other words, is Black—evidence, by which I mean scholarly evidence, well-researched and reliably sourced, has been vanishingly scant.To find that essential information, Miller turned mostly to newspaper archives.“For all my books, the biggest boon has been newspapers,” he told me. “They were about capturing the daily life of the community, and so you got a lot more flourish and details about what was happening at a particular event.”He sifted through the records of the speakers and the attendees at big community barbecues—which was tough work, since the food was often barely mentioned.Eventually, “writers started paying more attention to the details and at a time when African Americans went unnoticed more and more of them started talking to these Black barbecuers.”“Now, let’s just be straight up,” Miller said. “Part of this was to mock them. So you’d have them speaking in plantation dialect. But you saw other writers treating this person as an expert, as an artist and showing some love.”“I’ve struggled on how to tell people this,” Miller told me. “During the racist times you actually got more details.”And by the 1830s, in order to have legit barbecue, it was thought, an African American cook and his crew were necessary and barbecue was understood to be a Black experience. Miller explained a complicated twist in the narrative in words far more polite than I might have chosen: “In the 1850s, as there’s more and more tension about slavery, you actually find pro-slavery advocates using the plantation barbecue as evidence of their generosity.”After the Civil War, a group of African Americans “emerged from slavery with a highly specialized and marketable skill.” Barbecue culture flourished because African Americans were barbecuing on their own terms. “And that shows up with political barbecue, church barbecue and also emancipation barbecues.”Barbecue, after all, is perfectly suited to big crowds. You can feed thousands of people, as many as show up, as long as you’ve got the wood, the space and the meat.But the meat, says Miller, is not as cut-and-dried, so to speak, as one might think.In words sure to bring upon him (if not me, by association) a plague of wonky BBQ commentary, Miller reports that: “The regional barbecue styles that we fight about so fiercely today, they’re only about a hundred years old. Before that, barbecue was pretty standardized. It was hardwood coals in a trench, butterflied whole carcasses, flip it and sauce it, cut it up and serve it.” Pork was common, of course, but so was lamb and mutton, and the first emancipation barbecue, which took place in Port Royal, South Carolina, was a beef barbecue.Equally fascinating are the unsung regions of barbecue that Miller has championed such as St. Louis, Chicago, and the east side of Texas, where the meat comes with sauce and the sides aren’t the Germanic salads you find in Central Texas but soul food greens and creole dirty rice.So what happened over the last century? How did we get to a place where white people are thought to own barbecue?“At the very time that people are getting interested in barbecue, the non-diverse food media basically said ‘OK, these are the people we think should tell you what barbecue is, and where to get the good stuff.’ And they just kept putting white dude after white dude out in front.”And as he says it, and we talk about the trends that get pushed in barbecue, it becomes obvious, almost to the point of hilarity: the reason the mantra of barbecue became minimal seasoning was because we kept asking white people how to make barbecue. I suggest that I hear an echo of the old joke about how white people don’t season their food, and he laughs and agrees.“We’ll just flip that to our advantage,” Miller said, “and say you don’t need to season.”This trend is a big part of what brought Miller to write this book. “Chronically, there’s been so little coverage of African American barbecue culture.” Everywhere in the food media, the lack of African American representation “just hit me over and over.”He wasn’t sure, upon setting out on the project, how much he would find, and he feared, in the beginning, that he might be embarking on a record of faded glory. “I really thought I was going to be writing an elegy about Black barbecue,” he said. But “it’s thriving. It’s resilient.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

29,29,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Man who ‘lost everything’ in flood wins $2m jackpot - Vanguard,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/04/man-who-lost-everything-in-flood-wins-2m-jackpot/,"Kindly Share This Story:

A Michigan man who “lost everything” in a flood a year ago just won $2 million from a scratch-off lottery ticket.

The lucky 29-year-old, who chose to remain anonymous, said he “couldn’t stop shaking” when he found out about his sudden change in fortune.

“Last year, I lost everything in a flood, so to win this prize is so overwhelming to me,” he said in a statement released by state lottery officials.

He was on his way to pick up his kids from school when he stopped at a grocery store in Midland — and a ticket for the lottery’s Lucky 7s instant game caught his eye.

“Seven is a lucky number for me, so I decided to take a chance and bought the ticket,” said the man, who also won $10,000 playing the lottery a few years ago.

“I scratched it off when I got back to my car. When I saw I had a match, I thought: ‘Great, I won my money back!’ When I saw I had actually won $2 million, I couldn’t stop shaking.”

He went to the lottery headquarters to claim his big prize, opting for the lump sum of about $1.3 million instead of receiving annuity payments for the full $2 million.

He said he plans to pay off bills and save what’s left of his winnings.

“Knowing my kids will be taken care of is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

30,30,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Nigeria: Aftermath of Boko Haram Invasion - Niger State Communities in Panic Mode As Victims, Others Flood IDPs Camps - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/202104300443.html,"Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: ""I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

""I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

""We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.""

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists' presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. ""Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don't need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,"" he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: ""The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.""

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God's intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 28 Nigerian states are at risk of heavy flooding this year, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said Thursday.

This year's flood projections will, as expected, vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country, and rivers are likely to exceed flood level with some low-lying areas to be inundated, said the NIHSA in a statement following an earlier survey.

Out of the 774 local government areas in the country, it said, some 102 local government areas across 28 states are at risk of flooding -- one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria, which has a devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on floodplains for livelihood.

Although the projections showed that the floods this year might not be as severe as in previous years, it was important to begin to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns for preparedness, the agency said.

In March 2012, 32 of Nigeria's 36 states were affected by flooding, in which more than 360 people were killed and almost 2 million displaced.

The phenomenon is repeated across numerous communities in West Africa, where traffic and business come to a standstill for hours or days, waiting for the streets to drain. Sometimes the flooding becomes deadly.

Last year, hundreds of people were killed in a mudslide in Freetown, Sierra Leone, along a hillside where residents of the booming city had cleared forests to build homes. Victims were buried alive in their houses and vehicles. Environmental groups and local organizations had been warning for years that the development was risky.

In Nigeria, local television stations reported that more than 100 communities had flooded and broadcast images of muddy waters reaching the rooftops of clusters of homes. Some people died when flooding caused their homes to collapse, according to Agence France-Presse.

Local leaders in some areas were advising residents to evacuate. Officials in Anambra State set up 28 camps for fleeing residents. Thousands of people fled their homes in Cross River State, officials there said, noting that many of them lived in swampy areas or along waterways.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Nigerien student Hachimou Abdou has had to catch a boat to classes since river water swamped his route to university in the capital Niamey - one of about 760,000 people hit by severe flooding in recent weeks in parts of West and Central Africa.

Floods are common during the rainy season, but in recent years climate change, land degradation and poor urban planning have led to more frequent disasters as rapidly-growing cities struggle with heavier-than-normal rainfall.

Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Congo Republic and Senegal are among those worst-hit this year, with at least 111 people killed, according to latest figures from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Waters have yet to recede in parts of Niamey since torrential rains in August caused rivers to burst their banks, destroying nearly 32,000 houses and 5,768 hectares of farmland across Niger.

“I have to get to university - either I take a boat or I walk in the water,” Abdou said, before settling into a traditional wooden pirogue to travel up the flooded highway.

Flooding across landlocked Niger alone has so far impacted nearly 333,000 people. Over 188,000 people have been affected in neighbouring Chad, with OCHA warning of potential food shortages due to inundated land.

With further rain expected, particularly in Central Africa, the situation is expected to worsen, said OCHA’s director for West and Central Africa, Julie Belanger.

Communities’ ability to cope with natural disasters has been eroded by instability, food shortages and mass displacement in some areas. Over 25 million people are in need of humanitarian aid in the violence-plagued Sahel area, which includes Niger, Chad and Mali.

“Many of those populations live in flood-prone areas. It’s just a matter of time for them to be at risk of epidemics,” Belanger said, describing how quickly diseases can spread once floods wipe out access to clean water and sanitation.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200910&t=2&i=1532955151&r=LYNXMPEG891XR&w=800,"['recent', '760000', 'water', 'chad', 'university', 'central', 'floods', 'west', 'hit', 'parts', 'niger', 'severe', 'niamey', 'africa', 'shortages']", ,flood

An image of trucks and cars on a flooded road has been shared in multiple social media posts claiming to show a submerged highway in Nigeria’s southern Ogun state following a recent heavy downpour. This is partly false; while the location is correct, the photo has been circulating since at least 2019.

The image appears in numerous Facebook posts, including this one published on March 24, 2021, with more than 500 shares.

“Sango Ota bridge, I understand this was yesterday o (sic),” reads the Facebook post published on a page called “Lady K ifeoluwa show”. It has a history of calling for the secession of the Yoruba nation from Nigeria.

Sango Ota is a town in Nigeria’s southwestern Ogun state and is home to the country’s former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. The majority of inhabitants in the region are Yorubas, a large ethnic group in the west African country.

The rest of the post, translated from Yoruba into English, pleads for the “intervention” of state officials and then declares “end Nigeria now”.

The photo it refers to shows submerged vehicles on a flooded road, and features alongside an almost identical claim in this Facebook post with more than 800 shares, as well as on Twitter.

However, the image has been circulating online for more than a year.

Old photo

Using the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check traced earlier versions of the claim to Facebook accounts here and here on March 22, 2021.

It was reposted on Facebook the next day by Joe Igbokwe, the special adviser to the Lagos state governor for drainage and water resources.

“Sango Bridge after yesterday's rain, this is sign of what the people of that area should be expecting this year except the drainages are cleared. Please tell Ogun State to consult me (sic),” reads Igbokwe’s Facebook post.

AFP Fact Check has previously debunked misleading information shared on Igbokwe’s account.

In this case, AFP Fact Check confirmed that it actually rained in Sango Ota on March 22, 2021, according to the World Weather Online site.

Furthermore, an AFP journalist in Nigeria confirmed that the photo was indeed taken in the town.

However, the viral image is not evidence of any recent rainfall or flooding.

A Google reverse image search led to this Facebook post and the same picture from September 7, 2019, captioned ""Yesterday Rain @ Sango"". Five days later, global humanitarian organisation ReliefWeb reported that heavy rainfall in the preceding weeks had caused flooding in some parts of the country.

Flooding has long been an issue in the town. In 2011, residents called on the government to construct drainage to prevent an environmental disaster.

Now, like thousands of hectares of rice in Nigeria’s Kebbi state, it is under water.

“Almost all my farm has been flooded. I didn’t harvest any rice,” Ladan told Reuters News Agency. “It’s going to be devastating.”

Floods early this month across northwest Nigeria destroyed 90 percent of the two million tonnes that Kebbi state officials expected to harvest this autumn, the head of the state branch of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. The loss amounts to some 20 percent of the rice Nigeria grew last year, and the waters are still rising.

Further south, outside Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, chicken farmer Hippolite Adigwe is also worried. A shortage of maize forced him to sell most of his flock of more than 1,000 birds, and the 300 he has left are hungry. Chicken feed prices have more than doubled, and he is not sure how long he can cope.

Twin crises, floods and maize shortages, come just after movement restrictions and financing difficulties caused by COVID-19 containment measures complicated spring planting.

Some farmers and economists said it could push Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, into a food crisis. Rice is the country’s staple grain, and chicken is a core protein.

“There is a real fear of having food shortages,” Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. “The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Nigeria took roughly 4,000 tonnes of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s (ECOWAS) strategic stocks last month and released 30,000 tonnes of its own maize. It also gave four companies special permission to import maize.

The prominent Nigerian Economic Summit Group has called for “a complete overhaul” of agriculture policy.

Problems accessing foreign exchange to import food are adding to shortages. In July, the central bank added maize to a list of items for which importers are banned from using its dollars. Rice and fertiliser were already on the list, along with other items that Nigeria wants to be made locally.

Last week, even as food prices spiked, President Muhammadu Buhari promised that not one cent of central bank dollars would go to food or fertiliser imports, as Nigeria would continue encouraging local farmers over imports.

Importers can use dollars from pricier parallel markets. But these are tough to find due to an oil price crash that has cut Nigeria’s core source of foreign exchange.

Switching grains

Rice prices had already risen substantially due to a land border closure last year that aimed to stamp out smuggling and boost local production.

The worst is yet to happen. Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex

Peter Clubb of the International Grains Council said the spike drove consumers to eat maize instead. This, along with a disappointing crop late last year and the foreign exchange issues, boosted maize prices to 180,000 naira ($470) per tonne from approximately 70,000 naira ($183) in March.

Farmers sid that consumers grappling with inflation, as well as the first rise in fuel prices since 2016 and a power price spike, can only pay so much more for food.

Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex, said the central bank’s lending scheme for farmers has significantly expanded output, and can work long term.

But the coming months will be tough. Fertiliser prices hit a record after a COVID-19 outbreak shut down country’s sole urea plant for two weeks, meaning more farmers will skip fertilisers, limiting crop yields.

“The worst is yet to happen,” Balogun said. “It is a problem across grains.”

Buhari has pledged more support, and Agriculture Minister Muhammed Sabo Nanono visited the northwest area this weekend and promised to provide farmers with high-quality seeds and to set up a special committee to ensure they have all they need to plant new crops as soon as possible.

Adigwe, the chicken farmer, said he thinks barring foreign food in order to help farmers is not a bad idea, but “there are some factors that were not considered.”

Support the ICIR

IT was past noon – lunch time – but there was only one customer at the bukka. Loretta Eze, the proprietor, surveyed the busy street as she stood by the entrance of her restaurant located by the corner of a street in the Wuse 2 area of Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. A number of girls in yellow shirts, who worked as attendants in the restaurant, were hanging around waiting for the solitary customer to finish his meal.

“It was not always like this,” Loretta told The ICIR‘s correspondent, who visited the restaurant while investigating the impact of rising prices of foodstuffs on the preparation and consumption of food, especially jollof rice.

“Food items are very expensive these days and the situation is very hard for those of us that are into catering and food business. Things are hard and as a result, we are not getting as many customers as in the past when things were cheaper,” Loretta added.

Higher cost of foodstuffs has forced restaurants, including roadside bukkas and ‘Mama put‘ joints, to increase the prices of different dishes on their menu and Loretta observed that the development had, in turn, forced some customers to stay away because they could not afford meals as in the past.

Loretta’s observations and concerns mirrored the findings in the SBM Jollof Index report for the first quarter of 2021.

The SBM Jollof Index, developed by SBM Intel, an Africa-focused research firm, simplified the appreciation of food inflationary trends using a common delicacy that most Nigerian households enjoy – jollof rice.

Across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, SBM collects data on the most common ingredients that go into cooking jollof rice in 13 markets on a monthly basis except for December, due to the seasonal spikes caused by Yuletide celebrations. From the prices collated, the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for a family of five or six is averaged and used as a proxy for measuring food inflation across the country.

The commodities that make up the Jollof Index include rice, curry, thyme, seasoning, groundnut oil, chicken/turkey (poultry), beef, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions.

The SBM Index is published three times a year – at the end of the first three quarters. Data from October and November are reflected in the Quarter 1 Jollof Index of the following year.

Cost of making pot of jollof rice rose between March 2020 and March 2021

According to the latest SBM Jollof Index report, the average cost of making a pot of jollof rice rose by 7.8 per cent between March 2020 and March 2021.

The sharp spike in the cost of preparing the delicacy was attributed to a number of events which impacted on food prices. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020, the border closure and foreign exchange restrictions in August 2020 were worsened by a sharp hike in energy tariffs by September of that year.

The situation was further compounded by the the #EndSARS protests, as well as the food blockade imposed by northern traders on the southern part of the country, which disrupted agricultural supply chain and the movement of people and goods.

The reopening of land borders in December 2020 did not result in a significant drop in the cost of food items – the price of a bag of rice only dropped slightly by a margin of N1000 to N3000 depending on the market but that did not translate into a drop in the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for the majority of Nigerians who buy from retailers.

The SBM Jollof Index noted that food prices remained high due to factors such as reduced local production, exchange rate fluctuations, poor harvest due to adverse weather, and high cost of energy and transportation.

Insecurity was also a major factor for the increasing cost of preparing a pot of jollof rice, translating into rising food inflation in Nigeria.

“Some of the jollof rice ingredients such as rice, onions and tomatoes have witnessed reduced local production because of protracted conflicts and terrorist attacks on farmers. Out of the 11 main rice producing states in the country, Benue, Borno, Ebonyi and Kaduna have witnessed attacks on farmers with the most gruesome being the execution of about 110 rice farmers in Borno in November 2020,” the report said.

Faced with deaths from terror attacks in insecure agrarian communities, several farmers are leaving the countryside and moving to the cities to take up menial jobs.

Despite recent drop in inflation rate, Nigerians are still groaning over increasing cost of food items

According to latest figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria’s inflation rate dropped from 18.17 per cent in March 2021 to 18.12 per cent in April 2021.

The 0.05 percentage points decline was the first recorded in headline inflation in about 20 months.

Food inflation also recorded a decline – from 22.95 per cent in March 2021 to 22.72 per cent in April, 2021.

However, while the NBS suggested that inflation might have peaked and could continue to drop, Nigerians are yet to get any reprieve while purchasing foodstuffs.

For Loretta, a food vendor who deals in foodstuffs, the price of food items has continued to spike in the market.

Making a comparison of what was obtainable in the past and the present, she told The ICIR, “Before now, I used to buy a small basket of tomatoes between N300 and N500, but now, it is N1500. Some tomatoes even go for N2500 per basket. Also, a basket of fresh pepper is N1500 now. Before now, you could get a pint of groundnut oil for N300, but it is now N650.”

She added, “Before now, with N2500 or N3000, I could prepare a normal pot of soup or stew but now, if you don’t have at least N7000 you will not get the taste you want due to the high cost of food items.”

Further lamenting the daily hike in the price of staple food items, she observed that, not too long ago, a mudu, or regular measure of beans, was between N250 and N300. But a mudu of beans is N800 now.

“It is the same case as meat. Before now, with N6000 or N8000, you could get the quantity of goat meat that would be enough for you, but now, you will have up to N15000 or more for that same quantity.”

According to her, the increase in the price of onions was ‘manageable’. “The quantity we were getting for N100 before is about N400 or N500 at the moment.”

Loretta also pointed to the sharp increase in the price of rice.

“Before now, a mudu of rice was N300, but now, a mudu of local rice is about N800,” a development which she admitted had increased the cost of preparing a pot of regular jollof rice.

Speaking further, Loretta said, “crayfish and stockfish are totally out of the question” due to recent hike in the prices of the food items.

Nkechi Emmanuel, a housewife, had a frown on her face as she walked out of Dutse Market, in the Bwari area of Abuja. She was clutching a handful of food items.

In a brief encounter with The ICIR‘s correspondent, Nkechi explained that the feeding allowance her husband gave her each month, which was never enough in the best of times, was now barely able to provide a pot of stew and soup.

“It has never been this bad and it is getting worse by the day,” the woman said in a frustrated tone.

All types of foodstuffs are becoming out of reach for the poor and the lower middle-class by the day.

Okon-Essien stressed that the increase in the prices of basic food items, which had driven up the cost of food, had resulted in reduced patronage for food vendors.

“Before now, the highest amount you could get egusi is N250 or N300 for a mudu, but now, a mudu of egusi is N700 or N800.

“The situation is very difficult for those of us that are into food business. Due to the high cost of foodstuff, it is not easy to sell and make profit anymore because customers are having problems with the higher prices,” she said.

Garri is generally regarded as ‘poor man’s food,’ but Okon-Essien said that was in the past.

“Garri is longer a poor man’s food. A mudu of garri is now N500,” she told The ICIR.

Okon-Essien also noted that another staple foudstuff – red oil – had become more expensive.

“Before now, you could get a tin of red oil for N200, but now, it is not less than N500,” she said, while observing that the situation was more worrisome because the food items were locally produced and not imported.

Besides becoming more expensive, some food items which Nigerians took for granted, due to their availability, are becoming scarce.

The increase in the price of fufu, a cassava meal, goes with the increasing scarcity of the food item, according to Okon-Essien.

“Fufu is a food item that is loved by Nigerians but right now, fufu is scarce and that has made it very expensive. I don’t know if Nigerians are not planting cassava again. Fish has also become very expensive. People now find it very difficult to afford fish for their meals.”

Okon-Essien corroborated the findings of the SBM Jollof Index for the first quarter of 2021.

“Not too long ago, with as little as N1000, you could prepare a pot of jollof rice for your family because with that amount, you would get rice and some amount of crayfish, onion, maggi and other foodstuff you needed. But now, that N1000 will only be enough for a mudu of foreign rice and if you want to cook local rice, then you will need N700 or N800 to buy a mudu of rice and as a result, you will not have much left for the ingredients needed for the jollof rice.”

Highlighting the dismal impact of high food inflation on the food industry, she observed, “Before now, when it was lunch time, you would see many people coming to eat, but now, lunch time seems like morning time, you hardly see anybody. You only see a few people coming to eat and this is because there is no money and everybody is ‘checking his pocket.’ Before now, they could get a plate of food for N250 or N300, but the least you can get a plate of now is N400 or N500,” the woman said.

The number of customers in restaurants has dropped, Okon-Essien noted.

Inflation rate still very high despite recorded decline

Nigeria’s inflation rate might have recorded a marginal decline in April but it remains very high and this is especially so for food inflation.

This was stated by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) which decried the current inflation rate of 18.12 per cent.

Director General of LCCI Muda Yusuf noted that despite the recently recorded decline in the inflation rate, “food inflation at over 22 per cent is still very high in spite of the marginal moderation in food prices in April 2021.”

Yusuf said the situation had continued to exert a negative impact on the activities of every economic agents, including households, businesses and investors, with profound impact on the citizenry, particularly the low and middle-income households.

“The high level of inflation continues to dampen consumer purchasing power at a time households incomes are not increasing in proportion to cost,” he said, adding that the development had resulted in rising production costs and depressed margins for businesses.

Nigeria at risk of famine

Meanwhile, the latest SBM Jollof Index report, which said Nigeria was currently on a slippery slope, noted that Nigeria might experience famine in the nearest future if production, consumption and political-economic dynamics remained unchanged from what was currently obtainable.

Noting that decline in food availability, exponential population growth and decline in entitlements were the main contributors to famine, the report observed that “history shows that the famines with the highest mortality rates resulted from poor harvests, natural disasters (droughts, flood), war/conflict, poor governance and policy failures – conditions which Nigeria fulfills easily.”

The SBM Jollof Index noted that over the last 10 years, food production in Nigeria had been dismally affected by continuous conflicts between farmers and herders in the Middle Belt, where more than 62,000 farmers were displaced from their homeland between 2010 and 2015, including terrorist attacks on farmers in the North-East and bandits’ onslaught in the North-West.

Added to these are adverse weather conditions and decreasing agricultural land due to urbanisation, and the effects of governance failure and some government policies, such as border closer, foreign exchange restriction, hike in electricity tariff and petrol pump price.

The SBM Jollof Index stated that the different factors had combined to continuously drive up food prices in Nigeria.

Poverty rising

The 2020 report by World Poverty Clock showed that over 105 million Nigerians lived in extreme poverty – as against 98 million in October 2019. The figure represented more than 51 per cent of the population.

This placed Nigeria as world poverty capital for two years running. Unemployment in Nigeria reached 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020. Nigeria is among most miserable countries in Africa, scoring 50.6 points in March 2021, as against 14.8 points in Ghana, 6.9 in Ethiopia, 13 in Kenya and 12.1 points in Egypt, among others.","Fri, 21 May 2021 17:07:41 GMT",https://www.icirnigeria.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Goat-meat-jollof-rice.jpg,"['sbm', 'inflation', 'food', 'mudu', 'cost', 'worsening', 'jollof', 'signals', 'rising', 'prices', 'index', 'pot', 'insecurity', 'preparing', 'rice', 'nigerias']", ,flood_and_drought

Is the government doing enough?

Over the last few years in Nigeria, seasonal flooding has killed hundreds, destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, and displaced millions of people.

This year, since the rainy season began in June, twelve states have been badly affected. In four of them – Anambra, Delta, Kogi and Niger – the government declared a state of emergency. The National Emergency management agency (NEMA), which coordinate disaster management in Nigeria, estimates that two hundred people have died so far and over 600,000 people have had to flee their homes.

The havoc wrought by heavy rains this year has been devastating. But this level of destruction is not new to Nigeria. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and scores have died in floods. In 2012, particularly severe flooding led to two million displacements and 363 deaths.

Why Nigeria floods

Nigeria’s flooding problem derives from a combination of factors, natural and man-made alike.

On the one hand, rainfall has become significantly heavier in recent years due to climate change. This year, the Niger River reached 11.06m above sea level and could rise further, approaching the record 12.84m of 2012. Water levels have also risen in upstream Cameroon, Mali and Niger. These countries feed the Niger and Benue rivers, which flow through Nigeria. The towns along these two main rivers are particularly vulnerable.

Man-made issues have also contributed to the problem.

For example, Nigeria has several dams along its rivers, ranging from huge hydroelectric stations to smaller constructions for irrigation and fishing. These structures can, in theory, help manage water levels. But in reality, many have been poorly maintained and run, contributing to the build-up of water levels, endangering nearby towns and villages.

“Dams are not necessary facilitators of flood,” says James Akanmu, a water resource and environmental engineering expert. “But we often mismanage dams and they lead us into problems.”

Another contributing factor is a lack of town planning. As Nigeria rapidly urbanises, towns and cities have sprawled with little regard for environmental concerns. Waterways and canals that are crucial for flows are often filled in as part of building developments, while informal settlements in some areas vulnerable to flooding have doubled in population.

“People are building on water ways. People build houses without drainages. The government builds roads without drainages,” says Alabi Soneye, Professor of Geography at the University of Lagos.

“There is pressure in Nigeria cities. Too many people squeezed into small space and everything overstretched,” adds urban planner, Ugochukwu Donald.

The response

In response to this year’s floods, the government pledged $8.2 million for relief efforts as well as declaring a state of emergency in four states. NEMA set up five emergency operation centres to facilitate search and rescue operations and humanitarian support. These efforts have faced huge practical barriers in reaching flood victims, however, while they have also reportedly been undermined by poor management, bad governance and corruption.

Many also argue that such a reactive approach is insufficient in anything but the short-term. Experts say that Nigeria must proactively predict and prepare if it is to reduce the huge damage caused by floods.

Geography professor Soneye argues that the main problem is not planning but implementation. “Master plans are not Nigeria’s problem,” he says. “We have master plan documents, [but] nobody is acting on it. The disaster continues to grow.”

One area in which Nigeria has attempted to establish forward-thinking is through early warning systems. But this has not been straightforward. Nigerian meteorological agencies make predictions about potential flooding and warnings are meant to be sent to locations at risk, but the system is not always effective.

Furthermore, even when information is passed on, there are challenges associated with getting people to act accordingly. Around half of Nigeria’s population lives below the poverty line and moving households to safe areas can be complex and costly.

“It is not enough to tell people to move that the rains are coming. The early warning system needs to provide that support for such response to take place,” says Peter Nwilo, professor of surveying and geo-informatics at the University of Lagos.

Soneye suggests that many citizens are distrustful of state orders and that warning systems should work through local intelligence and community collaboration to be effective. “The people are not in the mood to believe anything that comes from the government,” he says.

Nwilo concurs. “Our warning system needs to be domesticated and localised before it works,” he says. “People are reluctant to comply with the early warning system until disaster catches up with them. Ignorance is huge and we must improve.”

Indeed, as floods continue to devastate areas of Nigeria year on year, the environmental, economic and – most importantly – the human toll is huge. The necessary actions in many cases are known, but as climate changes leads to more unpredictable and heavy rainfall, Nigeria’s flooding problems will only increase unless there is reliable forward planning, sound management and careful implementation.

“The situation is straight forward,” says urban planner Donald. “Flooding is a natural disaster. We cannot entirely rule it out. But somehow, Nigeria has failed to do the right thing: to make corrections from the past.”","Thu, 15 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://africanarguments.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nigeria-flood.jpg,"['problem', 'pours', 'water', 'seasonal', 'flooding', 'huge', 'emergency', 'management', 'floods', 'warning', 'system', 'nigeria', 'rains', 'growing', 'niger', 'nigerias']", ,flood

As of 23 October, flooding has affected 2.2 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Nigeria, Togo and the Central African Republic, and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million.

Respective National Societies, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), are working to respond to each of these disasters through different means. Some have Disaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREFs) or Emergency Appeals (EAs) launched, and others may require additional support in the future.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

In West Coast, Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Ghana have also experienced flooding throughout August-September 2020.","Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539716-Africa%20-%20Floods%20and%20multiple%20disasters%20-%20Information%20bulletin%2C%2006%20September%202020.png?itok=7OMwtMBe,"['affected', 'chad', 'sudan', 'flooding', '06', 'bulletin', '2020', 'floods', 'states', 'displaced', 'multiple', 'rains', 'information', 'niger', 'disasters', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

Thousands of people have been displaced following weeks of heavy rainfall in some central and southern states, the country's emergency response agency, NEMA said Tuesday.

Nigeria's two major rivers have burst their banks sweeping away homes in the central part of the country.

Residents steer a dugout canoe past flooded houses in Lokoja capital of Kogi State on September 14, 2018.

The agency warned the situation could worsen as water levels continue to rise in Lokoja capital of Kogi State, which lies at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers and is often one of the most affected states during the rainy season.

Five emergency operation centers have been created to coordinate search and rescue operations, while also providing humanitarian support for those displaced by the floods, Sani Datti, a spokesman for NEMA said.

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

Lagos State plans to stop being a receiver of processed rice and start processing its own Lake Rice, starting with the Kebbi State government.

Continuous heavy rainfall since July reached its peak in late September, causing severe and extensive flooding in 34 out of 36 states in Nigeria. Two major rivers, the Niger River and Benue River overflowed into the surrounding communities resulting in widespread destruction. The Nigerian government has declared a state of emergencies in nine states. The floods have affected 1.9 million people, destroyed 82,000 houses, displaced 210,000 people and devastated crops and livestock. Though flood water has receded in some communities, many people still do not have homes, businesses and farms to return to. They continue to seek refuge in schools and other public buildings where conditions are extremely poor. Fear of health outbreaks including malaria, cholera and typhoid remain high, as sanitary conditions have deteriorated especially in the temporary shelters.

Red Cross Actions

The International Red Cross has mobilized HKD 2 million from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to support the Nigerian Red Cross Society’s immediate relief activities. An emergency appeal was launched on 21 September 2018 seeking HKD 43.7 million globally targeting to assist 300,000 people for nine months in 10 states.

Since the onset of the floods the Nigerian Red Cross Society has mobilized over 2,000 volunteers and supported affected communities with evacuations, search and rescue, distribution of food and essential household items, provided first aid, psychosocial support and sensitized communities on good hygiene practices.

Hong Kong Red Cross Actions

49,49,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Nigeria: Flood of Tears, As Homes, Farmlands Get Washed Away - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009050051.html,"Floods have again hit several parts of the country, severely affecting farmlands and displacing thousands of people, especially in Kebbi State where our correspondent reports that it ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5billion, while also rendering people homeless in other states, heightening threats to food security.

Besides other factors threatening food security in Nigeria, including the seemingly intractable terrorism, banditry and killer herdsmen's onslaught which are steadily spreading across the country, harvest of farm produce might be imperiled this year and even the next as a result of flooding.

In Kebbi State for instance, 500,000 hectares was recently devastated by flood, 450,000 hectares of it being for rice farms.

This has heightened fears that by next year, majority of farmers in the state, particularly rice farmers, would be out of business.

Many farmlands visited by our correspondent were overrun by floods, just as rice farms were submerged.

A farmer, Libabatu Usman Kamba, expressed fears over imminent food scarcity, particularly as most of the farmers would not be able to mobilize for the next farming season due to the zero harvest this year.

Kamba said she cultivated over 20 hectares of rice this year at Cida Kai village in Dandi Local Government Area but lost over 16 hectares of the rice farm to flood.

She said her crop was ready for harvest and was hoping to get 40 bags of rice per hectare and 700 bags of paddy rice.

Though she could not say what she spent on the hectares submerged in the flood, she added that most farmers would not be able to go for dry season farming this year, hence the need for urgent government intervention.

""The losses recorded this year are so enormous that majority of small holder farmers would not go back for this year's dry season farming.

""The usual practice by most farmers is to re-invest what they realized from rainy season farming for dry season farming,"" she said.

Zuwaira Abubakar, another rice farmer in Argungu, said barely all rice farms in the area were submerged and that would affect farmers' capital for dry season farming. Zuwaira, who cultivated over 25 hectares of rice, said she lost all to flood, adding that she had spent over N300,000 in the farm before the flood came.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid. Many of us will be out of business if no intervention comes our way.

""Farmers don't keep money, the more we make in the business the more we open more farmlands, that is the secret of the farming business otherwise you won't last long in it,"" she said.

In Danko Wasagu Local Government Area, a farmer, Usman Umar, told Daily Trust that they did not experience massive destruction as was the case in most parts of the state, noting that only about a hectare of seven hectares of his rice farm was washed away by the flood.

Another farmer, Suleiman Bashir, who stood helplessly by his rice farm which was submerged along Dukku/Makera road in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area, appealed to the state and federal governments to come to their aid.

""I don't know what to do, I have two large rice farms and they have been completely submerged.

""We are appealing to the state and federal governments to assist us,"" he said.

The chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Sani Dododo, said farm produce worth over N5 billion was destroyed by flood.

He added that the loss recorded in rice farming could be put at 90 percent of the total value of farm produce in the state.

""Over 500,000 hectares of farmlands have been destroyed by flood, the destruction translates to over N5billion worth of farm produce.

""Rice farms constitute to about 90 percent of the farm produce destroyed,"" he said.

The National President of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Aminu Goronyo, who toured some of the affected places while in the entourage of the Kebbi State governor, described the incident as devastating.

Goronyo assured the farmers of federal government intervention because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had sent its officials to the state to assess the situation for immediate intervention.

""The CBN governor has directed RIFAN to mobilise one million farmers that can produce five million metric tonnes of rice during the dry season commencing in November for support,"" he said.

Also speaking with newsmen at Bakin Gada in Argungu Local Government Area after inspecting rice farms destroyed in some local government areas, Governor Abubakar Bagudu expressed shock over the incident, describing it as regrettable.

Thousands rendered homeless in Bauchi

Thousands of displaced people including women and children and the aged have moved into public schools, primary healthcare centres and shops while hundreds of others have relocated to neighboring Jama'are, Azare and Giade local government areas of Bauchi State for shelter.

When our correspondent visited some of the affected areas on Wednesday, dozens of families had taken refuge at various public schools including the Adamami Primary School which was still occupied by the flood.

A victim and father of 11 children, Hamisu Magaji, said three families were sharing two classes.

""One class is accommodating 42 children sleeping on school desks while the male heads of families are sleeping on tables because water has taken over the environment.

""We are staying here due to the flood which destroyed our houses, properties, food and farmlands but we leave everything to God.

""We are yet to receive support or assistance from anybody four days after the incident, life has been difficult, especially taking care of the families but we are struggling to feed them, that notwithstanding, we are appealing to the government and organizations to come to our aid,"" he said.

His daughter, 18-year-old Halima Hamisu, who cooked food for children in the camp, told Daily Trust how they managed to sleep on school desks.

""We arrange the desks laying mats on top and putting long sticks on four angles to hang mosquito nets.

""We line up between 8 and 12 children inside the net and that is how we have managed in this class for the past four days as our mothers have relocated to a nearby village because they are nursing babies,"" she said.

A woman with four children at the Government Day Secondary School camp in Adamami, Barakana Mohammed, said her six months old daughter had been infected with cold.

""I have been sleeping on the floor with my children for four days due to the flood that destroyed our house and property and the bad condition coupled with the weather affecting the children.

""Life has become difficult living in a classroom but we pray for God's intervention.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid.""

A 60-year-old woman, Aishatu Abdullahi, now taking refuge at the camp, decried the absence of essential commodities and the sanitary situation in the camp, saying, ""We don't have food in the camp because water has destroyed everything and the little our caregivers are struggling to bring to the camp is not enough as we have small children.

""I am appealing to the government and privileged individuals in the name of God to support us with food and other relief materials so as to rescue us from additional hardship.""

The village head of Adamami, Malam Isa Nalaraba, said the flood had caused a lot of destruction but, ""We thank God for saving our lives and our children because almost more than half of Adamami is destroyed by the flood which displaced many people to neighboring communities while others have become refugees in their locality while many other residents have relocated to neighboring towns and villages.

""We are appealing to the government and individuals to assist the victims with relief materials to support them and continue their lives.""

Habiba Sani who was to wed in three months and three others including a 14-year-old girl and a 60-year-old woman drowned in flood waters in Bakatma, Shira Local Government Area of the state.

Habiba's father, Malam Sani Biidis, told Daily Trust that he was away when his neighbor invited her and his daughter to accompany him to remove weeds in a rice farm beside a river that was flooded following heavy downpour.

He described the deceased as a kind hearted and obedient girl who hardly argued or disagreed with people within and outside the family.

""They met their sad end when they tried to cross the river at a point where everybody including children used to pass from the village because the area is not deep or wide but as a result of the flood the volume and speed of the water had increased, unfortunately the moment they entered the river the flow dragged them down and they could not swim out of the water.

""It was some children who witnessed the incident that rushed to inform the family that they tried to cross the river but drowned in the process.

""When they launched the search operation their corpses were found in a nearby area some meters from the point of passage.

""I was away from home when I received a phone call that my daughter and one other girl had drowned.

""Habiba's death is painful but I leave everything to God and pray for their souls,"" Bidis said.

Badamasi Shittu, the father of the 14-year-old Ziyada Badamasi, said he asked them to go to his rice farm to assist him remove weeds and apply fertilizer.

""My daughter, Ziyada, told me that they would go before I arrived to apply the fertilizer.

""When they reached the point where people cross the river, they met some children but decided to cross and when they reached the center of the river, Ziyada shouted for help as the flow pulled them down and there was no mature person around to rescue them.

""It was one of the children who rushed home and notified us that Habiba and Ziyada had drowned,"" he said.

The Acting Permanent Secretary in the State Emergency Management Agency, Habu Ningi, said the flood affected 11 villages including Adamami, Bakatma, Alkaleri, Sawi, Dirmi, dago, Shira, Yana , Bege, Bukul, Fago , Tsafi and Disina all, in Shira LGA.

Bakatma village, Adamami, Alkaleri, and Disina town and other villages in Shira Local Government Area were flooded following heavy downpour between Sunday and Monday morning, destroying over 2,600 houses and many hectares of farmlands.

A resident of Adamami, Adamu Oni Adamami, said the heavy rain started on Sunday and around 11 pm people in the town were confused because water had taken over everywhere, gushing into houses at a high speed.

""The rain continued unabated and people started running for safety, especially women and children, to higher areas.

""The rain did not stop until 6am on Monday thousands of houses collapsed and many hectares of farmlands were destroyed.""

Oni added; ""Another devastation the flood caused is destruction of food.

""Apart from losing houses majority of the victims have no food and the farmlands have been destroyed, leaving us in a big calamity now and in future because the time to cultivate new crops has passed.

""We are calling on the government, individuals and corporate organizations to come to our aid before the situation goes out of hand.""

Niger farmers count losses

Many farmlands have been wiped out in Niger State where there is wide lamentation among farmers who are appealing to the government to come to their aid.

Our correspondent gathered that entire farmlands were washed away by floods, leaving farmers with nothing to harvest.

An affected farmer, Tukura Saidu from Kuyi village, said over 40 farmers were affected in his village as yams, maize and rice planted were all wiped out, adding that it was the first time of experiencing such a huge loss to flood.

Also, fish worth over N100 million were washed away by flood at Lapai Gwari in Bosso Local Government Area of the state, it was gathered.

A fish farm according to Daily Trust findings, the major place where fish sellers get fresh fish, was greatly affected, causing a rise in the price of fish in the area as residents now have to travel elsewhere to get fish.

A fish farmer, Malam Mohammad Tukur, lamented that the devastation caused by ravaging floods in Lapai Gwari was the first of its kind and appealed to the state government to urgently assist them.

He said about 2000 fish farms had been washed away.

Another farmer, Malam Abdullahi Saidu, said customers from across Nigeria were trooping to the farm before the incident but many farmers had lost millions of naira worth of investments to floods.

The Vice Chairman of Bosso Local Government Area, Malam Saidu Zegi, said in April this year, rainstorms affected over 200 people, just as many farmers lost their farmlands.

The Director General, Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, described the incident as not only pathetic and tragic but also devastating.

Inga said they had sent a team of experts from the agency to investigate the extent of damage caused.

This according to him is to enable the state government come up with modalities of assisting victims.

He said though the state government was battling with insufficient funds occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, it would not fold its arms to allow the people suffer without any aid.

Floods hit Enugu farms

Enugu State is not left out of the massive flooding and destruction of crops. Mr. Austin Obiora has a rice farm of about 235 hectares at Ihuokpara community in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

Speaking with Daily Trust, he recalled how a heavy rainfall on August 26 caused a massive flood which affected his farm. About 16 hectares of the rice field was adversely affected.

According to him, the rice had started flowering when the flood came.

""I had to start afresh because the rice planting season was almost over.

""I started doing another ""broadcasting"" (spreading) of rice seeds in a systematic and orderly way to enable them germinate very well,"" he said.

""It costs about N250,000 to cultivate one hectare of rice field and when multiplied by 16 hectares, it will be over N4m because I have to add the cost of labour,"" Obiora said, adding: ""Therefore, I lost over N4m due to the massive and devastating flood.""

He, however, didn't feel discouraged by the huge loss because he said upon realizing that some large hectares were still there for him, the unaffected hectares represent compensation for his loss.

""We pray that it doesn't happen again in the next planting season, nobody wants to incur losses,"" he said.

Asked whether any government agency came to his aide, he said he considered it would be a waste of time and energy to approach any government body, just as he did not insure his farm in the first place.

However, Obiora said he had learnt his lesson as he has started making arrangements for insuring his farms in future.

Another farmer, an elderly Rev Dr Lambert Echetu who is into maize and cassava farming, told our correspondent that the combined misfortune of flooding and activities of herdsmen had caused a lot of havoc to his maize farm of two hectares at Amagunze in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

He said: ""The cattle and flood messed up my maize farm.

""I planted maize covering two hectares.

""I spent about N240,000 on clearing the bush, seeds and fertilizer.

""We went to the Government House, Enugu to complain about the Fulani herdsmen and their cows destroying our farms.

""The first tragedy was done to the farm by the cows.

""The second tragedy was caused by the huge flooding, even though the place is swampy.

""When I got to the Government House, they would refer me from one office to the other and it was like a wild goose chase and I left,"" he said.

Echetu further said: ""As a servant of God, when I tried to get help from people and I didn't succeed, I handed everything over to God.

""I love farming because I have passion for it.

""I prayed over the farm project before I decided to farm.

""I have a lot of people who need my help in the village.

""My intention is after harvesting the maize, and bringing it to the church, I will distribute the maize to the congregation.""

He said despite the setback, he won't give up farming and had acquired over 100 hectares of land at Ihu-Okpara community, specifically for planting cassava in the next planting season.

Kano, Jigawa farmers cry out

Last month, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) revealed that 20 of the 44 local government areas in Kano State were at high risk of flooding during this year's rainy season.

Tarauni, Garum Malam, Rimin Gado, Gaya, Gezawa, Gwale, Shanono, Gabasawa, Gwarzo, Ungoggo, Warawa, Dawakin Kudu, Dambatta, Bebeji, Kabo, Wudil, Kura, Nassarawa, Kano Municipal and Kumbotso were the local government areas identified in the report.

With the recent wave of rainfall in the state, some of the identified local governments have already begun to experience heavy flooding which resulted in the destruction of several hectares of farmlands by flood, causing loss of millions of naira worth of farm products.

According to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) in Kano, so far, hundreds of rice farmers in five local governments have reported to have been affected by the flood.

The state chapter chairman of RIFAN, Alhaji Haruna Abubakar Aliyu, said farmers in Dambatta, Makoda, Ajingi, Gaya and Rinim Gado have been seriously affected by the flooding.

""Based on the directives received from the RIFAN head office after we had sent our report on the damages caused to our various members, the head office asked us to compile a detailed report on the flood which currently we are working on.

""We have so far identified five local governments, though we are aware there are more than that but we are still working on it,"" he said.

The state chapter chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Alhaji Zubairu Ibrahim, said the association was still assessing the areas affected and number of farmers and farm lands affected.

He added that the outcome of the ongoing assessment would be made public and the association was working on measures to be adopted in assisting the affected farmers.

Attempts to contact the state commissioner for agriculture and who is also the deputy governor proved abortive but sources close to the ministry said a committee had been inaugurated by the state government to look into the issue and present its report for further action.

In Jigawa State, following a two-day heavy downpour in Birninkudu Local Government Area, several houses and farmlands were said to have been destroyed.

Alhaji Wada Faka, the chairman of the local government, said a yet-to-be ascertained number of houses and farmlands were destroyed in Malamawar Gangaran, Babaldu, Wurno, Kiyako and Samamiya villages.

NEMA had also stated that the Nigerian Hydrological Agency (NIHSA) 2020 Annual Flood Outlook already listed 12 local government areas in the state as flood-prone areas.

The NIHSA report listed Kaugama, Taura, Guri, Gwaram, Dutse, Auyo, Miga, Malam Madori, Ringim, Birniwa, Jahun and Kafin Hausa as probable flood risk areas.

Nasarawa farmers groan under flood

Many farms and farming communities were recently submerged in flood waters in Nasarawa, a state with many small, medium and large scale farms.

A farmer in Doma Local Government Area, Abu Doma, said his farm and many others were washed away in a few days.

Same goes with people residing on the bank of the River Benue along the state's boundary with Benue State.

This is the second year in a row that River Kilema in Lafia has flooded and submerged farms, houses and cemeteries among others.

An official of the State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) who prefers anonymity said it was taking measures to mitigate a possible humanitarian crisis in the state.

The agency has been urging those living in flood-prone areas to leave such places.

50,50,FL-2020-000207-NGA,A Flood of Polluting Air Conditioners Hampers Africa's Climate Efforts - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-flood-of-polluting-air-conditioners-hampers-africas-climate-efforts,"As air conditioning sales in Africa soar, many of the units imported there are old and inefficient, driving up electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. But some countries are taking action, banning the import of used air conditioners and adopting tough energy standards.

It’s early August and a dozen air conditioners are keeping Joy Obehi’s clients cool on another hot steamy day in Lagos, Nigeria. But invariably the electricity flickers off and her expensive diesel generator rumbles to life. “The power goes out pretty much every day, usually for one hour or two hours,” said Obehi, who rents out short-term meeting space and spends as much as $300 a month on diesel fuel. “[Air conditioners] use a lot of power, but our clients expect our locations to be cooler.” As African incomes rise and the number of hotter days from climate change increases, demand is exploding for air conditioners around the continent. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, more than 500,000 air conditioning units are bought each year and the number is increasing by 4 to 5 percent annually, according to a recent report. But that demand comes at a price: the plethora of energy-sapping — but inexpensive — air conditioners that are stressing already overburdened electricity grids, saddling consumers with high energy bills, contributing to more frequent outages that damage local economies, and making a significant contribution to the continent’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of used and new inefficient AC appliances are being sold in Africa every year, many of them illegally. Many are obsolete secondhand appliances imported mostly from Europe, despite international laws forbidding such activity. The appliances also contain banned ozone-depleting refrigerants that are potent contributors to climate change.

Electricity demand for air conditioners is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040.

And with cooling demand proliferating due to urbanization and hotter temperatures, Africa’s air conditioning market is poised to get bigger. Electricity demand for air conditioners and other cooling appliances is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040, from 11 terawatt-hours (TWh) to 112 terawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency. If African countries adopt stricter air conditioning efficiency standards, energy demand could be cut in half, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 million tons by 2040, according to the United Nations. Africa’s cooling challenge is part of a much larger trend. Worldwide demand for air conditioners is expected to more than triple in the next 30 years, from 1.6 billion units in 2018 to 5.6 billion units by 2050. That amounts to 10 new air conditioners being sold every second for the next three decades. Without government policies to make air conditioners cleaner and more efficient, greenhouse gas emissions from ACs and other cooling equipment will jump by a projected 90 percent by 2050 — a huge step backward in international efforts to limit global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, says a new UN report. Now, some African countries are trying to tamp down on energy-guzzling cooling. Ghana is successfully enforcing a ban on imports of used cooling appliances, including air conditioners. Rwanda approved a similar ban, along with Africa’s toughest-ever energy performance standards for new cooling appliances, both of which are set to come into effect next year. A half-dozen other countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, have minimum performance standards for new air conditioners and refrigerators. But success is still largely elusive due to weak policies and minimal enforcement. “There are not many harmonized efficiency policies at the moment in Africa, and many of them are out of date, not enforced, and not stringent,” said Patrick Blake, a policy expert at the UN’s United for Efficiency Program (U4E).

Among the countries struggling with the issue is Nigeria, Africa’s second-largest AC market behind Egypt. “Compliance with our energy standards is very, very slow,” said Etiosa Uyigue, executive director of a Nigerian environmental group, the Community Research and Development Center (CREDC), which has been pushing for more stringent mandatory energy standards and environmentally friendly refrigerants for all cooling appliances sold in the country. The stakes are enormous. Air conditioner sales are rising steadily across the continent, especially in hotter, more prosperous countries in West Africa. Morocco, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast have all seen a doubling in air conditioner imports since 2010, whether used or new units, according to government data. The United Nations projects that air conditioner stocks will hit 1.5 billion units in Africa by 2030, up from 660 million in 2015. The strains are already being felt. Nigeria’s limited power supplies, which are half the size of North Carolina’s despite having nearly 20 times more people, turn on and off every day and occasionally cause national blackouts, as happened 11 times in 2019. Hot sticky days when air conditioners are humming full throttle are the worst. “We just had two outages today,” said Uyigue, speaking in July from his home in the capital Abuja, where he uses three generators and a small solar energy system to keep the lights on. A Nigeria Energy Commission study in 2014 estimated that air conditioners account for 25 percent of total energy consumption in Abuja and 17 percent nationally. Nigeria’s annual CO2 emissions have tripled since 1990. The country’s widespread reliance on noisy, polluting diesel generators costs the economy nearly $14 billion a year, primarily in added fuel expenses. Meanwhile, Africa is tethered to an AC market dominated by high-polluting inefficient appliances.

Many air conditioners sold in Africa are low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made.

For years, many African countries have been flooded with millions of antiquated secondhand air conditioners and refrigerators imported primarily from Europe. Nigeria and other West African countries with high summer temperatures and close proximity to European shipping ports are especially popular destinations for used cooling appliances, which arrive stuffed into containers, cargo vehicles, and even used cars. The appliances are often broken and those that still work often consume two to three times more electricity than new models. “They come in branded as new, but when they’re off-loaded it’s mostly near-end-of-life e-waste,” said Leslie Adogame, executive director of SRADev, a Nigerian nonprofit environmental health research group. “They’re certainly cheaper to buy, but they use a lot more energy and don’t meet environmental standards.” A half-dozen African countries have joined a United Nations working group, launched in April, that is trying to stop these flows, many of which are unlawful. Shipping non-working electronic equipment is illegal under both the Basel Convention, an international treaty governing hazardous waste, and the European Union’s Waste Shipment Directive. New cooling appliances being sold in Africa are not much better. Recent research by the energy efficiency nonprofit CLASP and the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development (IGSD) showed that 35 percent of new room air conditioners sold in Africa’s 10 largest countries in 2018 were low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China. A quarter of the 650,000 low-efficiency units — none of which meet common efficiency standards used in developed countries — were imported from non-African countries, primarily China. The remaining three-quarters were largely imported and then assembled in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Egypt.

“Environmentally harmful dumping is occurring in Africa,” said Gabrielle Dreyfus, senior scientist at IGSD. “These kinds of markets deprive consumers of a smarter choice by flooding markets with lower-price products that cost consumers more over time.” The report also showed that 790,000 air conditioning units sold in Africa contained obsolete ozone-depleting, greenhouse gas refrigerants known as R-22, which are being phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol. Another 820,000 units contained R-410A refrigerants, a highly potent greenhouse gas with 2,000 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide. They are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol’s Kigali Amendment, beginning in 2019 in developed countries and later this decade in developing countries. Efforts to halt these damaging trade flows have been going on for years, but most have been unsuccessful, in large part simply because more and more African consumers want affordable devices to stay cool. Ghana is a noteworthy exception. Alarmed by the millions of obsolete cooling appliances that were entering the country and the widening gap between energy demand and power production, the country banned all used air conditioner and refrigerator imports in 2008. In 2013, when the government began enforcing the ban, illegal imports plummeted. Last year, new appliances, mostly from China, made up 95 percent of the market. “We succeeded in reversing the market in favor of new appliances,” said Kofi Agyarko, director of energy efficiency and climate change at the Ghana Energy Commission, who credits tough enforcement for catalyzing the shift. While new, more efficient appliances cost two to three times as much as used ones, they consume a third as much electricity, with Ghanaians saving on average $140 a year on energy bills, Agyarko said. But even if countries can effectively ban used imports, how can they limit the flood of inefficient new appliances into Africa? Rwanda thinks it has the answer. Last year, as part of a comprehensive national cooling strategy, Rwanda enacted Africa’s toughest energy standards and energy labeling for new air conditioners and other cooling appliances. The mandatory standards, which take effect next year, are modeled after guidelines developed by the UN’s United for Efficiency program. Brian Holuj, who leads the program’s work on cooling appliances, says Rwanda’s efforts are an important breakthrough. “For the first time in Africa, Rwanda will demonstrate the impact of mandatory policies, coupled with strong energy efficiency requirements and limits on global warming-damaging coolants in new products,” he said.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, AC energy demand would be cut in half from current projections.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, air conditioning energy demand would be cut in half from current projections, according to the UN. “More than two-dozen full-sized power plants could be avoided through more efficient air conditioners and refrigerators in Africa,” Holuj said. A critical step, Holuj said, is for countries to come together regionally on consistent policies, backed by enforcement, that send a strong market signal to the industry. “The key is regional alignment,” he said, citing the EU’s success in developing common requirements and energy labeling. Dreyfus, the scientist at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, echoed this point: As long as markets for cheap products are able to flourish, high-efficiency appliances will have a hard time competing. “If a manufacturer feels they have to compete for market share by selling low-efficiency obsolete equipment, we have to close the loopholes to bring the market up so that they have the right marketplace in which to sell better products,” she said. Nigeria has tried some of the approaches Ghana and Rwanda are using, but they are not working, according to CREDC’s Uyigue. Nigeria imposed an import ban on obsolete used cooling appliances in 2010, but it is not being enforced. It adopted voluntary energy performance standards and energy labels for air conditioners in 2017, but compliance is broadly lacking. Numerous obstacles are impeding progress. The first is price — a low-performing air conditioner costs only $100 to $200. The second is trade barriers such as a 20 percent duty on imported assembled air conditioners, an important source of government revenue. The third — perhaps the biggest — is the government’s unwillingness to take the tough steps necessary to force a market shift.","Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/site/GP01QLI_High_res_Nigeria_web.jpg,"['africa', 'air', 'demand', 'climate', 'hampers', 'flood', 'conditioners', 'africas', 'efforts', 'cooling', 'used', 'units', 'appliances', 'countries', 'energy', 'polluting']", ,flood
51,51,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Nigeria: 10 Things Nigerians Should Expect in 2021 - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/202101030130.html,"The year 2020 has come and gone with its challenges which include the coronavirus pandemic, banditry, kidnapping, terrorism and several other depressing episodes, and of course some spirit-lifting events. Here, Daily Trust on Sunday gives a list of what to expect this New Year.

Increased agitation for 2023

There is likely going to be increased agitation ahead of the 2023 general elections this year, and among other issues, whether or not zoning will determine who political parties decide to make their flagbearer, for the presidency.

The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) is likely to entrench its position on the subject, as its president, Alhaji Yerima Shetima, has rejected the agitation for the zoning of the number one position. Holding the same position is Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari's nephew, who said competency and not zoning should be the consideration in electing Buhari's successor.

However, people like Alhaji Shuaib Mustapha Kano, political adviser to a former governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, are likely to remain adamant on zoning the presidency to Eastern Nigeria.

Both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have debated whether or not their parties' tickets should be zoned to the North or to the South. This debate will most likely deepen this year.

Floods still in sight

Flooding has become one of the disasters that never seems to go away, and 2020 is a typical example. It happened again despite forecasts by the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and the Hydrological Services Agency (HAS) that revealed there would be massive flooding across many states from the beginning of the year. Also, donor agencies and even private firms repeatedly warned of the impending and imminent floods. The floods came and agricultural output and property worth billions were lost. It happened in Akwa Ibom State where 100 houses were destroyed and 300 persons displaced in Eket Local Government Area (LGA) in 2020, and in Borno where hundreds of shelters in Internally Displaced People's (IDP) camps were destroyed. Thousands of people were displaced and property destroyed in several parts of the country.

A report by Relief Web posted on October 19, 2020, indicated that flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara states, among others, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas.

In Kebbi State were a massive flood ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5bn and rendered people homeless, the Director of Flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umaisha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.

This is an example of promises Nigerians continue to get and there is no certainty that this will not happen again.

COVID-19 vaccine for 20m people

The Federal Government is making efforts to procure 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 to check the spread of the virus. Everything being equal, this means less than a quarter of Nigeria's over 200 million population may be vaccinated. Nigeria's Health Minister, Osagie Ehanire, who said this at a press conference in December, 2020, pointed out that health sector employees would be vaccinated first, then the vulnerable and those with chronic illnesses.

So far, Nigeria has recorded not less than 70,500 COVID-19 cases with 1,184 fatalities, and more than 65,000 patients have recovered from the disease. As of January 1, 2021, 1074 new confirmed cases and deaths were recorded. Therefore, there is a high possibility of another lockdown in 2021 to curtail the spread of the virus across states, but whether this would have a positive impact is left to be seen because there are arguably more Nigerians in slums and ghettos where families share toilet facilities and other basic amenities, and then there is the danger of a rise in criminality and rape as was the case in 2020.

Budget increase impact

President Muhammadu Buhari recently signed into law the 2021 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly. The National Assembly had on December 21, 2020, passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill with an aggregate expenditure of N13,588,027,886,175 trillion.

It comprises total Capital Supplementation of N1,060,751,051,650 and total Capital Expenditure of N4,125,149,354,222. Statutory Transfer stands at N496,528,471,273; Rrecurrent Expenditure of N5,641,970,060,680 with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 3.00 per cent.

The National Assembly also provided N3,324,380,000tn for debt servicing which would obviously serve as a drain on the country's finances.

The legislators had increased the budget estimate by N505,607,317,942 from the estimate of N13,082,420,568,233 presented to the joint sitting of the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 8, 2020. This means Nigeria would have more money to pump into vital sectors of the economy like healthcare, education and security.

Insecurity still looms

The abduction of over 300 schoolboys by gunmen in an all-boys Government Science School in Kankara, Katsina State, is probably one of the biggest highlights of insecurity in 2020. Even though the boys have been released, the incident still raises questions about Nigeria's dwindling security. Kidnappings continue to happen on the Kaduna-Abuja road, Lokoja-Abuja Expressway, the Obajana-Okene axis in Kogi State, among others. In the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, Kuje Area Council has recorded several cases of people being abducted, particularly in their homes. Terrorism in the North East and banditry in Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna states, among others, is yet to stop and there is no clear sign that 2021 is going to be different. Nigeria still has the same security chiefs from 2020 and the cost of goods and services are still on the rise.

Stiffer laws against rape, gender-based violence

In June, 2020, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, said Nigeria recorded 717 rape incidents between January and May of the same year. This was before the lockdown due to COVID-19 which saw a spike in rape cases and gender-based violence. Some states have since taken steps to tackle the issue. One of such is Kaduna, where Governor Nasir el-Rufai signed into law the amended Penal Code Law 2020 that provides for stiff penalties for rape of a child, including death, surgical castration for male convicts, and bilateral salpingectomy for female rapists.

Also, in 2019 Nigeria launched a sex offenders' register as a vital step towards tackling reported cases of sexual abuse. With these steps, there is hope for the fight against rape and gender-based violence this year as many Nigerians, especially Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), continue to call for stiffer laws.

Possible food shortage

As the activities of the terrorist group Boko Haram continue, including that of bandits and kidnappers who have been reported to have whisked or attacked people from their farms, there is a possible food shortage in sight, especially in Northern Nigeria. In addition is the effect of the 2020 flood that destroyed many farms across the country.

• Short - range forecasts up to 31 th October, marking the end of the season shows continued favorable seasonal conditions in most of the region except some localized pockets of moderate dryness. It is thus likely that the rainy season will be abnormally late particularly in the Sahel region.

• Early October, the end of the rainy season in the Sahel, West Africa has been characterized by mostly adequate and well-distributed rains: this results in average to above-average seasonal rainfall The Sahel region benefited the most from very good conditions with well above-average seasonal rains, while belowaverage rainfall spread over the southernmost part of the region across the Gulf of Guinea. The cumulative heavy rainfall recorded from mid-August to September resulted in flooding, that have affected about 760,000 people in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal with at least 111 fatalities.

• As a result of increase in rainfall since late July and wetter conditions in August and September: a pattern of strongly above-average vegetation emerged during September and October in all of the Sahel. Agricultural areas benefitted from very good seasonal conditions. Good production prospects are certain this year in the region (in biomass and crops production). As a result of good seasonal performance in mid-October water resources remain at a good level. Overall they have reached their highest level throughout the West African region.

• Across the Sahel, harvest has started for main season millet and sorghum crops in southern Mali, Burkina Faso, southern Niger, and eastern Senegal. Meanwhile favourable harvesting of main season crops reached completion in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, southern Ghana, southern Togo, Benin, and central Cameroon, while crops are still developing in Guinea, northern Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, and northern Nigeria under generally favourable conditions. Despite localized floods impacting the Sahel and drier-than-average conditions along the Gulf of Guinea countries, overall conditions are favourable except in conflict-affected northern Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, and northeast Nigeria along with the conflict and floodaffected Far North region of Cameroon.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540757-WFP-0000120139.png?itok=iitFCIc-,"['crops', 'monitor', 'situation', 'seasonal', 'region', '2020', 'west', 'season', 'floods', 'conditions', 'update', 'good', 'mali', 'southern', 'rainfall', 'sahel', 'africa', 'cameroon']", ,flood

Despite this success, the firm is also “confronted by growing support for activists’ demands to set more ambitious targets”, the newspaper adds. It notes that a separate resolution by Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This calling for Shell to set more “inspirational” targets attracted the support of 30% of shareholders, although such resolutions require 75% to pass. According to the Times, Follow This “insists that Shell’s goals are not consistent with achieving the Paris climate accord, in part because it lacks near-term targets for absolute emissions reductions”. The Guardian notes that this “significant shareholder rebellion” came on the day that the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its net-zero pathway, in which all exploration for new oil and gas fields stops this year to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It quotes Charlie Kronick, a senior climate finance adviser for Greenpeace UK, who notes that Shell’s plans would increase gas production by 20% by 2030, “contravening the advice of the IEA”. Reuters states that, under its current plans, Shell intends to increase its investment in low-carbon energy sources in the coming years, “but at least 75% of its spending will continue to go towards oil and gas”. In Bloomberg’s coverage, it says that the oil giant also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its “spill-prone operations in Nigeria”.

Meanwhile, another Guardian story reports that, in Australia, politicians and companies are being urged by campaigners to abandon plans for new coal power, gas and oil investments in light of the new IEA report. In Europe, Politico reports that the landmark report is “giving Brussels new ammunition in its war on fossil fuels”, as its conclusions support the European Commission’s efforts to discontinue EU funding for oil and gas projects. According to EurActiv, environmentalists have “warned against some of the assumptions in the scenario” developed by the IEA, notably the growing shares of biomass used for energy. The piece adds that IEA modellers have explained that their scenario assumes no overall increase in cropland use for bioenergy production, or new bioenergy crops on forested land. The Guardian reports on comments from the UK climate champion, Nigel Topping, who says he is “stubbornly optimistic” that the world will arrive at an agreement to “forge a transition to a net-zero future” at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year. (For more on the IEA’s latest report, see Carbon Brief‘s coverage.)

54,54,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Conflicting reports emerge in Nigeria over video of downed plane - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/03/conflicting-reports-emerge-in-nigeria-over-video-of-downed-plane/,"National-World

Conflicting reports have emerged in Nigeria over a video of a downed plane, after the country’s air force disputed claims from Boko Haram that its militants shot down a jet.

The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) strongly questioned the authenticity of the Boko Haram clip which purports to show fighters shooting at the military plane, eventually causing it to fall to the ground.

The NAF suggested that the crash was due to an air accident.

The video was published by the SITE Intelligence Group and is circulating across Nigerian media.

“It is evident that most parts of the video were deliberately doctored to give the false impression that the aircraft was shot down” when it was “obviously an air accident,” the NAF said in a statement posted on Facebook Friday.

The NAF rejected the seven-and-a-half-minute edited clip, calling it “false propaganda” and urging Nigerians “to ignore the contents of the videos making the rounds until all investigations as to how the aircraft crashed are completed.”

The NAF reported the plane missing on Wednesday, with two pilots on board.

A spokesperson told CNN Thursday afternoon the fighter jet had been deployed near Borno State in northeastern Nigeria to provide air support to ground troops, who were under fire from Boko Haram fighters before radar contact was lost.

“The cause of the crash as well as the whereabouts of the 2 pilots remain unknown. The pilots are Flight Lieutenant John Abolarinwa and Flight Lieutenant Ebiakpo Chapele,” the NAF said earlier Friday.

In the disputed video Boko Haram claims to have shot down the Alpha Jet.

The footage shows multiple fighters shooting into the air before a blast lights up the sky as a plane ignites into flames and falls to the ground. The video then cuts to fighters standing around what appears to be the wreckage of the jet.

It then cuts to the plane, showing “NAF 475” — the missing aircraft’s ID number. It later shows a charred body.

Separately the video then shows what appears to be a patch laying on the ground, displaying John Abolarinwa’s name.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Boko Haram has increased attacks against the Nigerian military as it tries to regain control of lost territories in pockets of the country’s northeast.

Frequent air raids by the Nigerian military have continued to rattle the insurgents — dislodging them from their hideouts.","Sat, 03 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['air', 'video', 'plane', 'conflicting', 'reports', 'boko', 'haram', 'emerge', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'shot', 'naf', 'fighters', 'downed', 'shows']", ,none

State governments in the North-central region of Nigeria are employing measures to halt the perennial flooding ravaging parts of the zone and alleviate the sufferings of the victims.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks claimed many lives, destroyed hundreds of houses and washed away farmlands and domestic animals in the sub-region.

The catastrophe compelled the governments in the zone to take steps to avert further flooding and provide succour to the affected people such as temporary shelters, food and medicines.

In Nasarawa State, Governor Abdullahi Sule ordered the immediate evacuation of persons whose houses had been submerged by flood in Nasarawa, headquarters of Nasarawa Local Government Area.

Mr Sule also directed that foodstuff, mattresses and other relief items be provided to the victims immediately.

His spokesperson, Ibrahim Addra, said the governor had visited the ancient town and sympathised with the people over the incident.

He urged the people to desist from erecting structures on waterways and stop indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the drains.

In response to the governor's directive, the Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) distributed food and non-food relief materials to over 45 communities ravaged by flood in Awe and Nasarawa local government areas of the state.

The Executive Secretary of the agency, Zakari Allumagas, said the governor gave the order during his visit to Nasarawa following the flood in the town.

Mr Allumagas said the relief materials comprised 44 trucks of 600 bags each of assorted grains and three trucks of non-food items such as building materials, children's clothing, cooking utensils and mats.

He warned against diversion of the items.

He also disclosed that over 700 households were displaced by floods in such communities as Ara, Udenyi Magaji, Ugya and Gude, Nasarawa town in Nasarawa Local Government Area, and Ribi and Gidan Soja in Awe Local Government Area.

The executive secretary said the state government was working with traditional and community leaders to come up with a directive banning approval and sale of lands near riverine areas of the state.

In Kogi, the State Commissioner for Environment, Victor Omofaiye, said many communities in some local government areas in the state had been ravaged by floods.

Mr Omofaiye said such communities included places in Kotonkarfe, Lokoja, Ajaokuta and Ibaji local government areas.

He said some victims of the disaster had already been moved to IDPs camps in Kotonkarfe, while the IDPs camps and flood estates in Lokoja were being prepared through clearing of their surroundings and fumigation for resettlement of the flood victims.

He said that the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had predicted that in 2020, about 10 local government areas would be affected by flood in Kogi.

They are Lokoja, Kogi/Kotonkarfe, Ajaokuta, Bassa, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela, Ofu, Adavi and Omala.

""The water level of River Niger is still fluctuating within the range of 10.5 to 10.7, but as at September 21, it was 10.7 compared to the 12.5 as at the same period in 2012 in Kogi.

""Flood is a menace that we experience in Kogi every year. The flood we experienced in Kogi in 2012 was massive and devastating; we do not pray for such in 2020, but we are actually on red alert,"" the commissioner said.

He attributed flooding in the state to human and natural factors.

According to him, the human factor has to do with the people's habit in managing the environment as they dump refuse on waterways and drains, thereby obstructing free flow of water.

Mr Omofaiye said that the confluence of two major rivers in Kogi: River Niger and Benue, which most times overflowed their banks, was affecting communities along the river paths, including those of other small rivers that took their sources from river Niger and Benue.

""Opening of dams, especially along River Niger, such as Lagdo Dam from Cameroon and other dams also cause flooding in Kogi due to high volume of water.

""We have done a lot of sensitisation and awareness creation to educate the general public, especially the people living in the flood prone areas in all the predicted local government areas.

""We are also partnering with the relevant stakeholders including SEMA to ensure that we are ahead of any emerging situation,"" he said.

He said he had led a team on assessment tour of some affected communities in Lokoja to ascertain the level of damage done by flood in the area and begin to tackle them head on.

The commissioner said the Governor Yahaya Bello administration would not relent in its efforts at tackling environmental challenges including flooding across the state.

He, therefore, advised the people living in the flood prone areas to relocate and move to high grounds in order not to endanger their lives as a result of floods.

The situation is similar in Plateau as the acting Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Rose Dakwar, said that floods had affected seven local government areas in the state recently.

Mrs Dakwar listed the affected local government areas as Mangu, Pankshin, Shendam, Quan Pan, Langtang South, Mikang and Wase.

She said that many farmlands, houses bridges and other valuables were destroyed by the floods in the listed areas.

""We as an emergency management agency, have already visited each of the affected local government areas in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).

""We visited and ascertained the level of damage and reported back to government.

""Government has, therefore, included the affected areas in the distribution of palliatives before the major assistance will come their way,"" she said.

Also, the NEMA Zonal Coordinator in Jos, Eugene Nyenlong, said the agency had composed jingles in local languages to educate the people on how to tackle floods if they occurred.

Mr Nyenlong also disclosed that the agency in the zone was making use of Flood Vanguards comprising youth corps members who raised alarms if flood occurred.

""We also have locals that are engaged to act in terms of response and evacuation when flood occurs,"" he said.

In Niger, not less than 500 communities have been flooded since the onset of the 2020 raining season in the state.

The Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Ahmed Inga, who disclosed this also said about 22 local government areas had so far been affected by the floods.

Mr Inga said 29 deaths were recorded during the floods, while 45,000 farmers were directly affected by the disaster.

""Farmlands and houses have been destroyed and assessment is still ongoing, "" he said.

He said Governor Abubakar Bello had directed the agency to look inward and design a better way of mitigating the situation by relocating the affected communities to safe areas.

The Governor of Niger-State, Abubakar Sani Bello [PHOTO CREDIT: Official Twitter handle of Mr Bello || @abusbello]He said that the state government had identified 13 resettlement sites in Muregi, Akere and Ketso, among others, where the affected communities were being resettled.

He said that compensations had been paid and allocation of plots to the affected communities would soon commence.

The director-general blamed the flooding partly on the situation where the state was home to three hydro-electric dams- Shiroro, Kainji and Jebba, and River Niger and River Kaduna flowing across parts of the state.

Similarly, the Benue Government has assured residents of flood prone areas of its plans to tackle the incessant flooding in communities in the state.

The State Director of Environment, Richarge Azaagee, who disclosed this, said plans were underway to address some of the flooding challenges, especially in Makurdi.

Mr Azaagee denied that the government had abandoned communities suffering from flood related challenges.

He said the government had already identified the causes of flooding in some communities/settlements and was working toward fixing them.

""The problem of erosion and flood is not just in Kaamem community alone, it cuts across many communities in Makurdi and the state at large.

NAN reports that places badly hit by flood in Makurdi are Agber village, Behind ITF Makurdi, Wurukum market, part of Judges Quarters, Low Level, Down Katsina-Ala Street, Kaamem community, Achussah village, and Nyiman village amongst others.

56,56,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Floods And Food Shortages Threaten To Push Nigeria Into A Food Crisis - The Organization for World Peace,https://theowp.org/reports/floods-and-food-shortages-threaten-to-push-nigeria-into-a-food-crisis/,"Nigeria is currently dealing with twin crises, record-breaking flooding, and a food shortage. According to Reuters, this is threatening to push Africa’s most populous country into a devastating food crisis. In 2020, Nigeria has dealt with destructive floods that have killed at least 40 and have displaced over 15,000 people. Recently, in September of 2020, intense flooding caused by heavy rainfall in northern Nigeria destroyed thousands of homes and wide areas of crops. As reported by Reuters, the flooding in northern Nigeria has destroyed 90% of the 2 million tons of rice that was expected to be harvested this Autumn. This loss is equivalent to 20% of the rice that Nigeria harvested last year.

Destruction of rice paddies is not the only food-related casualty of these floods. A shortage of maize has made it extremely difficult for chicken farmers to feed their flocks due to the price of chicken feed more than doubling. For Nigeria, rice is the staple grain, and chicken is a core protein. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many movement restrictions and financing difficulties that complicated the spring planting of many crops including maize. The combination of crop-destroying floods and an already existent maize shortage makes it look as if Nigeria is on the brink of a damaging food crisis. Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, told Reuters that “there is a real fear of having food shortages. The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Another effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is on fertilizer. After the virus’s outbreak caused a shutdown of Nigeria’s sole urea plant for two weeks, many farmers opted to skip using fertilizer on their crops, which has limited their crop yields.

Through all of this, the Nigerian government is still doing everything it can to promote domestic food production and local Nigerian farmers, but that may not be enough to sustain a country of nearly 200 million people through a looming food crisis. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that not one cent of the country’s central bank dollars would go towards food or fertilizer imports in an attempt to encourage local farmers and producers over imports. In August 2020, Nigeria took about 4,000 tons of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s strategic stocks (ECOWAS), released 30,000 tons of its own maize, and gave four companies special permission to import maize into the country, according to Reuters. The Nigerian Economic Summit Group has also called for “a complete overhaul” of agricultural policy.

In an interview with Reuters, Nigeria’s Agriculture Minister Muhammad Sabo Nanono said that “there is no question about it that there is an imminent problem with food insecurity, not only in Nigeria, but also in nations all over the world.” He is absolutely correct in that statement. According to a report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) called the Ecological Threat Register (ETR), food security is a major symptom of the ongoing climate crisis that is projected to worsen over the next several decades. By the ETR’s estimates, the global demand for food will increase by 50% by 2050. Approximately two billion people already experience moderate to severe food insecurity currently, and that number is expected to increase to 3.5 billion people by the year 2050. 822 million people currently experience undernutrition globally, leaving them at an extremely high risk of starvation. Additionally, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of food insecurity, at 52% of the population, and 18 of the 20 most food-insecure countries globally are located in the region.

What is happening in Nigeria should sound an alarm for the rest of the world. If the world continues on this trajectory, the climate crisis will only escalate in the coming years and decades. With that will come an increase in natural disasters, with flooding being the most common natural disaster to occur since 1990, according to the ETR. Flooding not only threatens people’s lives and property, but it also threatens the survival and harvestability of important crops, as seen with the current situation in Nigeria. Floods are also not the only natural disasters that will worsen with climate change, but wildfires and storm events like hurricanes will become more frequent and more damaging as well. All of these have the potential to threaten the food security of nations all over the globe. The ETR reports that 22% of countries will face catastrophic food insecurity by the year 2050, which would result in “substantial displacement of people or substantial increase in undernourishment.” That statistic shows that a food crisis like this will not be an event unique to Nigeria but could potentially threaten many other countries across the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst in worsening food security for countries around the globe. The United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) has warned that the number of people facing food insecurity could potentially double by the end of the pandemic. According to the Pullitzer Center, global shutdowns and border closures to curb the virus have caused tightened credit access to farmers, limited access to inputs for farmers, limited food transport services and food imports. Constraints like these have led to surges in food prices and limited many populations’ access to nutritious food. The effects of this can be seen in what is happening in Nigeria, and it has worsened food shortages that the country was already experiencing pre-pandemic.

The other countries of the world who have the means should take this opportunity to send humanitarian aid to Nigeria during this time in order to offset or prevent the looming food crisis. It would also be in the interest of the U.N. and other peacekeeping or human rights focused international organizations to aid Nigeria in any way that is possible so that the situation does not worsen into a debilitating crisis that could threaten millions of lives. The situation in Nigeria is of utmost urgency, so it is important that the international community acts with haste.

Furthermore, in order to take action towards preventing devastating food crises and worsening natural disasters in the future, the most important steps that nations can take is implementing aggressive climate change policies that curb emissions and aim to use cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy. This is especially true for countries who are the world’s biggest emitters and polluters, including but not limited to the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Combatting climate change will require an immense collective effort and continued inaction will only lead to more human suffering in places like Nigeria where people are already seeing the harsh effects of the climate crisis.

The impending food crisis in Nigeria is demonstrative of many issues that the world is facing. Swift action should be taken not only to aid Nigeria in combatting a destructive food crisis, but in the long run, all nations of the world should be putting progressive climate policies into effect. Growing food insecurity is a major symptom of a worsening climate, and the action should be taken now to ensure global food insecurity does not reach frightening levels in the future.","Sat, 19 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,"['farmers', 'climate', 'world', 'food', 'threaten', 'floods', 'push', 'crisis', 'nations', 'nigeria', 'insecurity', 'maize', 'countries', 'shortages']", ,flood

In September 2018, heavy rains were experienced in Nigeria which caused severe flooding in 129 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of 12 States which affected 2,321,592 people, based on the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) situation report. An estimated 722,741 people were internally displaced, and 351,236 people had immediate humanitarian needs in food; shelter; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and health.

On 17 September, the NEMA declared a state of emergency in four of the worst-affected states (Niger, Kogi, Anambra and Delta), where thousands of communities had been forced to evacuate from submerged settlements and seek refuge in temporary Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps. As the Niger River continued to flow above danger level, and additional dams were released, a state of emergency also was declared in five more states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Taraba, Kebbi and Adamawa) on 11 October 2018. The flooding situation exceeded thresholds of local capacity to respond to the people in need.

The floods resulted in rapid population displacement, destruction of shelters, extensive losses to livelihoods and the local economy, in addition to high rates of water-borne diseases among the affected population and their host communities. Internally Displaced Persons staying with host communities were particularly susceptible to cholera and other water-borne diseases due to the poor access to potable water, hygiene infrastructure and medical care in those locations. These challenges also impacted displaced people in IDP camps, who similarly lacked access to basic water and sanitation services.

Upon the request of Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), IFRC launched an Emergency Appeal in October 2018 for 5.4 million Swiss francs to support 300,000 flood-affected people in the areas of focus of shelter and non-food items, livelihoods and basic needs; health; WASH; and protection, gender and inclusion (PGI) for 9 months. The objective was to provide lifesaving and recovery interventions in 6 out of the over 18 states in Nigeria affected by flooding. The intervention focused on 6 states identified during the multi-sector needs assessment as those in most need of assistance, namely Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Niger, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The initial plan was to have the affected population supported in an IDP camp setup (schools and health facilities).

However, the flood-affected population moved out of the camps earlier than expected. The government also aimed to vacate the schools that were used to host the IDPs to be vacated to avoid the disruption of the resuming of classes in January 2019. As a result, these changes affected the geographical context of the operation as the flood-affected population dispersed to different Local Government Areas (LGAs) and villages.

The operation had to strategize to ensure planned activities were to be held in their current location. Even though all affected families returned to their communities after the acute phase, the flooding resulted in long-term impacts, including a cholera outbreak in December when IDPs returned to their communities. The devastating loss to livelihoods and trauma of displacement also created psychosocial needs within the affected population.","Mon, 06 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1493663-MDRNG025eafr.png?itok=KHVy4p40,"['states', 'communities', 'n', 'nigeria', 'plan', 'needs', 'report', 'local', 'flood', 'population', 'emergency', 'mdrng025', 'water', 'flooding', 'final', 'displaced', 'response', 'appeal', 'affected']", ,flood

ABUJA, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Death toll has risen to 18 due to the floods caused by persistent rainfall in central Nigeria, said a local official on Wednesday.

Confirming the figure to reporters, Ibrahim Inga, head of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency in Nigeria's central region, said eight more deaths were recorded recently.

On October 16, Inga had earlier confirmed 10 deaths recorded over the past two months as the floods wreaked havoc in the state.

So far, 41,959 people have been displaced due to the disaster, the official said.

The floods, as a result of a localized high-intensity rainfall accompanied by torrential winds since August, also triggered massive run-off activities in streams and rivers in the state.

""The combined effect of the micro-climate trend and severe rainfall regime upstream of rivers Niger and Kaduna increased inflow in the basin, which resulted in the spillage of the water from the three hydropower dams,"" Inga told reporters.

He said 2,714 houses have been destroyed so far by the disaster. The flood swept through 20 local government areas, with 152 communities submerged.

The floods also badly damaged, roads, bridges, culverts and other buildings, the official said.

Inga said the excess waters had inundated several hectares of farmlands and displaced some dwellers in hinterland communities.

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, which is responsible for issuing flood alerts here, had since early August issued an alert over possible flooding due to the high intensity of rainfall across the country.

The hydrological body said the flooding incidents are due to high rainfall intensity of long duration, rainstorms, blockage of drainage systems and poor urban planning resulting from the erection of structures within the floodplains and waterways.

This year, Nigeria's 36 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja, would witness different levels of flooding, the hydrological body predicted.","Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['official', 'death', 'roundup', 'nigerias', 'recorded', 'xinhua', 'rises', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'flood', 'central', 'hydrological', 'disaster', 'inga', 'flooding', '18', 'floods', 'toll', 'rivers']", ,flood

The rains and floods have so far affected 21,056 HHs across the three states (10,757 in Borno; 5,454 HHs in Adamawa; and 4,845 HHs in Yobe). Overall, this demonstrates a higher number of households affected in Adamawa State than estimated in the contingency plan, suggesting that concerted multi-sectoral efforts should be focused in Adamawa State to fill the gap between what was planned for and the reality on the ground (OCHA, 30 Aug 2019.)

61,61,FL-2020-000207-NGA,The new 'jollof wars' and why Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria for its first Africa base - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/14/the-new-jollof-wars-and-why-twitter-chose-ghana-over-nigeria-for-its-first-africa-base/,"National-World

Twitter’s announcement Monday that it will set up its first Africa base in Ghana, West Africa, has generated fierce debate among Nigerian users of the social media app, and reignited the never-ending rivalry between the two countries, known colloquially as the ‘jollof wars.’

Many Nigerians believe that Twitter’s decision is a snub to the continent’s largest economy, which is seeing rapid growth and investment in its tech scene.

According to NOI polls, 39.6 million Nigerians have a Twitter account, which is more than the entire 32 million population of Ghana.

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey capped a whirlwind tour of Africa in 2019 by pledging to move to the continent for several months in 2020.

Now it seems that his business will make that move first.

In a statement announcing the decision, Twitter described Ghana “as a champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet.”

The social media giant also cited Ghana’s hosting of the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) as another reason for moving there, saying it aligns with “its ambition to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa.”

Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said “the choice of Ghana as headquarters for Twitter’s Africa operations is EXCELLENT news,” and described it as a “beautiful partnership between Ghana and Twitter and which is critical for the dev’t of Ghana’s hugely important tech sector.”

‘No ease of doing business’

Some Nigerians blamed an “inconducive business environment” for Twitter choosing Ghana over Nigeria.

“Under @MBuhari our ease of doing business is so bad that it’s easier for terrorists to get phone lines than law-abiding residents. You can land at Ghana’s Kotoka Airport and get a SIM card at the airport. But a camel has to pass through the eye of a needle to get one in Nigeria,” said Reno Omokri via Twitter, a former presidential aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan.

Omokri was referring to the suspension of new phone lines registration because of a federal government policy to link all active SIM cards in the country to a national identity number (NIN) for security reasons.

The exercise is time consuming and the deadline has been extended multiple times, leaving new arrivals unable to obtain a local number, until at least May.

Another Twitter user, lawyer Moe Odele wrote: “One of our clients wanted to open shop in Nigeria for their West Africa office. Once we sent them a breakdown of the regulatory requirements for their industry (also tech), they hit us with ‘we will get back to you.’ We haven’t heard back since then.”

Another commenter, Onye Ajuju, said Twitter’s decision was justified and that Nigerians had a “bloated sense of entitlement.”

“It’s unbelievable seeing Nigerians throwing a tantrum because Twitter went to Ghana. The lack of awareness of how bad things are in the country, the bloated sense of entitlement, the unhinged expectations that everyone should accept Nigeria’s dysfunction…it’s incredible!” she said.

In 2019, Ghana ranked 13 places higher than Nigeria in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index.

Google,Microsoft and Huawei are among international tech giants that have expanded their operations in Ghana, targeting software developers and young creatives on the continent.

In 2018, Facebook opened its first community hub space in Africa in Nigeria’s commercial city, Lagos, while announcing plans last year to open an operational office also in Lagos, but for tech investors such as Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, there are lessons to be learned if Nigeria will continue to attract much-needed foreign investment.

“We have to think carefully about the reasons why Twitter chose Ghana — not necessarily in the context of whether we want to bring Twitter to Nigeria or not, but in the context of what it will take for us to remain a competitive destination for investors,” Aboyeji told CNN on Tuesday.

“We need to start thinking very carefully about enhancing democracy and the rule of law, freedom of speech, and most importantly, our role in enabling the Africa Free Trade Agreement. It’s not enough for us to just be a big market… We have next door to us, a very competitive neighbor, who’s doing all the right things to make itself the hub of West Africa,” he added.

‘A more productive market’

Another Nigerian tech entrepreneur and investor Bosun Tijani, told CNN that Twitter simply chose a more productive market to run its Africa operations.

“While Nigeria has a huge market that Twitter would love to target, the business environment here is quite demanding… It’s strenuous…the cost of running a business here is high. But with the AfCFTA single market agreement which Africa is signed up to, a company like Twitter can choose to set up shop in a small market like Ghana — that gives the best opportunity for it to operate — and still serve the Nigerian market,” said Tijani, who heads a tech innovation lab, CcHUB.

Nigeria is approaching the peak of its rainy season, and flooding is expected to hit 15 out of its 36 states this month. The agency has issued a red alert because of above-normal water levels on the country's two largest rivers, the Benue and the Niger.

In August, many communities along the rivers were cut off due to collapsed bridges and impassable roads. Four students were killed when a pedestrian bridge fell at a university in the northern region.

With thousands of houses and hectares of farmland and produce destroyed along with schools and shops, the economic impact of this year'sflooding is expected to be high. The country's emergency management agency is stepping in to distribute items like cement bags, blankets and hygiene products.

Peter Odjugo, a professor of geography at Nigeria's University of Benin, works with the Nigerian Meteorological Society. He has been tracking the extreme weather patterns and says the government has repeatedly failed to take preemptive measures to reduce the impact of flooding.

""What they prefer doing or what they are doing now is services after the impact, rather than preventing it from occurring,"" he said.

Odjugo suggests that the silt be removed from the rivers to increase the volume of water they can hold. He also recommends that town planners enforce regulation on where buildings are constructed, saying this is a glaring weak spot across the country.

City regulators look out for buildings being constructed near waterways. Such buildings are often marked with an X, designating an order to stop construction work.

Stella Ojeme, the director for information in the Federal Capital Territory Administration, says that even in the nation's capital ofAbuja, enforcing building codes is a challenge.

""Most of our people will go, buy white paint, paint off the stop work mark,"" she said. ""First of all, you find people [building] where they shouldn't build. You find people build on flood plains. You find some people dump their refuse in the gutter.""

Odjugo says climate change is making a real impact in Nigeria, but the government has not made the issue a priority.

Additional challenges

Additionally, the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency says its weather data collection equipment is being vandalized and stolen.

Clement Eze, the agency's director general, spoke at a workshop last month, asking the public to help stop the illegal activity, as it is hindering the agency's ability to forecast extreme weather.

""We can no longer take readings, maybe accumulated or about a week or two,"" he said. ""Or if there are no resources, it can even take more than six months before we can go back and replenish or repair and this equipment is imported from outside Nigeria.""

During Nigeria's worst flooding in 2012, the Niger River reached a record high level of 12.84 meters.

…Urges residents in coastal areas to relocate, predicts 261 days of rainfall

By Olasunkanmi Akoni

Lagos State Government, yesterday, predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with attendant flooding across the state, even as it directed residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas of the state to move upland to avert needless loss of lives and property.

Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, accompanied by Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, said this at a media briefing on the 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions, and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja.

Bello said: “The forecast for 2021 is based on the informed global consensus that el-Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, is at the cool phase, which will continue till around June and likely give to a dominant el-Nino phase till the end of 2021.

“Generally, the Seasonal Climate Prediction for Lagos State signifies that on-set dates ranged between March 17 in the earliest, and April 6, while the season-ending may range between November 20 and December 5, 2021.

READ ALSO:

“The connotation is that Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while the maximum annual rainfall amount is predicted to be 1,747mm.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Besides, he said the state government is collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NiMET, in downscaling the predictions to all stakeholders.

Also speaking, Mr. Igbokwe, stated that the government planned to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72kilometres spread across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state to checkmate flooding.

“I, therefore, urge residents to support the government to achieve a flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again been littered by residents,” Igbokwe said.

Meteorologist Luke Robinson said there could be significant rain in some areas around west central Montana.

“We are looking at some rain moving into the area starting mid week to the end of the week,” said Robinson. “This week we are looking at some pretty good soaking rains, particularly in southwest Montana and west central Montana. We will see the rivers and streams rising but right now we're not really anticipating any impacts from it.”

Robinson said the cold front will bring accompanying snow to the higher mountain areas.

“This system is moving in, it's going to be relatively cold, so we're actually looking at some accumulating snow in the mountains,” he said. “Those cooler temperatures will cut off all the hot mountain snow melt that we've had the past few days and most of the rise in the rivers and streams will be coming from mid to low level moisture coming into the area.”

Robinson said people who live in areas that usually flood in the spring may be nervous to see the river levels rising.

It could be more of just a nervous thing, right now,” he said. “We're looking at the cresting below flood stage, and that will be sometime Thursday or Friday. But right now we're not expecting any flooding at this at this point.”

By Joseph Erunke

THE Executive Director, Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE, Dr. Ganiyu Agbaje, Tuesday, said Nigeria has improved on its possession of requisite equipment’s to better forecast flood, thereby mitigating the effects.

To this end, he expressed optimism that the negative socioeconomic impacts of flooding in the country would henceforth be mitigated through effective and accurate forecast.

Agbaje, speaking at the opening ceremony of Online Regional Training on Flood Monitoring and Forecasting Modelling, in Abuja, insisted that with the latest technology in the country, it will henceforth be easier to predict flood and locate the people who are really affected, a development he noted, would make the country make informed decision to reduce the disaster associated with the flood.

But he tasked experts on accuracy in their forecast using satellite technology, saying such was necessary in order to monitor flood as well as identify its hotspot areas with a view to making a quick damage assessment.

He spoke as Nigeria joined other West African nations to adopt satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

He explained that the training was held to equip participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-hotspot areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse which is a major cause of flooding in Africa.

Hear him:“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction but more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower in Nigeria and other countries.”

According to him, the training was not to teach participants how to predict but to show them how to use additional satellite data to do their prediction better and support other methods.

He said that the technology has been on for a while around the world, adding that African leaders in collaboration with the EU initiated the training to help Africa better monitor the environment and mitigate disasters.

Agbaje said that with the data, rainfall, rivers and the environment will be better monitored, adding that in the case of Nigeria, more information on the activities of River Niger will be known using the technology.

“We need to support our rural communities on how best use flood when it occurs because at times if it coming far away from this country, you can harness the water overflowing for many other things in agriculture. In raining season, you can channel it for irrigation.

“We are feeling the economic impact of this disaster. We are looking at riverine flooding. You know our people settle along the rivers. And they have their livelihoods there; they are farmers and can’t come to towns,” he added.

The three-day training, which holds simultaneously in four other West African countries, was backed by the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) under its Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) initiative.

It was conducted by the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE.

Also speaking at the event, the GMES & Africa Programme Coordinator at the African Union Commission, Dr. Tidiane Ouattara, who joined via video conferencing, expressed joy that the activities of the CSSTE consortium was able to continue despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Emphasising the need for the constant training of young people and experts on the African continent, he described the training as a major achievement that would help Africa to build infrastructure and reduce the economic damage of flooding.

Participants at the workshop were drawn from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

In their separate goodwill messages, representatives of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said the training is aimed at building the capacity of stakeholders to better utilise satellite technology in providing accurate, timely and easily assessable information to improve the management of the environment.

FLOODS

Heavy rains have been recorded in West and Central Africa in the past weeks, including in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Senegal, leading to devastating floods that have killed dozens and displaced thousands of people. In Niger, 329,958 people had been affected by flooding with 65 deaths. About 31,960 houses have collapsed and 5,768 hectares of farmland destroyed. Maradi, Dosso, Tahoua and Niamey are the most affected regions. In 2019, at the same time, 35,384 people were affected across the country.

In northern Nigeria, thousands of homes and wide areas of crops have been destroyed in recent flooding in the states of Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi and Sokoto. More than 30 people reportedly have died. In Borno State, about 26,000 people, including IDPs, have been affected by heavy flooding across camps and communities. Borno and Adamawa states remain at risk of heavy flooding according to the Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) released by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) in June.

In Chad, some 188,915 people (37,783 households) were affected by flooding in the central and southern provinces, in the Lac and N’Djamena respectively. Large pieces of farmland are inundated with a potential impact on food security and livelihoods.

In Senegal, an emergency aid plan has been activated following exceptional rains in the capital Dakar and large part of the country that caused devastating floods on 5 September. At least four people were killed, the exact number of the people affected is yet to be determined.

Mali has also seen severe flooding that began in July. By early August, more than 13,200 people, including 5,400 internally displaced persons, were affected by floods in the country. The worst affected regions are Gao, Mopti, Ségou and Sikasso. A total of 1,160 homes have been destroyed.

In Cameroon, more than 30,000 people have been affected by floods caused by heavy rains in Far North, West, Coastal, South and South-West regions, destroying homes, washing away livestock and devastating plantations.

Heavy rainfall at the end of July caused rivers to overflow in the Far North, affecting over 5,000 people. More flooding was recently reported in the area, with over 1,500 families displaced around Maroua.

Flooding also affected the city of Douala and surrounding areas of Littoral region in the South-West after a torrential downpour on 21 August 2020.

In Ghana, roads, bridges, homes and farmland were inundated in the Northern and North East Regions due to heavy rainfall and releases from the Bagre Dam in neighbouring Burkina Faso, which began in mid-August 2020. At least eight people have lost their lives. The spillage was necessary due to a sharp increase in the water level. Several areas remain inaccessible, making assessments impossible.

In Burkina Faso, three people died in Kaya, Centre-Nord after heavy rainfall on 4 September. Earlier flooding affected the capital Ouagadougou, reportedly killing one person and damaging houses and property.

Early warning systems, contingency planning and local action can strengthen West Africa’s responses to increasingly frequent severe flooding, but more investment is needed in forecasting, panelists said in a recent webinar organized by the African Development Bank.

“We need to explore new and innovative approaches to better forecast and communicate floods and early warning information,” said Anthony Nyong, the Bank’s Director for Climate Change and Green Growth, in his opening remarks for the webinar Flood Forecasting and Early Warning in West Africa: Gaps, Innovation, and Lessons Learned.

In 2019 alone, extreme flooding caused the displacement of up to 5.1 million people in Africa, including 3.8 million from countries experiencing food insecurity. West Africa is a hotspot for extreme weather due to its long coastline, which is home to densely populated low-lying cities and economic hubs, from Lagos to Abidjan and Dakar.

This year, floods in eight West African countries affected over 750,000 people and claimed at least 100 lives. With rapid urbanization and increasing climate risks, the impact of floods in the region will likely accelerate over the next five decades.

The November 19 webinar, organized by the Bank’s Clim-Dev Africa Special Fund, brought together experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Senegal’s national meteorological agencies to provide an update on flood forecasting and early warning systems (EWS) in West Africa.

A representative for the Niger Basin Authority discussed regional collaboration on flood forecasting among its nine members. The event included a panel discussion with leading experts from the Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.

“We know that flood EWS is a crucial flood management tool, comprising key components of disaster risk knowledge, monitoring, and forecasting-as well as communication and response. Yet, little is being done to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and operationalize flood forecasts and early warning systems,” said James Kinyangi, Coordinator of the Clim-Dev Fund.

Ousmane N’diaye, Director of Senegal’s National Meteorological Agency, said that better preparedness through climate information and multi-disciplinary planning targeting vulnerable populations is crucial to saving lives and property. He emphasized the importance of early forecasting and the use of social media platforms to broadcast alerts and provide real-time weather information in local languages.

Michael Talhami of the Red Cross said acting early and anticipating risk would reduce human exposure to disaster. All too often, he said, local actors and humanitarian organizations have to work with weather and climate data that is dated, of poor quality, or non-existent. One example is the abandonment of hydrometeorological data collection in rural Mali, which has had detrimental consequences for emergency preparedness and response.

The Bank’s Institutional Support to African Climate Centers Project (ISACIP) has invested over $35 million to improve climate information services throughout Africa since 2010. As a follow-up to ISACIP, the Bank, through the Clim-Dev Fund, is investing over $27 million in regional and country operations to modernize Africa’s climate and weather infrastructure and provide high-quality and reliable data.","Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['green', 'improve', 'head', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'flood', 'growth', 'forecasting', 'west', 'early', 'warning', 'million', 'plan', 'preparedness', 'information', 'africa', 'weather']", ,flood

In 2020, flooding has affected 2.7 million people in 18 countries in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact has been particularly severe, and the number of people affected is more than double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, recent flooding have occurred in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This year 197,000 houses were reported destroyed in thirteen countries of the region. 422,000 hectares of farmland were affected by floods, which resulted in the destruction of crops and fields, threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions were already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities have led the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organizations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO has supported the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people and help communities to bounce back faster.","Thu, 24 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1549862-wca_2020_flooding_snapshot_20201218.png?itok=ipFhZmgq,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', '18', 'overview', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'floods', 'vulnerable', 'republic', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

The Lagos State Government said Sunday night that officials are mandated to arrest anyone caught dumping trash in drainage channels and canals, according to the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR).

For years, residents in the region of 16 million people have complained about garbage piled along highways and drainage canals.

""The situation is getting out of hand, passing the refuse dumps is an eyesore,"" resident Halimat Mogaji told The Guardian in December. ""Most times I try to avoid walking past the dumps because of the amount of refuse by the roadside.""

Residents told the news outlet that the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), which is responsible for collecting trash, often won't pick up waste from households that are behind on bills.

The situation led to poor sanitary conditions in the area, as canals fill with trash and standing water, the ICIR has reported.

76,76,FL-2020-000207-NGA,How a hackathon sparked resilience and innovation throughout one of the largest western African cities - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/75652,"Source(s): World Bank, the (WB)



By Robert Reid, Iguniwari Thomas Ekeu-Wei, and Zirra Banu

Ibadan is the third most populous city in Nigeria—Africa’s largest country in terms of population and economy. This city of six million also happens to be the country’s largest in terms of geographic area, but like many other cities, urbanization is largely uncontrolled, and people are exposed to disasters like floods.

We had the opportunity to experience Nigeria’s creativity and innovation in Lagos city, when the World Bank partnered with Co-Creation Hub and other players to organize a hackathon that focused on leveraging data and technology to improve accountability and service delivery in governance. People, including data and software engineers, professional and academic experts, and civil servants, came together to develop solutions for improved policy, governance and development impact.

The Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project (IUFMP) —set up to tackle the city’s urban resilience challenges—submitted datasets for the hackathon, and one of the teams that worked on the data from the project emerged as winner in February, 2020. Teams developed a geospatial visualization platform to overlay and view the datasets from the geodatabases created as part of the Ibadan city, and flood and drainage masterplans preparation, demonstrating how the government and other stakeholders can use insights from geospatial data to accelerate effective decision making in urban planning, flood risk and environmental management. With this open data, the state government can now use up-to-the-minute information to identify, manage, prevent, and prepare for flood risks, and other ensuing impacts from floods.

Building on this with support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and with the collaboration of technical initiatives from experts in Ibadan and around Oyo state, the project scaled up the use of data for flood risk management and developed an advanced geospatial visualization platform that empowers the government to seamlessly apply geospatial data in daily operations.

This innovation strengthens the capacity of the Oyo state government to manage flood risk and inform decision making in other sectors in Ibadan using data, coupled with previous capacity building efforts, gigabytes of geospatial data available and GIS innovation laboratories have been setup under the project. The labs established at the department of Urban Renewal Enforcement Monitoring and Compliance and Office of the Surveyor General under the Oyo State Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. The Project Implementation Unit has been equipped with computers, servers, printers, plotters and software needed to apply these datasets in decision making. These datasets, which are publicly available via an advanced geospatial visualization platform, now strategically inform technical decision making and engagements. This enhances urban resilience and disaster risk management, aligning strongly with the Oyo State Government’s E-governance Program and leveraging internet connectivity infrastructure provided by the government in locations where the labs are present to facilitate data exchange.

From the people to policy—students sparking innovation

In August, the University of Ibadan and the project signed a formal memorandum of understanding, to foster capacity development, knowledge exchange and promote long-term project sustainability through collaborative research, data information exchange, internship programs for students, short courses and training programs for government staff and other professionals, and all-round collaborations that bridge the academic-policy-industry gap through open data and innovation.

With the rising thirst for innovative responses to managing flood risks in Ibadan, the University of Ibadan, in collaboration with the project, GIS Konsult Limited and other partners hosted the second season of the Ibadan Geo-Hackathon completed in November with the theme, “Ibadan Urban Resilience,” leveraging the advanced geospatial visualization platform and geodatabases to deliver solutions focusing on three thematic areas: risk-informed decision making, urban resilient design, and innovative technology solutions for urban resilience. The winning submissions for the respective categories include: Smart Citi, a web-based application for automated flood-risk assessment and waste management,, and Flood Health Risk Mapper an industrial research innovation, and Fire Incidents - A Reoccurring Menace, a story on disaster resilience. The city of Ibadan has now developed two comprehensive masterplans: A Flood Risk Management and Drainage Masterplan and a City Masterplan. Both documents create a vision for resilient and sustainable urban development in the face of climate change, identifying opportunities to boost inclusive economic development, and identify and prioritize the structures most at risk of failing (bridges, culverts, drainages, dam, etc.) to strengthen the government's capacity to detect and respond more effectively to floods, and build resilience long-term. The amount of data, maps and information generated by these master plans is vast. They include spatial datasets, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) topography, high resolution aerial imagery, and outputs of urban analytics, hydrological and hydraulic modelling. By making this information accessible to the public, it becomes useful for many stakeholders, and will inform individuals, private sector, and government decision making to better manage risks and improve urban development.

Open data for innovation and entrepreneurship in development

Entrepreneurship is on the rise—and so is innovation and collaboration for the benefit of all. With data open and publicly accessible, businesses, academia and university students alike can utilize information for research and development. This innovation helps civil servants in their work as they tactically tackle disaster and urban development challenges. In turn, the increased resilience helps everyone from kindergarteners to tailors, and keeps the city’s six million people protected from preventable disaster risks. That’s the impact of open data, open governance, and effective resilience building—all together, they spark cooperation, preparedness and innovation for the benefit of everyone.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['data', 'geospatial', 'sparked', 'urban', 'ibadan', 'hackathon', 'flood', 'innovation', 'making', 'risk', 'resilience', 'cities', 'project', 'largest', 'western', 'african']", ,flood

The floods are also the worst in the state since 1988, residents and state officials told PREMIUM TIMES, amidst fears the floods could worsen Nigeria’s current food insufficiency that has led to an increase in prices of basic food like rice.

The Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) said the deaths occurred in about 19 local government areas of the state

Hadejia Emirate, with eight council areas, is the worst hit, the executive secretary of SEMA, Sani Yusuf, told PREMIUM TIMES.

Mr Yusuf said the deaths were recorded since the commencement of the current rainy season.

“These are the number of deaths so far reported to the agency since the beginning of this rainy season,” he said.

He explained that the agency, with federal government support, is doing the needful to cushion the effects of the disaster by providing emergency needs to the victims of the flood.

He added that the agency has so far distributed 30 canoes to communities affected by the flood, as well as materials to the affected communities to build embankments in order to control the water.

Worst Flood in over 30 years

Hamza Muhammad, special assistant to Governor Muhammad Badaru on community development and social inclusion, said this year’s flood is the worst since 1988 with Hadejia emirate as the worst affected area.

He listed the affected local governments as Buji, Hadejia, Ringim, Taura, Jahun, Miga, Malammadori, Auyo, Kafinhausa and Guri.

Others include Gwaram, Kiyawa, Kaugama, Birninkudu, kirikasamma, Garki and Babura.

Cause of flood

Mr Muhammad attributed the cause of the flood to an overflow of Tiga and Challawa dams in Kano State as well as effects of climate change.

He also said torrential rainfall, as earlier forecast by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, contributed to the disaster.

In an earlier report done by this newspaper, Isa Mustapha, the executive director, Exceptional Leadership and Integrity Promotion, listed the major causes of the flood as insufficient drainage channels, silted dams, weeds, trypa grass overgrowing on river channels and river beds, as well as illegal diversion and encroachment of waterways.

Other causes, according to Mr Mustapha, include lackadaisical attitude towards the desiltation of the Hadeija-Yobe Kwamadugu River basin, as well as poor coordination among stakeholders on the control of the menace of flood.

Government’s intervention

Mr Muhammad said the state government has been doing its best since January 2020 to prevent the flood including directing officials to conduct a survey in flood-prone areas of the state.

He said the government had also deployed water pumping machines to the affected communities to evacuate the flooded water.

“Where we cannot use the machines to evacuate the water, we organized self help groups in such communities and empower them with tools for embarkment,” he said.

Affected communities deny government’s intervention

Contrary to Mr Muhammad’s claims, residents of the affected communities said the government is not doing enough.

They accused the government of not providing any remedial measures to help mitigate the impact of the flood.

Mr Mustapha and some officials of SEMA, while on an assessment visit to some of the flooded areas on Monday, were mobbed by angry residents who decried the government’s negligence of the areas.

One of the vehicles conveying the officials got damaged while journalists trying to take footage of the flooded areas were also chased away by the angry residents.

Impact of Flooding on Food Production

Officials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, are already lamenting the impact of the flood on food production in Jigawa, and Nigeria, especially rice production.

Jigawa is one of the states that has benefitted most from the federal government’s Anchors Borrowers Programme to assist farmers boost rice production in the country.

Mr Muhammad, the governor’s aide, expressed the fear that the state may experience food shortage, saying that “Sixty-five per cent of Fadama farmland were washed away by the flood especially in Hadejia where much anticipated rice is expected.”

He added that grains like millet, maize and sorghum were also lost to the flood.

Officials could not give the exact number of farmlands and houses that were destroyed by the flood but said the damage is unprecedented while assessment is ongoing.

In his reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari described this year’s flood in Jigawa as ”unprecedented and devastating.”

In a statement by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, Mr Buhari, on Tuesday, sympathised with the victims of the flood while assuring them of federal government’s intervention.

He described the flood, which has reportedly destroyed over 100,000 hectares of rice farms in the state, as a setback to agriculture especially rice production which his administration has actively promoted and discouraged its importation.

The price of rice has also doubled in the past few months across Nigeria due to various reasons including the floods affecting rice-producing states like Jigawa and Kebbi.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/09/Jigawa-flood.jpg?fit=718%2C405&ssl=1,"['experiences', 'affected', 'destroyed', 'flood', 'governments', 'food', 'farms', 'dead', 'muhammad', 'communities', 'worst', 'jigawa', '40', 'officials', 'state', 'maize', 'rice']", ,flood

Participants were mainly technical operational staff from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

The training, which holds simultaneously across four other West African countries, aimed at equiping participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-prone areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model, as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

According to the Lead of the CSSTE Consortium, Dr Ganiyu Agbaje, the training was in alignment with one of the major pillars of the GMES & Africa support programme, which was capacity building, and this had led the CSSTE consortium to identify strategic training needs of its collaborating stakeholders on the MIFMASS project with the aim to train and empower them to sustain the product and service outcomes after the lifetime of the programme.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, a major cause of flooding in Africa.

“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here,’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of the Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction and more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower,” he said.

Dr. Agbaje, who also doubles as the Executive Director of the African Regional Centre for Space Science & Technology Education – English (ARCSSTE-E) in Ile-Ife, added that GMES & Africa is a joint initiative of the African Union and the European Union to harness the benefits of earth observation (satellite) data for inherent environmental challenges in Africa and their own MiFMASS project is one of the many ongoing research and development projects under the programme.

He pledged that two more training courses will be held as the consortium prepares for the conclusion of the project and the handover of its products and services to relevant agencies.

At the Official Presentation of the outlook in Abuja, the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, noted that the outlook was a fallout from the devastating effect of the 2012 flood in the country.

He said the purpose of the outlook was to present probable flood scenarios for this year and to disseminate information to all, especially in flood-prone areas and further reduce resultant effects.

He said flood is one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria with devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on flood plains for livelihoods.

He said although the flood outlook had shown that 2020 floods might not be as severe as previous years, it was important for all stakeholders to carry out an aggressive awareness campaign for preparedness.

“It is pertinent to note that the impending flooding season with COVID-19 presents a fight against two threats; on one hand, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and on the other hand, the likelihood of an active 2020 flood season.

“The 2020 flood projections will as expected vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country.

“Overall, the flood level may not be as severe as previous years, but it is a certainty that our rivers will exceed flood level and many will be inundated again this year.”

The minister said as always, flooding was associated with increased risk of infections when the displaced persons were high and polluted water sources, added that it was important for all stakeholders to prepare earnestly.

He added that part of the intervention to promote hygiene was the recently signed Executive Order 009 by the President Muhammadu Buhari aimed at ending Open Defecation by 2025.

“Many state governors have bought into this idea, the ministry declared emergency in the water and sanitation sector to encourage hand washing and put in place the National WASH Response Committee for COVID -19,” he said.

The minister also commended the efforts of NIHSA in the development of a new Flood Mobile App, saying that it would add practical value to water managers and for overall disaster risks management.

The NIHSA’s Director-General, Clement Nze, said the 2020 AFO would go beyond borders and defer all barriers to reach the needy in providing information on early flood warnings required for mitigating risks in the country.

Mr Nze noted that the need to carry out aggressive sensitisation and awareness campaigns on consistent clearing of all waterways and maintenance of dams and reservoirs to ensure free flow of water in drainages.

The D-G said the Flood Mobile App would also be used to give actual daily flood situations to everyone, especially those at the rural areas through the use of SMS services.

The new Flood Mobile App is designed to be of practical value to the Water Managers, Technical Experts, Disaster Risk Managers, Policy Makers and Flood Forecasting Community for flood prevention and for enhancing flood early warning systems in Nigeria.

The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539455-WCA%202020%20Flooding%20Snapshot_20201013.png?itok=qKkz1Zc_,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'rains', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

86,86,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Lagos flood alert: Heeding the augurs - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/lagos-flood-alert-heeding-the-augurs/,"By Kayode Ojewale

SIR: Flooding does not just suddenly happen; it is usually preceded by some occurrences hinting its imminent arrival. When the flow of rain water on its way to the drainage channels or river is impeded, then flooding occurs. Flooding is having too much water in the wrong place. The cause of flooding is mainly man-made because of our unclean environmental habits. With just few days of rains, some parts of Lagos are flooded. How will residents of these areas, especially flood-prone areas fare when the peak of rainy season which usually comes with attendant flooding eventually arrives? The omens of flooding are here with us coupled with the warnings issued by appropriate authorities; are we heeding the augurs?

What’s the end gain if the rains, meant to bless us and water our plants, turn out to damage our crops, properties and even destroy lives due to our actions and inactions? Does it appear many have forgotten the losses, pains and agony that accompanied the ravaging heavy rains which caused disasters in different parts of the country in 2012, the year of flood fury?

Of recent, it is observed that sometimes the rains no longer pre-inform or send any signal before its arrival through warnings like cloudy sky, windy atmosphere and dark clouds. Rather, it will just begin to rain suddenly without any pre-notification and it will pour heavily. That’s another indication that the rains this year would be in a different dimension.

On April 14, the Lagos State government predicted high intensity high of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello.

“…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm”.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding”, he further added.

As a way of checkmating the looming flood, the state government plans to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72 kilometers spread across all the Local Government Areas of the State.

Flood alerts and warnings are usually issued to sensitize residents and the authorities on the need to prepare. Ignoring these warnings or not heeding the flood alerts may come with deadly consequences. In order to be prepared for the predicted floods, agencies in charge of disaster management and emergencies should be ready to ensure safety of lives during the peak of the rainy season.

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lagos-flood.jpg,"['residents', 'rainy', 'warnings', 'water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'days', 'heeding', 'flow', 'lagos', 'alert', 'rains', 'state', 'areas', 'augurs']", ,flood

A total of 108 deaths and 192 injuries have been reported as of late August. Rainfall is expected to continue for the next week. Rivers and Bayelsa states are estimated to be amongst the worst affected states where water levels continue to rise. Initial assessments indicate that 13,031 homes were damaged or destroyed across all affected states as of late August. Shelter, food, NFIs and medical assistance continue to be key needs for the affected population

Crisis impact

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, widespread flooding due to ongoing rainfall has affected 441,250 people and displaced 141,400 people in Adamawa, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Delta, Edo, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Niger, Rivers, and Taraba states since late August (NEMA 24/09/2018; ERCC; 24/09/2018).

As of 24 September, flooding across 12 states and 50 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in central and southern Nigeria has caused 108 deaths and 192 injuries (NEMA 24/09/2018). Across all affected states, there is an urgent need for shelter, with around 13,000 houses damaged (NEMA 24/09/2018). The affected population has lost household and personal belongings. The floods have caused considerable damage to agricultural land across Nigeria, with 122,653 hectares of agricultural land destroyed. In addition to shelter, there is an urgent need for food, NFIs and medicine (NEMA 24/09/2018). The flooding is widespread and situation is rapidly evolving. As assessments are ongoing, the number of the affected people is expected to further increase.

Initial assessments indicate that Rivers and Bayelsa are amongst the most affected states. Water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa. As of 24 September, water levels in lower Benue state have subsided to 10m, compared to 11m on 21 September.

The Niger River at Lokoja city, Kogi state, has not receded, as it recorded water levels of 11.05m on 24 September (NEMA 24/09/2018). Light to moderate rainfall is expected to continue until early October.

Shelter: Flooding has displaced around 141,400 people across the 12 affected states, of which 80,600 people are estimated to be living with friends and family (NEMA 24/09/2018). Over 13,000 houses have been partially or totally damaged. IDPs have relocated to emergency shelters, such as LGA offices, schools, stadiums and churches.

Some of the affected population is staying in IDP camps that have been recently constructed by the Presidential Committee on Flood Relief and Rehabilitation (NEMA 21/09/2018). As assessments are ongoing, and water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa states, the amount of houses damaged, which are typically built with mud and thatch roods, is likely to increase (IFCR 23/09/2018). The affected population are in urgent need of shelter support and NFIs, such as blankets, mats, hygiene kits and kitchen sets (IFCR 23/09/2018).

Livelihood: New estimates indicate that 122,653 hectares of agricultural land have been flooded across central and southern Nigeria. Crops were destroyed before the harvesting season begins in October (NYTimes 17/08/2018). This makes the affected population more vulnerable to food insecurity, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of farmers. Flooding is also likely to affect other livelihoods, such as fishers and petty traders.

Food: There continues to be an urgent need for food assistance for IDPs across all affected states. Severe flood damage to agricultural crops means there is a risk that some communities will experience increased food insecurity throughout the harvest season. (Daily Trust 20/09/2018). There are still no reports on whether markets that have been flooded and closed. Transportation of food is likely to be severely restricted because main roads have been flooded.

Health: Since the publication of the briefing note on 21 September, 192 injuries have been reported since late August. Flood affected victims are likely to be in urgent medical care, as result of injuries and the risk of outbreaks made worse due to the extensive flooding. Health care support is particularly needed in IDP camps (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The risk that diarrhoea and cholera will spread remains high, as water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa, and have mostly not subsided in other communities.

Particularly in more populated areas, and overcrowded IDP camps where WASH facilities are inadequate, there continues to be a high concern for cholera to spread further. There have been reports of an increase in diarrhoea cases in four of the flood affected states (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of geographical information and data indicating which states are affected by the spike in diarrhoea cases. 27,927 cases of suspected cholera were reported between 1 January and 10 September countrywide (NCDC 10/09/2018). Between 1 January and 10 September, suspected cholera cases were reported in the flood affected states of Adamawa (2,002), Anambra (23), Bayelsa (no data), Benue (no data), Delta (no data), Edo (no data), Kebbi (198), Kogi (102), Kwara (no data), Niger (547), Rivers (no data), and Taraba (no data). (NCDC 10/09/2018). In Adamawa, an increase of 119 suspected cholera cases was observed between 17-23 September, most likely due to flooding facilitating the spread (Adamawa State Ministry of Health 23/09/2018)

As flooding has not receded, the escalation of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and-or West Nile fever remains a concern (WHO 2018). The Government recently confirmed that the malaria cases have increased due to the floods (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The current malaria incidence in Nigeria is 380.8/1,000 (2015) (PMI 2017). A distribution of mosquito nets for the flood affected population has been identified as a key priority (NEMA 24-09-2018 NaijaNews 18/09/2018).

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, there have been additional reports in local media sources that indicate antenatal care for pregnant women remains a key concern. This was reported in Uzanu community, Estako East LGA, Edo state and in Ogbaru, Amambra.

There is a need for psychosocial support, as flood victims have lost or been separated from their loved ones (IFCR 23/09/2018).

WASH: The displaced population is still staying in emergency shelters, such LGA offices, stadiums, schools and churches, which have inadequate sanitation facilities and are in urgent need of safe water. In most of the affected states, water sources have been contaminated by flooding (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of data on the potential amount of damaged water points.

Education: Schools continue to be used as evacuation centres across all affected states. On 18 September, primary and secondary schools were closed in Ogbaru, Southern Anambra state as a safety measure, following floods that displaced more than 1,1000 people (OCHA 24/09/2018). Considering the ongoing flooding, it is likely that many schools have been damaged by flooding (Premium Times 19/09/2018).

Protection: While there is no disaggregated data available on the amount of women and girls affected by the floods, it is likely that this group is disproportionately affected.

Women and girls that are displaced and staying in IDP camps continue to be at increased risk to gender-based violence. Overcrowding at IDP camps, with a lack of privacy and inadequate toilets and washing facilities, increases the risks and vulnerability of women and girls to gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (UNHCR 12/2017; OCHA 2016).

Impact on critical infrastructure

Since the start of the rainy season, in June, main roads have been flooded and bridges collapsed (Vanguard 15/09/2018). As water levels have not subsided and heavy rainfall is expected to continue until the beginning of October, main roads continue to be flooded across all affected states.

Power and telecommunications are affected in some of the flood-affected states. The Okpai Gas Independent Power Plant in Ndokwa East Council, Delta State, with power supply to Aso Villa, Abuja has been flooded (TheGuardian 25/09/2018). Communities in Kdokwa West and Ukwuani councils are also affected by the power cut.

Some LGA offices in affected are also likely to be impacted, as they are being used as emergency shelters for the flood affected population.","Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1171619-20180925_acaps_briefing_note_nigeria_floods_update_i_0.png?itok=EOQvdbLy,"['2018', 'data', 'likely', 'water', '26', 'flooding', 'continue', 'nema', 'flood', 'floods', 'states', 'levels', 'note', 'nigeria', 'briefing', 'affected', 'acaps']", ,flood
88,88,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Nigeria: Food Security Threatened As Floods Destroy Farms - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202009030184.html,"Fear of food crisis is heightening in Nigeria following massive floods that are ravaging crop farms in many parts of the country.

Many farmlands were reportedly destroyed by floods in Kebbi, Zamfara, Niger, Rivers, C/Rivers, Sokoto, Bauchi and some parts of Kwara State.

Rice and maize farmlands were most affected and farmers fear this could further hike the prices of the staple food in the country.

A Daily Trust market survey showed that prices of food items are already going up in the market.

In Kano, a 100kg of maize now costs N20,000, N22,000 in Benue, N24, 000 in Abuja and as high as N25,000 in Lagos State.

The same size of maize sold between N9, 000 and N11, 000 last year across the country.

Also, 100kg of local rice now costs N55,000 in Kano, N58,000 in Abuja, while prices of beans range from N22,000 to N24, 000 per 100kg depending on the market and state.

- The warnings -

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had warned that the current water level in the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin portends some level of concern for Nigeria as there could be a likelihood of river flooding in the states contiguous to River Niger.

The states, according to the Agency, are Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The Director-General of the agency, Engr. Clement Onyeaso Nze said the country through Kebbi State might be flooded beginning from September 6

Reports from Kebbi had shown that several hectares of rice farms were washed away by flood and similar incidence was also reported in some parts of Zamfara, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kwara, Cross Rivers, Rivers and Niger states.

The incident is already a source of concern for stakeholders in the food sector as they are expressing fears that if the ugly trend continues, there might be food crisis in the country.

In Kebbi State, over 500,000 hectares of farmlands were reported to have been destroyed by flood.

The Chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, Sani Dododo, who announced the incident said rice farms accounted for about 450,000 of the hectares while the remaining 50,000 were for other crops.

- Farmers narrate ordeal -

It was reported that farmers in Kebbi State lost over N5 billon to the flood.

A victim and female rice farmer in the state, Lubabatu Bunza, said she lost about 16,000 hectares to the recent flood in the state.

Also, Mallam Isa Ahman, another victim from Patigi LGA of Kwara State, said early last month, flood washed away about six hectares of his rice farm and four hectares of his maize farm.

The farmer said he obtained a loan from a commercial bank and invested on the farm, saying it would be difficult to repay the loan.

Many of the affected farmers in Kebbi and Niger states said they got their inputs from the Anchor Borrowers' Programme of the federal government and wondered how they would be able to repay the loans.

President of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Ibrahim Kabiru, said even though it would be difficult to ascertain the damages done to the farms by the flood across the country, the trend portents a great danger ahead.

He said the flood-affected rice, maize, sorghum and other crops in the affected states.

According to him, the situation was being worsened by the insecurity in the rural areas where the farms are located.

The farmers' leader had earlier warned that bandits were preventing farmers from accessing their farms, which he said was a dangerous pointer to food security.

Mr. Mathew Ajayi, a food security expert told Daily Trust on phone yesterday that already the country was nearing food crisis as this could be seen in the skyrocketing prices of food items across the country.

""It is obvious that we are approaching a serious food crisis considering the rising prices of food items across the country.

""And now look at the flood ravaging the farms' couple with the bandits chasing away farmers from their farms,"" he said.

Alhaji Muktar Umar, a farmer and local rice miller in Sabo-Wuse, Niger State, told Daily Trust on phone Wednesday that the country might experience serious rice crisis this year because of the flood incidence and security challenges threatening the farmers.

""From my experience as a farmer, I know many people go into rice farming this year but the farms are being washed away by the flood.

""Many farmers can no longer go to their farms now, most especially here in Niger State,"" he said.

- Buhari orders release of food items from reserves -

President Muhammadu Buhari said Wednesday that the flood disaster in Kebbi State had exposed the country to a major setback in the efforts to boost local food production.

Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed concerns over the heavy floods that took a number of lives, submerged thousands of hectares of farmlands and houses, destroying farm produce and personal belongings in the affected communities.

The president said: ""I am particularly sad over this incident because it is a setback to our efforts to boost local rice production as part of measures to stop food importation.

""Kebbi State is the focal point of our policy to produce rice locally as part of this administration's commitment to agricultural revival, which suffered relative neglect in favour of food importation.

""With the loss of six lives and still counting; thousands of hectares of land flooded and estimated economic losses of more than one billion naira by rice farmers in Kebbi State, we face a major setback in our efforts to boost local food production.

""This bad news couldn't have come at a worse time for our farmers and other Nigerians who looked forward to a bumper harvest this year in order to reduce the current astronomical rise in the costs of food items in the markets.""

The president, while sympathising with the bereaved families and farmers affected by the devastating floods, assured that ""we are going to work closely with the Kebbi State government in order to bring relief to the victims.""

In another statement yesterday by Shehu, Buhari expressed the concern of his administration about the sudden spiral of food prices at a time when the economy was already mired in a slowdown occasioned by the global coronavirus situation.

Buhari, however, assured Nigerians that the situation was transient.

He said his administration had already begun looking and putting in place measures to ameliorate the situation.

""While Providence has been kind to us with the rains and as such an expectation that a bumper harvest would lead to crashing of food prices and ease the burdens on the population, the government's concern is that the exploitative market behaviour by actors has significantly increased among traders in the past few years and may make any such relief a short-lived one.

""This year has indeed tested us in ways that globalisation has never been tested since the turn of the century.

""These challenges have disrupted lives and supply chains all over the world and Nigeria has not been spared.

""The effect has been deeply felt in the delays encountered in the procurement of raw materials for local production of fertilizer (damaging standing crops before harvest) and the speculative activities by a number of rice processors who are ready to pay for paddy at any price to keep their mills running non-stop.

""But of all these problems, the most worrisome is the activities of ""corrupt"" middlemen (with many of them discovered to be foreigners) and other food traders who serve as the link between farmers and consumers found to be systematically creating an artificial scarcity so that they can sell at higher prices.

""In dealing with these problems, the administration has, in line with its ease of doing business mantra, avoided imposing stockholding restrictions in order not to discourage investments in modern warehousing and cold storage.

""The president has just approved the release of food items from the strategic reserves, including 30,000 tons of maize to animal feeds producers to ease the high cost of poultry production.

""President Buhari's administration has raised some of these issues with the various food producer associations involved, particularly those of rice and other grains.

""With their cooperation, the high food prices should soon be a thing of the past.

""In addition, investments in the agro-allied sector by the private sector will significantly increase domestic production of farming inputs especially fertilizer, further crash prices, create employment and ease the pressure on our foreign reserves.

""One of these major investments is the Dangote Fertilizer plant, which is projected to come on stream by the 4th quarter of 2020,"" the president said.

- Experts suggest ways out -

The National President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Arc. Ibrahim Kabiru noted that to mitigate the effect of these calamities on the food system or food security, farmers should be encouraged to embark on full-scale dry season farming, which could lead to all-year-round farming

He advised that government should expand the nation's irrigable lands by investing more in water resources.

He also advised farmers to quickly plant alternative crops that require little time to mature in order to mitigate the crisis.

He said government at all levels could support such farmers with seeds and other inputs.

""Whereupon the time left for the rainy season cannot be sufficient for any crop, some form of compensation commensurate to the ascertained loss could be given to the affected farmers,"" he advised.

The farmer's leader urged his members to insure their farms, adding that the association is already working with National Agricultural Insurance Company (NAIC) to that all farmers insure their farms.

The women leader of the Kebbi State Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Lubabatu Usman Kamba suggested that the way out for some of the challenges was for the farmers to be provided with good knowledge of forecasting the planting season.

She said flooding has been the farmers' biggest nightmare, adding that they could only be addressed with good forecasting knowledge on when and where to plant the crops, which she said was currently lacking because of the near absence of extension service workers.","Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn05.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00540445:bd25877f5988946c2e238d58cdc5cf6e:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'niger', 'food', 'kebbi', 'security', 'floods', 'farms', 'prices', 'threatened', 'nigeria', 'destroy', 'rice', 'hectares', 'state']", ,flood

NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europe’s coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Figure 1. Departure of temperature from average for April 2021, the ninth-warmest April for the globe since record keeping began in 1880. Record-warm April temperatures were limited to parts of southern South America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, as well as small parts of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. No portion of the globe was record-cold. (Image credit: NOAA/NCEI)

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

Francis Ighorurhie, aged 38, reportedly drowned on Thursday night at Kaiama Community in Kolokuma-Opokuma Council of Bayelsa State. Two Primary school pupils also drowned along Goodnews street in Azikoro Town in Yenagoa Council of the state.

It was gathered on Friday that Fr. Francis Ighorurhie, a Missionary of St. Paul (MSP) from Delta State, was until his death the Parish Priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church, Kaiama.

A priest, who spoke anonymously, said, “this is a sad moment for us. Father was on his way back from Bomadi in Delta State when he met his untimely death. But for the flood, he could have driven his car straight to his residence instead of parking same by the road.”

“It was as he was walking on the wooden bridge part of which had been submerged that he slipped and got drowned. Those staying at his residence had to raise alarm when they saw his car by the roadside and he was nowhere to be found.

“They however became suspicious when they saw a bag containing some provision floating on the water not far from the bridge. Divers were contracted and his remains were recovered.”

x

He added that his remains had been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa.

Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State government, yesterday, in a statement, sympathised with residents of the state over the impact of the rising flood, assuring that efforts are underway to mitigate its devastating effects on the people.

The state government, during its Eight Executive Council Meeting, presided over by the Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stressed that government is aware of the difficulties being experienced as a result of the flood, which has become a perennial problem due to climate change.

Speaking on behalf of the Governor, Ewhrudjakpo appealed to Bayelsans to exercise patience with the state government over the inconveniences being experienced as a result of the ongoing expansion of the Etegwe roundabout.","Sun, 18 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekiti-flood.jpg,"['saw', 'bayelsa', 'flood', 'residence', 'st', 'catholic', 'drowned', 'drown', 'remains', 'pupils', 'council', 'state', 'priest', 'result']", ,flood

93,93,FL-2020-000207-NGA,An Inland Delta Flooded - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147692/an-inland-delta-flooded,"Drought is a perennial problem in the semi-arid Sahel region of Africa. But in 2020, in Mali and other countries in West Africa, excessive rainfall has been the problem at times. Exceptionally heavy summer rains pushed seasonal floods on the Niger River and its inland delta to destructive levels.

After intense rains fell in July and August in the Guinea Highlands and overloaded many streams and rivers, it took several weeks for flood waters to work their way through the vast inland delta in central Mali. When the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured a natural-color image on October 29, 2020, water had spread widely across the nearly flat delta, which was once a lake bottom. Standing water appears black. Many flooded areas appear green because bourgou grass, rice, and other plants grow in the shallow flood waters. For comparison, the other image shows the dry landscape in May 2020, before the rains.

In late October, floodwaters reached their peak height at Mopti, a town at the confluence of the Niger and Bani Rivers. Water levels in the delta were recorded at 670 centimeters (22 feet) on October 26 and remained at that level until November 2, according to Mali’s National Directorate of Water Resources. That tied the peak water levels from 2018, the highest since 1969.

After November 2, waters receded at Mopti even as they continued to rise at points downstream such as Akka and Diré. It typically takes water a full six months from falling in the Guinea Highlands to reach the ocean at the Niger Delta in Nigeria. People watch the timing of flooding closely because it affects when rice can be grown, when fish will be available to catch, and when pastures can be ready for grazing. Water levels were expected to be low enough in mid-December 2020 for the annual cattle crossing on the Niger River at Diafarabé. In the much anticipated event, nomadic herders drive cattle across the river toward rich grazing lands in the inland delta and are reunited with their families after months apart.

While seasonal floods are common in Mali, the severity of the floods this year caused widespread damage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 1,160 homes were destroyed by flooding.

94,94,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Reps to expand fire service operations - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/reps-to-expand-fire-service-operations/,"The House of Representatives is considering an expansion of the scope of operations of the fire service to include accidents and emergency situations in the transport sector and at construction sites in the real estate sector.



When the bill becomes law, officers of the fire service who show gallantry will be specially rewarded.



This proposal is contained in the legislation titled ‘A Bill for an Act to Repeal the Fire Service Act, Cap. F29, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and Enact the Fire and Emergency Service Bill to Provide for Additional Powers for Effective Service Delivery; and for Related Matters.’



The bill passed second reading at the plenary on Tuesday.



Sponsor of the bill, Mr Adejoro Adeogun, while leading the debate for the second reading, said the proposal was to provide for additional powers and expansion of responsibilities of the fire service



He said, “The major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed, would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency. It would also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through engagement of able bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.



“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources.”



Adeogun noted that the Fire Service Act (1963) saddled the Fire Service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies.



“This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and such other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required,” he said.



The lawmaker added, “This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.



“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”



The lawmaker listed the specific goals of the bill, saying it is to “prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters.”



He added that it would “encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by states, local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies.



“Establish the Office of the Fire and Emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the fire and emergency service.



“Empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilise resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies.



“Provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officers.”","Wed, 19 May 2021 08:43:56 GMT",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/19155231/Reps.fw_.png,"['flooding', 'service', 'construction', 'collapse', 'accidents', 'operations', 'scope', 'related', 'bill', 'reps', 'disasters', 'expand', 'emergency']", ,flood

This is as the government has warned against heavy rainfall, flooding and possible flood disasters.

While making the disclosure through a signed statement, the Honorable Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said 23 million cubic meters of water will be released in October, which is the peak of the rainfall season.

READ:

Bello explained that the release of more water from the Oyan Dam, which will be the highest so far, is due to intensive rainfall over the past few days, expected to peak in the current month.

He, therefore, enjoined all residents of Agboyi-Ketu, Owode Onirin, Isheri, Ajegunle, Agiliti, Kara, Majidun and all areas bordering the rivers and the sea in Lagos to be wary of the staggered Oyan Dam release, adding that by November, a reduced release of 11million cubic meters will be affected as the intensity of the rainfall declines.

Bello pointed out that data provided by the Nigerian Hydrological Services noted that the months of July, August, September and October would be characterized by heavy rainfall, flooding and flood disasters in most parts of the country.

READ:

Reiterating that the reminder became necessary because the projected heavy rainfall, which had increased in September, would continue with high intensity this month leading to the staggered release of water from the dam, the Commissioner disclosed that Lagos is, however, intensifying measures to minimize the effect of the heavy rainfall on lives and property.

He averred that, in continuation of the preventive efforts against flooding by the State Government, work is almost completed on all the primary and secondary channels, stating that this is in addition to the efforts of the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) that are being deployed around the State to undertake quick fixes of clogged manholes or drains manually.

Bello said, “For a coastal city like Lagos, let me remind everyone that once it rains consistently for a minimum of eight hours, we are bound to have flash floods caused by the increasing inability of effective discharge into the lagoon, which is brought about by a rise in the ocean level. This will automatically lock up all our drainages and would be unable to discharge until the water level goes down.’’

“Flash floods are not peculiar to Lagos. It is the new wave in most coastal cities around the world, including those who have adopted the best of technological advancements to curtail flooding. Lagos is at the receiving end of three types of flooding, namely Coastal, Urban and River flooding because of the peculiarity of its location.”

While urging residents to adopt an attitudinal change by not dumping refuse in drainage channels and erecting structures on drainage alignments, Bello vowed that anyone caught violating the environmental laws of the State would be punished accordingly.

The Commissioner also emphasized that all residents owe the state a duty to support the efforts of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration to ensure that heavy rainfall does not wreak havoc in any part of the metropolis.","Mon, 05 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sanwo-olu.jpg?fit=900%2C618&ssl=1,"['residents', 'release', 'water', 'flooding', 'state', 'cautions', 'flood', 'lagos', 'disaster', 'warns', 'rainfall', 'dam', 'heavy', 'oyan']", ,flood

The Director-General of FEMA, Idriss Abbas, made the call in a statement on Sunday.

He said most of the deaths recorded in the past from flood in the FCT were as a result of non-compliance to instructions and early warnings.

Mr Abbas, therefore, emphasised the need for residents to adhere to instructions and early warnings from relevant authorities.

He added that attitudinal change was the key to reducing disasters to the barest minimum in the FCT.

He disclosed that the Search and Rescue team of the agency recently discovered the body of one Garba Joseph, 43-year-old from Akoka-Edo of Edo State, after two days search from a flooded river around TradeMoore Estate, Lugbe, in Abuja

“Narrating the incident, an eye witness account (one of FEMA’s volunteer/vanguard Kenneth Chima) who captured the incident on video explained that they were four men that tried walking through the water.

“And I kept warning them to go back, three of them went back but only this man insisted on crossing, unfortunately the water overpowered him and washed him away,” he said.

He decried the increasing rate of flood in the FCT due to residents’ apathy towards the government’s directives and early warnings.

“This is also despite FEMA’s consistent sensitisations based on The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) predictions of torrential rainfall and dangers of flooding.“

He said NIHSA’s most recent predictions warned of torrential rainfall and flooding from August, adding that FEMA had carried out aggressive sensitisation to educate residents on ways to prevent the impending flood.

He said FEMA was conducting sensitisation programmes in five different indigenous languages in the FCT using different media channels.

“We recently organized a meeting with our Volunteers, Vangards and Divers from all the area Councils within the FCT to educate them on how they can sensitise their people on how to prevent disasters to minimize loss of lives and properties.

“We also embarked on community to community flood sensitisation campaigns in the FCT and mounted billboards at all the flood prone points warning off and cautioning residents from these danger areas.”

The DG, who reiterated the agency’s commitment to reducing disasters to a barest minimum in the FCT, called on residents to complement the efforts of the FCT Administration by doing the needful.

He also advised residents not to underestimate the strength of water when it was flooded.

“What we are experiencing now is flash flood, the water builds up speedily and comes unnoticed hence very dangerous,” he said.

He called on community and religious leaders to take responsibility of sensitising their subjects, especially those who are living close to flood prone areas to move to higher grounds to avoid being washed away by flood.

He said that relevant authorities have been on their toes evacuating refuse around the FCT, distilling drainages and expanding narrow water channels to enable free flow of water for a safer FCT.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos by Dallas County Police DepartmentDALLAS—After the kidnapping and killing of 4-year-old Cash Gernon in Dallas last week, neighbor Jose Alvarado checked his security cameras for any footage that might help investigators.What he found sent a chill up his spine.The video is from 10 weeks before little Cash was left dead of stab wounds on the ground. But it shows the teenager charged with abducting him, Darriynn Brown, skulking down the street, opening Alvarado’s backyard gate and peering in before quickly walking away.“It’s really scary,” Alvarado told The Daily Beast. “I have two kids, one girl and one boy, and they play basketball in the backyard.”Alvarado’s house shares a back alley with the home of Monica Sherrod, 35, who was taking care of Cash and his twin, Carter. She has said she was dating the twins’ father, Trevor Gernon, a 31-year-old construction worker, until he reportedly left town in March when a court ordered him to report to rehab.That left Sherrod to care for the boys for the next two months—unbeknownst to their mother, Melinda Seagroves, who lives in Houston.Early on the morning of May 15, a young man crept into the twins’ bedroom, lifted a still-sleeping Cash out of the toddler bed he shared with Carter, and walked out—a chilling scene captured in grainy black and white by a baby monitor.The footage, obtained by the Daily Mail, shows the intruder returning about two hours later, hovering over the bed where Carter remained in slumber, before abruptly leaving as though he was startled by something.By then, Cash was already dead.Antwainese Square, a Dallas teacher who lives in the area, was out for her morning walk around 6:45 a.m. when she saw a clump of hair on the ground she thought belonged to a dog.“I was on the phone with my mom,” Square told The Daily Beast. “As I got closer, I could see an arm and a foot and I just began crying, saying, ‘Mom, I think I'm coming up on a body.’ And I started, ‘Mommy, it’s a child! It’s a child!’ And the baby had blood all over his face. At that point, my mom told me to get off the phone with her and immediately call 911… The baby had ants all over the bottom of his feet. So I pretty much knew that he was gone.”Square said she remembers “being in denial,” and hoped Cash was actually just sleeping even though he was obviously dead. “I was just trying to put together all possible stories; there was no way in my mind that I would think somebody would do that to a kid,” she said, adding that she stayed with Cash’s body until police and paramedics arrived so no one would run over him.“One couple that was leaving out of their garage, I had to stop them to let them know that this baby was on the ground,” Square said.More than three hours later, Sherrod reported Cash missing. “The day that he was missing, I got up late and thought it was weird,” Sherrod would later tell the Daily Mail. “I was like, ‘It's 10 o'clock already, you guys.’ So I figured Cash was still in bed.” Cash Gernon was abducted out of his bed on May 15. Handout Later that day, police arrested Brown, 18, who lives with his parents about a half-mile from where Cash’s body was found, according to court documents. He was charged with kidnapping and burglary, but not murder because police said they are waiting for the result of forensic tests.Held in lieu of $1.5 million bail, Brown could not be reached for comment and does not have a lawyer listed in court records. His mother, Mimi, has told reporters that she believes her son is being framed.A tangled web of relationships, criminal records, and an unknown motive hangs over the case.Sherrod, the mother of several children, has a criminal record that includes assault and DWI. Trevor Gernon, who has an extensive rap sheet, appears to have vanished; a phone number listed under his name was disconnected. Darriynn Brown, meanwhile, is reportedly a friend of one of Sherrod’s children and had been seen playing with children in Sherrod’s care.Sherrod initially characterized any relationship she or her kids had with Brown, who attended the same high school as at least one of the boys living in her house, as minimal. She later told a reporter that Brown had visited her home two days before Cash’s murder, but she was out grocery shopping at the time.According to multiple neighbors, Brown was definitely not an unfamiliar face around the neighborhood. One told The Daily Beast the teen regularly played football and basketball with some of the kids who lived with Sherrod. Others said they had spotted Brown on their Ring security cameras hanging out in the area.Little information has emerged about Seagroves, who now has custody of Carter. Seagroves did not respond to multiple interview requests, but her mother, Connie Ward, told The Daily Beast this week: “We are not ready to give any kind of statement. My family is broken. It has been a nightmare listening and watching the news about our baby and stories being reported that are false.”Seagroves does not appear to have had any brushes with the law, but court records show both Sherrod and Gernon have records that include arrests for assaulting their own parents.In 2013, Sherrod pleaded guilty to attacking her mother, Lezlee Pinkerton. According to a criminal affidavit signed by Officer Glenn Burkheimer-Lubeck of the Harris County Constable’s Office, Sherrod “intentionally struck” Pinkerton in the head and chest with her hand and pulled her to the ground, then “cause[d] bodily injury” to Pinkerton “by stomping on [Pinkerton’s] toes with her feet.”“Complainant reports that she believes her toes are broken,” the affidavit says. Sherrod was sentenced to two years of community supervision, participation in a domestic violence treatment program, a $100 donation to a family violence center, and a $200 fine.In 2018, Gernon was arrested by deputies from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office for assaulting his father, Roger Gernon, during a dispute over a credit card bill, Texas court records show. When Roger Gernon told his son that he was going to call the police, Trevor grabbed the phone away, bloodied his dad’s arm with his fingernails, and elbowed him in the chest. Charged with misdemeanor assault and interference with an emergency telephone call, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 68 days in county jail.In addition to the assault of family members, both Sherrod and Gernon have a history of theft, fraud, and drug possession.Sherrod’s most recent arrest was for DWI; she has also pleaded guilty to identity fraud charges, meth possession, driving without a license, and misdemeanor theft.Gernon’s most recent arrest was for the possession of narcotics in 2020. He was previously charged for possession of methamphetamine in 2016. His rap sheet includes a range of other crimes.Neal Flanagan, who co-owns a corrosion-proofing business, told The Daily Beast he met Gernon in high school, then reconnected in 2016. He gave Gernon a bit of work because he was struggling. Then things went sideways.“My ex-wife and I were married at the time,” said Flanagan. “We had started having issues. She separated from me in January 2017. That’s when Trevor and her started seeing each other.”“I never did see him after,” said Flanagan. “A couple years later, he messaged me on Facebook. Like, ‘Hey buddy. How you been?’ Like nothing ever happened.""When he was sober, Gernon “was as good as you could ask for,” Neal’s father, Johnny Flanagan, said. But he added that he wasn’t surprised Gernon took off without his boys.“He's one of these guys that kind of goes whichever way the wind blows, you know, and he'll do good for several months and then do bad for several months and you know, just up and disappear,” Flanagan said.Gernon’s whereabouts are unknown. Following his indictment on felony drug possession charges last November, he failed to appear for a March 29, 2021, hearing and thus forfeited a $10,000 bond payment. There is now an open warrant out for his arrest.None of the various defense lawyers who represented Sherrod or Gernon in court agreed to speak, citing attorney-client privilege.Cash’s death has raised many questions about those responsible for him. But in the neighborhood where he spent his last months, the overriding mystery is why would someone kill a defenseless child and leave him on the street like trash. Steven Monacelli The solidly working-class Mountain Creek section of Dallas is a quiet place, bordered on one side by the 600-acre Cedar Ridge nature preserve. Houses are in decent shape, and yards are clean. On the street where Cash’s body was found, locals have been stopping at a shrine to leave toys, flowers, and other mementos.The woman who found Cash’s body, meanwhile, has been struggling with her emotions since that morning.“It's been difficult. It really has been difficult,” Square told The Daily Beast.“I have a 3-year-old and as we're dealing with this and processing this, I'm learning that I have little triggers. If I see a little boy, 4, 3, 5, I will burst out crying. It’s just a trigger for me. My own daughter is like a trigger. Sometimes she'll say something and I'll cry.“Because even though I didn't know that baby, he was just robbed of his life. So, it's been really hard. It's been really hard to just process this.

98,98,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Agency warns states contiguous to River Niger to brace up for impending flood - Guardian Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/news/agency-warns-states-contiguous-to-river-niger-to-brace-up-for-impending-flood/,"As River Niger reaches red alert

Following warning alert received from the Niger Basin Authority indicating that River Niger has reached Red alert of 6.60m the Nigerian Hydrological Service Agency has warned states contiguous to the Niger River to brace up for impending flood disaster.

The agency warned that It is expected that the flood magnitude sighted in Niamey, Niger Republic on the 23rd August 2020 would arrive Nigeria through Kebbi state on the 6th of September and flood other states contiguous to River Niger including Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa

NHSA Director General Engr Clement Nze in a press statement made available to journalists yesterday explained that he River Niger Basin which covers nine (9) countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, has Nigeria at the lowest portion of the Basin, meaning that that once the upper catchment of the Basin gets flooded, Nigeria should be prepared to experience flooding incident.

He said “As at today, the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin made up of Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso and part of Mali, have been flooded. The flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malanville (Benin Republic) have gotten to the Red Alert Zone”

Nze pointed out that Operators of Kainji and Jebba Dams have long been alerted to take appropriate measures in the operation of the reservoirs and accordingly, Kainji Dam is now spilling water at the rate of 1,000 m3/s that is 86.4 million cubic metres/day, saying this means that communities downstream Kainji and Jebba Dams could be flooded while Shiroro Dam on Kaduna River is still impounding, though there is the possibility of spilling water in the weeks ahead.

On River Benue sub-basin, the DG stated that the agency has maintained close contact with the Cameroonian authorities with regards to flood scenarios in the upper catchment of the sub-basin and Information received by NIHSA from the relevant authority in Cameroon stated that the Lagdo Dam is still impounding water.

He noted that the high intensity of rainfall during the last week of August has already saturated the soil and any rainfall of high intensity with long duration would translate into flooding in most part of the country.

He revealed that So far, Urban/Flash Flood has wrecked havocs in about 70 council areas in 20 states of the federation and the FCTof the Federation, including the FCT.

The NHSA boss recalled that the year 2020 Annual Flood Outlook predicted that some parts of at least 102 LGAs in 28 States fall within the Highly Probable Flood Risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 States of the Federation, including the FCT, fall within the Moderately Probable Flood Risk areas. The remaining 397 LGAs fall within the Low Probable Flood Risks areas.

It also warned The states that are contiguous to rivers Niger and Benue, namely: – Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa are likely to be affected by river flooding, while Coastal flooding is expected in Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, and Bayelsa States.

On account of poor drainage systems, flash and urban floods are expected to occur in major cities across the country, namely Birnin–Kebbi, Sokoto, Lokoja, Kaduna, Suleja, Gombe, Yola, Makurdi, Abuja, Lafia, Asaba, Port Harcourt, Yenagoa, Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Benin City, Oshogbo, Ado-Ekiti, Abakaliki, Awka, Nsukka.

The DG warned that the country still has many days of rainfall in the course of the year and More floods are expected in the months of August, September and October this year, in the event there is release of excess water from the Dams in other countries upstream rivers Niger and Benue this year, this will have more negative impacts on Nigeria which is located downstream other countries in the Niger Basin.

He urged that to prevent flood disaster,

blocked drainages and gutters should be cleared, river channels dredged and structures within the waterways and floodplains and flood paths pulled down.","Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-74.jpeg,"['river', 'world', 'flooding', 'flood', 'impending', 'expected', 'states', 'guardian', 'warned', 'nigeria', 'rivers', 'niger', 'contiguous', 'basin', 'warns']", ,flood
99,99,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Climate Change in Nigeria: Floods in Lagos, Abuja, Niger Delta are going to get a lot worse - Quartz Africa",https://qz.com/africa/1054825/climate-change-in-nigeria-floods-in-lagos-abuja-niger-delta-are-going-to-get-a-lot-worse/,"Earlier this year heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos, Nigeria’s economic nerve centre and one of Africa’s most populous cities. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

Pictures and videos later posted online showed dramatic and even bizarre scenes of flooding in the city, including the capture of a crocodile in the floodwater. Another video, which went viral, was one of a man kayaking in floodwater on one of the streets.

Lagos has not been alone. Suleija, a town near the capital city Abuja hundreds of kilometres away, suffered its own flooding challenge in early July. Heavy rains washed houses away and caused others to collapse, trapping occupants. Thirteen people were reported to have died.

The two primary factors of flooding in Nigeria are climate change and poor urban planning.

Some of the worst flooding in recent memory happened five years ago in March 2012 when 32 of Nigeria’s 36 states were affected, 24 severely. More than 360 people were killed and almost two million people were displaced.

The seriousness of the flooding was attributed to a combination of two events: very heavy local rainfall and the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in nearby Cameroon.

Although the degree and seriousness of flooding in Nigeria fluctuates, flooding remains a recurring phenomenon in most parts of the country. The first factor aggravating flooding is climate change, which has been shown to contribute to more extreme storms and rainfall. Another factor contributing to flooding in cities is that Nigeria has experienced rapid urban growth and planning is poor.

The problem of flooding is not peculiar to Nigeria alone. In 2007, floods affected 1.5 million people across several countries in Africa, including Uganda, Sudan, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and Niger. Alluvial flooding is common for major rivers—such as Nile, Niger, Benue, Orange, Zambezi—in Africa. Major cities in Africa are also susceptible to fluvial flooding which occurs when excessive rainfall, over an extended period of time, causes rivers to overflow.

Why Nigeria suffers

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria (1978 to 2007) suggests that rainstorms are getting more intense. The data show that there are fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed much from previous decades. This means that more rain is falling on the days that there is rain, which in turn means that rain storms in the city are getting more intense, increasing the threat of flooding.

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria suggests rainstorms are getting more intense with fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed.

In addition to more intense rain storms, the other possible cause of flooding in coastal regions is rising sea levels. Although up-to-date data on the rising sea levels in Nigeria are scarce, it’s believed that if nothing is done, this is likely to aggravate flooding in the future, particularly in coastal cities.

Areas at risk include Lagos, which is on the coast, as well as the Niger Delta region which has many low-lying towns and villages. Being on the coast also makes these places more susceptible to storm surges. While these areas are no stranger to floods, evidence suggests that floods have become increasingly common and intense in recent times.

In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the adjoining states. The changes in rainfall patterns, particularly in frequency and intensity, have meant that these events have begun to happen more frequently.

In Nigeria’s cities, the most common cause of flooding after excessive rains is poor drainage systems that can’t cope. This is called pluvial flooding. Lagos provides a good case study.

Lagos as a case study

Lagos has been urbanizing rapidly. By some estimates there will be 19 million in the city by 2050, making it the 11th most populous city in the world. It is also home to most of the country’s industrial, commercial and non-oil operations.

Urbanisation and industrialisation increase the number of roads and buildings. This in turn increases the proportion of surface area where water cannot be absorbed into the ground, leading to rapid runoff which then causes flooding during storms. And in cities that manage their infrastructure well, storm water drainage systems are built so that water can be directed to rivers efficiently and quickly.

Lagos has not kept up with its infrastructure needs. The growth and expansion of the city has been largely unregulated. The has resulted in inadequate and poor housing, the development of slum areas and inadequate water supply and waste disposal, among other problems.

What’s complicated the situation for Lagos is that many parts of the city were originally low-lying mangrove swamps and wetlands, which have been reclaimed and settled, mostly by poorer communities and more recently through concerted efforts by the government.

These low-lying areas are particularly at risk of flooding, and the situation is complicated by buildings being constructed on water ways, and bad waste dumping habits which block the drains.

Up to 70% of the population of Lagos live in slums.

What must be done

It’s clear Nigeria needs to take measures to cope with flooding. This will require both local and international interventions, and could include early warning and rapid response systems, flood data gathering and modelling, proper urban and spatial planning, flood emergency preparedness and political will.

The country can learn from others. For example, in Mumbai, India various measures have been implemented to reduce the impact of flooding. These have included an emergency control centre, automated weather stations, removal of solid waste from stormwater drains and the development of emergency response mechanisms. Nigeria must invest in these measures, and sustain them.

It had rained heavily that day in the capital city, Abuja. Trademore Estate in Lugbe, where Igwe runs a cybercafe business, was overrun by rainwater. The force of the flood pulled down the fence of Igwe’s office complex and destroyed a part of the building. In no time, the property was floating on water.

Igwe’s business was greatly affected as he lost machines and computers. It took his entire savings and the support of friends and family for him to be able to recover from the event of that day, he tells TheCable.

“I lost over two million naira worth of [electronics], my machines were all gone, my computers, everything. We didn’t expect such here,” he says.

Like Igwe, Victor Essang, a resident of Calabar, Cross River state capital, has also recorded losses to flooding.

First, his family lost a block of flats inherited from their grandparents, and later, his poultry business took a hit in 2016.

Igwe and Essang are just two of the many Nigerians who suffer the consequences of flooding that occurs yearly in different parts of the country during the rainy season.

SEVERE FLOOD PREDICTIONS

During the 2021 flood outlook presentation, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) announced that 28 states, including the FCT, will most likely experience flooding this year.

Similarly, the Nigeria Meteorological Agency, in its 2021 seasonal climate forecast, said the signals monitored by the agency in the last seven years show that things are changing on the climate front and that this year, Nigeria is expected to experience unprecedented heavy downpours.

The information is intended to alert Nigerians, government, relevant agencies and stakeholders of what is to come in order for them to prepare — prevent, mitigate and respond — for severe flooding.

Going by the alert, Igwe says he intends to raise his compound level to prevent rainwater from entering in the event of a flood.

On his part, Essang says he was already apprehensive about the severity of this year’s rainfall, even before the alert. He tells TheCable that he has relocated his belongings to a safer place.

“I have packed out my things to a safe place, I will bring them back when the rain stops. My only prayer is God will not let it bring our house down,” he says.

CLIMATE CHANGE A DRIVING FACTOR IN FLOODING

A report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) states that extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global climate change increase the likelihood of floods.

Chukwudi Njoku, a doctoral researcher on climate change at the University of Calabar, says flooding in Nigeria can be linked to both natural and human activities that influence changes in the climate.

“When there is high temperature, then there is increased possibility for evaporation – the process where water vapour is taken from the earth surface into the atmosphere — which can trigger much more rainfall,” he tells TheCable.

“The rising temperature here is a climate change feedback and when evaporation is increased, there is the possibility of more rainfall and when rainfall increases, simultaneously it could trigger flooding.”

Research by MOJ Ecology & Environmental Sciences (MOJES) has shown that human activities such as urbanisation, felling of forest trees and burning of fossil fuels, among others, lead to the emission of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.

According to the study, these activities distort the carbon cycle – the process in which carbon atoms move from the atmosphere to the earth and then back into the atmosphere. The activities also initiate climate change processes which involve a variety of changes including higher surface temperatures and changes to the hydrological cycle – the process in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and then back in form of rain.

Njoku believes that these human activities are what increases and make worse the impacts of climate change on humans and their environment.

“Such activities like urbanisation which is not properly done in a sustainable manner, for example, people building in floodplains and swampy areas which are supposed to serve as banks for water, thus reducing the ability of the environment to collect and keep excess water,” the researcher explains.

“Also, the clearing of forest areas for agriculture increases the extent of bare surfaces that would have hitherto collected runoff water and reduced the flow of water.

“These human activities are not sustainable and where they are not checked, they only go to increase the susceptibility of the people to flooding which appears to be inevitable at this time considering the increasing temperature and rainfall events.”

He advises that people living in flood-prone areas should be relocated and government should put laws in place to deter chaotic urbanisation, create more awareness about the potential increase in flooding events and their dangers, and also ensure that roads and drainages are constructed to accommodate the volume of water from the rain.

HOW IS GOVERNMENT PREPARING?

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), whose responsibility is to manage disasters, tells TheCable that the agency had information about imminent flooding since February through the seasonal climate predictions document made available by NIMET.

“Before that presentation by NIHSA, NEMA already had some information about the outlook of the rains and the consequences of the flood. So having the information, the agency had called together experts to analyse the predictions of NIMET and come out with a disaster risk management of the prediction,” says Manzo Ezekiel, public relations officer of NEMA.

“The secretary will soon convene a meeting of all the state emergency management agencies and relevant organisations that their activities or mandate have something to do with the management of floods.

“During that meeting, NEMA is going to communicate to them that this is the information we have and this information is going to cover your area of operation, what and what can you do about it. That is the next line of action that we have. That meeting will take hold very soon.”

The PRO said the zonal offices of the agency “are already on standby to take the information down to the specific communities that are at risk of flooding”.

He said the agency will ensure continuous engagement with Nigerians and create awareness at the federal, state, and local government levels to ensure that flooding does not take Nigerians by surprise.

“We are going to tell them that, this year there is a forecast of increased rainfall and this will likely interrupt your stay here,” he says.

SPEEDY MITIGATION EFFORTS NEEDED

While government agencies are still at the preparation stage, Igwe wishes they can speed up the process since the country is already in the rainy season.

He believes the annual flood events in his locality is a result of the lack of an adequate drainage system which the government had earlier promised to expand.

“I think the major cause is the drainage system. I wish the government could even rush down and do it for us today today today,” he says.

Igwe desires the speedy process because, according to him, the relief materials government agencies offer in the aftermath of flooding do not equate to the losses.

“When they were sharing their palliatives, I just refused; how can somebody lose about two point something million and you are giving him a pack of Indomie and small 5kg camping gas cylinder?” Igwe adds.","Thu, 20 May 2021 07:27:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FLOOD-PRONE-AREAS-IN-FCT1-1.png,"['information', 'water', 'process', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'arising', 'states', 'igwe', '28', 'nigeria', 'prepared', 'risk', 'agency', 'rainfall', 'matters', 'activities']", ,flood

He spoke at the public presentation of 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) tagged “Managing Flood for Sustainable Development in COVID-19 Era” organised by NIHSA, yesterday, in Abuja.

Adamu said that 302 local government areas in 36 states, including Federal Capital Territory ( FCT), would fall within moderate flood risk areas while 121 councils in 28 states would be within the highly probable risk areas.

“This year, like 2020, we will be grappling with the two threats of the COVID-19 pandemic and related hygiene challenges as well as the impending floods as predicted in the AFO. The 2021 floods levels will be higher than in the previous years but will not attain the levels of the 2012 that was devastating,” he said.

The minister also warned that states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue, including Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nassarawa and Kogi, are likely to experience river flooding.

Others are Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa states. Coastal flooding is expected to affect Rivers, Cross River, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states.

“Flash and urban floods from heavy inundation are predicted to occur in some major cities. The severity would depend on availability and adequacy of drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.”

Adamu, therefore, called on all stakeholders, including policy makers and agencies, to rise up to the challenge of impending floods and threats of COVID-19.

Director General of NIHSA, Clement Nzeh, said: “States and relevant authorities as well as farmers must take the flood outlook serious by putting in place measures to mitigated its impact.

“There is a greater awareness for this year’s outlook in terms of the level of participation and political will, looking at representation, including governors, senators and key agencies. I believe they are going to cascade this to the grassroots.”

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has identified 10 local government areas in Cross River State that fall under the probable flood risk areas in view of the Annual Flood Outlook for 2021.

The agency also identified two local government areas in the state that falls under the highly probable risk areas for 2021.

The Director-General of NEMA, Muhammadu Muhammed, said this in Ikom Local Government Area while distributing relief materials to victims of windstorm in the area.

Mr Muhammed, who was represented by Godwin Tepikor, the zonal coordinator of NEMA, South-south, urged the state government to immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities to mitigate the impact.

He mentioned the 10 local government areas to include Yakurr, Calabar Municipal, Akpabuyo, Obubra, Bakassi, Ogoja, Biase, Etung, Odukpani and Ikom.

He said the two local government areas in the state that fall under highly probable risks areas were Calabar South and Abi.

“The state should immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities so as to mitigate the impact of the predicted flood on the vulnerable local government areas,” he said.

The agency distributed relief materials to over 1,000 households affected by windstorm in four communities in Ikom local government area of Cross River.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the distribution followed the windstorm disaster that occurred on May, last year, in Ogomogom, Akorofono, Nkarasi and Abinti communities, all in Ikom Local Government Area.

The director general said the items were approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, following the recommendation from the agency as humanitarian assistance to the affected persons.

The items distributed were bags of rice, beans and garri, tomato paste, kegs of palm oil, wrappers, blankets, bundles of roofing sheets, cement, bags of nails, zinc and ceiling boards.

He urged the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the items.

In his remark, the Director General, Cross River State Emergency Management Agency, Princewill Ayim, thanked NEMA for its intervention.

The Chairman of Ikom Local Government Area, Kingsley Egumi, thanked President Buhari and NEMA for the timely response to the concerns of their people, pledging that the items would be judiciously utilised.

Mfam Akong, who responded on behalf of the beneficiaries, thanked NEMA for its assistance.

3,3,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Why Lagosians should heed flood alert | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World NewsOpinion — The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/opinion/why-lagosians-should-heed-flood-alert/,"Sir: On April 14, 2021, the Lagos State Government predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state, therefore, directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic Implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello, “…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm. It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

In downscaling the predictions of the flood alerts, the state government is therefore collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET). In addition to what the Environment and Water Resources commissioner said, the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe declared, “I…urge residents to support the government to achieve flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again being littered by residents.”

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.

4,4,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Rainy season: Fears over impending flood in the land - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/rainy-season-fears-over-impending-flood-in-the-land/,"In fact, the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, who released the prediction, warned: “…the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Jolted by the report, many residents told The Guardian that they fear for the worst, noting that they had not recovered from the devastating effects of last year’s flood.

A resident in Bello Street in Ilasamaja area of the state, Tomiwa Sulaimon, said while she would love to move to another area before the rains start, it was not financially possible for her at this time.

She recalled: “Last year when it was raining almost everyday, our street and house got flooded every other day. This street is a bit low and erosion has eaten a good part of the road and despite our little efforts to keep the flood at bay, the water always finds a way to get in. The worst part is that those refuse disposal trucks hardly come around, claiming that we owe them for several months but if they hardly come around, how do they expect to get paid? They come around only once in a blue moon and in the meantime, we have to find a way to help ourselves. I want to plead with the government to tell them to improve on their services so that people are not forced to dump refuse indiscriminately.”

A shop owner, who identified herself as Blessing Ogbe, lamented that residents in the area were responsible for the constant flooding in the area whenever it rains.

Ogbe said: “The landlords and agents are very greedy. Once they see one small space, they will construct shops on it, most times blocking the water channels in the process. At Taiwo Junction and Transformer bus stop, that place is a major water channel but go and see for yourself. They have built a row of shops there now, blocking the gutter. So, anytime rain falls, the water has nowhere to go.

“The residents themselves are always so eager to throw refuse into the gutter when it is raining or by the roadside, some of which also end up in the gutter. The roads are bad and gutters are very narrow; so the water has nowhere to go as such. This has been a recurring problem for many years now and we have been making private efforts but we need the government to step in for us now.”

An estate agent whose office is located along Okota road, Yusuf Isa, expressed fears that his office might not survive another rainy season, lamenting that floodwater finds its way into the office with the smallest rainfall.

He said: “No matter how shortly it rains, this side of Okota road leading to Jakande Gate always gets flooded. We have carried out several interventions by ourselves and would appreciate if the government can step in now. We tried to channel the flood through Akiti to connect it to the canal at Oke-Afa but there is a limit to what we can do on our own. Because of this, Okota and Akiti are usually flooded but what can we do?”

Many residents in Oke-Afa, Okota, Ibeju Lekki and Ikorodu areas of the state, who spoke with The Guardian, also recounted similar tales of woe. Lagosians who reside along flood plains of major rivers and drainage channels such as Owode, Iwaya, Makoko, Badia, Ijora, Isaalu, Pota and Shibiri, among others, could not be reached. But Bello had advised them to always be on the alert and ready to move to higher grounds when the need arises, adding that they would be duly notified at the appropriate time.

He stated that the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) of the ministry had been consistently de-silting and working on various linkages to the secondary and primary channels to enable them discharge efficiently and act as retention basins.

Bello also disclosed that the government was maintaining the long-established synergy with Ogun-Oshun River Basin Authority, which had ensured control and monitoring of the steady and systemic release of water from Oyan Dam to prevent flooding the downstream reaches.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, an engineer, also stated that the state government would dredge about 221 collector drains and 32 primary channels measuring about 72 km spread across the 20 local councils of the state to checkmate flooding.

He reiterated that EFAG would continue to de-silt various tertiary channels and manholes measuring about 100 kilometres across the state.

While restating the present administration’s resolve to find a lasting solution to flooding in the state, he called on residents to desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on the rights of way of canals, adding that it was regrettable that several of the canals recently cleaned up were being littered with refuse.

Lagos might appear on top of the situation. But the problem of flooding at the peak of the rainy season is not limited to the state alone; it is a national problem. Since 2012 when floods killed 363 people and displaced over 2.1 million others from their homes between early July and November 5, no year has passed without the natural disaster claiming lives and property worth billions of naira in the country. From Lagos to Delta, Anambra, Imo, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Osun, Taraba and Kebbi states, among others, flood wreaks havoc on homes and farms yearly with adverse effects on the economy of the country and health of citizens.

The most recent report on the natural disaster, which was released by the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Muhammadu Muhammed, in early December 2020, stated that, “the devastating impact of the 2020 flooding killed 68 people, affected 35 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 320 local councils and over 129,000 people.”

Now, the question is: With another rainy season at hand and with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) predicting that “the country is expected to have rainfall amounts from 400mm in the North to over 3000mm in the South,” what are communities and the state governments doing to avert a reoccurrence? The Guardian spoke with relevant stakeholders in Akwa Ibom, Osun, Imo, Delta and Cross River states on the issue. The stories are as follows:

Solution To Your Flood Problem Underway, A’Ibom Govt Re-assures Apprehensive Residents

From Inemesit Akpan-Nsoh, Uyo

AS the rains begin to set in, residents of flood prone areas in Akwa Ibom State have sent a Save Our Souls (SOS) message to the state government to come to their aid so as to avert the perennial flooding they have been experiencing year in year out.

In Uyo, the state capital, residents in areas like Abak Road, Atiku Abubakar, IBB Avenue, Esuene Street, Ukana Offot/adjourning streets, Atan, Use and Effiat Offot communities have appealed to the government to replicate the ‘magic’ it used to control flooding and erosion along Oron road by Nsikak Eduok and Edet Akpan Avenue in their areas.

x

The residents noted that controlling the flood in their areas would enable them to access their homes, have their properties secured and ensure that they would no longer live in fear whenever rain is about to fall.

Mr. Okon Etim of Ukana Offot street told The Guardian that the flooding on his street had for several years rendered many persons homeless.

According to him, the government had always given affected residents relief materials when their household properties were destroyed, with a pledge to find a permanent solution to the menace.

He, however, lamented that successive governments had tried to remedy the situation to no avail. Offot said the situation appears to have worsened as houses along Calabar, Port Harcourt and Esuene streets and parts of the Federal Housing Estate are no-go-area once the rains set in.

Other residents, including Mrs. Nkoyo Akpan and Augustine Effiong, among others, also called on the government to come to their aid, adding that they could not afford the money to relocate or construct another apartment at the moment.

Findings by The Guardian, which the residents acknowledged, indicated that structures in the areas were built on the right of way, thereby blocking free flow of floodwater.



Responding to the cries of residents, the state Commissioner for Environment and Petroleum Resources, Mr. Charles Udoh, said government was aware of the problem, noting that it has, in conjunction with the World Bank, awarded the contract that would address it to China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) at an estimated cost of N12 billion.

Udoh stated that the 7.2-kilomtre flood control project covers 17 communities in three local councils; namely Uyo, Nsit Ibom and Ibesikpo Asutan.

His words: “The reality is that the government cannot go everywhere to de-silt gutters. So, while the government is doing the common areas, the government is calling on residents and citizens to also embark on de-silting of gutters. Flooding sometimes comes from bad habits like dumping refuse into gutters. We are also calling on our people to desist from dumping refuse into gutters. The waste management agency of the state is embarking on massive de-silting of drains all over the state.



“This is in addition to the three major flagship projects of the ministry that talks about water collection and harvesting, erosion control project, one in Etim Umana, one in Anua and then the IBB erosion control. IBB will not be completed this rainy season, but this is the last rainy season that everybody affected on the IBB corridor will face flooding. Once that is done, the entire Atiku Abubakar, Abak road axis, Mechanic village, State Secretariat, Atan, Effiat and Use Offot communities will be evacuated.

“We will also evacuate water from Area ‘C’ Police Command. All the water will be taken to the outfall drain and also taking water at some point of Ring Road Two. But we cannot complete the entire process within this rainy season. The IBB project is 8.4 kilometres, the biggest flood control project ongoing in Nigeria now.”



We Don’t Want To Abandon Our Homes Again, Osun Residents Cry Out

From Timothy Agbor, Osogbo

Some residents in flood-prone areas in Osun State have cried out to the state government to assist them in mitigating the problem this year.

Speaking with The Guardian, residents in flood-prone areas like Rasco, Gbonmi and Gbodofon appealed to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to save them from losing their houses to flood this year.

A landlord at Gbonmi, Mr. Suraju Kamaruden, said many house owners and residents in the community always relocate to safe areas when the rainy season is at its peak, adding: “We don’t want to abandon our houses again. That is why we are begging our government to come to our aid and help us.”

x

A trader at Rasco area in Osogbo, Mr. Jude Okpara, said traders in the area face difficult times during rainy season as flood always submerges their shops.

“We don’t have any other place to go. If not, we would have left this area. Although the government expanded the waterways about three years ago, the water still overflows its boundaries and submerges our shops. We are tired,” he lamented.

Chairman of Olorunwa Sawmill in Oke-Baale community, Osogbo, Mr. Sunday Ajewole, said there was an urgent need for government to construct a bigger drainage channel that would accommodate much floodwater when the rain is at its peak.

He said: “For the past seven years, we have been battling with flood. Every time we are in the rainy season, we always lose our planks to flood. Our government would always clear and expand the waterways every year but we are still battling flood. Most times when government fails to do something and we are approaching rainy season, we hire some labourers to help us clear the waterways. Sometimes we contribute between N80,000 to N100,000 and give to the dredgers. Still, we are not safe.

“We have discovered that the problem is that we have only one ring that forms the bridge of the waterways. And the ring is very small. The water that gushes from Ona-Baba-Ona area and Arogunmosa community would divert at our area and the ring doesn’t have the capacity to make it flow, as it should. It usually bounces back to where we stay, sweep our goods away and even sack residents out of their homes.

“This year, to lessen the severity of the flood, the government has cleared the waterways for us but once it rains heavily, there will be flood. Until the bridge is re-constructed and a bigger ring is fixed, we may not be out of this flood problem. We don’t have the financial strength to construct a bigger bridge and that’s why we are appealing to government to come to our aid.

“We have lost millions of naira worth of goods and property to flood in this area. We are afraid that if nothing is done again this year, property or even lives may be lost to flood because we have started seeing signs that it will rain heavily this year.”

To prevent a reoccurrence of flood in the state this year, the Osun State Waste Management Agency said it has been sensitising members of the public on the need to desist from dumping refuse on floodwater channels.

T

he General Manager of the agency, Mr. Fatai Oyewole, told The Guardian in Osogbo that efforts were ongoing to rid major gutters of refuse.

“We have been mobilising people not to dump refuse on waterways and major gutters,” he said. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment has disclosed that it opened up some streams across the state during the dry season for easy flow of water. This, according to the coordinator of the ministry’s Department of Flood Control, Samorudeen Odesanmi, an engineer, was part of the state government’s efforts at preventing another incident of flooding in the state.

“This government is proactive. Before the advent of this rainy season, we optimised the opportunity of the dry season to open up series of streams across the state for easy flow of water. If at all we are going to do anything on flood control, it would be minimal.

“We have already marked off some areas we want to work on this year and they are waiting for governor’s approval. Much had been done before now and we are on top of the situation,” he said.

Imo Commences De-silting Of Drainages, Vows To Demolish Houses Built On Waterways

From Charles Ogugbuaja, Owerri

AS this year’s rainy season gradually sets in, residents in Imo State and the state government have commenced preparations to mitigate the likely effect of flooding.

x

The flood-prone local councils in the state are the riverine areas of Oguta, Ohaji/Egbema and Orsu, among others. The locals in these communities began to experience massive flooding since 2012, which has resulted in loss of lives and destruction of their property. The flood, which occurs at the peak of every rainy season, had forced many residents to abandon their homes and relocate to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), where both the state and national emergency management agencies lent them helping hands.

A resident in Oguta, Jude Igwe, who called for quick intervention by the government, told The Guardian that he would not want a repeat of his past experiences this year, likewise other members of his family. He said: “Since 2012, almost on a yearly basis, we living in riverine areas have been witnessing flooding. It is not something to behold. Now that the rains are setting in, we appeal to the state government to prepare and assist us in time. Some of us are poor. We shall be relocated to camps as usual. So, we are calling for early preparation in case such occurs.”

Also, an indigene of Orsu, who identified himself simply as Okechukwu, recounted how his family lost valuable property in previous years and called for help.

“I am not ready to allow flood engulf us again. We are preparing ahead of time. But government and good spirited individuals should please come to our assistance ahead of time. We also want government to build gutters that will channel water to the rivers,” he said.

A community leader in Ohaji, Saturday Ochia, however, urged residents to desist from blocking waterways with refuse. He said: “We want our people to adhere to the simple environment-friendly rule of clearing the waterways. We do not want to witness flooding this year in our community. We are educating our people.”

Speaking with The Guardian, the Commissioner for Environment, Dr. Ikechukwu Njoku, said the state government was not leaving anything to chances, adding that it has commenced public enlightenment on appropriate waste disposal and clearing of drainages by holding town hall meetings with the monarchs, local government officials, community leaders and residents. He also disclosed that the ministry has commenced de-silting of drainages in Owerri, the state capital.

According to Njoku, the government has marked structures built on waterways for demolition, stressing that they were constructed in contravention of the state’s master plan.

He also gave assurance that the government has put a robust plan in place to ensure flood-free environment in the state capital and other communities, stressing that the Governor, Hope Uzodimma, would ensure the construction of standard drainage systems in the state.

Delta Is Already Prepared To Tackle Flooding, Commissioner Says

From Monday Osayande, Asaba

DELTA State government has declared that it was fully prepared to mitigate the impact of flood in coastal areas of the state this year.

The Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Christ Onogba, made the declaration in an interview with The Guardian in Asaba. Onogba noted that the state did not have to wait for NIMET or other agencies’ prediction on the effect of flood before putting things right.

“Firstly, we keep on saying to everyone that we are in the era of climate change, so those communities living in the coastal line should find alternative homes before the rains set in,” he noted.

According to the commissioner, it was necessary for flood victims to have alternative abode because government was no longer ready to build camps for those that might be displaced by flood due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We cannot set up camps as it used to be, but that doesn’t mean we are sleeping. In fact, we have done a lot. We are resetting the drains, and very shortly, we will open one of the channels that is flowing into the River Niger, and good enough, the road side drain in Asaba is clean and working fine.

“The government is prepared and we will never be taken unaware in the issue of flood. And because we understand that because of climate change, flooding is something that must happen, we will not wait for any prediction before we start making our preparations,” he emphasised.

A resident in Ndokwa East council, Mr. Emma Agboma, lamented that several homes had collapsed in the area in the past as a result of flooding.

“I think now that we are approaching rainy season, government should exercise its power early so that we are not taken unaware. They should be alert so that they can relocate some of us to upland. Many are willing to leave their houses but it is not easy to relocate from where you are used to over the years.

“Government should do as much as possible to mitigate our suffering in riverine areas – Burutu, Bomadi and Patani. So, government should do the needful by building camps early enough for us to relocate,” he said.

For Dave Ogochukwu, while government should try to evacuate people in flood-prone areas to avoid loss of lives, residents should also not dispose refuse indiscriminately, thereby blocking waterways.

“The property that has been lost since 2012 till date is enormous and it is not good for the growth of the society. In recent times, several farmlands have been overrun by flood putting farmers in a difficult situation.

“Over the years, government has made efforts to relocate people from the flood-prone areas but some people have been adamant. However, government should continue to sensitise the people on the need to relocate before the flooding begins,” Ogochukwu added.

‘We Have Been Crying Out To Government For Help’

From Agosi Todo, Calabar

LAST year during the peak of the rainy season, many communities in Cross River State experienced heavy flooding that destroyed farms and homes. Over 300 residents in the state were left homeless and properties worth millions of naira destroyed due to heavy rainfalls.

The rains destroyed farmlands specifically in Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Biase and Boki local councils of the state.

Some of the residents at Ikot Eka Edem in Calabar Municipal local council identified building of houses on waterways as the cause of flooding in the area.

A resident, Mr. Gab Otei, said he was apprehensive ahead of this year’s rainy season, lamenting that he lost his valuables to flood last year.

Otei said: “Last year, the heavy rains wreaked havoc in the whole of this street. I lost my valuables because I was trying to save my little children from being taken away by the flooding.

“I cannot leave this place because this is my father’s house and I stay here with my family. For years now, we have been crying to government at all levels to come to our aid and open the canals for free flow of water, but no response.”

A resident in Kakwagom community in Boki local council, Mr. Augustine Ita, said: “Last year, most of the yam and cassava farms were basically destroyed. We lost everything and you know that hunger was the effect of it. What those of us who farm in the riverine areas are trying to do now is to either cultivate earlier or make your mounds to be bigger than what it used to be, because if the mounds are very big, and the crop are up there, if the flood comes, it starts from the bottom of the mound. If God is on our side, we will still have something to hold on to. It depends on the strength of your mounds and how heavy the flood will be.”

x

Speaking with The Guardian on measures the state government was taking to safeguard lives and properties against flood this year, the Director General of Cross River State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr. Princewill Ayim, disclosed that last year, over 510 persons were displaced by flood across the state.

Ayim stated that although the state had not received the yearly prediction from concerned government agencies on what to expect this year, the agency has started sensitisation campaign in communities in Calabar South, Calabar Municipality, Boki, Biase, Odukpani and Etung local councils that are prone to flood.

He lamented that people living in flood-prone areas refuse to relocate to safe areas because they insist on remaining in their ancestral homes.

Ayim explained: “The way we do it every year is that we get informed from the national bodies. They tell us when there will be heavy flood and what to expect. For now we have not gotten any prediction but we cannot keep on waiting. We need to be proactive by engaging ourselves in activities that can mitigate heavy flood.

“We have our local emergency committees spread across all the 18 local councils. They interface with the locals to inform them more about flooding and how to prepare for it. And at the same time, we are also collaborating with the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC). Luckily, we are among the states that installed emergency outfit; so if you are in distress and do not have airtime in your phone, you can dial the 122 free toll number through which help can come to you. That is in place already.

“Apart from that, we use the media houses to educate the public to clear their drainage channels and to cut the entire weeds on the waterways. If you go to Calabar South for example, you see some stagnant water that if you don’t look very well you won’t know there is an artificial pool there.”","Sat, 24 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rainy-season.jpg,"['rainy', 'residents', 'water', 'world', 'flooding', 'waterways', 'flood', 'impending', 'season', 'area', 'guardian', 'nigeria', 'land', 'state', 'areas', 'fears']", ,flood

Speaking at the public presentation of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency’s (NIHSA) 2021 annual flood outlook (AFO) in Abuja on Thursday, Adamu said the flood projection in different states are of varying severity.

He said states surrounding River Niger and Benue will experience “severe flooding”, adding that it will aggravate the problems created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This year, we will be grappling with the two threats of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the impending floods as predicted in the AFO,” NAN quoted him as saying.

“The flood projections show varying severity across parts of the country.

“In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 local government areas (LGAs) in 36 states including the FCT will fall within the moderate probable flood risk areas.

“It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the highly probable risk areas.

“The states surrounding Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience severe flooding.

“Floods come with attendant health risks through the contamination of potable water sources. The 2021 flooding will be exacerbated by the continuing ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The minister noted that the 2012 flood which brought massive destruction of lives and property across the country necessitated the creation of a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront a reoccurrence.

According to him, the NIHSA forecasts have increased citizens’ awareness and led them to take measures to prevent severe flood damage.

He urged stakeholders, including policy makers and tiers of government, to take appropriate measures such as clearing of waterways and flood paths to contain it.","Thu, 06 May 2021 17:12:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Flood-Gwagwalada.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'varying', 'states', 'minister', '28', '2021', 'covid19', 'afo', 'risk', 'severe']", ,none

Rather than being a blessing, the rains have become a curse to many Nigerians, especially to coastal states and communities living along the bank of Rivers Niger and Benue. The federal government has issued a flood alert. Will the 2021 predictions go the way of others? TONY AKOWE reports

Since the devastating flood in Nigeria in 2012, it has become important for the government and its agency to make an annual forecast of possible flood and its impact in the country annually. Since the first forecast was made in 2013, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, working with other government agencies, has consistently warned the nation of impending flood across the country and in most cases, the intensity of such flood. Unfortunately, warnings by the agencies have often been ignored by both the people and state governments and their agencies. This year, the government has said not less than 121 local government areas across 28 states are at highly probable risk of heavy flooding, while another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will experience some level of flooding.

Flooding is categorised into river flooding, coastal flooding as well as flash and urban flooding occasioned by poor drainages, blocked drainages and poor adherence to town planning regulations.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) said flooding accounts for 15% of all natural disaster related deaths across the globe.

Floods have since become annual phenomena not only in flood plains, but also in urban and semi-urban areas. Experts link urban flooding to inadequacies of drainage channels that have become too small to contain excess runoff, the use of river channels as waste repositories thus clogging the channels, poor compliance with or non-existence of land use zoning/building codes, poor waste management practices, and removal of vegetation that create resistance and minimise flood impact. Coastal areas of Nigeria are not spared from flooding as they may be worst hit by flood this year. Interestingly, more states in Nigeria are increasingly suffering from annual flooding due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Unfortunately, Nigeria is located downstream of Rivers Niger and Benue, and therefore abounds with water resources that become a menace by causing flooding and flood disasters, the worst of which was experience in 2012 when hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property loss running into billions of naira including massive farm lands and crops when water was released from the a dam in Cameroon.

A close study of the predictions revealed that all the 20 local government areas in Lagos State (as against 18 in 2020) are likely to be affected with eight of them being at higher risk of heavy flooding. Apart from urban and river flooding, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Delta and Ondo states stand the risk of heavy coastal flooding. In 2020, similar predictions by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency and advice to states and local government areas to take precautionary measure to mitigate the flood fell on deaf ears in most parts of the country. The consequence was the displacement of over 2.3 million people and the death of 69 others. The outcome was also the washing away of farm lands in Kebbi and Jigawa as well as livestock and other valuables. The agency has continuously expressed concern over disregard for town planning regulations leading to people building on flood plains.

Minister for Water Resources Suleiman Adamu, who announced the 2021 prediction on behalf of the agency, said 121 local government areas in 28 states and the FCT as well as another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will likely experience high and moderate flooding in 2021. Acting on information from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, the minister also said there would be heavy coastal flooding in Rivers, Cross Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states. He stressed the need for concerted efforts to mitigate the impact of the expected flood.

He said: “So far, the flood levels will be higher than in previous years, but will not attain the levels of the 2012 devastating floods. In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 LGAs in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will fall within the moderate probable Flood Risk Areas. It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the Highly Probable Risk Areas. The states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience river flooding. These states and the number of local government likely to be affected include Abia (9), Akwa Ibom (2), Anambra (5), Bauchi (2), Bayelsa (5), Benue (3), Cross River (2), Delta (8), Ebonyi (4), Edo (1), FCT (2), Gombe (7), Imo (3), Jigawa (9), Kaduna (2), Kano (2), Kebbi (4), Kogi (9), Kwara (2), Lagos (8), Nasarawa (2), Niger (5), Ogun (3), Oyo (7), Rivers (12), Sokoto (7), Taraba (7) and Zamfara (1).”

The list of states to be affected by one form of flood or the other in 2021 show that northern and coastal states are at a greater risk of flooding this year, with some states along the River Niger and Benue are also likely to be affected. Adamu said flash and urban floods from heavy inundation were predicted to occur in some major cities, the severity of which would depend on the availability and adequacy of the drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.

He said: “The information contained in the AFO 2021 is a Clarion call to all stakeholders, policy makers, Federal, States and Local Governments, Departments and Agencies to rise and set up appropriate mechanism such as clearing the waterways and flood paths as well as maintaining proper water disposal management practices to curtail the ravages of the impending flood and threats of COVID-19. The year 2012 is a landmark in the annals of flood occurrence in Nigeria. It brought with it massive destruction of lives, property and critical national infrastructure. The need arose therefore, to put in place a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront the menace of this disaster of flooding, hence the coming into being of APO in the year 2013. The 2021 Annual Flood Outlook built on the successes of the previous eight (8) years forecasts by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency. The outcomes of these forecasts have been the increased awareness by the citizenry with respect to measures that need to be taken before, during and after floods. This has culminated in the progressive reduction in the severity of flood and its harmful effects on lives and property. The timeliness in the release of these forecasts is quite commendable and deserving of every possible support by all of us.”

He believed that man’s interaction with natural process has been both helpful and harmful to some degree, adding that the negative impact of man’s activities can be observed in the heightened climate change being experienced globally by way of rising temperatures, intensified rainfall, more destructive storms and floods. He maintained that the annual prediction by the agency is designed to create awareness of the inherent dangers of flooding and to inform people about locations that are prone to Flood risk at a particular time and encourage them to take appropriate actions.

Drawing attention to the 2020 experience, the minister said: “The year 2020 saw the devastating impact of extreme flood across the country with practically every state of the federation affected in one way or the other. The flood affected 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 349 Local Government Areas (LGAs) within the 36 States were affected and over 2,353,647 people were displaced with a record of 69 deaths. Kebbi and Jigawa States were worst hit with regards to agricultural lands and houses destroyed. Apart from the physical damages, other indirect losses are often overlooked. These indirect and intangible impacts are generally associated with disruption to normal life as well as long term health issues and stress-related illnesses. We must recognise that extreme weather and flooding extents do happen and that we need to be well equipped to respond to them. I am confident that our communities, infrastructure and businesses will be better protected if due attention is given to the information contained in this 9th edition of the Annual Flood Outlook.”

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs. Didi Walson-Jack, said: “The overall objective of this event is to sensitise the nation (i.e planners, decision and policy makers, farmers, stakeholders) and the general public towards embarking on preventive measures to improve on safety and reduce potential damages to lives and property from predicted flood events.”

She said the event was expected to provide ample opportunity for enlightenment campaigns in the media for better Preparedness on flood mitigation, control and management in flood risks locations across the country. She maintained that the accuracy of the predictions over the years have been fairly high and reliable, stressing however that “the focus is rather on prevention and mitigation of possible flood disasters by increasing the awareness of the populace and prompting them to take appropriate preventive, adaptive and mitigative measures”.

The Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd), stressed the need to strengthen multi-agency approach to disaster risk reduction in the country.

Mohammed said: “To enhance flood forecasting and management in Nigeria, NEMA is currently supporting NIHSA in establishing three Automatic Weather Observation Stations which are at various stages of installation located in Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti and Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. These stations will be used not only for hydrological predictions but also to train students in the field of Geography, Engineering, Agriculture, meteorology, climate change and other sciences”. He said further that “one of the lessons learnt during the 2020 flood after action review meeting is the need for proper utilization of our dams in the country. When dams meant for irrigation purpose are used for dry season agriculture, they acquire more capacities to hold more water in the rainy season. In addition, a timely controlled release of water from dams will reduce panic release of water during rainy season that can lead to further flooding.”

The Director-General of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze said government at all levels in the country must take necessary steps to avert a possible disastrous effect of flood in 2021. Nze said as the rains begin to set in, the country was gradually inching towards the peak of rainy season with its attendant flood incidents. He said Nigeria’s geographical location downstream of all the countries in the Niger Basin places it at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollution from all countries upstream, adding that this explain why persistent flooding has become an annual event since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster.

He argued that the annual flood forecast was to enable states and local government as well as individuals take concrete steps now to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past few years including clearing of blocked drainages and canals, removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinth and floats on water channels. People living along water ways as well as those having socio-economic activities in such areas should be encouraged to relocate o safer areas before the peak of rains, while there should also be an improved system for flood monitoring, flood forecasting and early warnings. He stressed that states must intensify soil conservation measuring techniques on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and encourage ecosystem protection, while also enhancing the enforcement of town planning code to allow for the construction of houses and drainage structures.

He said further that while it was not possible to eradicate flooding, efforts should be made to either reduce or minimise it, adding that state governments must educate their people, insisting that states must make efforts to avoid a repeat of the incidences of 2020 which saw over 450,000 hectare of rice plantation being washed away in Kebbi state alone as a result of flooding. Nzeh lamented that while the agency has continued to give early warning signs, many states in the country have failed to listen to the recommendations of the agency, adding that at the moment, Jigawa state has set up a committee that is working to reduce incidences of flooding in the state in line with recommendations from the agency.

The NIHSA’s Director of Hydrogeophysics, Stephen Margima Jabo, said flooding has become a global phenomenon that has increased in frequency over the years. According to him, the effective management of flood risk should be a collective responsibility of all stakeholders from the federal, state, and local to individual levels, adding that the existing synergy between Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, stakeholders and other collaborative agencies involved in flood management and disaster issues should be further strengthened. He said government at all level should also put in place measures for better town planning and effective land use zoning, effective flood disaster management in the changing environment, improved biodiversity and ecosystem management for the enhancement of rapid and sustainable development in the country. States, he said should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers particularly, where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood waters will not be lost to the sea.

The agency said among others that “stakeholders in the water sector should carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas by the removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers to improve their conveyance capacities and from dams, lakes and reservoirs to increase their storage capacities for the containment of the incoming floodwaters; there is need for construction of weirs, small reservoirs on tributary, streams and rivers for conservation of flood water to be used during the dry season thereby preventing desert encroachment, increasing irrigation food crop production, improvement of grassland areas, nomadic settlement, peace and sustainable development by relevant government agencies; intensification of soil conservation measuring technics on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and increase ecosystem protection among others; enforcement of Town Planning Codes in the country to allow for the appropriate construction of houses, and drainage structures and constantly freeing the waterways from obstructions and provision of adequate refuse dumping facilities by relevant authorities.”","Tue, 11 May 2021 00:15:10 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Flood-1.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'happen', 'local', 'flood', 'waiting', 'states', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'country', 'state', 'areas']", ,flood
7,7,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Collaborative Call to Mitigate Flooding - THISDAY Newspapers,https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/04/26/collaborative-call-to-mitigate-flooding/,"Udora Orizu writes that the widespread destruction and loss of lives caused by flooding in 2020, calls for all hands on deck by all tiers of government to put in place structures and adhere to warnings issued by flood monitoring agencies ahead of the next flooding season

September 12, 2020, around 8:00pm, residents of Alapere area of Lagos State, raised alarm as another flooding tragedy struck. Two yet-to-be-identified children were swept away as people battled flood after a heavy rainfall that lasted for hours and led to destruction of properties.

This is just one of the horrific, heart-wrenching experiences Nigerians go through, following havoc wreaked by floods every year. Yet nothing is done by stakeholders to ameliorate the disaster.

Nigeria with a population of over 200 million people, faces numerous natural disasters, with flooding being the most common. Most states in the country are increasingly suffering from annual flooding during the rainy seasons. However unlike some natural disasters, rainfall flooding can be controlled with proper planning and the provision of necessary infrastructure.

Flooding in Nigeria is usually caused by climate change, river overflowing, dam opening, current poor urban planning practices, poor drainage systems that can’t cope and so on. In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the neighboring states.

Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals. The immediate impact of it include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases. These were seen recurring this year, in various states of the federation.

Havoc in Some States

In a report on October last year, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods since September have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across 22 states in Nigeria. Furthermore, around 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people were reported to be displaced.

According to the Red Cross, the overflowing Benue and Niger rivers caused severe floods in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara States from October 6, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. At least 57 people died, 473 were injured and 22,357 displaced. Flooding was also reported in southern parts of the country, Bayelsa, Anambra, Rivers and Delta States, were affected and fatalities reported.

One of the most devastating impact of floods was seen in Kebbi State. The flood swept away villages and peoples, displacing families and destroyed about 90 per cent of crops, putting the country’s food security at risk. Over 30 lives were lost, hundreds of houses destroyed and thousands of residents displaced by the devastating flood that sacked communities in the state.

The losses incurred by the farmers, particularly rice farmers in Kebbi State were colossal and immeasurable , they run into billions of naira . Thousands of hectares of fadama rice farms in the state were affected by the flood. Rice farms , other agricultural crops, livestock and even communities were not spared by the raging floods.

Chairman of the State Emergency Management Authority (KSEMA), Alhaji Sani Dododo, revealed that five different bridges had been washed away across the state.

The Birnin-Kebbi-Makera-Kangiwa road, an international highway, which runs from the state capital to Niger Republic, is at the risk of caving in at Duku. Some of the minor bridges and culverts along the highway are already caving in, following erosion caused by rising water overflowing the nearby River Rima.

Also, the Bagudo-Tuga-Kaoje route, which leads to Benin Republic border, including the Tuga Bridge, is also submerged, cutting border communities. Dododo, who confirmed the number of deaths recorded so far, said 10 people died in a boat that capsized at Ihiru in Jega Local Government.

“Only eight bodies have so far been recovered; a family of six – father, mother and children were wiped away in Arewa council area. We recorded one death in Yauri, among others. The numbers may increase, since we are experiencing rainfall daily. In Bagudo council area is the worst hit by the flooding, as it was learnt that 98 per cent of the villages were affected.

In Iwaro Oka community of Akoko South West Local Government area, Ondo State

a middle-aged man was swept away by flood. Sources said the motorcycle of the farmer, identified as Akede, was seen inside the river very close to a popular filling station, which made people aware that the farmer was missing. Family members were thrown into mourning when all efforts to find him proved abortive. His body was later recovered in a river very close to St Patrick’s College, Iwaro Oka.

In Lokoja, Kogi State, the road linking Kogi East and Eastern Nigeria to the state capital was flooded for days as canoe and boats were employed to navigate the roads which is meant for cars and other road users.

In Niger State, officials of the state government visited communities submerged by flood to ascertain the extent of damage and to enable government render assistance to victims.

In Kano State, the Kano Emergency Management Agency confirmed four persons killed and over 5,200 houses destroyed due to flooding in Rogo and Danbatta Local Government Areas of the state. He disclosed that two persons lost their lives and 200 houses destroyed in Rogo, while two other persons and over 5,000 houses were destroyed by flood in Danbatta.

Also the South-south and South-east were wreaked by flood havoc. South-south states like Delta had over 150 houses submerged by flood. In South-east, Anambra for instance, over 5,000 persons have been displaced by flood that submerged houses, schools and churches in the Ogbaru Local Government Area. The Chairman of the council, Arinze Awaogu, said about 1,000 of the displaced persons were being catered for at Internally Displaced Persons’ camps in the area, while many others trapped in their communities needed evacuation.

He said, ”Over 5,000 families have been displaced, while churches, schools and many residential houses have been submerged by flood, with farm crops destroyed and displaced persons seeking refuge in Onitsha and surrounding communities. At the moment, we are housing over 1,000 IDPs; we have over 5,000 persons who have been displaced; some are taking refuge in the residences of their relatives, who live upland, including Onitsha. We need the Federal Government’s assistance in the areas of donation of food items, non-food items, medical supplies, establishment of sick bays and sending enough medical personnel to help in handling the situation; our fear now is that of a possible outbreak of epidemic.”

Earlier in the year, heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

In Abuja, four Area Councils, Bwari, Gwagwalada, Abaji and Kwali which are prone to flood were affected by the disaster with Gwagwala being the worst hit in July as eight lives were lost, over 100 houses submerged and properties destroyed. On July 25, after a heavy downpour which lasted for hours, five residents were swept away and several houses and cars destroyed in Gwagwalada, Dawaki, Giri and Zuba where the flood cut the bridge linking Ikwa, Yimi and other villages.

The incidence was confirmed by the Director General of FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Idris Abbas who had said there was a building collapse in Dawaki as a result of the flood. Gwagwalada is flooded from Giri. A family of five were flooded at Giri.

“We got one body and still searching for four. We rescued six people and are in the hospital. The flood has damaged a lot of houses and property, especially at Gwagwalada. The residents are still saying some are missing but they cannot give us the identities of such persons who they claim to be missing. People should be careful when it is raining. They should not drive on water. They should not build on flood plain. They must respect the master plan of FCT and ensure that all drainages are clean. What happened in Giri-Gota was because people built on flood plain”, he said

Federal Lawmakers Laments

Back in September, the Kebbi State Caucus in the House of Representatives while commiserating with the government and people of the state on the recent flood disaster that ravaged the entire state, said the disaster is a major setback to the federal government effort to boost local rice production as part of measures to end rice importation.

The Chairman, Hon. Muhammad Jega, representing Gwandu/Aliero/Jega federal constituency, lamented that the disaster could not have come at a worse time for the farmers who were looking forward to a bumper harvest this year to reduce the rising cost of food items.

The lawmaker, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari and the state Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, for the prompt response to reduce the hardship caused by the flood, also urged them to as a matter of urgency send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state.

Jega further urged the federal government to commission a study with the aim of providing a lasting solution to the perennial flood disaster in the state.

According to him, “The flood is a serious setback towards addressing food security in the country; the government, therefore, needs to address the shortfall of the food supply chain to reduce the hardship and cost of food items in the market, and also address the severe environmental degradation caused by the flood. This may include adequate and early preparation for dry-season farming and reconstruction of major infrastructures affected in the state.

‘’The estimated cost of the disaster is over N10 billion across the state. We call on the federal government as a matter of urgency to send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state, as early preparation for dry season farming should commence in earnest with provision of seedlings, fertilizer and other inputs to be made available to the farmers in good time.’’

Also, a member of the House of Representatives, representing Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency of Delta State, Hon. Ossai Nicholas Ossai, decried the submerging of over 150 houses in Delta State, by devastating floods.

He said that since past two weeks, the Ndokwa East Communities of Delta State have been bedeviled by constant and frightening heavy downpour, being accompanied by excessive flooding and erosion, that is seriously and presently wreaking havoc in the Communities.

According to him, the affected communities are; Ossissa, Onyah, Ase, Ushie, Ibedeni; Asagba, Aballa-Uno, Agballa-Obodo, AgballaOshimili, Uchi, Okpai, Onuaboh, Inyi, Benekuku, Aboh, Onyah, Asaba-Ase, Ibrede, Ashaka, Afor, Abalagáda, Umuolu, Igbuku, Obettim, Obodo-Okolafa, Iyadama,0nuogboko, UtagbaOgbe, Utagba-Uno, Ogume, Onitsha-Ukwuani, Akarri, Umuolu, just to mention a few”.

He said he was disturbed that “schools, farmlands, health centres, places of worship have seriously been affected and over 150 households has been rendered homeless particularly children and women and more is still being affected daily. About 90per cent of the ommunities in the entire Ndokwa East Local Government Area has been submerged,and worse still is the deplorable economic conditions of the peasant farmers in these agrarian communities”.

He observed that these communities are often prone to serious environmental disaster as a result of vulnerability of constant coastal flooding and erosion from the River Niger”.

The legislator, pleaded with the Federal Governnment, to Direct the Ecological Fund office to conduct an environmental survey with a view to addressing the excessive flooding in these Ndokwa Communities and urge the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to urgently provide relief materials for the Hood victims in accordance with section 6 of NEMA Act.

NIHSA Flood Alerts

In February, the Director General of Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze, alerted the government, stakeholders and all citizens to use this period of dry season to prepare ahead for 2021 flooding.

Nze lamented that Nigeria currently doesn’t have enough dams, saying more dams would help to mitigate floods.

He explained that with the increasing global population and the expanding activities of man, flooding would continue to persist, hence the need to control human activities, environmental adjustment and purposefully adopting actions in certain areas that would make adjustment possible.

According to him, “Flooding problem is a global environmental issue which is faced by many countries worldwide, particularly in areas close to low lying terrains and river valleys. Over the past years, there have been increasing concerns that human actions and natural catastrophes have been adversely impacting the environment, posing serious ecological and environmental hazards.

“Though flood is a natural environmental phenomenon, it can be greatly accelerated by human-induced activities as it is the case worldwide. Some floods may result in major disasters involving structural and erosion damages, disruption of socio-economic activities, loss of lives and properties, displacement of people, destruction of agricultural land and contamination of water and environment in general.”

The director general said this is the appropriate time to construct drainages where they are necessary (but not provided), dredge river channels, clear blocked gutters and drainages, and pull down structures that are within the floodplains and flood paths.

“There is a reasonable time to do that before the rains set in. According to the 2020 Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public recently by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), February 24 and June 22 are the predicted onset of rainfall in the South-south and Northern states respectively, while the respective predicted cessation dates are December 28th and September 26th. This implies that Nigeria is likely to experience longer period of rainy season in 2020 compared to year 2019,” he added.

Again, in September, the agency warned members of the public to expect more floods in the months of September and October.

Nze, gave the warning at a press briefing in Abuja, saying that the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country.

Nze explained that any release of excess water from the dams in countries upstream Rivers Niger and Benue this year would have more negative impacts on Nigeria, which is located downstream of countries in the Niger Basin.

He identified the highly vulnerable states as Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa.

He said that the flood that ravaged Kebbi State just about a week ago left so many damages and noted that the current flooding situation called for vigilance on the part of all the stakeholders.

The director general called the states and local governments as well as multi-national companies and public-spirited individuals to join hands to save the country from the consequences of “twin pandemic” (COVID-19 and flood) in the year 2020.

Nze warned: ‘’The rains are finally here. The volume of river flows on our river is surging and river channels could no longer accommodate significant runoff as floodplains, which traditionally serve the alluvial plains and are rich in agricultural productivity, lost its retention capacity to give way to flooding of adjacent lands.

“Farmlands and crop yields are being lost to furry of floodwaters, livestock and ecosystem species are diminishing while hope for livelihood hang in the balance due to monumental economic losses.

‘’As a matter of fact, all the states of the federation have suffered several degrees of flooding since June 2020. The danger is not yet over. Information received from the regional Niger Basin Authority (NBA) by NIHSA, has it that as at 7.30am today September 10, 2020, the River Niger flood level in Niamey, Niger Republic, attained an unprecedented level of 7.02m (702cm). This is a far cry from the value of 6.60m which I reported in my last press briefing of August 25, 2020.

“Noting that the Red Alert Warning Zone in Niamey is 6.20m and above, the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country, Nigeria, which is at the Lower portion of Niger Basin within this month of September and October.’

‘’Based on the report of the expected flood coming down from Niamey and the projected contributions by the inland rivers, both Kainji and Jebbo Dams built on River Niger have continued to spill water downstream. The Shiroro Dam on River Koduno, with reservoir level at 381.48m as at 9.00am today, has been maintaining a regulated spilling into the River Niger. The effect of all these is that the communities in the states adjoining River Niger will continue to be highly inundated by River Flooding as is being witnessed in the recent time.”

Recently, The DG of NIHSA, briefing the press on March 24, 2021, again advised the three tiers of government and citizens across the country to prepare against impending devastating floods in 2021.

Nze, who gave the advice at a press conference in Abuja, said this was because Nigeria was at the receiving end of disastrous floods among the nine countries of the River Niger Basin.

He said, “There is still time for states/LGAs (Local Government Areas) and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

“As the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin which covers nine countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season with its attendant flood incidents.

He also advised Nigerians residing at waterways to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains, just as warned that Nigerians have about three months to prepare against the disastrous effects of flood.

He explained that the country’s geographical location is downstream of all the countries in the Basin, making it to be at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollutions from all the countries upstream.

The DG lamented that relevant authorities are frustrating the effort of the Federal Government by neglecting the predictions, as could be seen in the results of last year’s damages.

Nze while urging the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past years, noted that there is still time for stakeholders to take steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

Expectations from Stakeholders

In the last few months, President Muhammadu Buhari has been sending solidarity messages to some states affected by flood disasters with promises of federal aid. The president authorised needed assistance to 12 states worst affected by the seasonal rains. The states are: Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Edo, Anambra, Delta, Kano, Jigawa, Rivers, Bayelsa and Adamawa.

However, flooding in various state has become a recurring decimal for decades, all tiers of government are expected to put all hands on deck and come up with a permanent solution. Flood is a natural disaster, but lack of preparedness is a man-made disaster.

As Nigeria is months away till the next rainy season, stakeholders have ample time to do the needful and heed to flood warnings by various monitoring agencies in order to avert another impending tragedy.

One of the main strategies as stated by NIHSA is that, the 36 States and the FCT authority should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using the flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood water will not be lost to the sea to become saline water.

The agency is also urging state governments to pull down structures built on flood plains and expand the drainages for easy flow of water as one of the strategies mapped out.

According to them, the foodstuff, meant for distribution to the vulnerable, is to cushion the ravaging hardship in the region. Flagging off the exercise in Yola, Adamawa State, one of the associates, Dahiru Hammadikko, said the gesture was courtesy of Tinubu’s associates in the 19 northern states.

He said over 10,000 households in the 21 local councils of Adamawa were targeted to benefit. He lamented that Nigerians were facing hardship, which informed the group’s move to ameliorate the suffering of Nigerians, irrespective of religious and political affiliations.

The national coordinator of the Tinubu support group said: “The gesture is to honour the national leader of APC, due to his philanthropic disposition, which is why the rice was branded with his image.”

He described Tinubu as “a detribalised Nigerian, in whom the Northern region relies” as the unifying factor.

“Today, we are flagging off the distribution of 5kg of rice to Nigerians from the northern region. We are targeting one million beneficiaries in the 19 northern states and the FCT.

“But here in Adamawa we are giving over 10,000 people,” he said.

10,10,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Many states not taking precautions against floods –NIHSA boss - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/many-states-not-taking-precautions-against-floods-nihsa-boss/,"The Director-General, Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, Mr Clement Nze, tells OKECHUKWU NNODIM that the devastation caused by floods in many states is as a result of the failure of the governments to adhere to warnings

What are the types of flooding being experienced in Nigeria?

There are three major types of flooding that we experience in Nigeria. The first one is river flooding, which is not just from rivers that are within Nigeria but from River Niger and River Benue, and these are trans-boundary waters. There is also urban/flash flooding, and these are caused by poor drainage systems or even non-existing drainage systems in many major cities in Nigeria. Lastly is coastal or tidal flooding for states that are within coastal areas such as Ondo, Lagos, Bayelsa and Rivers.

Now, it is important to state that our Annual Flood Outlook is a scientific prediction done using historical data physically collected in the field, some of them over 40 to 50 years ago. So, we use it to project and see what is going to happen tomorrow. And from what we have seen using international standards to predict, we have said that not less than 121 Local Government Areas in Nigeria, in 27 states actually, will be affected by flooding in the course of the year. Also, about 302 LGAs will experience different magnitudes of flooding. And about 351 LGAs may have a lesser severity of flooding. But like I said, it is a prediction, which we monitor closely by weekly publications. We are talking about the issue of climate change and so what you see today may not be what will happen tomorrow. So, as a result of that, we will be updating the media, states and others on what they are likely to observe in the course of the year.

How are you interfacing with the states with respect to predictions in the AFOs?

We will be doing sensitisation programmes and will downscale it to the states. We will tell the governors that these are the locations in your state that are likely to be affected in the course of the year 2021. We informed the public through the press some months ago, as preparatory to the unveiling of the 2021 AFO. And by protocol, it is the Minister of Water Resources who interfaces with the governors on behalf of the agency. Last year, for instance, the minister sent letters to each of the state governors in Nigeria and detailed the states that would be affected by flooding in that year. But what they did with it is another cup of tea.

Also, we go through other systems in the states such as their emergency management agencies, water resources and environment ministries. We interface with them directly, but what they do with our information is another issue.

Are you satisfied with what states are doing about the recommendations in the AFOs?

Frankly speaking, they are not doing as much as we expect from them, otherwise, the level of devastation that happens year in year out could have been avoided or eliminated. We’ve been telling the state governors that the tempo of political activities they embark upon during election periods should be deployed against activities that encourage flooding. Go to the grassroots, you have councillors in LGAs. They should be able to cascade this information and domesticate it in their own locations. But often time, it doesn’t happen. However, when a disaster occurs, they are quick to complain and cry out to high heavens and maybe get some support from the humanitarian ministry. But in terms of ameliorating the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.

I recall in 2016/2017, I engaged some state emergency management agencies one-on-one and we were told not to come to tell them what will happen in the course of the year except we are coming with relief materials. But we told them that that was not our jurisdiction. Ours is to inform you about what is likely to happen in your own state. If it happens, you have the National Emergency Management Agency that can support you, not NIHSA.

What are states likely going to face by failing to abide by the recommendations in the AFO?

Going by the law establishing the agency, the agency’s powers begin and stop at predicting and releasing the message. We don’t enforce anything. Each state has its own regulatory body, such as the urban planning department and emergency management agencies. They also have environmental laws and ministries that are supposed to be the regulators to ensure that the dictates of our prediction are followed. I may then say that NEMA could now insist by saying, ‘Since you failed to do the needful, don’t run to us for relief materials.’ This is because, if you recall, when the flood was very severe in 2012, the Federal Government gave out a lot of money. Some states got about N4bn to N5bn, depending on the degree of devastation.

Maybe such decisions could be taken by NEMA so as to encourage states that are doing well in terms of adhering to the predictions to ensure that lives and property are not lost. We, as an agency, can’t enforce anything; we can’t force any governor to do the needful. But the governors on their own should in the spirit of humanity protect and help those who voted them into power.

Are you collaborating with sister agencies on climate issues?

In fact, our relationship with one of them, NiMet (Nigeria Meteorological Services Agency) is very superb and cordial. First of all, at the international level, the meteorological agency is Nigeria’s permanent representative with the World Meteorological Organisation, and that falls on whoever is the Director-General. Also, whosoever heads the hydrological agency in any nation is an adviser to that permanent representative. So, in that wise, there is a very good collaboration between NIHSA and NiMet; for instance, we requested rainfall data from NiMet. And this was one of the major inputs in the model to use for predictions. They provide us those data at no cost. And once they are releasing their own predictions, such as the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction, which is now called Seasonal Climate Prediction, they inform NIHSA.

So, we collaborate a lot; they provide us with data that help us to do our prediction alongside other river measurements that we do by ourselves. We use so much data – about 12 of them, but the rainfall data are among the major data.

What are some of the recommendations in the 2021 AFO, and what advice do you have for farmers?

Farmers should heed our predictions. They should also abide by our warnings. Those who farm within the river banks should ensure that their crops have early maturity. This is to ensure that before the onset of the rainy season or flooding, the crops would have matured and be harvested. Flooding doesn’t come with the rains immediately, rather it is when the soil is saturated and its moisture content becomes high that flooding will begin to take place. So, if there is a way they can be helped to plant crops that can mature easily, it should be done, so that before the flooding starts they can harvest. And after the flooding, heavy nutrients are now brought within the flood plain, which can lead to enhanced yields when the farming starts again.

The Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, for instance, once mentioned that because of the heavy nutrients that the floods brought, they were able to regain what they lost in one of the farming seasons. That governor is very active, he works with us and comes from time to time to ask what could be done to improve farming activities in his state.

What are some of the things states should be doing now, considering the looming flood?

Like I said in our press briefing in March, there is still time for states, LGAs and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021. We made it clear at the briefing that as the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin, which covers nine countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season, with its attendant flood incidents. Nigeria’s geographical location, downstream of all the countries in this basin, places it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollution from all the countries upstream.

We know that the persistent flooding and flood disasters have become an annual event in Nigeria since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster in recent history. In 2012, hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property losses running into trillions of naira.

It is in the light of the above that NIHSA wishes to urge the states and the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly menace of flooding in the past years. We recommend that the three tiers of government should consider clearing drainage systems and canals and also embark on projects for improving hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows. They should carry out the removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinths and floats on water channels and on all avenues for river runoffs. We also encourage people living along the waterways and those having socio-economic activities on flood plains to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains.

Description of the disaster

On 6 October 2020, flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of the torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto, and Zamfara state (amongst other states) affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin, which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas. Table 1 illustrates the flood impacts of the worst flood affected states.

The situation in Kebbi – the country's biggest rice-producing state – is especially dire, as vast farmlands are completely submerged due to the most recent rains. Meanwhile in Jigawa state, a total of 18 out of 27 Local Government Areas (LGA)s have been affected, with Gwaram, Birnin Kudu, Kirikasamma, and Gumel as the worst hit. Wide swaths of farmlands have been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of Naira. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), with the support from the Federal Government, is scaling efforts to assist flood victims by providing emergency needs. So far, the agency has distributed 30 canoes to inundated communities, as well as materials to build embankments to control the floods.

Kwara State is also concerning as more than 5,000 households have been affected. The government estimates damage worth N10bn have been incurred. At least three lives in Ilorin are believed to have been lost. Scores of houses also had their roofs blown off by the raging storm that accompanied the heavy rains in the Ilorin metropolis while electricity poles were destroyed in Taiwo and Odota areas of the state capital. Telecommunication masts and building walls were also damaged in Olonkonla, Bobonkiri, Egba-Akota, Aberi, Akuji and Idiope, all in Ita-Ogunbo area, Alanamu Ward in Ilorin West Local Government Area, the worst hit.

Since September to date, torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across Nigeria. Some 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people are reported to be displaced. Most of the those affected are children. Wide swaths of farmlands have also been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of naira. These floods have so far impacted 22 states in the country’s six geo-political zones: North West (4 state), North Central (4 states), North East (4 state), South East (4 states), South-South (3 states) and South West (3 state). This earlier flooding had weakened Nigeria’s water supply and road infrastructure, killing dozens and leading to disease outbreaks.

A government team began the delivery of food palliatives to the Kwara North Senatorial District, beginning with Jebba town in Moro Local Government Area and Lafiagi in Edu Local Government Area. Over 15,000 households across 357 communities of the state are estimated to have been affected by the ugly incidents that also destroyed farmlands and human dwellings worth billions of naira. In the wake of the floods, over 100,000 hectares of rice, maize and millet farms in Kpata-Gbaradogi, fishing and agrarian settlement in Pategi LGA were destroyed. About 100 residential buildings were also submerged while 1,500 people were rendered homeless.

The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, warned flood-prone states to prepare for flood emergency, rescue and rehabilitation. According to the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rainy season is expected to continue until December 28th in the southern parts of the country. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), predicted that at least 102 LGAs in 28 states fall within the highly probable flood risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 states of the Federation, including FCT, fall within the moderately probable flood risks areas.","Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540152-Nigeria%20Floods%20-%20Emergency%20Plan%20of%20Action%20%28EPoA%29%20DREF%20n%C2%B0%20MDRNG030.png?itok=T4e01g_v,"['n', 'dref', 'affected', 'north', 'epoa', 'flood', 'local', 'floods', 'states', 'action', 'area', 'farmlands', 'plan', 'nigeria', 'state', 'mdrng030', 'areas', 'emergency']", ,none
14,14,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Nigeria Loses a Quarter of Rice Production to Floods - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/nigeria-loses-quarter-rice-production-floods,"ARGUNGU - Farmers in northern Nigeria have lost more than two million tons of rice, a quarter of the country's projected harvest, due to flooding. Despite the loss, Nigeria is so far upholding a year-long ban on land-based imports of rice to crack down on smuggling and boost local production.

Ibrahim Adullahi is looking at what remains of his 350-hectare rice farm in Nigeria’s Kebbi state.

Abdullahi was expecting a harvest of 600 tons of rice, but weeks of severe flooding means he will be lucky to get 100.

“Since when I started farming, I have never experienced intensive cultivation of rice like now, because a lot of people are into the rice farming. But unfortunately, we experienced this intensive flooding that we are still experiencing now, and farmers are now counting losses because 90 percent of our farmers have lost what they have cultivated,” he said.

Nigeria’s biggest rice producing state, Kebbi, had projected 2.5 million tons this year.

But heavy September rains washed away two million tons. Local rice miller Mohammad Anuana said this could cause a further jump in the price of the grain.

“If rain has already washed away all the farm product, you know the goods will be rising up (in price) because the little one they have on ground - they will make sure they recover (the value of) the one that the water moves away. And, so they’ll double the price,” he said.

With Africa’s largest population, Nigeria annually imports billions of dollars of rice and wheat. But the country hopes to become self-sufficient.

Last year, the government banned land-based rice imports to crack down on smuggling and boost local rice production.

Despite the lost rice, the Nigerian officials say the ban will remain in place.

Chairman of the All Farmers Association in Nigeria John Wuyep said affected farmers will be compensated.

""The government and even the financial institutions have a machinery in force. So many who have lost now are already preparing for the dry season farming,” he said.

Nigeria’s farmers association says better groundwork is needed to prevent flooding and have a steady water supply during the dry season.

Flood reduction would also help save homes and the displacement of thousands of Nigerians from overflowing rivers.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2020-09/vlcsnap-2020-09-30-12h41m36s655.png,"['farmers', 'production', 'lost', 'flooding', 'local', 'quarter', 'price', 'tons', 'floods', 'million', 'nigeria', 'imports', 'loses', 'rice']", ,flood

Heavy rains have caused extensive flooding in Chad, Niger and Nigeria since the onset of rainy seasons in June. Chad’s rainy season, expected to last until October, is the heaviest in the past 30 years (OCHA 25/08/2020). Flooding in Niger has affected almost twice the estimated population. Flooding in Nigeria is less widespread than in 2019, but is still significant (NIHSA 06/2020; OCHA 21/07/2020).

Almost 60% of all affected people and over half of reported deaths from the three countries are in Niger, the country most affected by floods (UNHCR 15/09/2020). Flooding has affected more than 516,000 people across all eight regions, and resulted in at least 71 deaths (UNHCR 17/09/2020; OCHA 24/09/2020). Nigeria is at risk of crossborder flooding, given it is downstream from other flood-affected countries along the Niger River basin, including Niger (HNO 12/2019).

In all three countries, heavy rainfall and flash floods have resulted in the widespread destruction of shelters, driving displacement. Emergency shelters are overcrowded and unsanitary, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection and the spread of water-borne diseases (IOM 1/09/2020; OCHA 07/09/2020).

The Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region complicates flood relief efforts and increases protection concerns for highly vulnerable displaced populations in all three countries. The situation is most severe in northeast Nigeria, where over 2.7 million people are displaced and 10.6 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, especially food, shelter and WASH (OCHA 14/09/2020; UNHCR 31/07/2020). Additionally, cross-border violence from Mali affects northwest Niger and insecurity caused by banditry poses further risks to flood-affected populations in northwest Nigeria.","Wed, 07 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1538484-20201006_acaps_briefing_note_flooding_in_chad_niger_nigeria_.png?itok=WwqCv9xM,"['ocha', 'affected', 'chad', 'flooding', 'briefing', 'unhcr', 'shelters', '2020', 'countries', 'note', 'nigeria', 'widespread', 'risk', 'niger', '30', 'acaps']", ,flood
16,16,FL-2020-000196-NGA,How Africa's largest city is staying afloat - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210121-lagos-nigeria-how-africas-largest-city-is-staying-afloat,"Navigating the thronging streets of Lagos, Nigeria, is a challenge at the best of times. But during the rainy seasons, the city's streets can become almost impassable. Home to more than 24 million, Lagos is Nigeria's economic powerhouse, making it a destination for people seeking new opportunities. But that rapid growth creates pressure on the streets, and the environment.

The streets are often flooded, in part due to the dysfunctional disposal of the 6,000-10,000 tonnes of rubbish generated daily in the city. After a downpour, rubbish piles up in open gutters and makes moving around the streets difficult. “I worry when it rains, especially when it is heavy,” says Lagos resident Stephanie Erigha. ""It makes me anxious."" On one occasion when taking a taxi through a waterlogging-prone part of the city, she recalls the water gushing right into the back seat next to her.

While the overall climate in Lagos is expected to see less rainfall overall with climate change, the intensity of rain is expected to increase, bringing with it greater risk of flooding. Meanwhile, the low-lying city is also particularly vulnerable to water from another source: rising seas. If global warming exceeds 2C, the city is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100, according to research led by marine physicist Svetlana Jevrejeva, of the UK's National Oceanography Centre.

How, in the face of flooding, blocked streets and rising waters, is Africa's most populous city adapting?

Floating architecture

There is one part of Lagos that has extensive experience of dealing with high water. Much of the Makoko neighbourhood is not built on land, but rather sits on stilts above the waterline. Makoko, known as the ""Venice of Africa"", is a labyrinthine slum built on stilts and navigated by canoe. The slum has little access to electricity or clean sanitation, but it has also been home to innovations like the Makoko Floating School, a structure resting on recycled empty plastic barrels for buoyancy. The school's pyramid shape helped lower its centre of gravity and so increase its stability, while also being an ideal roof shape for shedding heavy rains.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/live/624x351/p094q1j4.jpg,"['afloat', 'water', 'rubbish', 'streets', 'slum', 'africas', 'staying', 'rising', 'lagos', 'stilts', 'shape', 'largest', 'city', 'makoko']", ,flood

The Edo State government said it has appointed a contractor for the flood control project at Ughoha community in Esan South Local Government Area of the state, signalling the commencement of the project.

The project coordinator, Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP), Tom Obaseki, made this known on Wednesday at Ugboha, while introducing the project contractor to the community.

Mr Obaseki assured the people that the best contractor was selected to handle the project because of the importance of the community to the state.

“Ugboha is very important to us and we thank the community for producing great men that have made so many positive contributions to the development of Edo State.

“We made sure that in the process of recruiting a contractor for the job, we went for the best of the best,” he stated.

Mr Obaseki solicited the support of the traditional head of Ugboha and members of the community for the smooth implementation of the project.

“We want to solicit the support of your highness and the entire people of the kingdom so that there will not be hitches down the line.

“Every time we waste or lose cannot be recovered. So, we want to seek your support in providing the enabling environment and security for the contractor,” he said.

The traditional head of Ugboha, Ukato Steven II, assured that the community would provide a conducive environment for the successful and timely delivery of the project.

Outrage as IDPs camps overflows with displaced residence



Governor raises the alarm as terrorists hoist flag in Kaore community

Affected communities speak out: “We don’t want Govt food or money but adequate security to enable us to return home

CAN goes spiritual; declares 3-day fast

By Wole Mosadomi

Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

“I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

“We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.”

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists’ presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. “Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don’t need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,” he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: “The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.”

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God’s intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

Speaking when the 2021 flood outlook was presented in Abuja, Nze said states have maintained a carefree attitude towards flood warnings over the years.

“Last year, the minister sent a letter to all the state governors in Nigeria and informed them in detail of what to expect, yet not too many states are doing something about it,” he said.

Nze urged state governors to use the same energy for political activities when tackling environmental challenges such as flooding.

He said: “It could be avoided or eliminated. The tempo of political activities they exhibited during the elections should be replicated in tackling this disturbing issue of flooding in the states.

“LGA councillors should be able to domesticate this information in their own locations but this doesn’t happen.

“Once the disaster occurs, they are quick to cry to high heavens, but in terms of reducing the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.”

The NIHSA DG also warned that going by historical data, there are indications that 121 LGAs in 27 states and the federal capital territory (FCT) are likely to experience flooding this year.","Sat, 08 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Flooding-River-Niger.jpg,"['political', 'rallies', 'flooding', 'tackling', 'occurs', 'states', 'nze', 'nigeria', 'governors', 'state', 'nihsa', 'treat', 'seriousness']", ,flood

There Is No End

BLUE NOTE

8/10

Though I’d witnessed the hypnotic magic of Tony Allen while he was drumming for his Afrobeat contemporary Fela Kuti, and had long been a fan of the rhythmatist’s work with King Sunny Ade and Ginger Baker, it wasn’t until the drummer played with Damon Albarn’s Gorillaz, then his The Good, the Bad & the Queen project, where I could speak to Allen. A casually cool drum god stuffed into a regal kingseat, Allen treated Albarn’s compositions and the rhythm section he had formed with Paul Simonon (of The Clash fame) in 2006 as but one more piece of his puzzle, a West African–styled Lego set layered with the ragged, angled tiles of R&B, funk, and jazz. He talked of taking the eccentric English music touched by dub and Afrobeat in stride, and made all that he laid his hands on a simple life pleasure—like sipping fine wine. Combine that cool complexity with an innate in-the-pocket oomph more finely regulated and metronomic than Clyde Stubblefield’s steady, burrowing groove, and Allen was magnificent—the rhythm divine personified.

Allen passed in April 2020 with a handful of compositions and demos in the planning stages for a new solo album—a soulful, personal catalog which merits greater examination—and to commemorate that passing, Blue Note drops There Is No End. Completed by its co-producers Vincent Taeger and Vincent Taurelle, with vocalists and rappers such as Sampa the Great and Danny Brown, the End’s game isn’t some grand finale or explanatory note summing up a career. Like everything else Allen was about, it’s but another piece of a greater puzzle.

That metronome’s meter, with a dub-house break and a hi-hat’s ride, turns “Stumbling Down” into something eerily atmospheric, yet sharply angled, a woozy track made whole by Sampa’s giddy rap. The same floppy dub break with tuneful jazzy brass applied doesn’t so much punctuate “Deer in Headlights” as it does stir up a smoldering psychedelic stew made weirder by Allen’s phase-shifting snare sounds and Brown’s leering voice. The Afro-pop of “Cosmosis” has the feel of being everywhere and nowhere at once, and aggressively yet.

Such aggression can easily be connected to years of warring strife, racism, insurgency, and pleas for justice in Allen’s homeland of Nigeria, and throughout a cut such as “Hurt Your Soul,” you can sense the pains of Allen’s drums, even when he’s rat-tat-tatting a snare to emulate the ring of gunshots. For every dramatic snare sound of Allen’s, there’s another tom-tom romp waiting to be beheld, even quietly and rumbling during “Très Magnifique” and its warm-winded rap courtesy Tsunami.

Though hardly or specifically hip-hop, it’s fascinating that Allen’s last full album is dedicated to the drummer’s relationship with rap, sweet or sour, and young collaborators. But, as its title signals, Tony Allen was a restless soul to go with his position as the rhythm divine personified. Savor this.","Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://floodmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tony-Allen-There-Is-No-End-600x315.jpg,"['allen', 'snare', 'rhythm', 'end', 'rap', 'note', 'tony', 'piece', 'vincent', 'soul', 'allens']", ,none

By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja

A bill seeking to amend the fire service act of 1963 and include other natural disasters as emergencies to be given urgent attention has passed for second reading in the House of Representatives.

The bill is titled “An Act to repeal the Fire Service Act Cap. F29 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and enact the Fire and Emergency Service Act 2021 to provide for additional powers for effective service delivery; and for related matters”.

The non-fire occurrences listed by the bill needing emergency rescue included flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters.

The sponsor of the bill is Rep. Adejoro Adeogun Akoko South East: South West Federal Constituency of Ondo State.

Leading the debate on the general principle of the bill at Tuesday plenary, Adeogun said that the bill when passed into law would provide stricter penalties for violation of building codes and fire regulations.

He said: “The fire service act (1963) saddled the Fire service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies. This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required.

Also read:

“This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.

“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”

According to the lawmaker, the goals of the bill are essential to prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters; encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by States, Local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies; establish the office of the Fire and emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the Fire and emergency service; empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilize resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies; and provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officer.

“Mr Speaker, Hon. colleagues, the major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency.

“It will also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through the engagement of able-bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.

“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating of future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources. I am therefore seeking the support of all distinguished Honorable members of this house for the second reading of this bill and eventual passage”, Adeogun submitted.

The bill eventually received the overwhelming support of the House majority when subjected to a voice vote by the presiding officer, Ahmed Idris Wase and passed for second reading.

This was disclosed by the NHSA Director-General, Mr Clement Nze, in a press briefing on Wednesday in Abuja. He urged that strict town planning codes be enforced, calling for constructions of flood walls, buffer dams, dykes and other infrastructure that can hold water and prevent flooding.

What the NHSA is saying

“Federal, states and local governments should clear drainage systems and canals, and embark on projects that will improve hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows… carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas through removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers, to increase storage capacities,” Nze said.

READ:

The NHSA boss revealed that Nigeria is stepping into the 2021/2022 hydrological year in the River Niger Basin, which includes a total of 9 countries, citing the yearly occurrence of flooding in the country since 2012.

“It then means that Nigeria is gradually inching closer to its peak rainy season with subsequent flood incidents,” he said.

“Nigeria’s geographical location downstream, of all the countries in the Basin, puts it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollutions from all the countries upstream,” Nze added.

In case you missed it: According to the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rising heatwave in the month of March just before the rainfalls was caused by NorthWestern and South Western air masses from the Sahara and Atlantic Ocean which generates so much heat during the transition month period of March-April.","Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Rainfall.jpg?fit=900%2C506&ssl=1,"['rainy', 'river', 'nhsa', 'urged', 'floods', 'peak', 'season', 'states', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'closer', 'nze', 'countries', 'expected']", ,flood

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beat/University of North Carolina PressWho doesn’t love a book with more than one index entry for possum? Two hundred of them were cooked at an Oklahoma City bash in 1923, along with 5,000 chickens, 10 bears, 500 beef cattle, 5 tons of coffee, etc. These are but some of the many fascinating facts in Adrian Miller’s new book Black Smoke: African Americans and the United States of Barbecue.Meet One of the First Barbecue Kings: Henry ‘Poppa’ MillerThe Lost African-American Bartenders who Created the CocktailThe book has 22 recipes (bison skewers, banana pudding, alligator ribs), 16 mini-profiles (such as barbecue king Henry “Poppa” Miller), and a big mission.In the 1990s, Miller worked as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton in the One America Initiative, which had the goal of fostering dialogue and helping communities reconcile racial divisions. Miller’s books could be seen as an extension of that experience. His James Beard Award-winning Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time expounded upon the social history of key soul dishes—fried chicken, chitlins, yams. In The President’s Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas, Miller researched the contributions of African Americans who worked in the White House kitchen.So faced with a whitewashed and one-sided representation of barbecue, Miller got to work. While most people agree that barbecue is a result of European influences dovetailing with Native American techniques in Southern kitchens where the cooks were African Americans—that barbecue, in other words, is Black—evidence, by which I mean scholarly evidence, well-researched and reliably sourced, has been vanishingly scant.To find that essential information, Miller turned mostly to newspaper archives.“For all my books, the biggest boon has been newspapers,” he told me. “They were about capturing the daily life of the community, and so you got a lot more flourish and details about what was happening at a particular event.”He sifted through the records of the speakers and the attendees at big community barbecues—which was tough work, since the food was often barely mentioned.Eventually, “writers started paying more attention to the details and at a time when African Americans went unnoticed more and more of them started talking to these Black barbecuers.”“Now, let’s just be straight up,” Miller said. “Part of this was to mock them. So you’d have them speaking in plantation dialect. But you saw other writers treating this person as an expert, as an artist and showing some love.”“I’ve struggled on how to tell people this,” Miller told me. “During the racist times you actually got more details.”And by the 1830s, in order to have legit barbecue, it was thought, an African American cook and his crew were necessary and barbecue was understood to be a Black experience. Miller explained a complicated twist in the narrative in words far more polite than I might have chosen: “In the 1850s, as there’s more and more tension about slavery, you actually find pro-slavery advocates using the plantation barbecue as evidence of their generosity.”After the Civil War, a group of African Americans “emerged from slavery with a highly specialized and marketable skill.” Barbecue culture flourished because African Americans were barbecuing on their own terms. “And that shows up with political barbecue, church barbecue and also emancipation barbecues.”Barbecue, after all, is perfectly suited to big crowds. You can feed thousands of people, as many as show up, as long as you’ve got the wood, the space and the meat.But the meat, says Miller, is not as cut-and-dried, so to speak, as one might think.In words sure to bring upon him (if not me, by association) a plague of wonky BBQ commentary, Miller reports that: “The regional barbecue styles that we fight about so fiercely today, they’re only about a hundred years old. Before that, barbecue was pretty standardized. It was hardwood coals in a trench, butterflied whole carcasses, flip it and sauce it, cut it up and serve it.” Pork was common, of course, but so was lamb and mutton, and the first emancipation barbecue, which took place in Port Royal, South Carolina, was a beef barbecue.Equally fascinating are the unsung regions of barbecue that Miller has championed such as St. Louis, Chicago, and the east side of Texas, where the meat comes with sauce and the sides aren’t the Germanic salads you find in Central Texas but soul food greens and creole dirty rice.So what happened over the last century? How did we get to a place where white people are thought to own barbecue?“At the very time that people are getting interested in barbecue, the non-diverse food media basically said ‘OK, these are the people we think should tell you what barbecue is, and where to get the good stuff.’ And they just kept putting white dude after white dude out in front.”And as he says it, and we talk about the trends that get pushed in barbecue, it becomes obvious, almost to the point of hilarity: the reason the mantra of barbecue became minimal seasoning was because we kept asking white people how to make barbecue. I suggest that I hear an echo of the old joke about how white people don’t season their food, and he laughs and agrees.“We’ll just flip that to our advantage,” Miller said, “and say you don’t need to season.”This trend is a big part of what brought Miller to write this book. “Chronically, there’s been so little coverage of African American barbecue culture.” Everywhere in the food media, the lack of African American representation “just hit me over and over.”He wasn’t sure, upon setting out on the project, how much he would find, and he feared, in the beginning, that he might be embarking on a record of faded glory. “I really thought I was going to be writing an elegy about Black barbecue,” he said. But “it’s thriving. It’s resilient.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A Michigan man who “lost everything” in a flood a year ago just won $2 million from a scratch-off lottery ticket.

The lucky 29-year-old, who chose to remain anonymous, said he “couldn’t stop shaking” when he found out about his sudden change in fortune.

“Last year, I lost everything in a flood, so to win this prize is so overwhelming to me,” he said in a statement released by state lottery officials.

He was on his way to pick up his kids from school when he stopped at a grocery store in Midland — and a ticket for the lottery’s Lucky 7s instant game caught his eye.

“Seven is a lucky number for me, so I decided to take a chance and bought the ticket,” said the man, who also won $10,000 playing the lottery a few years ago.

“I scratched it off when I got back to my car. When I saw I had a match, I thought: ‘Great, I won my money back!’ When I saw I had actually won $2 million, I couldn’t stop shaking.”

He went to the lottery headquarters to claim his big prize, opting for the lump sum of about $1.3 million instead of receiving annuity payments for the full $2 million.

He said he plans to pay off bills and save what’s left of his winnings.

“Knowing my kids will be taken care of is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

28,28,FL-2020-000196-NGA,"Nigeria: Aftermath of Boko Haram Invasion - Niger State Communities in Panic Mode As Victims, Others Flood IDPs Camps - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/202104300443.html,"Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: ""I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

""I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

""We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.""

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists' presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. ""Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don't need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,"" he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: ""The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.""

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God's intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 28 Nigerian states are at risk of heavy flooding this year, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said Thursday.

This year's flood projections will, as expected, vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country, and rivers are likely to exceed flood level with some low-lying areas to be inundated, said the NIHSA in a statement following an earlier survey.

Out of the 774 local government areas in the country, it said, some 102 local government areas across 28 states are at risk of flooding -- one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria, which has a devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on floodplains for livelihood.

Although the projections showed that the floods this year might not be as severe as in previous years, it was important to begin to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns for preparedness, the agency said.

In March 2012, 32 of Nigeria's 36 states were affected by flooding, in which more than 360 people were killed and almost 2 million displaced.

The phenomenon is repeated across numerous communities in West Africa, where traffic and business come to a standstill for hours or days, waiting for the streets to drain. Sometimes the flooding becomes deadly.

Last year, hundreds of people were killed in a mudslide in Freetown, Sierra Leone, along a hillside where residents of the booming city had cleared forests to build homes. Victims were buried alive in their houses and vehicles. Environmental groups and local organizations had been warning for years that the development was risky.

In Nigeria, local television stations reported that more than 100 communities had flooded and broadcast images of muddy waters reaching the rooftops of clusters of homes. Some people died when flooding caused their homes to collapse, according to Agence France-Presse.

Local leaders in some areas were advising residents to evacuate. Officials in Anambra State set up 28 camps for fleeing residents. Thousands of people fled their homes in Cross River State, officials there said, noting that many of them lived in swampy areas or along waterways.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Nigerien student Hachimou Abdou has had to catch a boat to classes since river water swamped his route to university in the capital Niamey - one of about 760,000 people hit by severe flooding in recent weeks in parts of West and Central Africa.

Floods are common during the rainy season, but in recent years climate change, land degradation and poor urban planning have led to more frequent disasters as rapidly-growing cities struggle with heavier-than-normal rainfall.

Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Congo Republic and Senegal are among those worst-hit this year, with at least 111 people killed, according to latest figures from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Waters have yet to recede in parts of Niamey since torrential rains in August caused rivers to burst their banks, destroying nearly 32,000 houses and 5,768 hectares of farmland across Niger.

“I have to get to university - either I take a boat or I walk in the water,” Abdou said, before settling into a traditional wooden pirogue to travel up the flooded highway.

Flooding across landlocked Niger alone has so far impacted nearly 333,000 people. Over 188,000 people have been affected in neighbouring Chad, with OCHA warning of potential food shortages due to inundated land.

With further rain expected, particularly in Central Africa, the situation is expected to worsen, said OCHA’s director for West and Central Africa, Julie Belanger.

Communities’ ability to cope with natural disasters has been eroded by instability, food shortages and mass displacement in some areas. Over 25 million people are in need of humanitarian aid in the violence-plagued Sahel area, which includes Niger, Chad and Mali.

“Many of those populations live in flood-prone areas. It’s just a matter of time for them to be at risk of epidemics,” Belanger said, describing how quickly diseases can spread once floods wipe out access to clean water and sanitation.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200910&t=2&i=1532955151&r=LYNXMPEG891XR&w=800,"['recent', '760000', 'water', 'chad', 'university', 'central', 'floods', 'west', 'hit', 'parts', 'niger', 'severe', 'niamey', 'africa', 'shortages']", ,flood

An image of trucks and cars on a flooded road has been shared in multiple social media posts claiming to show a submerged highway in Nigeria’s southern Ogun state following a recent heavy downpour. This is partly false; while the location is correct, the photo has been circulating since at least 2019.

The image appears in numerous Facebook posts, including this one published on March 24, 2021, with more than 500 shares.

“Sango Ota bridge, I understand this was yesterday o (sic),” reads the Facebook post published on a page called “Lady K ifeoluwa show”. It has a history of calling for the secession of the Yoruba nation from Nigeria.

Screenshot taken on March 29, 2021, showing the misleading Facebook post

Sango Ota is a town in Nigeria’s southwestern Ogun state and is home to the country’s former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. The majority of inhabitants in the region are Yorubas, a large ethnic group in the west African country.

The rest of the post, translated from Yoruba into English, pleads for the “intervention” of state officials and then declares “end Nigeria now”.

The photo it refers to shows submerged vehicles on a flooded road, and features alongside an almost identical claim in this Facebook post with more than 800 shares, as well as on Twitter.

However, the image has been circulating online for more than a year.

Old photo

Using the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check traced earlier versions of the claim to Facebook accounts here and here on March 22, 2021.

It was reposted on Facebook the next day by Joe Igbokwe, the special adviser to the Lagos state governor for drainage and water resources.

“Sango Bridge after yesterday's rain, this is sign of what the people of that area should be expecting this year except the drainages are cleared. Please tell Ogun State to consult me (sic),” reads Igbokwe’s Facebook post.

AFP Fact Check has previously debunked misleading information shared on Igbokwe’s account.

In this case, AFP Fact Check confirmed that it actually rained in Sango Ota on March 22, 2021, according to the World Weather Online site.

Furthermore, an AFP journalist in Nigeria confirmed that the photo was indeed taken in the town.

However, the viral image is not evidence of any recent rainfall or flooding.

A Google reverse image search led to this Facebook post and the same picture from September 7, 2019, captioned ""Yesterday Rain @ Sango"". Five days later, global humanitarian organisation ReliefWeb reported that heavy rainfall in the preceding weeks had caused flooding in some parts of the country.

Flooding has long been an issue in the town. In 2011, residents called on the government to construct drainage to prevent an environmental disaster.

Now, like thousands of hectares of rice in Nigeria’s Kebbi state, it is under water.

“Almost all my farm has been flooded. I didn’t harvest any rice,” Ladan told Reuters News Agency. “It’s going to be devastating.”

Floods early this month across northwest Nigeria destroyed 90 percent of the two million tonnes that Kebbi state officials expected to harvest this autumn, the head of the state branch of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. The loss amounts to some 20 percent of the rice Nigeria grew last year, and the waters are still rising.

Further south, outside Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, chicken farmer Hippolite Adigwe is also worried. A shortage of maize forced him to sell most of his flock of more than 1,000 birds, and the 300 he has left are hungry. Chicken feed prices have more than doubled, and he is not sure how long he can cope.

Twin crises, floods and maize shortages, come just after movement restrictions and financing difficulties caused by COVID-19 containment measures complicated spring planting.

Some farmers and economists said it could push Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, into a food crisis. Rice is the country’s staple grain, and chicken is a core protein.

“There is a real fear of having food shortages,” Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. “The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Nigeria took roughly 4,000 tonnes of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s (ECOWAS) strategic stocks last month and released 30,000 tonnes of its own maize. It also gave four companies special permission to import maize.

The prominent Nigerian Economic Summit Group has called for “a complete overhaul” of agriculture policy.

Problems accessing foreign exchange to import food are adding to shortages. In July, the central bank added maize to a list of items for which importers are banned from using its dollars. Rice and fertiliser were already on the list, along with other items that Nigeria wants to be made locally.

Last week, even as food prices spiked, President Muhammadu Buhari promised that not one cent of central bank dollars would go to food or fertiliser imports, as Nigeria would continue encouraging local farmers over imports.

Importers can use dollars from pricier parallel markets. But these are tough to find due to an oil price crash that has cut Nigeria’s core source of foreign exchange.

Switching grains

Rice prices had already risen substantially due to a land border closure last year that aimed to stamp out smuggling and boost local production.

The worst is yet to happen. Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex

Peter Clubb of the International Grains Council said the spike drove consumers to eat maize instead. This, along with a disappointing crop late last year and the foreign exchange issues, boosted maize prices to 180,000 naira ($470) per tonne from approximately 70,000 naira ($183) in March.

Farmers sid that consumers grappling with inflation, as well as the first rise in fuel prices since 2016 and a power price spike, can only pay so much more for food.

Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex, said the central bank’s lending scheme for farmers has significantly expanded output, and can work long term.

But the coming months will be tough. Fertiliser prices hit a record after a COVID-19 outbreak shut down country’s sole urea plant for two weeks, meaning more farmers will skip fertilisers, limiting crop yields.

“The worst is yet to happen,” Balogun said. “It is a problem across grains.”

Buhari has pledged more support, and Agriculture Minister Muhammed Sabo Nanono visited the northwest area this weekend and promised to provide farmers with high-quality seeds and to set up a special committee to ensure they have all they need to plant new crops as soon as possible.

Adigwe, the chicken farmer, said he thinks barring foreign food in order to help farmers is not a bad idea, but “there are some factors that were not considered.”

Is the government doing enough?

Over the last few years in Nigeria, seasonal flooding has killed hundreds, destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, and displaced millions of people.

This year, since the rainy season began in June, twelve states have been badly affected. In four of them – Anambra, Delta, Kogi and Niger – the government declared a state of emergency. The National Emergency management agency (NEMA), which coordinate disaster management in Nigeria, estimates that two hundred people have died so far and over 600,000 people have had to flee their homes.

The havoc wrought by heavy rains this year has been devastating. But this level of destruction is not new to Nigeria. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and scores have died in floods. In 2012, particularly severe flooding led to two million displacements and 363 deaths.

Why Nigeria floods

Nigeria’s flooding problem derives from a combination of factors, natural and man-made alike.

On the one hand, rainfall has become significantly heavier in recent years due to climate change. This year, the Niger River reached 11.06m above sea level and could rise further, approaching the record 12.84m of 2012. Water levels have also risen in upstream Cameroon, Mali and Niger. These countries feed the Niger and Benue rivers, which flow through Nigeria. The towns along these two main rivers are particularly vulnerable.

Man-made issues have also contributed to the problem.

For example, Nigeria has several dams along its rivers, ranging from huge hydroelectric stations to smaller constructions for irrigation and fishing. These structures can, in theory, help manage water levels. But in reality, many have been poorly maintained and run, contributing to the build-up of water levels, endangering nearby towns and villages.

“Dams are not necessary facilitators of flood,” says James Akanmu, a water resource and environmental engineering expert. “But we often mismanage dams and they lead us into problems.”

Another contributing factor is a lack of town planning. As Nigeria rapidly urbanises, towns and cities have sprawled with little regard for environmental concerns. Waterways and canals that are crucial for flows are often filled in as part of building developments, while informal settlements in some areas vulnerable to flooding have doubled in population.

“People are building on water ways. People build houses without drainages. The government builds roads without drainages,” says Alabi Soneye, Professor of Geography at the University of Lagos.

“There is pressure in Nigeria cities. Too many people squeezed into small space and everything overstretched,” adds urban planner, Ugochukwu Donald.

The response

In response to this year’s floods, the government pledged $8.2 million for relief efforts as well as declaring a state of emergency in four states. NEMA set up five emergency operation centres to facilitate search and rescue operations and humanitarian support. These efforts have faced huge practical barriers in reaching flood victims, however, while they have also reportedly been undermined by poor management, bad governance and corruption.

Many also argue that such a reactive approach is insufficient in anything but the short-term. Experts say that Nigeria must proactively predict and prepare if it is to reduce the huge damage caused by floods.

Geography professor Soneye argues that the main problem is not planning but implementation. “Master plans are not Nigeria’s problem,” he says. “We have master plan documents, [but] nobody is acting on it. The disaster continues to grow.”

One area in which Nigeria has attempted to establish forward-thinking is through early warning systems. But this has not been straightforward. Nigerian meteorological agencies make predictions about potential flooding and warnings are meant to be sent to locations at risk, but the system is not always effective.

Furthermore, even when information is passed on, there are challenges associated with getting people to act accordingly. Around half of Nigeria’s population lives below the poverty line and moving households to safe areas can be complex and costly.

“It is not enough to tell people to move that the rains are coming. The early warning system needs to provide that support for such response to take place,” says Peter Nwilo, professor of surveying and geo-informatics at the University of Lagos.

Soneye suggests that many citizens are distrustful of state orders and that warning systems should work through local intelligence and community collaboration to be effective. “The people are not in the mood to believe anything that comes from the government,” he says.

Nwilo concurs. “Our warning system needs to be domesticated and localised before it works,” he says. “People are reluctant to comply with the early warning system until disaster catches up with them. Ignorance is huge and we must improve.”

Indeed, as floods continue to devastate areas of Nigeria year on year, the environmental, economic and – most importantly – the human toll is huge. The necessary actions in many cases are known, but as climate changes leads to more unpredictable and heavy rainfall, Nigeria’s flooding problems will only increase unless there is reliable forward planning, sound management and careful implementation.

“The situation is straight forward,” says urban planner Donald. “Flooding is a natural disaster. We cannot entirely rule it out. But somehow, Nigeria has failed to do the right thing: to make corrections from the past.”","Thu, 15 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://africanarguments.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nigeria-flood.jpg,"['problem', 'pours', 'water', 'seasonal', 'flooding', 'huge', 'emergency', 'management', 'floods', 'warning', 'system', 'nigeria', 'rains', 'growing', 'niger', 'nigerias']", ,flood

IT was past noon – lunch time – but there was only one customer at the bukka. Loretta Eze, the proprietor, surveyed the busy street as she stood by the entrance of her restaurant located by the corner of a street in the Wuse 2 area of Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. A number of girls in yellow shirts, who worked as attendants in the restaurant, were hanging around waiting for the solitary customer to finish his meal.

“It was not always like this,” Loretta told The ICIR‘s correspondent, who visited the restaurant while investigating the impact of rising prices of foodstuffs on the preparation and consumption of food, especially jollof rice.

“Food items are very expensive these days and the situation is very hard for those of us that are into catering and food business. Things are hard and as a result, we are not getting as many customers as in the past when things were cheaper,” Loretta added.

Higher cost of foodstuffs has forced restaurants, including roadside bukkas and ‘Mama put‘ joints, to increase the prices of different dishes on their menu and Loretta observed that the development had, in turn, forced some customers to stay away because they could not afford meals as in the past.

Loretta’s observations and concerns mirrored the findings in the SBM Jollof Index report for the first quarter of 2021.

The SBM Jollof Index, developed by SBM Intel, an Africa-focused research firm, simplified the appreciation of food inflationary trends using a common delicacy that most Nigerian households enjoy – jollof rice.

Across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, SBM collects data on the most common ingredients that go into cooking jollof rice in 13 markets on a monthly basis except for December, due to the seasonal spikes caused by Yuletide celebrations. From the prices collated, the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for a family of five or six is averaged and used as a proxy for measuring food inflation across the country.

The commodities that make up the Jollof Index include rice, curry, thyme, seasoning, groundnut oil, chicken/turkey (poultry), beef, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions.

The SBM Index is published three times a year – at the end of the first three quarters. Data from October and November are reflected in the Quarter 1 Jollof Index of the following year.

Cost of making pot of jollof rice rose between March 2020 and March 2021

According to the latest SBM Jollof Index report, the average cost of making a pot of jollof rice rose by 7.8 per cent between March 2020 and March 2021.

The sharp spike in the cost of preparing the delicacy was attributed to a number of events which impacted on food prices. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020, the border closure and foreign exchange restrictions in August 2020 were worsened by a sharp hike in energy tariffs by September of that year.

The situation was further compounded by the the #EndSARS protests, as well as the food blockade imposed by northern traders on the southern part of the country, which disrupted agricultural supply chain and the movement of people and goods.

The reopening of land borders in December 2020 did not result in a significant drop in the cost of food items – the price of a bag of rice only dropped slightly by a margin of N1000 to N3000 depending on the market but that did not translate into a drop in the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for the majority of Nigerians who buy from retailers.

The SBM Jollof Index noted that food prices remained high due to factors such as reduced local production, exchange rate fluctuations, poor harvest due to adverse weather, and high cost of energy and transportation.

Insecurity was also a major factor for the increasing cost of preparing a pot of jollof rice, translating into rising food inflation in Nigeria.

“Some of the jollof rice ingredients such as rice, onions and tomatoes have witnessed reduced local production because of protracted conflicts and terrorist attacks on farmers. Out of the 11 main rice producing states in the country, Benue, Borno, Ebonyi and Kaduna have witnessed attacks on farmers with the most gruesome being the execution of about 110 rice farmers in Borno in November 2020,” the report said.

Faced with deaths from terror attacks in insecure agrarian communities, several farmers are leaving the countryside and moving to the cities to take up menial jobs.

Despite recent drop in inflation rate, Nigerians are still groaning over increasing cost of food items

According to latest figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria’s inflation rate dropped from 18.17 per cent in March 2021 to 18.12 per cent in April 2021.

The 0.05 percentage points decline was the first recorded in headline inflation in about 20 months.

Food inflation also recorded a decline – from 22.95 per cent in March 2021 to 22.72 per cent in April, 2021.

However, while the NBS suggested that inflation might have peaked and could continue to drop, Nigerians are yet to get any reprieve while purchasing foodstuffs.

For Loretta, a food vendor who deals in foodstuffs, the price of food items has continued to spike in the market.

Making a comparison of what was obtainable in the past and the present, she told The ICIR, “Before now, I used to buy a small basket of tomatoes between N300 and N500, but now, it is N1500. Some tomatoes even go for N2500 per basket. Also, a basket of fresh pepper is N1500 now. Before now, you could get a pint of groundnut oil for N300, but it is now N650.”

She added, “Before now, with N2500 or N3000, I could prepare a normal pot of soup or stew but now, if you don’t have at least N7000 you will not get the taste you want due to the high cost of food items.”

Further lamenting the daily hike in the price of staple food items, she observed that, not too long ago, a mudu, or regular measure of beans, was between N250 and N300. But a mudu of beans is N800 now.

“It is the same case as meat. Before now, with N6000 or N8000, you could get the quantity of goat meat that would be enough for you, but now, you will have up to N15000 or more for that same quantity.”

According to her, the increase in the price of onions was ‘manageable’. “The quantity we were getting for N100 before is about N400 or N500 at the moment.”

Loretta also pointed to the sharp increase in the price of rice.

“Before now, a mudu of rice was N300, but now, a mudu of local rice is about N800,” a development which she admitted had increased the cost of preparing a pot of regular jollof rice.

Speaking further, Loretta said, “crayfish and stockfish are totally out of the question” due to recent hike in the prices of the food items.

Nkechi Emmanuel, a housewife, had a frown on her face as she walked out of Dutse Market, in the Bwari area of Abuja. She was clutching a handful of food items.

In a brief encounter with The ICIR‘s correspondent, Nkechi explained that the feeding allowance her husband gave her each month, which was never enough in the best of times, was now barely able to provide a pot of stew and soup.

“It has never been this bad and it is getting worse by the day,” the woman said in a frustrated tone.

All types of foodstuffs are becoming out of reach for the poor and the lower middle-class by the day.

Mary Okon-Essien operates a restaurant in the FCT. She took a break from serving a customer to respond to questions by The ICIR‘s correspondent on May 20.

Okon-Essien stressed that the increase in the prices of basic food items, which had driven up the cost of food, had resulted in reduced patronage for food vendors.

“Before now, the highest amount you could get egusi is N250 or N300 for a mudu, but now, a mudu of egusi is N700 or N800.

“The situation is very difficult for those of us that are into food business. Due to the high cost of foodstuff, it is not easy to sell and make profit anymore because customers are having problems with the higher prices,” she said.

Garri is generally regarded as ‘poor man’s food,’ but Okon-Essien said that was in the past.

“Garri is longer a poor man’s food. A mudu of garri is now N500,” she told The ICIR.

Okon-Essien also noted that another staple foudstuff – red oil – had become more expensive.

“Before now, you could get a tin of red oil for N200, but now, it is not less than N500,” she said, while observing that the situation was more worrisome because the food items were locally produced and not imported.

Besides becoming more expensive, some food items which Nigerians took for granted, due to their availability, are becoming scarce.

The increase in the price of fufu, a cassava meal, goes with the increasing scarcity of the food item, according to Okon-Essien.

“Fufu is a food item that is loved by Nigerians but right now, fufu is scarce and that has made it very expensive. I don’t know if Nigerians are not planting cassava again. Fish has also become very expensive. People now find it very difficult to afford fish for their meals.”

Okon-Essien corroborated the findings of the SBM Jollof Index for the first quarter of 2021.

“Not too long ago, with as little as N1000, you could prepare a pot of jollof rice for your family because with that amount, you would get rice and some amount of crayfish, onion, maggi and other foodstuff you needed. But now, that N1000 will only be enough for a mudu of foreign rice and if you want to cook local rice, then you will need N700 or N800 to buy a mudu of rice and as a result, you will not have much left for the ingredients needed for the jollof rice.”

Highlighting the dismal impact of high food inflation on the food industry, she observed, “Before now, when it was lunch time, you would see many people coming to eat, but now, lunch time seems like morning time, you hardly see anybody. You only see a few people coming to eat and this is because there is no money and everybody is ‘checking his pocket.’ Before now, they could get a plate of food for N250 or N300, but the least you can get a plate of now is N400 or N500,” the woman said.

The number of customers in restaurants has dropped, Okon-Essien noted.

Inflation rate still very high despite recorded decline

Nigeria’s inflation rate might have recorded a marginal decline in April but it remains very high and this is especially so for food inflation.

This was stated by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) which decried the current inflation rate of 18.12 per cent.

Director General of LCCI Muda Yusuf noted that despite the recently recorded decline in the inflation rate, “food inflation at over 22 per cent is still very high in spite of the marginal moderation in food prices in April 2021.”

Yusuf said the situation had continued to exert a negative impact on the activities of every economic agents, including households, businesses and investors, with profound impact on the citizenry, particularly the low and middle-income households.

“The high level of inflation continues to dampen consumer purchasing power at a time households incomes are not increasing in proportion to cost,” he said, adding that the development had resulted in rising production costs and depressed margins for businesses.

Nigeria at risk of famine

Meanwhile, the latest SBM Jollof Index report, which said Nigeria was currently on a slippery slope, noted that Nigeria might experience famine in the nearest future if production, consumption and political-economic dynamics remained unchanged from what was currently obtainable.

Noting that decline in food availability, exponential population growth and decline in entitlements were the main contributors to famine, the report observed that “history shows that the famines with the highest mortality rates resulted from poor harvests, natural disasters (droughts, flood), war/conflict, poor governance and policy failures – conditions which Nigeria fulfills easily.”

The SBM Jollof Index noted that over the last 10 years, food production in Nigeria had been dismally affected by continuous conflicts between farmers and herders in the Middle Belt, where more than 62,000 farmers were displaced from their homeland between 2010 and 2015, including terrorist attacks on farmers in the North-East and bandits’ onslaught in the North-West.

Added to these are adverse weather conditions and decreasing agricultural land due to urbanisation, and the effects of governance failure and some government policies, such as border closer, foreign exchange restriction, hike in electricity tariff and petrol pump price.

The SBM Jollof Index stated that the different factors had combined to continuously drive up food prices in Nigeria.

Poverty rising

The 2020 report by World Poverty Clock showed that over 105 million Nigerians lived in extreme poverty – as against 98 million in October 2019. The figure represented more than 51 per cent of the population.

This placed Nigeria as world poverty capital for two years running. Unemployment in Nigeria reached 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020. Nigeria is among most miserable countries in Africa, scoring 50.6 points in March 2021, as against 14.8 points in Ghana, 6.9 in Ethiopia, 13 in Kenya and 12.1 points in Egypt, among others.","Fri, 21 May 2021 17:07:41 GMT",https://www.icirnigeria.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Goat-meat-jollof-rice.jpg,"['sbm', 'inflation', 'food', 'mudu', 'cost', 'worsening', 'jollof', 'signals', 'rising', 'prices', 'index', 'pot', 'insecurity', 'preparing', 'rice', 'nigerias']", ,flood

As of 23 October, flooding has affected 2.2 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Nigeria, Togo and the Central African Republic, and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1541305-West%20and%20Central%20Africa%20-%20Flooding%20Situation%20As%20of%2023%20October%202020.png?itok=ZU-fKzR-,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', '23', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'rains', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

Respective National Societies, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), are working to respond to each of these disasters through different means. Some have Disaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREFs) or Emergency Appeals (EAs) launched, and others may require additional support in the future.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

In West Coast, Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Ghana have also experienced flooding throughout August-September 2020.","Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539716-Africa%20-%20Floods%20and%20multiple%20disasters%20-%20Information%20bulletin%2C%2006%20September%202020.png?itok=7OMwtMBe,"['affected', 'chad', 'sudan', 'flooding', '06', 'bulletin', '2020', 'floods', 'states', 'displaced', 'multiple', 'rains', 'information', 'niger', 'disasters', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

Thousands of people have been displaced following weeks of heavy rainfall in some central and southern states, the country's emergency response agency, NEMA said Tuesday.

Nigeria's two major rivers have burst their banks sweeping away homes in the central part of the country.

Residents steer a dugout canoe past flooded houses in Lokoja capital of Kogi State on September 14, 2018.

The agency warned the situation could worsen as water levels continue to rise in Lokoja capital of Kogi State, which lies at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers and is often one of the most affected states during the rainy season.

Five emergency operation centers have been created to coordinate search and rescue operations, while also providing humanitarian support for those displaced by the floods, Sani Datti, a spokesman for NEMA said.

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

Lagos State plans to stop being a receiver of processed rice and start processing its own Lake Rice, starting with the Kebbi State government.

Continuous heavy rainfall since July reached its peak in late September, causing severe and extensive flooding in 34 out of 36 states in Nigeria. Two major rivers, the Niger River and Benue River overflowed into the surrounding communities resulting in widespread destruction. The Nigerian government has declared a state of emergencies in nine states. The floods have affected 1.9 million people, destroyed 82,000 houses, displaced 210,000 people and devastated crops and livestock. Though flood water has receded in some communities, many people still do not have homes, businesses and farms to return to. They continue to seek refuge in schools and other public buildings where conditions are extremely poor. Fear of health outbreaks including malaria, cholera and typhoid remain high, as sanitary conditions have deteriorated especially in the temporary shelters.

Red Cross Actions

The International Red Cross has mobilized HKD 2 million from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to support the Nigerian Red Cross Society’s immediate relief activities. An emergency appeal was launched on 21 September 2018 seeking HKD 43.7 million globally targeting to assist 300,000 people for nine months in 10 states.

Since the onset of the floods the Nigerian Red Cross Society has mobilized over 2,000 volunteers and supported affected communities with evacuations, search and rescue, distribution of food and essential household items, provided first aid, psychosocial support and sensitized communities on good hygiene practices.

Besides other factors threatening food security in Nigeria, including the seemingly intractable terrorism, banditry and killer herdsmen's onslaught which are steadily spreading across the country, harvest of farm produce might be imperiled this year and even the next as a result of flooding.

In Kebbi State for instance, 500,000 hectares was recently devastated by flood, 450,000 hectares of it being for rice farms.

This has heightened fears that by next year, majority of farmers in the state, particularly rice farmers, would be out of business.

Many farmlands visited by our correspondent were overrun by floods, just as rice farms were submerged.

A farmer, Libabatu Usman Kamba, expressed fears over imminent food scarcity, particularly as most of the farmers would not be able to mobilize for the next farming season due to the zero harvest this year.

Kamba said she cultivated over 20 hectares of rice this year at Cida Kai village in Dandi Local Government Area but lost over 16 hectares of the rice farm to flood.

She said her crop was ready for harvest and was hoping to get 40 bags of rice per hectare and 700 bags of paddy rice.

Though she could not say what she spent on the hectares submerged in the flood, she added that most farmers would not be able to go for dry season farming this year, hence the need for urgent government intervention.

""The losses recorded this year are so enormous that majority of small holder farmers would not go back for this year's dry season farming.

""The usual practice by most farmers is to re-invest what they realized from rainy season farming for dry season farming,"" she said.

Zuwaira Abubakar, another rice farmer in Argungu, said barely all rice farms in the area were submerged and that would affect farmers' capital for dry season farming. Zuwaira, who cultivated over 25 hectares of rice, said she lost all to flood, adding that she had spent over N300,000 in the farm before the flood came.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid. Many of us will be out of business if no intervention comes our way.

""Farmers don't keep money, the more we make in the business the more we open more farmlands, that is the secret of the farming business otherwise you won't last long in it,"" she said.

In Danko Wasagu Local Government Area, a farmer, Usman Umar, told Daily Trust that they did not experience massive destruction as was the case in most parts of the state, noting that only about a hectare of seven hectares of his rice farm was washed away by the flood.

Another farmer, Suleiman Bashir, who stood helplessly by his rice farm which was submerged along Dukku/Makera road in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area, appealed to the state and federal governments to come to their aid.

""I don't know what to do, I have two large rice farms and they have been completely submerged.

""We are appealing to the state and federal governments to assist us,"" he said.

The chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Sani Dododo, said farm produce worth over N5 billion was destroyed by flood.

He added that the loss recorded in rice farming could be put at 90 percent of the total value of farm produce in the state.

""Over 500,000 hectares of farmlands have been destroyed by flood, the destruction translates to over N5billion worth of farm produce.

""Rice farms constitute to about 90 percent of the farm produce destroyed,"" he said.

The National President of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Aminu Goronyo, who toured some of the affected places while in the entourage of the Kebbi State governor, described the incident as devastating.

Goronyo assured the farmers of federal government intervention because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had sent its officials to the state to assess the situation for immediate intervention.

""The CBN governor has directed RIFAN to mobilise one million farmers that can produce five million metric tonnes of rice during the dry season commencing in November for support,"" he said.

Also speaking with newsmen at Bakin Gada in Argungu Local Government Area after inspecting rice farms destroyed in some local government areas, Governor Abubakar Bagudu expressed shock over the incident, describing it as regrettable.

Thousands rendered homeless in Bauchi

Thousands of displaced people including women and children and the aged have moved into public schools, primary healthcare centres and shops while hundreds of others have relocated to neighboring Jama'are, Azare and Giade local government areas of Bauchi State for shelter.

When our correspondent visited some of the affected areas on Wednesday, dozens of families had taken refuge at various public schools including the Adamami Primary School which was still occupied by the flood.

A victim and father of 11 children, Hamisu Magaji, said three families were sharing two classes.

""One class is accommodating 42 children sleeping on school desks while the male heads of families are sleeping on tables because water has taken over the environment.

""We are staying here due to the flood which destroyed our houses, properties, food and farmlands but we leave everything to God.

""We are yet to receive support or assistance from anybody four days after the incident, life has been difficult, especially taking care of the families but we are struggling to feed them, that notwithstanding, we are appealing to the government and organizations to come to our aid,"" he said.

His daughter, 18-year-old Halima Hamisu, who cooked food for children in the camp, told Daily Trust how they managed to sleep on school desks.

""We arrange the desks laying mats on top and putting long sticks on four angles to hang mosquito nets.

""We line up between 8 and 12 children inside the net and that is how we have managed in this class for the past four days as our mothers have relocated to a nearby village because they are nursing babies,"" she said.

A woman with four children at the Government Day Secondary School camp in Adamami, Barakana Mohammed, said her six months old daughter had been infected with cold.

""I have been sleeping on the floor with my children for four days due to the flood that destroyed our house and property and the bad condition coupled with the weather affecting the children.

""Life has become difficult living in a classroom but we pray for God's intervention.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid.""

A 60-year-old woman, Aishatu Abdullahi, now taking refuge at the camp, decried the absence of essential commodities and the sanitary situation in the camp, saying, ""We don't have food in the camp because water has destroyed everything and the little our caregivers are struggling to bring to the camp is not enough as we have small children.

""I am appealing to the government and privileged individuals in the name of God to support us with food and other relief materials so as to rescue us from additional hardship.""

The village head of Adamami, Malam Isa Nalaraba, said the flood had caused a lot of destruction but, ""We thank God for saving our lives and our children because almost more than half of Adamami is destroyed by the flood which displaced many people to neighboring communities while others have become refugees in their locality while many other residents have relocated to neighboring towns and villages.

""We are appealing to the government and individuals to assist the victims with relief materials to support them and continue their lives.""

Habiba Sani who was to wed in three months and three others including a 14-year-old girl and a 60-year-old woman drowned in flood waters in Bakatma, Shira Local Government Area of the state.

Habiba's father, Malam Sani Biidis, told Daily Trust that he was away when his neighbor invited her and his daughter to accompany him to remove weeds in a rice farm beside a river that was flooded following heavy downpour.

He described the deceased as a kind hearted and obedient girl who hardly argued or disagreed with people within and outside the family.

""They met their sad end when they tried to cross the river at a point where everybody including children used to pass from the village because the area is not deep or wide but as a result of the flood the volume and speed of the water had increased, unfortunately the moment they entered the river the flow dragged them down and they could not swim out of the water.

""It was some children who witnessed the incident that rushed to inform the family that they tried to cross the river but drowned in the process.

""When they launched the search operation their corpses were found in a nearby area some meters from the point of passage.

""I was away from home when I received a phone call that my daughter and one other girl had drowned.

""Habiba's death is painful but I leave everything to God and pray for their souls,"" Bidis said.

Badamasi Shittu, the father of the 14-year-old Ziyada Badamasi, said he asked them to go to his rice farm to assist him remove weeds and apply fertilizer.

""My daughter, Ziyada, told me that they would go before I arrived to apply the fertilizer.

""When they reached the point where people cross the river, they met some children but decided to cross and when they reached the center of the river, Ziyada shouted for help as the flow pulled them down and there was no mature person around to rescue them.

""It was one of the children who rushed home and notified us that Habiba and Ziyada had drowned,"" he said.

The Acting Permanent Secretary in the State Emergency Management Agency, Habu Ningi, said the flood affected 11 villages including Adamami, Bakatma, Alkaleri, Sawi, Dirmi, dago, Shira, Yana , Bege, Bukul, Fago , Tsafi and Disina all, in Shira LGA.

Bakatma village, Adamami, Alkaleri, and Disina town and other villages in Shira Local Government Area were flooded following heavy downpour between Sunday and Monday morning, destroying over 2,600 houses and many hectares of farmlands.

A resident of Adamami, Adamu Oni Adamami, said the heavy rain started on Sunday and around 11 pm people in the town were confused because water had taken over everywhere, gushing into houses at a high speed.

""The rain continued unabated and people started running for safety, especially women and children, to higher areas.

""The rain did not stop until 6am on Monday thousands of houses collapsed and many hectares of farmlands were destroyed.""

Oni added; ""Another devastation the flood caused is destruction of food.

""Apart from losing houses majority of the victims have no food and the farmlands have been destroyed, leaving us in a big calamity now and in future because the time to cultivate new crops has passed.

""We are calling on the government, individuals and corporate organizations to come to our aid before the situation goes out of hand.""

Niger farmers count losses

Many farmlands have been wiped out in Niger State where there is wide lamentation among farmers who are appealing to the government to come to their aid.

Our correspondent gathered that entire farmlands were washed away by floods, leaving farmers with nothing to harvest.

An affected farmer, Tukura Saidu from Kuyi village, said over 40 farmers were affected in his village as yams, maize and rice planted were all wiped out, adding that it was the first time of experiencing such a huge loss to flood.

Also, fish worth over N100 million were washed away by flood at Lapai Gwari in Bosso Local Government Area of the state, it was gathered.

A fish farm according to Daily Trust findings, the major place where fish sellers get fresh fish, was greatly affected, causing a rise in the price of fish in the area as residents now have to travel elsewhere to get fish.

A fish farmer, Malam Mohammad Tukur, lamented that the devastation caused by ravaging floods in Lapai Gwari was the first of its kind and appealed to the state government to urgently assist them.

He said about 2000 fish farms had been washed away.

Another farmer, Malam Abdullahi Saidu, said customers from across Nigeria were trooping to the farm before the incident but many farmers had lost millions of naira worth of investments to floods.

The Vice Chairman of Bosso Local Government Area, Malam Saidu Zegi, said in April this year, rainstorms affected over 200 people, just as many farmers lost their farmlands.

The Director General, Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, described the incident as not only pathetic and tragic but also devastating.

Inga said they had sent a team of experts from the agency to investigate the extent of damage caused.

This according to him is to enable the state government come up with modalities of assisting victims.

He said though the state government was battling with insufficient funds occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, it would not fold its arms to allow the people suffer without any aid.

Floods hit Enugu farms

Enugu State is not left out of the massive flooding and destruction of crops. Mr. Austin Obiora has a rice farm of about 235 hectares at Ihuokpara community in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

Speaking with Daily Trust, he recalled how a heavy rainfall on August 26 caused a massive flood which affected his farm. About 16 hectares of the rice field was adversely affected.

According to him, the rice had started flowering when the flood came.

""I had to start afresh because the rice planting season was almost over.

""I started doing another ""broadcasting"" (spreading) of rice seeds in a systematic and orderly way to enable them germinate very well,"" he said.

""It costs about N250,000 to cultivate one hectare of rice field and when multiplied by 16 hectares, it will be over N4m because I have to add the cost of labour,"" Obiora said, adding: ""Therefore, I lost over N4m due to the massive and devastating flood.""

He, however, didn't feel discouraged by the huge loss because he said upon realizing that some large hectares were still there for him, the unaffected hectares represent compensation for his loss.

""We pray that it doesn't happen again in the next planting season, nobody wants to incur losses,"" he said.

Asked whether any government agency came to his aide, he said he considered it would be a waste of time and energy to approach any government body, just as he did not insure his farm in the first place.

However, Obiora said he had learnt his lesson as he has started making arrangements for insuring his farms in future.

Another farmer, an elderly Rev Dr Lambert Echetu who is into maize and cassava farming, told our correspondent that the combined misfortune of flooding and activities of herdsmen had caused a lot of havoc to his maize farm of two hectares at Amagunze in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

He said: ""The cattle and flood messed up my maize farm.

""I planted maize covering two hectares.

""I spent about N240,000 on clearing the bush, seeds and fertilizer.

""We went to the Government House, Enugu to complain about the Fulani herdsmen and their cows destroying our farms.

""The first tragedy was done to the farm by the cows.

""The second tragedy was caused by the huge flooding, even though the place is swampy.

""When I got to the Government House, they would refer me from one office to the other and it was like a wild goose chase and I left,"" he said.

Echetu further said: ""As a servant of God, when I tried to get help from people and I didn't succeed, I handed everything over to God.

""I love farming because I have passion for it.

""I prayed over the farm project before I decided to farm.

""I have a lot of people who need my help in the village.

""My intention is after harvesting the maize, and bringing it to the church, I will distribute the maize to the congregation.""

He said despite the setback, he won't give up farming and had acquired over 100 hectares of land at Ihu-Okpara community, specifically for planting cassava in the next planting season.

Kano, Jigawa farmers cry out

Last month, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) revealed that 20 of the 44 local government areas in Kano State were at high risk of flooding during this year's rainy season.

Tarauni, Garum Malam, Rimin Gado, Gaya, Gezawa, Gwale, Shanono, Gabasawa, Gwarzo, Ungoggo, Warawa, Dawakin Kudu, Dambatta, Bebeji, Kabo, Wudil, Kura, Nassarawa, Kano Municipal and Kumbotso were the local government areas identified in the report.

With the recent wave of rainfall in the state, some of the identified local governments have already begun to experience heavy flooding which resulted in the destruction of several hectares of farmlands by flood, causing loss of millions of naira worth of farm products.

According to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) in Kano, so far, hundreds of rice farmers in five local governments have reported to have been affected by the flood.

The state chapter chairman of RIFAN, Alhaji Haruna Abubakar Aliyu, said farmers in Dambatta, Makoda, Ajingi, Gaya and Rinim Gado have been seriously affected by the flooding.

""Based on the directives received from the RIFAN head office after we had sent our report on the damages caused to our various members, the head office asked us to compile a detailed report on the flood which currently we are working on.

""We have so far identified five local governments, though we are aware there are more than that but we are still working on it,"" he said.

The state chapter chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Alhaji Zubairu Ibrahim, said the association was still assessing the areas affected and number of farmers and farm lands affected.

He added that the outcome of the ongoing assessment would be made public and the association was working on measures to be adopted in assisting the affected farmers.

Attempts to contact the state commissioner for agriculture and who is also the deputy governor proved abortive but sources close to the ministry said a committee had been inaugurated by the state government to look into the issue and present its report for further action.

In Jigawa State, following a two-day heavy downpour in Birninkudu Local Government Area, several houses and farmlands were said to have been destroyed.

Alhaji Wada Faka, the chairman of the local government, said a yet-to-be ascertained number of houses and farmlands were destroyed in Malamawar Gangaran, Babaldu, Wurno, Kiyako and Samamiya villages.

NEMA had also stated that the Nigerian Hydrological Agency (NIHSA) 2020 Annual Flood Outlook already listed 12 local government areas in the state as flood-prone areas.

The NIHSA report listed Kaugama, Taura, Guri, Gwaram, Dutse, Auyo, Miga, Malam Madori, Ringim, Birniwa, Jahun and Kafin Hausa as probable flood risk areas.

Nasarawa farmers groan under flood

Many farms and farming communities were recently submerged in flood waters in Nasarawa, a state with many small, medium and large scale farms.

A farmer in Doma Local Government Area, Abu Doma, said his farm and many others were washed away in a few days.

Same goes with people residing on the bank of the River Benue along the state's boundary with Benue State.

This is the second year in a row that River Kilema in Lafia has flooded and submerged farms, houses and cemeteries among others.

An official of the State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) who prefers anonymity said it was taking measures to mitigate a possible humanitarian crisis in the state.

The agency has been urging those living in flood-prone areas to leave such places.

He said last month, heavy floods occurred in three local government areas including Awe, Nasarawa and Toto.

The Director of flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr. Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umasha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.","Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn03.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00521229:97559b81f1c74f189f2c92809408b0aa:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'washed', 'children', 'homes', 'flood', 'local', 'farm', 'area', 'farmlands', 'nigeria', 'tears', 'state', 'away', 'rice', 'hectares']", ,none
48,48,FL-2020-000196-NGA,A Flood of Polluting Air Conditioners Hampers Africa's Climate Efforts - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-flood-of-polluting-air-conditioners-hampers-africas-climate-efforts,"As air conditioning sales in Africa soar, many of the units imported there are old and inefficient, driving up electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. But some countries are taking action, banning the import of used air conditioners and adopting tough energy standards.

It’s early August and a dozen air conditioners are keeping Joy Obehi’s clients cool on another hot steamy day in Lagos, Nigeria. But invariably the electricity flickers off and her expensive diesel generator rumbles to life. “The power goes out pretty much every day, usually for one hour or two hours,” said Obehi, who rents out short-term meeting space and spends as much as $300 a month on diesel fuel. “[Air conditioners] use a lot of power, but our clients expect our locations to be cooler.” As African incomes rise and the number of hotter days from climate change increases, demand is exploding for air conditioners around the continent. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, more than 500,000 air conditioning units are bought each year and the number is increasing by 4 to 5 percent annually, according to a recent report. But that demand comes at a price: the plethora of energy-sapping — but inexpensive — air conditioners that are stressing already overburdened electricity grids, saddling consumers with high energy bills, contributing to more frequent outages that damage local economies, and making a significant contribution to the continent’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of used and new inefficient AC appliances are being sold in Africa every year, many of them illegally. Many are obsolete secondhand appliances imported mostly from Europe, despite international laws forbidding such activity. The appliances also contain banned ozone-depleting refrigerants that are potent contributors to climate change.

Electricity demand for air conditioners is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040.

And with cooling demand proliferating due to urbanization and hotter temperatures, Africa’s air conditioning market is poised to get bigger. Electricity demand for air conditioners and other cooling appliances is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040, from 11 terawatt-hours (TWh) to 112 terawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency. If African countries adopt stricter air conditioning efficiency standards, energy demand could be cut in half, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 million tons by 2040, according to the United Nations. Africa’s cooling challenge is part of a much larger trend. Worldwide demand for air conditioners is expected to more than triple in the next 30 years, from 1.6 billion units in 2018 to 5.6 billion units by 2050. That amounts to 10 new air conditioners being sold every second for the next three decades. Without government policies to make air conditioners cleaner and more efficient, greenhouse gas emissions from ACs and other cooling equipment will jump by a projected 90 percent by 2050 — a huge step backward in international efforts to limit global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, says a new UN report. Now, some African countries are trying to tamp down on energy-guzzling cooling. Ghana is successfully enforcing a ban on imports of used cooling appliances, including air conditioners. Rwanda approved a similar ban, along with Africa’s toughest-ever energy performance standards for new cooling appliances, both of which are set to come into effect next year. A half-dozen other countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, have minimum performance standards for new air conditioners and refrigerators. But success is still largely elusive due to weak policies and minimal enforcement. “There are not many harmonized efficiency policies at the moment in Africa, and many of them are out of date, not enforced, and not stringent,” said Patrick Blake, a policy expert at the UN’s United for Efficiency Program (U4E).

Among the countries struggling with the issue is Nigeria, Africa’s second-largest AC market behind Egypt. “Compliance with our energy standards is very, very slow,” said Etiosa Uyigue, executive director of a Nigerian environmental group, the Community Research and Development Center (CREDC), which has been pushing for more stringent mandatory energy standards and environmentally friendly refrigerants for all cooling appliances sold in the country. The stakes are enormous. Air conditioner sales are rising steadily across the continent, especially in hotter, more prosperous countries in West Africa. Morocco, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast have all seen a doubling in air conditioner imports since 2010, whether used or new units, according to government data. The United Nations projects that air conditioner stocks will hit 1.5 billion units in Africa by 2030, up from 660 million in 2015. The strains are already being felt. Nigeria’s limited power supplies, which are half the size of North Carolina’s despite having nearly 20 times more people, turn on and off every day and occasionally cause national blackouts, as happened 11 times in 2019. Hot sticky days when air conditioners are humming full throttle are the worst. “We just had two outages today,” said Uyigue, speaking in July from his home in the capital Abuja, where he uses three generators and a small solar energy system to keep the lights on. A Nigeria Energy Commission study in 2014 estimated that air conditioners account for 25 percent of total energy consumption in Abuja and 17 percent nationally. Nigeria’s annual CO2 emissions have tripled since 1990. The country’s widespread reliance on noisy, polluting diesel generators costs the economy nearly $14 billion a year, primarily in added fuel expenses. Meanwhile, Africa is tethered to an AC market dominated by high-polluting inefficient appliances.

Many air conditioners sold in Africa are low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made.

For years, many African countries have been flooded with millions of antiquated secondhand air conditioners and refrigerators imported primarily from Europe. Nigeria and other West African countries with high summer temperatures and close proximity to European shipping ports are especially popular destinations for used cooling appliances, which arrive stuffed into containers, cargo vehicles, and even used cars. The appliances are often broken and those that still work often consume two to three times more electricity than new models. “They come in branded as new, but when they’re off-loaded it’s mostly near-end-of-life e-waste,” said Leslie Adogame, executive director of SRADev, a Nigerian nonprofit environmental health research group. “They’re certainly cheaper to buy, but they use a lot more energy and don’t meet environmental standards.” A half-dozen African countries have joined a United Nations working group, launched in April, that is trying to stop these flows, many of which are unlawful. Shipping non-working electronic equipment is illegal under both the Basel Convention, an international treaty governing hazardous waste, and the European Union’s Waste Shipment Directive. New cooling appliances being sold in Africa are not much better. Recent research by the energy efficiency nonprofit CLASP and the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development (IGSD) showed that 35 percent of new room air conditioners sold in Africa’s 10 largest countries in 2018 were low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China. A quarter of the 650,000 low-efficiency units — none of which meet common efficiency standards used in developed countries — were imported from non-African countries, primarily China. The remaining three-quarters were largely imported and then assembled in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Egypt.

“Environmentally harmful dumping is occurring in Africa,” said Gabrielle Dreyfus, senior scientist at IGSD. “These kinds of markets deprive consumers of a smarter choice by flooding markets with lower-price products that cost consumers more over time.” The report also showed that 790,000 air conditioning units sold in Africa contained obsolete ozone-depleting, greenhouse gas refrigerants known as R-22, which are being phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol. Another 820,000 units contained R-410A refrigerants, a highly potent greenhouse gas with 2,000 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide. They are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol’s Kigali Amendment, beginning in 2019 in developed countries and later this decade in developing countries. Efforts to halt these damaging trade flows have been going on for years, but most have been unsuccessful, in large part simply because more and more African consumers want affordable devices to stay cool. Ghana is a noteworthy exception. Alarmed by the millions of obsolete cooling appliances that were entering the country and the widening gap between energy demand and power production, the country banned all used air conditioner and refrigerator imports in 2008. In 2013, when the government began enforcing the ban, illegal imports plummeted. Last year, new appliances, mostly from China, made up 95 percent of the market. “We succeeded in reversing the market in favor of new appliances,” said Kofi Agyarko, director of energy efficiency and climate change at the Ghana Energy Commission, who credits tough enforcement for catalyzing the shift. While new, more efficient appliances cost two to three times as much as used ones, they consume a third as much electricity, with Ghanaians saving on average $140 a year on energy bills, Agyarko said. But even if countries can effectively ban used imports, how can they limit the flood of inefficient new appliances into Africa? Rwanda thinks it has the answer. Last year, as part of a comprehensive national cooling strategy, Rwanda enacted Africa’s toughest energy standards and energy labeling for new air conditioners and other cooling appliances. The mandatory standards, which take effect next year, are modeled after guidelines developed by the UN’s United for Efficiency program. Brian Holuj, who leads the program’s work on cooling appliances, says Rwanda’s efforts are an important breakthrough. “For the first time in Africa, Rwanda will demonstrate the impact of mandatory policies, coupled with strong energy efficiency requirements and limits on global warming-damaging coolants in new products,” he said.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, AC energy demand would be cut in half from current projections.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, air conditioning energy demand would be cut in half from current projections, according to the UN. “More than two-dozen full-sized power plants could be avoided through more efficient air conditioners and refrigerators in Africa,” Holuj said. A critical step, Holuj said, is for countries to come together regionally on consistent policies, backed by enforcement, that send a strong market signal to the industry. “The key is regional alignment,” he said, citing the EU’s success in developing common requirements and energy labeling. Dreyfus, the scientist at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, echoed this point: As long as markets for cheap products are able to flourish, high-efficiency appliances will have a hard time competing. “If a manufacturer feels they have to compete for market share by selling low-efficiency obsolete equipment, we have to close the loopholes to bring the market up so that they have the right marketplace in which to sell better products,” she said. Nigeria has tried some of the approaches Ghana and Rwanda are using, but they are not working, according to CREDC’s Uyigue. Nigeria imposed an import ban on obsolete used cooling appliances in 2010, but it is not being enforced. It adopted voluntary energy performance standards and energy labels for air conditioners in 2017, but compliance is broadly lacking. Numerous obstacles are impeding progress. The first is price — a low-performing air conditioner costs only $100 to $200. The second is trade barriers such as a 20 percent duty on imported assembled air conditioners, an important source of government revenue. The third — perhaps the biggest — is the government’s unwillingness to take the tough steps necessary to force a market shift.","Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/site/GP01QLI_High_res_Nigeria_web.jpg,"['africa', 'air', 'demand', 'climate', 'hampers', 'flood', 'conditioners', 'africas', 'efforts', 'cooling', 'used', 'units', 'appliances', 'countries', 'energy', 'polluting']", ,flood
49,49,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Nigeria: 10 Things Nigerians Should Expect in 2021 - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/202101030130.html,"The year 2020 has come and gone with its challenges which include the coronavirus pandemic, banditry, kidnapping, terrorism and several other depressing episodes, and of course some spirit-lifting events. Here, Daily Trust on Sunday gives a list of what to expect this New Year.

Increased agitation for 2023

There is likely going to be increased agitation ahead of the 2023 general elections this year, and among other issues, whether or not zoning will determine who political parties decide to make their flagbearer, for the presidency.

The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) is likely to entrench its position on the subject, as its president, Alhaji Yerima Shetima, has rejected the agitation for the zoning of the number one position. Holding the same position is Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari's nephew, who said competency and not zoning should be the consideration in electing Buhari's successor.

However, people like Alhaji Shuaib Mustapha Kano, political adviser to a former governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, are likely to remain adamant on zoning the presidency to Eastern Nigeria.

Both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have debated whether or not their parties' tickets should be zoned to the North or to the South. This debate will most likely deepen this year.

Floods still in sight

Flooding has become one of the disasters that never seems to go away, and 2020 is a typical example. It happened again despite forecasts by the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and the Hydrological Services Agency (HAS) that revealed there would be massive flooding across many states from the beginning of the year. Also, donor agencies and even private firms repeatedly warned of the impending and imminent floods. The floods came and agricultural output and property worth billions were lost. It happened in Akwa Ibom State where 100 houses were destroyed and 300 persons displaced in Eket Local Government Area (LGA) in 2020, and in Borno where hundreds of shelters in Internally Displaced People's (IDP) camps were destroyed. Thousands of people were displaced and property destroyed in several parts of the country.

A report by Relief Web posted on October 19, 2020, indicated that flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara states, among others, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas.

In Kebbi State were a massive flood ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5bn and rendered people homeless, the Director of Flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umaisha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.

This is an example of promises Nigerians continue to get and there is no certainty that this will not happen again.

COVID-19 vaccine for 20m people

The Federal Government is making efforts to procure 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 to check the spread of the virus. Everything being equal, this means less than a quarter of Nigeria's over 200 million population may be vaccinated. Nigeria's Health Minister, Osagie Ehanire, who said this at a press conference in December, 2020, pointed out that health sector employees would be vaccinated first, then the vulnerable and those with chronic illnesses.

So far, Nigeria has recorded not less than 70,500 COVID-19 cases with 1,184 fatalities, and more than 65,000 patients have recovered from the disease. As of January 1, 2021, 1074 new confirmed cases and deaths were recorded. Therefore, there is a high possibility of another lockdown in 2021 to curtail the spread of the virus across states, but whether this would have a positive impact is left to be seen because there are arguably more Nigerians in slums and ghettos where families share toilet facilities and other basic amenities, and then there is the danger of a rise in criminality and rape as was the case in 2020.

Budget increase impact

President Muhammadu Buhari recently signed into law the 2021 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly. The National Assembly had on December 21, 2020, passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill with an aggregate expenditure of N13,588,027,886,175 trillion.

It comprises total Capital Supplementation of N1,060,751,051,650 and total Capital Expenditure of N4,125,149,354,222. Statutory Transfer stands at N496,528,471,273; Rrecurrent Expenditure of N5,641,970,060,680 with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 3.00 per cent.

The National Assembly also provided N3,324,380,000tn for debt servicing which would obviously serve as a drain on the country's finances.

The legislators had increased the budget estimate by N505,607,317,942 from the estimate of N13,082,420,568,233 presented to the joint sitting of the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 8, 2020. This means Nigeria would have more money to pump into vital sectors of the economy like healthcare, education and security.

Insecurity still looms

The abduction of over 300 schoolboys by gunmen in an all-boys Government Science School in Kankara, Katsina State, is probably one of the biggest highlights of insecurity in 2020. Even though the boys have been released, the incident still raises questions about Nigeria's dwindling security. Kidnappings continue to happen on the Kaduna-Abuja road, Lokoja-Abuja Expressway, the Obajana-Okene axis in Kogi State, among others. In the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, Kuje Area Council has recorded several cases of people being abducted, particularly in their homes. Terrorism in the North East and banditry in Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna states, among others, is yet to stop and there is no clear sign that 2021 is going to be different. Nigeria still has the same security chiefs from 2020 and the cost of goods and services are still on the rise.

Stiffer laws against rape, gender-based violence

In June, 2020, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, said Nigeria recorded 717 rape incidents between January and May of the same year. This was before the lockdown due to COVID-19 which saw a spike in rape cases and gender-based violence. Some states have since taken steps to tackle the issue. One of such is Kaduna, where Governor Nasir el-Rufai signed into law the amended Penal Code Law 2020 that provides for stiff penalties for rape of a child, including death, surgical castration for male convicts, and bilateral salpingectomy for female rapists.

Also, in 2019 Nigeria launched a sex offenders' register as a vital step towards tackling reported cases of sexual abuse. With these steps, there is hope for the fight against rape and gender-based violence this year as many Nigerians, especially Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), continue to call for stiffer laws.

Possible food shortage

As the activities of the terrorist group Boko Haram continue, including that of bandits and kidnappers who have been reported to have whisked or attacked people from their farms, there is a possible food shortage in sight, especially in Northern Nigeria. In addition is the effect of the 2020 flood that destroyed many farms across the country.

Movies

The year 2021 promises to be eventful with the release of movies like the musical drama 'Dreamers' written by Michael Castiel and scheduled for release on January 31; 'Mamba's Diamond' directed by Seyi Babatope, written by Darlington Abuda and starring actors like Osas Ighodaro, Uchembe Williams and Nse Ikpe-Etim set for March 19; 'Retribution' which is still in development; 'Willie-Willie' also in the development stage, among others.

Music

Meanwhile, nominations for the 63rd annual Grammy Awards were recently announced with Nigeria's Burna Boy (for his recent album 'Twice as Tall') and Wizkid on the list for the 2021 awards by the Recording Academy. Burna Boy was nominated under the World Music Album while Wizkid for his feature in Beyonce's Brownskin Girl song.

Books! Books!! Books!!!

This year TJ Benson's debut novel 'Madhouse' is set for release. Also, 'The Days of Silence' by Angel Patricks Amegbe; 'What Happened to Janet Uzor' by Miracle Emeka-Nkwor and Onyeka Nwelue's 'The Strangers of Braamfontein', to mention a few.

Festivals

As always there are a number of festivals to look forward to this year. There is the Lagos Carnival held during the Lagos Black Heritage Festival, Afan National Festival, Argungu Fishing Festival, Atyap Annual Cultural Festival and several more.

Most book and art festivals come towards year-end such as the Ake Arts and Book Festival, Lagos Book and Art Festival (LABAF), Benue Books and Art Festival and the Abuja Literary and Arts Festival (ALITFEST).

• Short - range forecasts up to 31 th October, marking the end of the season shows continued favorable seasonal conditions in most of the region except some localized pockets of moderate dryness. It is thus likely that the rainy season will be abnormally late particularly in the Sahel region.

• Early October, the end of the rainy season in the Sahel, West Africa has been characterized by mostly adequate and well-distributed rains: this results in average to above-average seasonal rainfall The Sahel region benefited the most from very good conditions with well above-average seasonal rains, while belowaverage rainfall spread over the southernmost part of the region across the Gulf of Guinea. The cumulative heavy rainfall recorded from mid-August to September resulted in flooding, that have affected about 760,000 people in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal with at least 111 fatalities.

• As a result of increase in rainfall since late July and wetter conditions in August and September: a pattern of strongly above-average vegetation emerged during September and October in all of the Sahel. Agricultural areas benefitted from very good seasonal conditions. Good production prospects are certain this year in the region (in biomass and crops production). As a result of good seasonal performance in mid-October water resources remain at a good level. Overall they have reached their highest level throughout the West African region.

• Across the Sahel, harvest has started for main season millet and sorghum crops in southern Mali, Burkina Faso, southern Niger, and eastern Senegal. Meanwhile favourable harvesting of main season crops reached completion in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, southern Ghana, southern Togo, Benin, and central Cameroon, while crops are still developing in Guinea, northern Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, and northern Nigeria under generally favourable conditions. Despite localized floods impacting the Sahel and drier-than-average conditions along the Gulf of Guinea countries, overall conditions are favourable except in conflict-affected northern Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, and northeast Nigeria along with the conflict and floodaffected Far North region of Cameroon.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540757-WFP-0000120139.png?itok=iitFCIc-,"['crops', 'monitor', 'situation', 'seasonal', 'region', '2020', 'west', 'season', 'floods', 'conditions', 'update', 'good', 'mali', 'southern', 'rainfall', 'sahel', 'africa', 'cameroon']", ,flood
51,51,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Investors support Shell's strategy for net-zero emissions despite backlash - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/investors-support-shells-strategy-for-net-zero-emissions-despite-backlash,"Nearly 89% of shareholders at Shell’s annual investor meeting on Tuesday voted in favour of the oil and gas company’s strategy to achieve a net-zero emissions business by 2050, the Financial Times reports. Despite this success, the firm is also “confronted by growing support for activists’ demands to set more ambitious targets”, the newspaper adds. It notes that a separate resolution by Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This calling for Shell to set more “inspirational” targets attracted the support of 30% of shareholders, although such resolutions require 75% to pass. According to the Times, Follow This “insists that Shell’s goals are not consistent with achieving the Paris climate accord, in part because it lacks near-term targets for absolute emissions reductions”. The Guardian notes that this “significant shareholder rebellion” came on the day that the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its net-zero pathway, in which all exploration for new oil and gas fields stops this year to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It quotes Charlie Kronick, a senior climate finance adviser for Greenpeace UK, who notes that Shell’s plans would increase gas production by 20% by 2030, “contravening the advice of the IEA”. Reuters states that, under its current plans, Shell intends to increase its investment in low-carbon energy sources in the coming years, “but at least 75% of its spending will continue to go towards oil and gas”. In Bloomberg’s coverage, it says that the oil giant also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its “spill-prone operations in Nigeria”.

Meanwhile, another Guardian story reports that, in Australia, politicians and companies are being urged by campaigners to abandon plans for new coal power, gas and oil investments in light of the new IEA report. In Europe, Politico reports that the landmark report is “giving Brussels new ammunition in its war on fossil fuels”, as its conclusions support the European Commission’s efforts to discontinue EU funding for oil and gas projects. According to EurActiv, environmentalists have “warned against some of the assumptions in the scenario” developed by the IEA, notably the growing shares of biomass used for energy. The piece adds that IEA modellers have explained that their scenario assumes no overall increase in cropland use for bioenergy production, or new bioenergy crops on forested land. The Guardian reports on comments from the UK climate champion, Nigel Topping, who says he is “stubbornly optimistic” that the world will arrive at an agreement to “forge a transition to a net-zero future” at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year. (For more on the IEA’s latest report, see Carbon Brief‘s coverage.)

52,52,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Conflicting reports emerge in Nigeria over video of downed plane - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/03/conflicting-reports-emerge-in-nigeria-over-video-of-downed-plane/,"National-World

Conflicting reports have emerged in Nigeria over a video of a downed plane, after the country’s air force disputed claims from Boko Haram that its militants shot down a jet.

The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) strongly questioned the authenticity of the Boko Haram clip which purports to show fighters shooting at the military plane, eventually causing it to fall to the ground.

The NAF suggested that the crash was due to an air accident.

The video was published by the SITE Intelligence Group and is circulating across Nigerian media.

“It is evident that most parts of the video were deliberately doctored to give the false impression that the aircraft was shot down” when it was “obviously an air accident,” the NAF said in a statement posted on Facebook Friday.

The NAF rejected the seven-and-a-half-minute edited clip, calling it “false propaganda” and urging Nigerians “to ignore the contents of the videos making the rounds until all investigations as to how the aircraft crashed are completed.”

The NAF reported the plane missing on Wednesday, with two pilots on board.

A spokesperson told CNN Thursday afternoon the fighter jet had been deployed near Borno State in northeastern Nigeria to provide air support to ground troops, who were under fire from Boko Haram fighters before radar contact was lost.

“The cause of the crash as well as the whereabouts of the 2 pilots remain unknown. The pilots are Flight Lieutenant John Abolarinwa and Flight Lieutenant Ebiakpo Chapele,” the NAF said earlier Friday.

In the disputed video Boko Haram claims to have shot down the Alpha Jet.

The footage shows multiple fighters shooting into the air before a blast lights up the sky as a plane ignites into flames and falls to the ground. The video then cuts to fighters standing around what appears to be the wreckage of the jet.

It then cuts to the plane, showing “NAF 475” — the missing aircraft’s ID number. It later shows a charred body.

Separately the video then shows what appears to be a patch laying on the ground, displaying John Abolarinwa’s name.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Boko Haram has increased attacks against the Nigerian military as it tries to regain control of lost territories in pockets of the country’s northeast.

Frequent air raids by the Nigerian military have continued to rattle the insurgents — dislodging them from their hideouts.","Sat, 03 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['air', 'video', 'plane', 'conflicting', 'reports', 'boko', 'haram', 'emerge', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'shot', 'naf', 'fighters', 'downed', 'shows']", ,flood
53,53,FL-2020-000196-NGA,"Nigeria: Dozens Killed, Houses Destroyed As Floods Ravage North-Central Nigeria - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009250681.html,"Torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks wreaked havoc in the North-central sub-region of Nigeria.

State governments in the North-central region of Nigeria are employing measures to halt the perennial flooding ravaging parts of the zone and alleviate the sufferings of the victims.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks claimed many lives, destroyed hundreds of houses and washed away farmlands and domestic animals in the sub-region.

The catastrophe compelled the governments in the zone to take steps to avert further flooding and provide succour to the affected people such as temporary shelters, food and medicines.

In Nasarawa State, Governor Abdullahi Sule ordered the immediate evacuation of persons whose houses had been submerged by flood in Nasarawa, headquarters of Nasarawa Local Government Area.

Mr Sule also directed that foodstuff, mattresses and other relief items be provided to the victims immediately.

His spokesperson, Ibrahim Addra, said the governor had visited the ancient town and sympathised with the people over the incident.

He urged the people to desist from erecting structures on waterways and stop indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the drains.

In response to the governor's directive, the Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) distributed food and non-food relief materials to over 45 communities ravaged by flood in Awe and Nasarawa local government areas of the state.

The Executive Secretary of the agency, Zakari Allumagas, said the governor gave the order during his visit to Nasarawa following the flood in the town.

Mr Allumagas said the relief materials comprised 44 trucks of 600 bags each of assorted grains and three trucks of non-food items such as building materials, children's clothing, cooking utensils and mats.

He warned against diversion of the items.

He also disclosed that over 700 households were displaced by floods in such communities as Ara, Udenyi Magaji, Ugya and Gude, Nasarawa town in Nasarawa Local Government Area, and Ribi and Gidan Soja in Awe Local Government Area.

The executive secretary said the state government was working with traditional and community leaders to come up with a directive banning approval and sale of lands near riverine areas of the state.

In Kogi, the State Commissioner for Environment, Victor Omofaiye, said many communities in some local government areas in the state had been ravaged by floods.

Mr Omofaiye said such communities included places in Kotonkarfe, Lokoja, Ajaokuta and Ibaji local government areas.

He said some victims of the disaster had already been moved to IDPs camps in Kotonkarfe, while the IDPs camps and flood estates in Lokoja were being prepared through clearing of their surroundings and fumigation for resettlement of the flood victims.

He said that the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had predicted that in 2020, about 10 local government areas would be affected by flood in Kogi.

They are Lokoja, Kogi/Kotonkarfe, Ajaokuta, Bassa, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela, Ofu, Adavi and Omala.

""The water level of River Niger is still fluctuating within the range of 10.5 to 10.7, but as at September 21, it was 10.7 compared to the 12.5 as at the same period in 2012 in Kogi.

""Flood is a menace that we experience in Kogi every year. The flood we experienced in Kogi in 2012 was massive and devastating; we do not pray for such in 2020, but we are actually on red alert,"" the commissioner said.

He attributed flooding in the state to human and natural factors.

According to him, the human factor has to do with the people's habit in managing the environment as they dump refuse on waterways and drains, thereby obstructing free flow of water.

Mr Omofaiye said that the confluence of two major rivers in Kogi: River Niger and Benue, which most times overflowed their banks, was affecting communities along the river paths, including those of other small rivers that took their sources from river Niger and Benue.

""Opening of dams, especially along River Niger, such as Lagdo Dam from Cameroon and other dams also cause flooding in Kogi due to high volume of water.

""We have done a lot of sensitisation and awareness creation to educate the general public, especially the people living in the flood prone areas in all the predicted local government areas.

""We are also partnering with the relevant stakeholders including SEMA to ensure that we are ahead of any emerging situation,"" he said.

He said he had led a team on assessment tour of some affected communities in Lokoja to ascertain the level of damage done by flood in the area and begin to tackle them head on.

The commissioner said the Governor Yahaya Bello administration would not relent in its efforts at tackling environmental challenges including flooding across the state.

He, therefore, advised the people living in the flood prone areas to relocate and move to high grounds in order not to endanger their lives as a result of floods.

The situation is similar in Plateau as the acting Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Rose Dakwar, said that floods had affected seven local government areas in the state recently.

Mrs Dakwar listed the affected local government areas as Mangu, Pankshin, Shendam, Quan Pan, Langtang South, Mikang and Wase.

She said that many farmlands, houses bridges and other valuables were destroyed by the floods in the listed areas.

""We as an emergency management agency, have already visited each of the affected local government areas in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).

""We visited and ascertained the level of damage and reported back to government.

""Government has, therefore, included the affected areas in the distribution of palliatives before the major assistance will come their way,"" she said.

Also, the NEMA Zonal Coordinator in Jos, Eugene Nyenlong, said the agency had composed jingles in local languages to educate the people on how to tackle floods if they occurred.

Mr Nyenlong also disclosed that the agency in the zone was making use of Flood Vanguards comprising youth corps members who raised alarms if flood occurred.

""We also have locals that are engaged to act in terms of response and evacuation when flood occurs,"" he said.

In Niger, not less than 500 communities have been flooded since the onset of the 2020 raining season in the state.

The Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Ahmed Inga, who disclosed this also said about 22 local government areas had so far been affected by the floods.

Mr Inga said 29 deaths were recorded during the floods, while 45,000 farmers were directly affected by the disaster.

""Farmlands and houses have been destroyed and assessment is still ongoing, "" he said.

He said Governor Abubakar Bello had directed the agency to look inward and design a better way of mitigating the situation by relocating the affected communities to safe areas.

The Governor of Niger-State, Abubakar Sani Bello [PHOTO CREDIT: Official Twitter handle of Mr Bello || @abusbello]He said that the state government had identified 13 resettlement sites in Muregi, Akere and Ketso, among others, where the affected communities were being resettled.

He said that compensations had been paid and allocation of plots to the affected communities would soon commence.

The director-general blamed the flooding partly on the situation where the state was home to three hydro-electric dams- Shiroro, Kainji and Jebba, and River Niger and River Kaduna flowing across parts of the state.

Similarly, the Benue Government has assured residents of flood prone areas of its plans to tackle the incessant flooding in communities in the state.

The State Director of Environment, Richarge Azaagee, who disclosed this, said plans were underway to address some of the flooding challenges, especially in Makurdi.

Mr Azaagee denied that the government had abandoned communities suffering from flood related challenges.

He said the government had already identified the causes of flooding in some communities/settlements and was working toward fixing them.

""The problem of erosion and flood is not just in Kaamem community alone, it cuts across many communities in Makurdi and the state at large.

54,54,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Floods And Food Shortages Threaten To Push Nigeria Into A Food Crisis - The Organization for World Peace,https://theowp.org/reports/floods-and-food-shortages-threaten-to-push-nigeria-into-a-food-crisis/,"Nigeria is currently dealing with twin crises, record-breaking flooding, and a food shortage. According to Reuters, this is threatening to push Africa’s most populous country into a devastating food crisis. In 2020, Nigeria has dealt with destructive floods that have killed at least 40 and have displaced over 15,000 people. Recently, in September of 2020, intense flooding caused by heavy rainfall in northern Nigeria destroyed thousands of homes and wide areas of crops. As reported by Reuters, the flooding in northern Nigeria has destroyed 90% of the 2 million tons of rice that was expected to be harvested this Autumn. This loss is equivalent to 20% of the rice that Nigeria harvested last year.

Destruction of rice paddies is not the only food-related casualty of these floods. A shortage of maize has made it extremely difficult for chicken farmers to feed their flocks due to the price of chicken feed more than doubling. For Nigeria, rice is the staple grain, and chicken is a core protein. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many movement restrictions and financing difficulties that complicated the spring planting of many crops including maize. The combination of crop-destroying floods and an already existent maize shortage makes it look as if Nigeria is on the brink of a damaging food crisis. Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, told Reuters that “there is a real fear of having food shortages. The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Another effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is on fertilizer. After the virus’s outbreak caused a shutdown of Nigeria’s sole urea plant for two weeks, many farmers opted to skip using fertilizer on their crops, which has limited their crop yields.

Through all of this, the Nigerian government is still doing everything it can to promote domestic food production and local Nigerian farmers, but that may not be enough to sustain a country of nearly 200 million people through a looming food crisis. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that not one cent of the country’s central bank dollars would go towards food or fertilizer imports in an attempt to encourage local farmers and producers over imports. In August 2020, Nigeria took about 4,000 tons of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s strategic stocks (ECOWAS), released 30,000 tons of its own maize, and gave four companies special permission to import maize into the country, according to Reuters. The Nigerian Economic Summit Group has also called for “a complete overhaul” of agricultural policy.

In an interview with Reuters, Nigeria’s Agriculture Minister Muhammad Sabo Nanono said that “there is no question about it that there is an imminent problem with food insecurity, not only in Nigeria, but also in nations all over the world.” He is absolutely correct in that statement. According to a report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) called the Ecological Threat Register (ETR), food security is a major symptom of the ongoing climate crisis that is projected to worsen over the next several decades. By the ETR’s estimates, the global demand for food will increase by 50% by 2050. Approximately two billion people already experience moderate to severe food insecurity currently, and that number is expected to increase to 3.5 billion people by the year 2050. 822 million people currently experience undernutrition globally, leaving them at an extremely high risk of starvation. Additionally, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of food insecurity, at 52% of the population, and 18 of the 20 most food-insecure countries globally are located in the region.

What is happening in Nigeria should sound an alarm for the rest of the world. If the world continues on this trajectory, the climate crisis will only escalate in the coming years and decades. With that will come an increase in natural disasters, with flooding being the most common natural disaster to occur since 1990, according to the ETR. Flooding not only threatens people’s lives and property, but it also threatens the survival and harvestability of important crops, as seen with the current situation in Nigeria. Floods are also not the only natural disasters that will worsen with climate change, but wildfires and storm events like hurricanes will become more frequent and more damaging as well. All of these have the potential to threaten the food security of nations all over the globe. The ETR reports that 22% of countries will face catastrophic food insecurity by the year 2050, which would result in “substantial displacement of people or substantial increase in undernourishment.” That statistic shows that a food crisis like this will not be an event unique to Nigeria but could potentially threaten many other countries across the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst in worsening food security for countries around the globe. The United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) has warned that the number of people facing food insecurity could potentially double by the end of the pandemic. According to the Pullitzer Center, global shutdowns and border closures to curb the virus have caused tightened credit access to farmers, limited access to inputs for farmers, limited food transport services and food imports. Constraints like these have led to surges in food prices and limited many populations’ access to nutritious food. The effects of this can be seen in what is happening in Nigeria, and it has worsened food shortages that the country was already experiencing pre-pandemic.

The other countries of the world who have the means should take this opportunity to send humanitarian aid to Nigeria during this time in order to offset or prevent the looming food crisis. It would also be in the interest of the U.N. and other peacekeeping or human rights focused international organizations to aid Nigeria in any way that is possible so that the situation does not worsen into a debilitating crisis that could threaten millions of lives. The situation in Nigeria is of utmost urgency, so it is important that the international community acts with haste.

Furthermore, in order to take action towards preventing devastating food crises and worsening natural disasters in the future, the most important steps that nations can take is implementing aggressive climate change policies that curb emissions and aim to use cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy. This is especially true for countries who are the world’s biggest emitters and polluters, including but not limited to the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Combatting climate change will require an immense collective effort and continued inaction will only lead to more human suffering in places like Nigeria where people are already seeing the harsh effects of the climate crisis.

The impending food crisis in Nigeria is demonstrative of many issues that the world is facing. Swift action should be taken not only to aid Nigeria in combatting a destructive food crisis, but in the long run, all nations of the world should be putting progressive climate policies into effect. Growing food insecurity is a major symptom of a worsening climate, and the action should be taken now to ensure global food insecurity does not reach frightening levels in the future.","Sat, 19 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,"['farmers', 'climate', 'world', 'food', 'threaten', 'floods', 'push', 'crisis', 'nations', 'nigeria', 'insecurity', 'maize', 'countries', 'shortages']", ,none

In September 2018, heavy rains were experienced in Nigeria which caused severe flooding in 129 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of 12 States which affected 2,321,592 people, based on the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) situation report. An estimated 722,741 people were internally displaced, and 351,236 people had immediate humanitarian needs in food; shelter; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and health.

On 17 September, the NEMA declared a state of emergency in four of the worst-affected states (Niger, Kogi, Anambra and Delta), where thousands of communities had been forced to evacuate from submerged settlements and seek refuge in temporary Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps. As the Niger River continued to flow above danger level, and additional dams were released, a state of emergency also was declared in five more states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Taraba, Kebbi and Adamawa) on 11 October 2018. The flooding situation exceeded thresholds of local capacity to respond to the people in need.

The floods resulted in rapid population displacement, destruction of shelters, extensive losses to livelihoods and the local economy, in addition to high rates of water-borne diseases among the affected population and their host communities. Internally Displaced Persons staying with host communities were particularly susceptible to cholera and other water-borne diseases due to the poor access to potable water, hygiene infrastructure and medical care in those locations. These challenges also impacted displaced people in IDP camps, who similarly lacked access to basic water and sanitation services.

Upon the request of Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), IFRC launched an Emergency Appeal in October 2018 for 5.4 million Swiss francs to support 300,000 flood-affected people in the areas of focus of shelter and non-food items, livelihoods and basic needs; health; WASH; and protection, gender and inclusion (PGI) for 9 months. The objective was to provide lifesaving and recovery interventions in 6 out of the over 18 states in Nigeria affected by flooding. The intervention focused on 6 states identified during the multi-sector needs assessment as those in most need of assistance, namely Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Niger, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The initial plan was to have the affected population supported in an IDP camp setup (schools and health facilities).

However, the flood-affected population moved out of the camps earlier than expected. The government also aimed to vacate the schools that were used to host the IDPs to be vacated to avoid the disruption of the resuming of classes in January 2019. As a result, these changes affected the geographical context of the operation as the flood-affected population dispersed to different Local Government Areas (LGAs) and villages.

The operation had to strategize to ensure planned activities were to be held in their current location. Even though all affected families returned to their communities after the acute phase, the flooding resulted in long-term impacts, including a cholera outbreak in December when IDPs returned to their communities. The devastating loss to livelihoods and trauma of displacement also created psychosocial needs within the affected population.","Mon, 06 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1493663-MDRNG025eafr.png?itok=KHVy4p40,"['states', 'communities', 'n', 'nigeria', 'plan', 'needs', 'report', 'local', 'flood', 'population', 'emergency', 'mdrng025', 'water', 'flooding', 'final', 'displaced', 'response', 'appeal', 'affected']", ,flood

ABUJA, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Death toll has risen to 18 due to the floods caused by persistent rainfall in central Nigeria, said a local official on Wednesday.

Confirming the figure to reporters, Ibrahim Inga, head of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency in Nigeria's central region, said eight more deaths were recorded recently.

On October 16, Inga had earlier confirmed 10 deaths recorded over the past two months as the floods wreaked havoc in the state.

So far, 41,959 people have been displaced due to the disaster, the official said.

The floods, as a result of a localized high-intensity rainfall accompanied by torrential winds since August, also triggered massive run-off activities in streams and rivers in the state.

""The combined effect of the micro-climate trend and severe rainfall regime upstream of rivers Niger and Kaduna increased inflow in the basin, which resulted in the spillage of the water from the three hydropower dams,"" Inga told reporters.

He said 2,714 houses have been destroyed so far by the disaster. The flood swept through 20 local government areas, with 152 communities submerged.

The floods also badly damaged, roads, bridges, culverts and other buildings, the official said.

Inga said the excess waters had inundated several hectares of farmlands and displaced some dwellers in hinterland communities.

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, which is responsible for issuing flood alerts here, had since early August issued an alert over possible flooding due to the high intensity of rainfall across the country.

The hydrological body said the flooding incidents are due to high rainfall intensity of long duration, rainstorms, blockage of drainage systems and poor urban planning resulting from the erection of structures within the floodplains and waterways.

This year, Nigeria's 36 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja, would witness different levels of flooding, the hydrological body predicted.","Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['official', 'death', 'roundup', 'nigerias', 'recorded', 'xinhua', 'rises', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'flood', 'central', 'hydrological', 'disaster', 'inga', 'flooding', '18', 'floods', 'toll', 'rivers']", ,flood

59,59,FL-2020-000196-NGA,The new 'jollof wars' and why Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria for its first Africa base - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/14/the-new-jollof-wars-and-why-twitter-chose-ghana-over-nigeria-for-its-first-africa-base/,"National-World

Twitter’s announcement Monday that it will set up its first Africa base in Ghana, West Africa, has generated fierce debate among Nigerian users of the social media app, and reignited the never-ending rivalry between the two countries, known colloquially as the ‘jollof wars.’

Many Nigerians believe that Twitter’s decision is a snub to the continent’s largest economy, which is seeing rapid growth and investment in its tech scene.

According to NOI polls, 39.6 million Nigerians have a Twitter account, which is more than the entire 32 million population of Ghana.

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey capped a whirlwind tour of Africa in 2019 by pledging to move to the continent for several months in 2020.

Now it seems that his business will make that move first.

In a statement announcing the decision, Twitter described Ghana “as a champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet.”

The social media giant also cited Ghana’s hosting of the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) as another reason for moving there, saying it aligns with “its ambition to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa.”

Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said “the choice of Ghana as headquarters for Twitter’s Africa operations is EXCELLENT news,” and described it as a “beautiful partnership between Ghana and Twitter and which is critical for the dev’t of Ghana’s hugely important tech sector.”

‘No ease of doing business’

Some Nigerians blamed an “inconducive business environment” for Twitter choosing Ghana over Nigeria.

“Under @MBuhari our ease of doing business is so bad that it’s easier for terrorists to get phone lines than law-abiding residents. You can land at Ghana’s Kotoka Airport and get a SIM card at the airport. But a camel has to pass through the eye of a needle to get one in Nigeria,” said Reno Omokri via Twitter, a former presidential aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan.

Omokri was referring to the suspension of new phone lines registration because of a federal government policy to link all active SIM cards in the country to a national identity number (NIN) for security reasons.

The exercise is time consuming and the deadline has been extended multiple times, leaving new arrivals unable to obtain a local number, until at least May.

Another Twitter user, lawyer Moe Odele wrote: “One of our clients wanted to open shop in Nigeria for their West Africa office. Once we sent them a breakdown of the regulatory requirements for their industry (also tech), they hit us with ‘we will get back to you.’ We haven’t heard back since then.”

Another commenter, Onye Ajuju, said Twitter’s decision was justified and that Nigerians had a “bloated sense of entitlement.”

“It’s unbelievable seeing Nigerians throwing a tantrum because Twitter went to Ghana. The lack of awareness of how bad things are in the country, the bloated sense of entitlement, the unhinged expectations that everyone should accept Nigeria’s dysfunction…it’s incredible!” she said.

In 2019, Ghana ranked 13 places higher than Nigeria in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index.

Google,Microsoft and Huawei are among international tech giants that have expanded their operations in Ghana, targeting software developers and young creatives on the continent.

In 2018, Facebook opened its first community hub space in Africa in Nigeria’s commercial city, Lagos, while announcing plans last year to open an operational office also in Lagos, but for tech investors such as Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, there are lessons to be learned if Nigeria will continue to attract much-needed foreign investment.

“We have to think carefully about the reasons why Twitter chose Ghana — not necessarily in the context of whether we want to bring Twitter to Nigeria or not, but in the context of what it will take for us to remain a competitive destination for investors,” Aboyeji told CNN on Tuesday.

“We need to start thinking very carefully about enhancing democracy and the rule of law, freedom of speech, and most importantly, our role in enabling the Africa Free Trade Agreement. It’s not enough for us to just be a big market… We have next door to us, a very competitive neighbor, who’s doing all the right things to make itself the hub of West Africa,” he added.

‘A more productive market’

Another Nigerian tech entrepreneur and investor Bosun Tijani, told CNN that Twitter simply chose a more productive market to run its Africa operations.

“While Nigeria has a huge market that Twitter would love to target, the business environment here is quite demanding… It’s strenuous…the cost of running a business here is high. But with the AfCFTA single market agreement which Africa is signed up to, a company like Twitter can choose to set up shop in a small market like Ghana — that gives the best opportunity for it to operate — and still serve the Nigerian market,” said Tijani, who heads a tech innovation lab, CcHUB.

From tourism to tech, Ghana has been actively courting investors from the diaspora and in particular African-Americans, some of whom were given citizenship and encouraged to return to their roots.

Ghana also ranked as the 43rd most peaceful country in the world, in the 2020 Global Peace Index, placing 104 spots ahead of Nigeria — which grapples with Boko Haram insurgency and periodic outbreaks of violence.","Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['tech', 'market', 'twitter', 'chose', 'nigerians', 'doing', 'west', 'jollof', 'ghana', 'wars', 'nigeria', 'base', 'business', 'africa']", ,flood

Nigeria is approaching the peak of its rainy season, and flooding is expected to hit 15 out of its 36 states this month. The agency has issued a red alert because of above-normal water levels on the country's two largest rivers, the Benue and the Niger.

In August, many communities along the rivers were cut off due to collapsed bridges and impassable roads. Four students were killed when a pedestrian bridge fell at a university in the northern region.

FILE - Houses partially submerged in flood waters are pictured in Lokoja city, Kogi State, Nigeria, Sept. 17, 2018.

With thousands of houses and hectares of farmland and produce destroyed along with schools and shops, the economic impact of this year'sflooding is expected to be high. The country's emergency management agency is stepping in to distribute items like cement bags, blankets and hygiene products.

Peter Odjugo, a professor of geography at Nigeria's University of Benin, works with the Nigerian Meteorological Society. He has been tracking the extreme weather patterns and says the government has repeatedly failed to take preemptive measures to reduce the impact of flooding.

""What they prefer doing or what they are doing now is services after the impact, rather than preventing it from occurring,"" he said.

Odjugo suggests that the silt be removed from the rivers to increase the volume of water they can hold. He also recommends that town planners enforce regulation on where buildings are constructed, saying this is a glaring weak spot across the country.

City regulators look out for buildings being constructed near waterways. Such buildings are often marked with an X, designating an order to stop construction work.

Stella Ojeme, the director for information in the Federal Capital Territory Administration, says that even in the nation's capital ofAbuja, enforcing building codes is a challenge.

""Most of our people will go, buy white paint, paint off the stop work mark,"" she said. ""First of all, you find people [building] where they shouldn't build. You find people build on flood plains. You find some people dump their refuse in the gutter.""

Odjugo says climate change is making a real impact in Nigeria, but the government has not made the issue a priority.

Additional challenges

Additionally, the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency says its weather data collection equipment is being vandalized and stolen.

Clement Eze, the agency's director general, spoke at a workshop last month, asking the public to help stop the illegal activity, as it is hindering the agency's ability to forecast extreme weather.

""We can no longer take readings, maybe accumulated or about a week or two,"" he said. ""Or if there are no resources, it can even take more than six months before we can go back and replenish or repair and this equipment is imported from outside Nigeria.""

During Nigeria's worst flooding in 2012, the Niger River reached a record high level of 12.84 meters. Two million Nigerians were forced from their homes and 363 people were killed, according to the National Emergency Management Agency.","Thu, 05 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-09/RTX6J5VG.jpg,"['floodravaged', 'flooding', 'month', 'stop', 'unprepared', 'buildings', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'nigerian', 'rains', 'communities', 'impact', 'services', 'rivers', 'weather']", ,flood

…Urges residents in coastal areas to relocate, predicts 261 days of rainfall

By Olasunkanmi Akoni

Lagos State Government, yesterday, predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with attendant flooding across the state, even as it directed residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas of the state to move upland to avert needless loss of lives and property.

Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, accompanied by Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, said this at a media briefing on the 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions, and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja.

Bello said: “The forecast for 2021 is based on the informed global consensus that el-Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, is at the cool phase, which will continue till around June and likely give to a dominant el-Nino phase till the end of 2021.

“Generally, the Seasonal Climate Prediction for Lagos State signifies that on-set dates ranged between March 17 in the earliest, and April 6, while the season-ending may range between November 20 and December 5, 2021.

READ ALSO:

“The connotation is that Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while the maximum annual rainfall amount is predicted to be 1,747mm.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Besides, he said the state government is collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NiMET, in downscaling the predictions to all stakeholders.

Also speaking, Mr. Igbokwe, stated that the government planned to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72kilometres spread across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state to checkmate flooding.

“I, therefore, urge residents to support the government to achieve a flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again been littered by residents,” Igbokwe said.

Meteorologist Luke Robinson said there could be significant rain in some areas around west central Montana.

“We are looking at some rain moving into the area starting mid week to the end of the week,” said Robinson. “This week we are looking at some pretty good soaking rains, particularly in southwest Montana and west central Montana. We will see the rivers and streams rising but right now we're not really anticipating any impacts from it.”

Robinson said the cold front will bring accompanying snow to the higher mountain areas.

“This system is moving in, it's going to be relatively cold, so we're actually looking at some accumulating snow in the mountains,” he said. “Those cooler temperatures will cut off all the hot mountain snow melt that we've had the past few days and most of the rise in the rivers and streams will be coming from mid to low level moisture coming into the area.”

Robinson said people who live in areas that usually flood in the spring may be nervous to see the river levels rising.

By Joseph Erunke

THE Executive Director, Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE, Dr. Ganiyu Agbaje, Tuesday, said Nigeria has improved on its possession of requisite equipment’s to better forecast flood, thereby mitigating the effects.

To this end, he expressed optimism that the negative socioeconomic impacts of flooding in the country would henceforth be mitigated through effective and accurate forecast.

Agbaje, speaking at the opening ceremony of Online Regional Training on Flood Monitoring and Forecasting Modelling, in Abuja, insisted that with the latest technology in the country, it will henceforth be easier to predict flood and locate the people who are really affected, a development he noted, would make the country make informed decision to reduce the disaster associated with the flood.

But he tasked experts on accuracy in their forecast using satellite technology, saying such was necessary in order to monitor flood as well as identify its hotspot areas with a view to making a quick damage assessment.

He spoke as Nigeria joined other West African nations to adopt satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

He explained that the training was held to equip participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-hotspot areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse which is a major cause of flooding in Africa.

Hear him:“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction but more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower in Nigeria and other countries.”

According to him, the training was not to teach participants how to predict but to show them how to use additional satellite data to do their prediction better and support other methods.

He said that the technology has been on for a while around the world, adding that African leaders in collaboration with the EU initiated the training to help Africa better monitor the environment and mitigate disasters.

Agbaje said that with the data, rainfall, rivers and the environment will be better monitored, adding that in the case of Nigeria, more information on the activities of River Niger will be known using the technology.

“We need to support our rural communities on how best use flood when it occurs because at times if it coming far away from this country, you can harness the water overflowing for many other things in agriculture. In raining season, you can channel it for irrigation.

“We are feeling the economic impact of this disaster. We are looking at riverine flooding. You know our people settle along the rivers. And they have their livelihoods there; they are farmers and can’t come to towns,” he added.

The three-day training, which holds simultaneously in four other West African countries, was backed by the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) under its Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) initiative.

It was conducted by the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE.

Also speaking at the event, the GMES & Africa Programme Coordinator at the African Union Commission, Dr. Tidiane Ouattara, who joined via video conferencing, expressed joy that the activities of the CSSTE consortium was able to continue despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Emphasising the need for the constant training of young people and experts on the African continent, he described the training as a major achievement that would help Africa to build infrastructure and reduce the economic damage of flooding.

Participants at the workshop were drawn from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

In their separate goodwill messages, representatives of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said the training is aimed at building the capacity of stakeholders to better utilise satellite technology in providing accurate, timely and easily assessable information to improve the management of the environment.

FLOODS

Heavy rains have been recorded in West and Central Africa in the past weeks, including in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Senegal, leading to devastating floods that have killed dozens and displaced thousands of people. In Niger, 329,958 people had been affected by flooding with 65 deaths. About 31,960 houses have collapsed and 5,768 hectares of farmland destroyed. Maradi, Dosso, Tahoua and Niamey are the most affected regions. In 2019, at the same time, 35,384 people were affected across the country.

In northern Nigeria, thousands of homes and wide areas of crops have been destroyed in recent flooding in the states of Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi and Sokoto. More than 30 people reportedly have died. In Borno State, about 26,000 people, including IDPs, have been affected by heavy flooding across camps and communities. Borno and Adamawa states remain at risk of heavy flooding according to the Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) released by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) in June.

In Chad, some 188,915 people (37,783 households) were affected by flooding in the central and southern provinces, in the Lac and N’Djamena respectively. Large pieces of farmland are inundated with a potential impact on food security and livelihoods.

In Senegal, an emergency aid plan has been activated following exceptional rains in the capital Dakar and large part of the country that caused devastating floods on 5 September. At least four people were killed, the exact number of the people affected is yet to be determined.

Mali has also seen severe flooding that began in July. By early August, more than 13,200 people, including 5,400 internally displaced persons, were affected by floods in the country. The worst affected regions are Gao, Mopti, Ségou and Sikasso. A total of 1,160 homes have been destroyed.

In Cameroon, more than 30,000 people have been affected by floods caused by heavy rains in Far North, West, Coastal, South and South-West regions, destroying homes, washing away livestock and devastating plantations.

Heavy rainfall at the end of July caused rivers to overflow in the Far North, affecting over 5,000 people. More flooding was recently reported in the area, with over 1,500 families displaced around Maroua.

Flooding also affected the city of Douala and surrounding areas of Littoral region in the South-West after a torrential downpour on 21 August 2020.

In Ghana, roads, bridges, homes and farmland were inundated in the Northern and North East Regions due to heavy rainfall and releases from the Bagre Dam in neighbouring Burkina Faso, which began in mid-August 2020. At least eight people have lost their lives. The spillage was necessary due to a sharp increase in the water level. Several areas remain inaccessible, making assessments impossible.

In Burkina Faso, three people died in Kaya, Centre-Nord after heavy rainfall on 4 September. Earlier flooding affected the capital Ouagadougou, reportedly killing one person and damaging houses and property.

The expansion of the epidemic to the Bomongo health zone, bordering the Republic of Congo, is a serious concern. Rapid response actions are needed and point of Entry/Control (PoE/PoC) must be reinforced to mitigate the risk of the epidemic spreading to neighboring Republic of Congo. As of 6 September, there are 112 Ebola cases (106 confirmed cases and six probable cases), including 48 deaths and 50 recoveries.","Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1534863-West%20and%20Central%20Africa%20%E2%80%93%20Weekly%20Regional%20Humanitarian%20Snapshot%20%281%20%E2%80%93%207%20September%202020%29.png?itok=ad73obf8,"['congo', 'homes', 'west', 'democratic', 'republic', 'humanitarian', 'including', 'rains', 'rainfall', 'weekly', 'regional', 'snapshot', 'central', 'heavy', 'africa', 'regions', 'flooding', 'floods', 'affected']", ,flood

Early warning systems, contingency planning and local action can strengthen West Africa’s responses to increasingly frequent severe flooding, but more investment is needed in forecasting, panelists said in a recent webinar organized by the African Development Bank.

“We need to explore new and innovative approaches to better forecast and communicate floods and early warning information,” said Anthony Nyong, the Bank’s Director for Climate Change and Green Growth, in his opening remarks for the webinar Flood Forecasting and Early Warning in West Africa: Gaps, Innovation, and Lessons Learned.

In 2019 alone, extreme flooding caused the displacement of up to 5.1 million people in Africa, including 3.8 million from countries experiencing food insecurity. West Africa is a hotspot for extreme weather due to its long coastline, which is home to densely populated low-lying cities and economic hubs, from Lagos to Abidjan and Dakar.

This year, floods in eight West African countries affected over 750,000 people and claimed at least 100 lives. With rapid urbanization and increasing climate risks, the impact of floods in the region will likely accelerate over the next five decades.

The November 19 webinar, organized by the Bank’s Clim-Dev Africa Special Fund, brought together experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Senegal’s national meteorological agencies to provide an update on flood forecasting and early warning systems (EWS) in West Africa.

A representative for the Niger Basin Authority discussed regional collaboration on flood forecasting among its nine members. The event included a panel discussion with leading experts from the Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.

“We know that flood EWS is a crucial flood management tool, comprising key components of disaster risk knowledge, monitoring, and forecasting-as well as communication and response. Yet, little is being done to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and operationalize flood forecasts and early warning systems,” said James Kinyangi, Coordinator of the Clim-Dev Fund.

Ousmane N’diaye, Director of Senegal’s National Meteorological Agency, said that better preparedness through climate information and multi-disciplinary planning targeting vulnerable populations is crucial to saving lives and property. He emphasized the importance of early forecasting and the use of social media platforms to broadcast alerts and provide real-time weather information in local languages.

Michael Talhami of the Red Cross said acting early and anticipating risk would reduce human exposure to disaster. All too often, he said, local actors and humanitarian organizations have to work with weather and climate data that is dated, of poor quality, or non-existent. One example is the abandonment of hydrometeorological data collection in rural Mali, which has had detrimental consequences for emergency preparedness and response.

The Bank’s Institutional Support to African Climate Centers Project (ISACIP) has invested over $35 million to improve climate information services throughout Africa since 2010. As a follow-up to ISACIP, the Bank, through the Clim-Dev Fund, is investing over $27 million in regional and country operations to modernize Africa’s climate and weather infrastructure and provide high-quality and reliable data.","Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['green', 'improve', 'head', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'flood', 'growth', 'forecasting', 'west', 'early', 'warning', 'million', 'plan', 'preparedness', 'information', 'africa', 'weather']", ,flood

In 2020, flooding has affected 2.7 million people in 18 countries in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact has been particularly severe, and the number of people affected is more than double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, recent flooding have occurred in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This year 197,000 houses were reported destroyed in thirteen countries of the region. 422,000 hectares of farmland were affected by floods, which resulted in the destruction of crops and fields, threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions were already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities have led the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organizations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO has supported the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people and help communities to bounce back faster.","Thu, 24 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1549862-wca_2020_flooding_snapshot_20201218.png?itok=ipFhZmgq,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', '18', 'overview', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'floods', 'vulnerable', 'republic', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

The Lagos State Government said Sunday night that officials are mandated to arrest anyone caught dumping trash in drainage channels and canals, according to the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR).

For years, residents in the region of 16 million people have complained about garbage piled along highways and drainage canals.

""The situation is getting out of hand, passing the refuse dumps is an eyesore,"" resident Halimat Mogaji told The Guardian in December. ""Most times I try to avoid walking past the dumps because of the amount of refuse by the roadside.""

Residents told the news outlet that the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), which is responsible for collecting trash, often won't pick up waste from households that are behind on bills.

The situation led to poor sanitary conditions in the area, as canals fill with trash and standing water, the ICIR has reported.

By Robert Reid, Iguniwari Thomas Ekeu-Wei, and Zirra Banu

Ibadan is the third most populous city in Nigeria—Africa’s largest country in terms of population and economy. This city of six million also happens to be the country’s largest in terms of geographic area, but like many other cities, urbanization is largely uncontrolled, and people are exposed to disasters like floods.

We had the opportunity to experience Nigeria’s creativity and innovation in Lagos city, when the World Bank partnered with Co-Creation Hub and other players to organize a hackathon that focused on leveraging data and technology to improve accountability and service delivery in governance. People, including data and software engineers, professional and academic experts, and civil servants, came together to develop solutions for improved policy, governance and development impact.

The Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project (IUFMP) —set up to tackle the city’s urban resilience challenges—submitted datasets for the hackathon, and one of the teams that worked on the data from the project emerged as winner in February, 2020. Teams developed a geospatial visualization platform to overlay and view the datasets from the geodatabases created as part of the Ibadan city, and flood and drainage masterplans preparation, demonstrating how the government and other stakeholders can use insights from geospatial data to accelerate effective decision making in urban planning, flood risk and environmental management. With this open data, the state government can now use up-to-the-minute information to identify, manage, prevent, and prepare for flood risks, and other ensuing impacts from floods.

Building on this with support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and with the collaboration of technical initiatives from experts in Ibadan and around Oyo state, the project scaled up the use of data for flood risk management and developed an advanced geospatial visualization platform that empowers the government to seamlessly apply geospatial data in daily operations.

This innovation strengthens the capacity of the Oyo state government to manage flood risk and inform decision making in other sectors in Ibadan using data, coupled with previous capacity building efforts, gigabytes of geospatial data available and GIS innovation laboratories have been setup under the project. The labs established at the department of Urban Renewal Enforcement Monitoring and Compliance and Office of the Surveyor General under the Oyo State Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. The Project Implementation Unit has been equipped with computers, servers, printers, plotters and software needed to apply these datasets in decision making. These datasets, which are publicly available via an advanced geospatial visualization platform, now strategically inform technical decision making and engagements. This enhances urban resilience and disaster risk management, aligning strongly with the Oyo State Government’s E-governance Program and leveraging internet connectivity infrastructure provided by the government in locations where the labs are present to facilitate data exchange.

From the people to policy—students sparking innovation

In August, the University of Ibadan and the project signed a formal memorandum of understanding, to foster capacity development, knowledge exchange and promote long-term project sustainability through collaborative research, data information exchange, internship programs for students, short courses and training programs for government staff and other professionals, and all-round collaborations that bridge the academic-policy-industry gap through open data and innovation.

With the rising thirst for innovative responses to managing flood risks in Ibadan, the University of Ibadan, in collaboration with the project, GIS Konsult Limited and other partners hosted the second season of the Ibadan Geo-Hackathon completed in November with the theme, “Ibadan Urban Resilience,” leveraging the advanced geospatial visualization platform and geodatabases to deliver solutions focusing on three thematic areas: risk-informed decision making, urban resilient design, and innovative technology solutions for urban resilience. The winning submissions for the respective categories include: Smart Citi, a web-based application for automated flood-risk assessment and waste management,, and Flood Health Risk Mapper an industrial research innovation, and Fire Incidents - A Reoccurring Menace, a story on disaster resilience. The city of Ibadan has now developed two comprehensive masterplans: A Flood Risk Management and Drainage Masterplan and a City Masterplan. Both documents create a vision for resilient and sustainable urban development in the face of climate change, identifying opportunities to boost inclusive economic development, and identify and prioritize the structures most at risk of failing (bridges, culverts, drainages, dam, etc.) to strengthen the government's capacity to detect and respond more effectively to floods, and build resilience long-term. The amount of data, maps and information generated by these master plans is vast. They include spatial datasets, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) topography, high resolution aerial imagery, and outputs of urban analytics, hydrological and hydraulic modelling. By making this information accessible to the public, it becomes useful for many stakeholders, and will inform individuals, private sector, and government decision making to better manage risks and improve urban development.

Open data for innovation and entrepreneurship in development

Entrepreneurship is on the rise—and so is innovation and collaboration for the benefit of all. With data open and publicly accessible, businesses, academia and university students alike can utilize information for research and development. This innovation helps civil servants in their work as they tactically tackle disaster and urban development challenges. In turn, the increased resilience helps everyone from kindergarteners to tailors, and keeps the city’s six million people protected from preventable disaster risks. That’s the impact of open data, open governance, and effective resilience building—all together, they spark cooperation, preparedness and innovation for the benefit of everyone.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['data', 'geospatial', 'sparked', 'urban', 'ibadan', 'hackathon', 'flood', 'innovation', 'making', 'risk', 'resilience', 'cities', 'project', 'largest', 'western', 'african']", ,flood

The floods are also the worst in the state since 1988, residents and state officials told PREMIUM TIMES, amidst fears the floods could worsen Nigeria’s current food insufficiency that has led to an increase in prices of basic food like rice.

The Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) said the deaths occurred in about 19 local government areas of the state

Hadejia Emirate, with eight council areas, is the worst hit, the executive secretary of SEMA, Sani Yusuf, told PREMIUM TIMES.

Mr Yusuf said the deaths were recorded since the commencement of the current rainy season.

“These are the number of deaths so far reported to the agency since the beginning of this rainy season,” he said.

He explained that the agency, with federal government support, is doing the needful to cushion the effects of the disaster by providing emergency needs to the victims of the flood.

He added that the agency has so far distributed 30 canoes to communities affected by the flood, as well as materials to the affected communities to build embankments in order to control the water.

Worst Flood in over 30 years

Hamza Muhammad, special assistant to Governor Muhammad Badaru on community development and social inclusion, said this year’s flood is the worst since 1988 with Hadejia emirate as the worst affected area.

He listed the affected local governments as Buji, Hadejia, Ringim, Taura, Jahun, Miga, Malammadori, Auyo, Kafinhausa and Guri.

Others include Gwaram, Kiyawa, Kaugama, Birninkudu, kirikasamma, Garki and Babura.

Cause of flood

Mr Muhammad attributed the cause of the flood to an overflow of Tiga and Challawa dams in Kano State as well as effects of climate change.

He also said torrential rainfall, as earlier forecast by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, contributed to the disaster.

In an earlier report done by this newspaper, Isa Mustapha, the executive director, Exceptional Leadership and Integrity Promotion, listed the major causes of the flood as insufficient drainage channels, silted dams, weeds, trypa grass overgrowing on river channels and river beds, as well as illegal diversion and encroachment of waterways.

Other causes, according to Mr Mustapha, include lackadaisical attitude towards the desiltation of the Hadeija-Yobe Kwamadugu River basin, as well as poor coordination among stakeholders on the control of the menace of flood.

Government’s intervention

Mr Muhammad said the state government has been doing its best since January 2020 to prevent the flood including directing officials to conduct a survey in flood-prone areas of the state.

He said the government had also deployed water pumping machines to the affected communities to evacuate the flooded water.

“Where we cannot use the machines to evacuate the water, we organized self help groups in such communities and empower them with tools for embarkment,” he said.

Affected communities deny government’s intervention

Contrary to Mr Muhammad’s claims, residents of the affected communities said the government is not doing enough.

They accused the government of not providing any remedial measures to help mitigate the impact of the flood.

Mr Mustapha and some officials of SEMA, while on an assessment visit to some of the flooded areas on Monday, were mobbed by angry residents who decried the government’s negligence of the areas.

One of the vehicles conveying the officials got damaged while journalists trying to take footage of the flooded areas were also chased away by the angry residents.

Impact of Flooding on Food Production

Officials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, are already lamenting the impact of the flood on food production in Jigawa, and Nigeria, especially rice production.

Jigawa is one of the states that has benefitted most from the federal government’s Anchors Borrowers Programme to assist farmers boost rice production in the country.

Mr Muhammad, the governor’s aide, expressed the fear that the state may experience food shortage, saying that “Sixty-five per cent of Fadama farmland were washed away by the flood especially in Hadejia where much anticipated rice is expected.”

He added that grains like millet, maize and sorghum were also lost to the flood.

Officials could not give the exact number of farmlands and houses that were destroyed by the flood but said the damage is unprecedented while assessment is ongoing.

In his reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari described this year’s flood in Jigawa as ”unprecedented and devastating.”

In a statement by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, Mr Buhari, on Tuesday, sympathised with the victims of the flood while assuring them of federal government’s intervention.

He described the flood, which has reportedly destroyed over 100,000 hectares of rice farms in the state, as a setback to agriculture especially rice production which his administration has actively promoted and discouraged its importation.

The price of rice has also doubled in the past few months across Nigeria due to various reasons including the floods affecting rice-producing states like Jigawa and Kebbi.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/09/Jigawa-flood.jpg?fit=718%2C405&ssl=1,"['experiences', 'affected', 'destroyed', 'flood', 'governments', 'food', 'farms', 'dead', 'muhammad', 'communities', 'worst', 'jigawa', '40', 'officials', 'state', 'maize', 'rice']", ,flood

The training, organised by the Centre for Space Science & Technology Education (CSSTE) was part of the Multi-Scale Flood Monitoring and Assessment Services for West Africa (MiFMASS) project under the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) Support Programme which seeks to help Nigeria and other West African nations to adopt a new system of utilising satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

Participants were mainly technical operational staff from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

The training, which holds simultaneously across four other West African countries, aimed at equiping participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-prone areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model, as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

According to the Lead of the CSSTE Consortium, Dr Ganiyu Agbaje, the training was in alignment with one of the major pillars of the GMES & Africa support programme, which was capacity building, and this had led the CSSTE consortium to identify strategic training needs of its collaborating stakeholders on the MIFMASS project with the aim to train and empower them to sustain the product and service outcomes after the lifetime of the programme.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, a major cause of flooding in Africa.

“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here,’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of the Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction and more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower,” he said.

Dr. Agbaje, who also doubles as the Executive Director of the African Regional Centre for Space Science & Technology Education – English (ARCSSTE-E) in Ile-Ife, added that GMES & Africa is a joint initiative of the African Union and the European Union to harness the benefits of earth observation (satellite) data for inherent environmental challenges in Africa and their own MiFMASS project is one of the many ongoing research and development projects under the programme.

He pledged that two more training courses will be held as the consortium prepares for the conclusion of the project and the handover of its products and services to relevant agencies.

As well as the risk of further deaths and injuries, and damage to livelihoods and infrastructure, the Nigerian Red Cross is warning of a steep rise in the number of diarrhoea cases in Kogi, Niger, Anambra and Delta.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has launched an emergency appeal on behalf of the Nigerian Red Cross, seeking 5,425,000 Swiss francs to support 300,000 of the most vulnerable people for nine months. The operation will provide shelter and the distribution of relief items; livelihoods including cash transfers; health; water, sanitation and hygiene, and protection, gender and inclusion.","Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180817_085506021_iOS_edited.jpg,"['14', 'livelihoods', 'floods', 'states', 'cross', 'disaster', 'million', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'risk', 'niger', 'affected', 'kogi', 'red', 'emergency']", ,flood
80,80,FL-2020-000196-NGA,28 states at risk of flood - Agency - Premium Times,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/395058-28-states-at-risk-of-flood-agency.html,"No fewer than 102 local government areas in 28 states are at risk of flooding, according to the 2020 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO), released by the Nigeria Hydrological Survey Agency (NIHSA) on Thursday.

The states include the states of Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, Bayelsa, Sokoto, Kogi, Niger, Kaduna, Gombe, Adamawa, Benue, FCT, Nasarawa, Delta, Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Edo, Abia, Anambra, Imo, Borno, Kano and Kebbi.

At the Official Presentation of the outlook in Abuja, the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, noted that the outlook was a fallout from the devastating effect of the 2012 flood in the country.

He said the purpose of the outlook was to present probable flood scenarios for this year and to disseminate information to all, especially in flood-prone areas and further reduce resultant effects.

He said flood is one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria with devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on flood plains for livelihoods.

He said although the flood outlook had shown that 2020 floods might not be as severe as previous years, it was important for all stakeholders to carry out an aggressive awareness campaign for preparedness.

“It is pertinent to note that the impending flooding season with COVID-19 presents a fight against two threats; on one hand, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and on the other hand, the likelihood of an active 2020 flood season.

“The 2020 flood projections will as expected vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country.

“Overall, the flood level may not be as severe as previous years, but it is a certainty that our rivers will exceed flood level and many will be inundated again this year.”

The minister said as always, flooding was associated with increased risk of infections when the displaced persons were high and polluted water sources, added that it was important for all stakeholders to prepare earnestly.

He added that part of the intervention to promote hygiene was the recently signed Executive Order 009 by the President Muhammadu Buhari aimed at ending Open Defecation by 2025.

“Many state governors have bought into this idea, the ministry declared emergency in the water and sanitation sector to encourage hand washing and put in place the National WASH Response Committee for COVID -19,” he said.

The minister also commended the efforts of NIHSA in the development of a new Flood Mobile App, saying that it would add practical value to water managers and for overall disaster risks management.

The NIHSA’s Director-General, Clement Nze, said the 2020 AFO would go beyond borders and defer all barriers to reach the needy in providing information on early flood warnings required for mitigating risks in the country.

Mr Nze noted that the need to carry out aggressive sensitisation and awareness campaigns on consistent clearing of all waterways and maintenance of dams and reservoirs to ensure free flow of water in drainages.

The D-G said the Flood Mobile App would also be used to give actual daily flood situations to everyone, especially those at the rural areas through the use of SMS services.

The new Flood Mobile App is designed to be of practical value to the Water Managers, Technical Experts, Disaster Risk Managers, Policy Makers and Flood Forecasting Community for flood prevention and for enhancing flood early warning systems in Nigeria.

As of 10 October, flooding has affected around 2.1 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is almost double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains are gradually subsiding in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Ghana, Benin and the DRC and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539455-WCA%202020%20Flooding%20Snapshot_20201013.png?itok=qKkz1Zc_,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'rains', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

83,83,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Lagos flood alert: Heeding the augurs - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/lagos-flood-alert-heeding-the-augurs/,"By Kayode Ojewale

SIR: Flooding does not just suddenly happen; it is usually preceded by some occurrences hinting its imminent arrival. When the flow of rain water on its way to the drainage channels or river is impeded, then flooding occurs. Flooding is having too much water in the wrong place. The cause of flooding is mainly man-made because of our unclean environmental habits. With just few days of rains, some parts of Lagos are flooded. How will residents of these areas, especially flood-prone areas fare when the peak of rainy season which usually comes with attendant flooding eventually arrives? The omens of flooding are here with us coupled with the warnings issued by appropriate authorities; are we heeding the augurs?

What’s the end gain if the rains, meant to bless us and water our plants, turn out to damage our crops, properties and even destroy lives due to our actions and inactions? Does it appear many have forgotten the losses, pains and agony that accompanied the ravaging heavy rains which caused disasters in different parts of the country in 2012, the year of flood fury?

Of recent, it is observed that sometimes the rains no longer pre-inform or send any signal before its arrival through warnings like cloudy sky, windy atmosphere and dark clouds. Rather, it will just begin to rain suddenly without any pre-notification and it will pour heavily. That’s another indication that the rains this year would be in a different dimension.

On April 14, the Lagos State government predicted high intensity high of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello.

“…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm”.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding”, he further added.

As a way of checkmating the looming flood, the state government plans to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72 kilometers spread across all the Local Government Areas of the State.

Flood alerts and warnings are usually issued to sensitize residents and the authorities on the need to prepare. Ignoring these warnings or not heeding the flood alerts may come with deadly consequences. In order to be prepared for the predicted floods, agencies in charge of disaster management and emergencies should be ready to ensure safety of lives during the peak of the rainy season.

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lagos-flood.jpg,"['residents', 'rainy', 'warnings', 'water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'days', 'heeding', 'flow', 'lagos', 'alert', 'rains', 'state', 'areas', 'augurs']", ,flood

A total of 108 deaths and 192 injuries have been reported as of late August. Rainfall is expected to continue for the next week. Rivers and Bayelsa states are estimated to be amongst the worst affected states where water levels continue to rise. Initial assessments indicate that 13,031 homes were damaged or destroyed across all affected states as of late August. Shelter, food, NFIs and medical assistance continue to be key needs for the affected population

Crisis impact

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, widespread flooding due to ongoing rainfall has affected 441,250 people and displaced 141,400 people in Adamawa, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Delta, Edo, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Niger, Rivers, and Taraba states since late August (NEMA 24/09/2018; ERCC; 24/09/2018).

As of 24 September, flooding across 12 states and 50 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in central and southern Nigeria has caused 108 deaths and 192 injuries (NEMA 24/09/2018). Across all affected states, there is an urgent need for shelter, with around 13,000 houses damaged (NEMA 24/09/2018). The affected population has lost household and personal belongings. The floods have caused considerable damage to agricultural land across Nigeria, with 122,653 hectares of agricultural land destroyed. In addition to shelter, there is an urgent need for food, NFIs and medicine (NEMA 24/09/2018). The flooding is widespread and situation is rapidly evolving. As assessments are ongoing, the number of the affected people is expected to further increase.

Initial assessments indicate that Rivers and Bayelsa are amongst the most affected states. Water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa. As of 24 September, water levels in lower Benue state have subsided to 10m, compared to 11m on 21 September.

The Niger River at Lokoja city, Kogi state, has not receded, as it recorded water levels of 11.05m on 24 September (NEMA 24/09/2018). Light to moderate rainfall is expected to continue until early October.

Shelter: Flooding has displaced around 141,400 people across the 12 affected states, of which 80,600 people are estimated to be living with friends and family (NEMA 24/09/2018). Over 13,000 houses have been partially or totally damaged. IDPs have relocated to emergency shelters, such as LGA offices, schools, stadiums and churches.

Some of the affected population is staying in IDP camps that have been recently constructed by the Presidential Committee on Flood Relief and Rehabilitation (NEMA 21/09/2018). As assessments are ongoing, and water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa states, the amount of houses damaged, which are typically built with mud and thatch roods, is likely to increase (IFCR 23/09/2018). The affected population are in urgent need of shelter support and NFIs, such as blankets, mats, hygiene kits and kitchen sets (IFCR 23/09/2018).

Livelihood: New estimates indicate that 122,653 hectares of agricultural land have been flooded across central and southern Nigeria. Crops were destroyed before the harvesting season begins in October (NYTimes 17/08/2018). This makes the affected population more vulnerable to food insecurity, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of farmers. Flooding is also likely to affect other livelihoods, such as fishers and petty traders.

Food: There continues to be an urgent need for food assistance for IDPs across all affected states. Severe flood damage to agricultural crops means there is a risk that some communities will experience increased food insecurity throughout the harvest season. (Daily Trust 20/09/2018). There are still no reports on whether markets that have been flooded and closed. Transportation of food is likely to be severely restricted because main roads have been flooded.

Health: Since the publication of the briefing note on 21 September, 192 injuries have been reported since late August. Flood affected victims are likely to be in urgent medical care, as result of injuries and the risk of outbreaks made worse due to the extensive flooding. Health care support is particularly needed in IDP camps (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The risk that diarrhoea and cholera will spread remains high, as water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa, and have mostly not subsided in other communities.

Particularly in more populated areas, and overcrowded IDP camps where WASH facilities are inadequate, there continues to be a high concern for cholera to spread further. There have been reports of an increase in diarrhoea cases in four of the flood affected states (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of geographical information and data indicating which states are affected by the spike in diarrhoea cases. 27,927 cases of suspected cholera were reported between 1 January and 10 September countrywide (NCDC 10/09/2018). Between 1 January and 10 September, suspected cholera cases were reported in the flood affected states of Adamawa (2,002), Anambra (23), Bayelsa (no data), Benue (no data), Delta (no data), Edo (no data), Kebbi (198), Kogi (102), Kwara (no data), Niger (547), Rivers (no data), and Taraba (no data). (NCDC 10/09/2018). In Adamawa, an increase of 119 suspected cholera cases was observed between 17-23 September, most likely due to flooding facilitating the spread (Adamawa State Ministry of Health 23/09/2018)

As flooding has not receded, the escalation of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and-or West Nile fever remains a concern (WHO 2018). The Government recently confirmed that the malaria cases have increased due to the floods (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The current malaria incidence in Nigeria is 380.8/1,000 (2015) (PMI 2017). A distribution of mosquito nets for the flood affected population has been identified as a key priority (NEMA 24-09-2018 NaijaNews 18/09/2018).

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, there have been additional reports in local media sources that indicate antenatal care for pregnant women remains a key concern. This was reported in Uzanu community, Estako East LGA, Edo state and in Ogbaru, Amambra.

There is a need for psychosocial support, as flood victims have lost or been separated from their loved ones (IFCR 23/09/2018).

WASH: The displaced population is still staying in emergency shelters, such LGA offices, stadiums, schools and churches, which have inadequate sanitation facilities and are in urgent need of safe water. In most of the affected states, water sources have been contaminated by flooding (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of data on the potential amount of damaged water points.

Education: Schools continue to be used as evacuation centres across all affected states. On 18 September, primary and secondary schools were closed in Ogbaru, Southern Anambra state as a safety measure, following floods that displaced more than 1,1000 people (OCHA 24/09/2018). Considering the ongoing flooding, it is likely that many schools have been damaged by flooding (Premium Times 19/09/2018).

Protection: While there is no disaggregated data available on the amount of women and girls affected by the floods, it is likely that this group is disproportionately affected.

Women and girls that are displaced and staying in IDP camps continue to be at increased risk to gender-based violence. Overcrowding at IDP camps, with a lack of privacy and inadequate toilets and washing facilities, increases the risks and vulnerability of women and girls to gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (UNHCR 12/2017; OCHA 2016).

Impact on critical infrastructure

Since the start of the rainy season, in June, main roads have been flooded and bridges collapsed (Vanguard 15/09/2018). As water levels have not subsided and heavy rainfall is expected to continue until the beginning of October, main roads continue to be flooded across all affected states.

Power and telecommunications are affected in some of the flood-affected states. The Okpai Gas Independent Power Plant in Ndokwa East Council, Delta State, with power supply to Aso Villa, Abuja has been flooded (TheGuardian 25/09/2018). Communities in Kdokwa West and Ukwuani councils are also affected by the power cut.

Some LGA offices in affected are also likely to be impacted, as they are being used as emergency shelters for the flood affected population.","Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1171619-20180925_acaps_briefing_note_nigeria_floods_update_i_0.png?itok=EOQvdbLy,"['2018', 'data', 'likely', 'water', '26', 'flooding', 'continue', 'nema', 'flood', 'floods', 'states', 'levels', 'note', 'nigeria', 'briefing', 'affected', 'acaps']", ,flood
85,85,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Nigeria: Food Security Threatened As Floods Destroy Farms - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202009030184.html,"Fear of food crisis is heightening in Nigeria following massive floods that are ravaging crop farms in many parts of the country.

Many farmlands were reportedly destroyed by floods in Kebbi, Zamfara, Niger, Rivers, C/Rivers, Sokoto, Bauchi and some parts of Kwara State.

Rice and maize farmlands were most affected and farmers fear this could further hike the prices of the staple food in the country.

A Daily Trust market survey showed that prices of food items are already going up in the market.

In Kano, a 100kg of maize now costs N20,000, N22,000 in Benue, N24, 000 in Abuja and as high as N25,000 in Lagos State.

The same size of maize sold between N9, 000 and N11, 000 last year across the country.

Also, 100kg of local rice now costs N55,000 in Kano, N58,000 in Abuja, while prices of beans range from N22,000 to N24, 000 per 100kg depending on the market and state.

- The warnings -

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had warned that the current water level in the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin portends some level of concern for Nigeria as there could be a likelihood of river flooding in the states contiguous to River Niger.

The states, according to the Agency, are Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The Director-General of the agency, Engr. Clement Onyeaso Nze said the country through Kebbi State might be flooded beginning from September 6

Reports from Kebbi had shown that several hectares of rice farms were washed away by flood and similar incidence was also reported in some parts of Zamfara, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kwara, Cross Rivers, Rivers and Niger states.

The incident is already a source of concern for stakeholders in the food sector as they are expressing fears that if the ugly trend continues, there might be food crisis in the country.

In Kebbi State, over 500,000 hectares of farmlands were reported to have been destroyed by flood.

The Chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, Sani Dododo, who announced the incident said rice farms accounted for about 450,000 of the hectares while the remaining 50,000 were for other crops.

- Farmers narrate ordeal -

It was reported that farmers in Kebbi State lost over N5 billon to the flood.

A victim and female rice farmer in the state, Lubabatu Bunza, said she lost about 16,000 hectares to the recent flood in the state.

Also, Mallam Isa Ahman, another victim from Patigi LGA of Kwara State, said early last month, flood washed away about six hectares of his rice farm and four hectares of his maize farm.

The farmer said he obtained a loan from a commercial bank and invested on the farm, saying it would be difficult to repay the loan.

Many of the affected farmers in Kebbi and Niger states said they got their inputs from the Anchor Borrowers' Programme of the federal government and wondered how they would be able to repay the loans.

President of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Ibrahim Kabiru, said even though it would be difficult to ascertain the damages done to the farms by the flood across the country, the trend portents a great danger ahead.

He said the flood-affected rice, maize, sorghum and other crops in the affected states.

According to him, the situation was being worsened by the insecurity in the rural areas where the farms are located.

The farmers' leader had earlier warned that bandits were preventing farmers from accessing their farms, which he said was a dangerous pointer to food security.

Mr. Mathew Ajayi, a food security expert told Daily Trust on phone yesterday that already the country was nearing food crisis as this could be seen in the skyrocketing prices of food items across the country.

""It is obvious that we are approaching a serious food crisis considering the rising prices of food items across the country.

""And now look at the flood ravaging the farms' couple with the bandits chasing away farmers from their farms,"" he said.

Alhaji Muktar Umar, a farmer and local rice miller in Sabo-Wuse, Niger State, told Daily Trust on phone Wednesday that the country might experience serious rice crisis this year because of the flood incidence and security challenges threatening the farmers.

""From my experience as a farmer, I know many people go into rice farming this year but the farms are being washed away by the flood.

""Many farmers can no longer go to their farms now, most especially here in Niger State,"" he said.

- Buhari orders release of food items from reserves -

President Muhammadu Buhari said Wednesday that the flood disaster in Kebbi State had exposed the country to a major setback in the efforts to boost local food production.

Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed concerns over the heavy floods that took a number of lives, submerged thousands of hectares of farmlands and houses, destroying farm produce and personal belongings in the affected communities.

The president said: ""I am particularly sad over this incident because it is a setback to our efforts to boost local rice production as part of measures to stop food importation.

""Kebbi State is the focal point of our policy to produce rice locally as part of this administration's commitment to agricultural revival, which suffered relative neglect in favour of food importation.

""With the loss of six lives and still counting; thousands of hectares of land flooded and estimated economic losses of more than one billion naira by rice farmers in Kebbi State, we face a major setback in our efforts to boost local food production.

""This bad news couldn't have come at a worse time for our farmers and other Nigerians who looked forward to a bumper harvest this year in order to reduce the current astronomical rise in the costs of food items in the markets.""

The president, while sympathising with the bereaved families and farmers affected by the devastating floods, assured that ""we are going to work closely with the Kebbi State government in order to bring relief to the victims.""

In another statement yesterday by Shehu, Buhari expressed the concern of his administration about the sudden spiral of food prices at a time when the economy was already mired in a slowdown occasioned by the global coronavirus situation.

Buhari, however, assured Nigerians that the situation was transient.

He said his administration had already begun looking and putting in place measures to ameliorate the situation.

""While Providence has been kind to us with the rains and as such an expectation that a bumper harvest would lead to crashing of food prices and ease the burdens on the population, the government's concern is that the exploitative market behaviour by actors has significantly increased among traders in the past few years and may make any such relief a short-lived one.

""This year has indeed tested us in ways that globalisation has never been tested since the turn of the century.

""These challenges have disrupted lives and supply chains all over the world and Nigeria has not been spared.

""The effect has been deeply felt in the delays encountered in the procurement of raw materials for local production of fertilizer (damaging standing crops before harvest) and the speculative activities by a number of rice processors who are ready to pay for paddy at any price to keep their mills running non-stop.

""But of all these problems, the most worrisome is the activities of ""corrupt"" middlemen (with many of them discovered to be foreigners) and other food traders who serve as the link between farmers and consumers found to be systematically creating an artificial scarcity so that they can sell at higher prices.

""In dealing with these problems, the administration has, in line with its ease of doing business mantra, avoided imposing stockholding restrictions in order not to discourage investments in modern warehousing and cold storage.

""The president has just approved the release of food items from the strategic reserves, including 30,000 tons of maize to animal feeds producers to ease the high cost of poultry production.

""President Buhari's administration has raised some of these issues with the various food producer associations involved, particularly those of rice and other grains.

""With their cooperation, the high food prices should soon be a thing of the past.

""In addition, investments in the agro-allied sector by the private sector will significantly increase domestic production of farming inputs especially fertilizer, further crash prices, create employment and ease the pressure on our foreign reserves.

""One of these major investments is the Dangote Fertilizer plant, which is projected to come on stream by the 4th quarter of 2020,"" the president said.

- Experts suggest ways out -

The National President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Arc. Ibrahim Kabiru noted that to mitigate the effect of these calamities on the food system or food security, farmers should be encouraged to embark on full-scale dry season farming, which could lead to all-year-round farming

He advised that government should expand the nation's irrigable lands by investing more in water resources.

He also advised farmers to quickly plant alternative crops that require little time to mature in order to mitigate the crisis.

He said government at all levels could support such farmers with seeds and other inputs.

""Whereupon the time left for the rainy season cannot be sufficient for any crop, some form of compensation commensurate to the ascertained loss could be given to the affected farmers,"" he advised.

The farmer's leader urged his members to insure their farms, adding that the association is already working with National Agricultural Insurance Company (NAIC) to that all farmers insure their farms.

The women leader of the Kebbi State Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Lubabatu Usman Kamba suggested that the way out for some of the challenges was for the farmers to be provided with good knowledge of forecasting the planting season.

She said flooding has been the farmers' biggest nightmare, adding that they could only be addressed with good forecasting knowledge on when and where to plant the crops, which she said was currently lacking because of the near absence of extension service workers.","Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn05.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00540445:bd25877f5988946c2e238d58cdc5cf6e:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'niger', 'food', 'kebbi', 'security', 'floods', 'farms', 'prices', 'threatened', 'nigeria', 'destroy', 'rice', 'hectares', 'state']", ,flood
86,86,FL-2020-000196-NGA,"April 2021: Ninth-warmest April on record, NOAA and NASA report - Yale Climate Connections",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/05/april-2021-ninth-warmest-april-on-record-noaa-and-nasa-report/,"April 2021 was the ninth-warmest April since global record-keeping began in 1880, 0.79 degrees Celsius (1.42°F) above the 20th-century average, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, NCEI, reported May 13. NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europe’s coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Figure 1. Departure of temperature from average for April 2021, the ninth-warmest April for the globe since record keeping began in 1880. Record-warm April temperatures were limited to parts of southern South America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, as well as small parts of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. No portion of the globe was record-cold. (Image credit: NOAA/NCEI)

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

Francis Ighorurhie, aged 38, reportedly drowned on Thursday night at Kaiama Community in Kolokuma-Opokuma Council of Bayelsa State. Two Primary school pupils also drowned along Goodnews street in Azikoro Town in Yenagoa Council of the state.

It was gathered on Friday that Fr. Francis Ighorurhie, a Missionary of St. Paul (MSP) from Delta State, was until his death the Parish Priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church, Kaiama.

A priest, who spoke anonymously, said, “this is a sad moment for us. Father was on his way back from Bomadi in Delta State when he met his untimely death. But for the flood, he could have driven his car straight to his residence instead of parking same by the road.”

“It was as he was walking on the wooden bridge part of which had been submerged that he slipped and got drowned. Those staying at his residence had to raise alarm when they saw his car by the roadside and he was nowhere to be found.

“They however became suspicious when they saw a bag containing some provision floating on the water not far from the bridge. Divers were contracted and his remains were recovered.”

He added that his remains had been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa.

Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State government, yesterday, in a statement, sympathised with residents of the state over the impact of the rising flood, assuring that efforts are underway to mitigate its devastating effects on the people.

The state government, during its Eight Executive Council Meeting, presided over by the Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stressed that government is aware of the difficulties being experienced as a result of the flood, which has become a perennial problem due to climate change.

Speaking on behalf of the Governor, Ewhrudjakpo appealed to Bayelsans to exercise patience with the state government over the inconveniences being experienced as a result of the ongoing expansion of the Etegwe roundabout.","Sun, 18 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekiti-flood.jpg,"['saw', 'bayelsa', 'flood', 'residence', 'st', 'catholic', 'drowned', 'drown', 'remains', 'pupils', 'council', 'state', 'priest', 'result']", ,flood

90,90,FL-2020-000196-NGA,An Inland Delta Flooded - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147692/an-inland-delta-flooded,"Drought is a perennial problem in the semi-arid Sahel region of Africa. But in 2020, in Mali and other countries in West Africa, excessive rainfall has been the problem at times. Exceptionally heavy summer rains pushed seasonal floods on the Niger River and its inland delta to destructive levels.

After intense rains fell in July and August in the Guinea Highlands and overloaded many streams and rivers, it took several weeks for flood waters to work their way through the vast inland delta in central Mali. When the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured a natural-color image on October 29, 2020, water had spread widely across the nearly flat delta, which was once a lake bottom. Standing water appears black. Many flooded areas appear green because bourgou grass, rice, and other plants grow in the shallow flood waters. For comparison, the other image shows the dry landscape in May 2020, before the rains.

In late October, floodwaters reached their peak height at Mopti, a town at the confluence of the Niger and Bani Rivers. Water levels in the delta were recorded at 670 centimeters (22 feet) on October 26 and remained at that level until November 2, according to Mali’s National Directorate of Water Resources. That tied the peak water levels from 2018, the highest since 1969.

After November 2, waters receded at Mopti even as they continued to rise at points downstream such as Akka and Diré. It typically takes water a full six months from falling in the Guinea Highlands to reach the ocean at the Niger Delta in Nigeria. People watch the timing of flooding closely because it affects when rice can be grown, when fish will be available to catch, and when pastures can be ready for grazing. Water levels were expected to be low enough in mid-December 2020 for the annual cattle crossing on the Niger River at Diafarabé. In the much anticipated event, nomadic herders drive cattle across the river toward rich grazing lands in the inland delta and are reunited with their families after months apart.

While seasonal floods are common in Mali, the severity of the floods this year caused widespread damage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 1,160 homes were destroyed by flooding.

91,91,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Reps to expand fire service operations - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/reps-to-expand-fire-service-operations/,"The House of Representatives is considering an expansion of the scope of operations of the fire service to include accidents and emergency situations in the transport sector and at construction sites in the real estate sector.



When the bill becomes law, officers of the fire service who show gallantry will be specially rewarded.



This proposal is contained in the legislation titled ‘A Bill for an Act to Repeal the Fire Service Act, Cap. F29, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and Enact the Fire and Emergency Service Bill to Provide for Additional Powers for Effective Service Delivery; and for Related Matters.’



The bill passed second reading at the plenary on Tuesday.



Sponsor of the bill, Mr Adejoro Adeogun, while leading the debate for the second reading, said the proposal was to provide for additional powers and expansion of responsibilities of the fire service



He said, “The major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed, would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency. It would also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through engagement of able bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.



“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources.”



Adeogun noted that the Fire Service Act (1963) saddled the Fire Service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies.



“This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and such other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required,” he said.



The lawmaker added, “This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.



“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”



The lawmaker listed the specific goals of the bill, saying it is to “prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters.”



He added that it would “encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by states, local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies.



“Establish the Office of the Fire and Emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the fire and emergency service.



“Empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilise resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies.



“Provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officers.”","Wed, 19 May 2021 08:43:56 GMT",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/19155231/Reps.fw_.png,"['flooding', 'service', 'construction', 'collapse', 'accidents', 'operations', 'scope', 'related', 'bill', 'reps', 'disasters', 'expand', 'emergency']", ,none

This is as the government has warned against heavy rainfall, flooding and possible flood disasters.

While making the disclosure through a signed statement, the Honorable Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said 23 million cubic meters of water will be released in October, which is the peak of the rainfall season.

READ:

Bello explained that the release of more water from the Oyan Dam, which will be the highest so far, is due to intensive rainfall over the past few days, expected to peak in the current month.

He, therefore, enjoined all residents of Agboyi-Ketu, Owode Onirin, Isheri, Ajegunle, Agiliti, Kara, Majidun and all areas bordering the rivers and the sea in Lagos to be wary of the staggered Oyan Dam release, adding that by November, a reduced release of 11million cubic meters will be affected as the intensity of the rainfall declines.

Bello pointed out that data provided by the Nigerian Hydrological Services noted that the months of July, August, September and October would be characterized by heavy rainfall, flooding and flood disasters in most parts of the country.

READ:

Reiterating that the reminder became necessary because the projected heavy rainfall, which had increased in September, would continue with high intensity this month leading to the staggered release of water from the dam, the Commissioner disclosed that Lagos is, however, intensifying measures to minimize the effect of the heavy rainfall on lives and property.

He averred that, in continuation of the preventive efforts against flooding by the State Government, work is almost completed on all the primary and secondary channels, stating that this is in addition to the efforts of the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) that are being deployed around the State to undertake quick fixes of clogged manholes or drains manually.

Bello said, “For a coastal city like Lagos, let me remind everyone that once it rains consistently for a minimum of eight hours, we are bound to have flash floods caused by the increasing inability of effective discharge into the lagoon, which is brought about by a rise in the ocean level. This will automatically lock up all our drainages and would be unable to discharge until the water level goes down.’’

“Flash floods are not peculiar to Lagos. It is the new wave in most coastal cities around the world, including those who have adopted the best of technological advancements to curtail flooding. Lagos is at the receiving end of three types of flooding, namely Coastal, Urban and River flooding because of the peculiarity of its location.”

While urging residents to adopt an attitudinal change by not dumping refuse in drainage channels and erecting structures on drainage alignments, Bello vowed that anyone caught violating the environmental laws of the State would be punished accordingly.

The Commissioner also emphasized that all residents owe the state a duty to support the efforts of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration to ensure that heavy rainfall does not wreak havoc in any part of the metropolis.","Mon, 05 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sanwo-olu.jpg?fit=900%2C618&ssl=1,"['residents', 'release', 'water', 'flooding', 'state', 'cautions', 'flood', 'lagos', 'disaster', 'warns', 'rainfall', 'dam', 'heavy', 'oyan']", ,none

The Director-General of FEMA, Idriss Abbas, made the call in a statement on Sunday.

He said most of the deaths recorded in the past from flood in the FCT were as a result of non-compliance to instructions and early warnings.

Mr Abbas, therefore, emphasised the need for residents to adhere to instructions and early warnings from relevant authorities.

He added that attitudinal change was the key to reducing disasters to the barest minimum in the FCT.

He disclosed that the Search and Rescue team of the agency recently discovered the body of one Garba Joseph, 43-year-old from Akoka-Edo of Edo State, after two days search from a flooded river around TradeMoore Estate, Lugbe, in Abuja

“Narrating the incident, an eye witness account (one of FEMA’s volunteer/vanguard Kenneth Chima) who captured the incident on video explained that they were four men that tried walking through the water.

“And I kept warning them to go back, three of them went back but only this man insisted on crossing, unfortunately the water overpowered him and washed him away,” he said.

He decried the increasing rate of flood in the FCT due to residents’ apathy towards the government’s directives and early warnings.

“This is also despite FEMA’s consistent sensitisations based on The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) predictions of torrential rainfall and dangers of flooding.“

He said NIHSA’s most recent predictions warned of torrential rainfall and flooding from August, adding that FEMA had carried out aggressive sensitisation to educate residents on ways to prevent the impending flood.

He said FEMA was conducting sensitisation programmes in five different indigenous languages in the FCT using different media channels.

“We recently organized a meeting with our Volunteers, Vangards and Divers from all the area Councils within the FCT to educate them on how they can sensitise their people on how to prevent disasters to minimize loss of lives and properties.

“We also embarked on community to community flood sensitisation campaigns in the FCT and mounted billboards at all the flood prone points warning off and cautioning residents from these danger areas.”

The DG, who reiterated the agency’s commitment to reducing disasters to a barest minimum in the FCT, called on residents to complement the efforts of the FCT Administration by doing the needful.

He also advised residents not to underestimate the strength of water when it was flooded.

“What we are experiencing now is flash flood, the water builds up speedily and comes unnoticed hence very dangerous,” he said.

He called on community and religious leaders to take responsibility of sensitising their subjects, especially those who are living close to flood prone areas to move to higher grounds to avoid being washed away by flood.

He said that relevant authorities have been on their toes evacuating refuse around the FCT, distilling drainages and expanding narrow water channels to enable free flow of water for a safer FCT.

94,94,FL-2020-000196-NGA,Agency warns states contiguous to River Niger to brace up for impending flood - Guardian Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/news/agency-warns-states-contiguous-to-river-niger-to-brace-up-for-impending-flood/,"As River Niger reaches red alert

Following warning alert received from the Niger Basin Authority indicating that River Niger has reached Red alert of 6.60m the Nigerian Hydrological Service Agency has warned states contiguous to the Niger River to brace up for impending flood disaster.

The agency warned that It is expected that the flood magnitude sighted in Niamey, Niger Republic on the 23rd August 2020 would arrive Nigeria through Kebbi state on the 6th of September and flood other states contiguous to River Niger including Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa

NHSA Director General Engr Clement Nze in a press statement made available to journalists yesterday explained that he River Niger Basin which covers nine (9) countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, has Nigeria at the lowest portion of the Basin, meaning that that once the upper catchment of the Basin gets flooded, Nigeria should be prepared to experience flooding incident.

He said “As at today, the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin made up of Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso and part of Mali, have been flooded. The flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malanville (Benin Republic) have gotten to the Red Alert Zone”

Nze pointed out that Operators of Kainji and Jebba Dams have long been alerted to take appropriate measures in the operation of the reservoirs and accordingly, Kainji Dam is now spilling water at the rate of 1,000 m3/s that is 86.4 million cubic metres/day, saying this means that communities downstream Kainji and Jebba Dams could be flooded while Shiroro Dam on Kaduna River is still impounding, though there is the possibility of spilling water in the weeks ahead.

On River Benue sub-basin, the DG stated that the agency has maintained close contact with the Cameroonian authorities with regards to flood scenarios in the upper catchment of the sub-basin and Information received by NIHSA from the relevant authority in Cameroon stated that the Lagdo Dam is still impounding water.

He noted that the high intensity of rainfall during the last week of August has already saturated the soil and any rainfall of high intensity with long duration would translate into flooding in most part of the country.

He revealed that So far, Urban/Flash Flood has wrecked havocs in about 70 council areas in 20 states of the federation and the FCTof the Federation, including the FCT.

The NHSA boss recalled that the year 2020 Annual Flood Outlook predicted that some parts of at least 102 LGAs in 28 States fall within the Highly Probable Flood Risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 States of the Federation, including the FCT, fall within the Moderately Probable Flood Risk areas. The remaining 397 LGAs fall within the Low Probable Flood Risks areas.

It also warned The states that are contiguous to rivers Niger and Benue, namely: – Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa are likely to be affected by river flooding, while Coastal flooding is expected in Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, and Bayelsa States.

On account of poor drainage systems, flash and urban floods are expected to occur in major cities across the country, namely Birnin–Kebbi, Sokoto, Lokoja, Kaduna, Suleja, Gombe, Yola, Makurdi, Abuja, Lafia, Asaba, Port Harcourt, Yenagoa, Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Benin City, Oshogbo, Ado-Ekiti, Abakaliki, Awka, Nsukka.

The DG warned that the country still has many days of rainfall in the course of the year and More floods are expected in the months of August, September and October this year, in the event there is release of excess water from the Dams in other countries upstream rivers Niger and Benue this year, this will have more negative impacts on Nigeria which is located downstream other countries in the Niger Basin.

He urged that to prevent flood disaster,

blocked drainages and gutters should be cleared, river channels dredged and structures within the waterways and floodplains and flood paths pulled down.","Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-74.jpeg,"['river', 'world', 'flooding', 'flood', 'impending', 'expected', 'states', 'guardian', 'warned', 'nigeria', 'rivers', 'niger', 'contiguous', 'basin', 'warns']", ,flood

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos by Dallas County Police DepartmentDALLAS—After the kidnapping and killing of 4-year-old Cash Gernon in Dallas last week, neighbor Jose Alvarado checked his security cameras for any footage that might help investigators.What he found sent a chill up his spine.The video is from 10 weeks before little Cash was left dead of stab wounds on the ground. But it shows the teenager charged with abducting him, Darriynn Brown, skulking down the street, opening Alvarado’s backyard gate and peering in before quickly walking away.“It’s really scary,” Alvarado told The Daily Beast. “I have two kids, one girl and one boy, and they play basketball in the backyard.”Alvarado’s house shares a back alley with the home of Monica Sherrod, 35, who was taking care of Cash and his twin, Carter. She has said she was dating the twins’ father, Trevor Gernon, a 31-year-old construction worker, until he reportedly left town in March when a court ordered him to report to rehab.That left Sherrod to care for the boys for the next two months—unbeknownst to their mother, Melinda Seagroves, who lives in Houston.Early on the morning of May 15, a young man crept into the twins’ bedroom, lifted a still-sleeping Cash out of the toddler bed he shared with Carter, and walked out—a chilling scene captured in grainy black and white by a baby monitor.The footage, obtained by the Daily Mail, shows the intruder returning about two hours later, hovering over the bed where Carter remained in slumber, before abruptly leaving as though he was startled by something.By then, Cash was already dead.Antwainese Square, a Dallas teacher who lives in the area, was out for her morning walk around 6:45 a.m. when she saw a clump of hair on the ground she thought belonged to a dog.“I was on the phone with my mom,” Square told The Daily Beast. “As I got closer, I could see an arm and a foot and I just began crying, saying, ‘Mom, I think I'm coming up on a body.’ And I started, ‘Mommy, it’s a child! It’s a child!’ And the baby had blood all over his face. At that point, my mom told me to get off the phone with her and immediately call 911… The baby had ants all over the bottom of his feet. So I pretty much knew that he was gone.”Square said she remembers “being in denial,” and hoped Cash was actually just sleeping even though he was obviously dead. “I was just trying to put together all possible stories; there was no way in my mind that I would think somebody would do that to a kid,” she said, adding that she stayed with Cash’s body until police and paramedics arrived so no one would run over him.“One couple that was leaving out of their garage, I had to stop them to let them know that this baby was on the ground,” Square said.More than three hours later, Sherrod reported Cash missing. “The day that he was missing, I got up late and thought it was weird,” Sherrod would later tell the Daily Mail. “I was like, ‘It's 10 o'clock already, you guys.’ So I figured Cash was still in bed.” Cash Gernon was abducted out of his bed on May 15. Handout Later that day, police arrested Brown, 18, who lives with his parents about a half-mile from where Cash’s body was found, according to court documents. He was charged with kidnapping and burglary, but not murder because police said they are waiting for the result of forensic tests.Held in lieu of $1.5 million bail, Brown could not be reached for comment and does not have a lawyer listed in court records. His mother, Mimi, has told reporters that she believes her son is being framed.A tangled web of relationships, criminal records, and an unknown motive hangs over the case.Sherrod, the mother of several children, has a criminal record that includes assault and DWI. Trevor Gernon, who has an extensive rap sheet, appears to have vanished; a phone number listed under his name was disconnected. Darriynn Brown, meanwhile, is reportedly a friend of one of Sherrod’s children and had been seen playing with children in Sherrod’s care.Sherrod initially characterized any relationship she or her kids had with Brown, who attended the same high school as at least one of the boys living in her house, as minimal. She later told a reporter that Brown had visited her home two days before Cash’s murder, but she was out grocery shopping at the time.According to multiple neighbors, Brown was definitely not an unfamiliar face around the neighborhood. One told The Daily Beast the teen regularly played football and basketball with some of the kids who lived with Sherrod. Others said they had spotted Brown on their Ring security cameras hanging out in the area.Little information has emerged about Seagroves, who now has custody of Carter. Seagroves did not respond to multiple interview requests, but her mother, Connie Ward, told The Daily Beast this week: “We are not ready to give any kind of statement. My family is broken. It has been a nightmare listening and watching the news about our baby and stories being reported that are false.”Seagroves does not appear to have had any brushes with the law, but court records show both Sherrod and Gernon have records that include arrests for assaulting their own parents.In 2013, Sherrod pleaded guilty to attacking her mother, Lezlee Pinkerton. According to a criminal affidavit signed by Officer Glenn Burkheimer-Lubeck of the Harris County Constable’s Office, Sherrod “intentionally struck” Pinkerton in the head and chest with her hand and pulled her to the ground, then “cause[d] bodily injury” to Pinkerton “by stomping on [Pinkerton’s] toes with her feet.”“Complainant reports that she believes her toes are broken,” the affidavit says. Sherrod was sentenced to two years of community supervision, participation in a domestic violence treatment program, a $100 donation to a family violence center, and a $200 fine.In 2018, Gernon was arrested by deputies from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office for assaulting his father, Roger Gernon, during a dispute over a credit card bill, Texas court records show. When Roger Gernon told his son that he was going to call the police, Trevor grabbed the phone away, bloodied his dad’s arm with his fingernails, and elbowed him in the chest. Charged with misdemeanor assault and interference with an emergency telephone call, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 68 days in county jail.In addition to the assault of family members, both Sherrod and Gernon have a history of theft, fraud, and drug possession.Sherrod’s most recent arrest was for DWI; she has also pleaded guilty to identity fraud charges, meth possession, driving without a license, and misdemeanor theft.Gernon’s most recent arrest was for the possession of narcotics in 2020. He was previously charged for possession of methamphetamine in 2016. His rap sheet includes a range of other crimes.Neal Flanagan, who co-owns a corrosion-proofing business, told The Daily Beast he met Gernon in high school, then reconnected in 2016. He gave Gernon a bit of work because he was struggling. Then things went sideways.“My ex-wife and I were married at the time,” said Flanagan. “We had started having issues. She separated from me in January 2017. That’s when Trevor and her started seeing each other.”“I never did see him after,” said Flanagan. “A couple years later, he messaged me on Facebook. Like, ‘Hey buddy. How you been?’ Like nothing ever happened.""When he was sober, Gernon “was as good as you could ask for,” Neal’s father, Johnny Flanagan, said. But he added that he wasn’t surprised Gernon took off without his boys.“He's one of these guys that kind of goes whichever way the wind blows, you know, and he'll do good for several months and then do bad for several months and you know, just up and disappear,” Flanagan said.Gernon’s whereabouts are unknown. Following his indictment on felony drug possession charges last November, he failed to appear for a March 29, 2021, hearing and thus forfeited a $10,000 bond payment. There is now an open warrant out for his arrest.None of the various defense lawyers who represented Sherrod or Gernon in court agreed to speak, citing attorney-client privilege.Cash’s death has raised many questions about those responsible for him. But in the neighborhood where he spent his last months, the overriding mystery is why would someone kill a defenseless child and leave him on the street like trash. Steven Monacelli The solidly working-class Mountain Creek section of Dallas is a quiet place, bordered on one side by the 600-acre Cedar Ridge nature preserve. Houses are in decent shape, and yards are clean. On the street where Cash’s body was found, locals have been stopping at a shrine to leave toys, flowers, and other mementos.The woman who found Cash’s body, meanwhile, has been struggling with her emotions since that morning.“It's been difficult. It really has been difficult,” Square told The Daily Beast.“I have a 3-year-old and as we're dealing with this and processing this, I'm learning that I have little triggers. If I see a little boy, 4, 3, 5, I will burst out crying. It’s just a trigger for me. My own daughter is like a trigger. Sometimes she'll say something and I'll cry.“Because even though I didn't know that baby, he was just robbed of his life. So, it's been really hard. It's been really hard to just process this. And no matter how much you try to move on, you can't unsee what you saw.”Rohrlich reported from New York and Monacelli from DallasRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

96,96,FL-2020-000196-NGA,"Nearly 80% of Nigerian farmers affected by floods, drought in 2020 — Report - Premium Times",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/agriculture/agric-news/436380-nearly-80-of-nigerian-farmers-affected-by-floods-drought-in-2020-report.html,"About 79 per cent of Nigerian farmers were estimated to have been affected by the ravaging effects of drought and flooding in 2020, a survey conducted in seven states of the country has shown.

The analysis by SBMIntel, an Africa focused research firm, revealed that the harvests of 26.3 per cent of Nigerian farmers were greatly affected by extreme weather conditions.

It said 52.60 per cent ”were somewhat affected and a fifth (21.1 per cent) were not affected by drought and flooding in the year under review.”

The survey, titled: “Nigerians just want to eat” and published this month, chronicled the major challenges bedevilling Nigerian farmers and food transporters which are capable of impeding national food security.

Survey

Data for the survey were sampled from seven Nigerian states, namely; Nasarawa, Osun, Benue, Oyo, Katsina, Ogun and Lagos.

Of the seven states surveyed, the report noted that the majority of the respondents (farmers) had their farms in the South-west States (73.7 per cent)—Lagos (36.8 per cent ), Oyo (21.1 per cent ) and Ogun (15.8 per cent ) .

Meanwhile, 10.5 per cent of the respondents had their farms in Benue and the remaining 15.9 per cent were equally distributed between Nasarawa, Osun and Katsina states respectively.

The farmers surveyed were mostly crop farmers who grew a wide range of staples with fruits, vegetables, cassava and maize farmers in the majority, the report noted.

Scourge

According to the survey, extreme climatic events such as flooding and drought witnessed in some states within the country triggered the negative effects being noticed on the prices of staple foods.

It said flooding in Nigeria was experienced in the north, mostly in states like Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara, and some parts of Kwara.

“In fact, in Kebbi alone, 500,000 hectares of farmland were destroyed by flooding, with the cost being upward of N5 billion,” the report said.

Also, it stated that the problem that faced farmers in the South-western region was the lack of rainfall experienced during the mid-planting season last year.

“Last year, the ‘August break’ actually began in early July and lasted through till the end of August. This prevented the planting of maize, cassava and cash crops like cocoa,” the survey added.

According to the survey, ”more than half of the farmers engaged had no irrigation system, even when they believed that it will help greatly in their farming endeavours.”

It said 57.90 per cent of the respondents said ”they do not own any irrigation system that could help complement the absence of rainfall when asked if they have, only 42.10 per cent had”.

”However, about 94.7 per cent of the respondents agreed to a large extent that an irrigation system would help their farming system while 10.5 per cent said it would only help to a small extent and 5.3 per cent said to no extent,” it added.

The survey said most farmers are getting discouraged over their inability to own irrigation systems or the technology of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) to support crops during adverse weather conditions.

Recommendations

In order to mitigate the challenges being faced by these farmers and food transporters, the report recommends that both state and federal governments adopt ”wider irrigation systems and as well facilitate the provision of early maturing and drought-resistant crop varieties.”

“Switching to climate-smart agriculture is the best way to guard against crop failure and poor yields,” the survey reads in part.

The report said respondents asked the government to fix access roads and provide adequate transportation that is cheap, effective and efficient.

“An efficient rail system will reduce the cost of transporting farm produce to the markets and improve food security. Security remains paramount followed by access to land and irrigation infrastructure,” the report quoted the farmers to have said.","Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/06/IMG-20200628-WA0015-e1593352816374.jpg?fit=970%2C436&ssl=1,"['farmers', 'flooding', 'survey', '2020', 'floods', 'cent', 'states', 'irrigation', 'respondents', 'system', '80', 'nigerian', 'affected', 'nearly', 'report', 'drought']", ,flood
97,97,FL-2020-000196-NGA,"Climate Change in Nigeria: Floods in Lagos, Abuja, Niger Delta are going to get a lot worse - Quartz Africa",https://qz.com/africa/1054825/climate-change-in-nigeria-floods-in-lagos-abuja-niger-delta-are-going-to-get-a-lot-worse/,"Earlier this year heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos, Nigeria’s economic nerve centre and one of Africa’s most populous cities. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

Pictures and videos later posted online showed dramatic and even bizarre scenes of flooding in the city, including the capture of a crocodile in the floodwater. Another video, which went viral, was one of a man kayaking in floodwater on one of the streets.

Lagos has not been alone. Suleija, a town near the capital city Abuja hundreds of kilometres away, suffered its own flooding challenge in early July. Heavy rains washed houses away and caused others to collapse, trapping occupants. Thirteen people were reported to have died.

The two primary factors of flooding in Nigeria are climate change and poor urban planning.

Some of the worst flooding in recent memory happened five years ago in March 2012 when 32 of Nigeria’s 36 states were affected, 24 severely. More than 360 people were killed and almost two million people were displaced.

The seriousness of the flooding was attributed to a combination of two events: very heavy local rainfall and the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in nearby Cameroon.

Although the degree and seriousness of flooding in Nigeria fluctuates, flooding remains a recurring phenomenon in most parts of the country. The first factor aggravating flooding is climate change, which has been shown to contribute to more extreme storms and rainfall. Another factor contributing to flooding in cities is that Nigeria has experienced rapid urban growth and planning is poor.

The problem of flooding is not peculiar to Nigeria alone. In 2007, floods affected 1.5 million people across several countries in Africa, including Uganda, Sudan, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and Niger. Alluvial flooding is common for major rivers—such as Nile, Niger, Benue, Orange, Zambezi—in Africa. Major cities in Africa are also susceptible to fluvial flooding which occurs when excessive rainfall, over an extended period of time, causes rivers to overflow.

Why Nigeria suffers

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria (1978 to 2007) suggests that rainstorms are getting more intense. The data show that there are fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed much from previous decades. This means that more rain is falling on the days that there is rain, which in turn means that rain storms in the city are getting more intense, increasing the threat of flooding.

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria suggests rainstorms are getting more intense with fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed.

In addition to more intense rain storms, the other possible cause of flooding in coastal regions is rising sea levels. Although up-to-date data on the rising sea levels in Nigeria are scarce, it’s believed that if nothing is done, this is likely to aggravate flooding in the future, particularly in coastal cities.

Areas at risk include Lagos, which is on the coast, as well as the Niger Delta region which has many low-lying towns and villages. Being on the coast also makes these places more susceptible to storm surges. While these areas are no stranger to floods, evidence suggests that floods have become increasingly common and intense in recent times.

In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the adjoining states. The changes in rainfall patterns, particularly in frequency and intensity, have meant that these events have begun to happen more frequently.

In Nigeria’s cities, the most common cause of flooding after excessive rains is poor drainage systems that can’t cope. This is called pluvial flooding. Lagos provides a good case study.

Lagos as a case study

Lagos has been urbanizing rapidly. By some estimates there will be 19 million in the city by 2050, making it the 11th most populous city in the world. It is also home to most of the country’s industrial, commercial and non-oil operations.

Urbanisation and industrialisation increase the number of roads and buildings. This in turn increases the proportion of surface area where water cannot be absorbed into the ground, leading to rapid runoff which then causes flooding during storms. And in cities that manage their infrastructure well, storm water drainage systems are built so that water can be directed to rivers efficiently and quickly.

Lagos has not kept up with its infrastructure needs. The growth and expansion of the city has been largely unregulated. The has resulted in inadequate and poor housing, the development of slum areas and inadequate water supply and waste disposal, among other problems.

What’s complicated the situation for Lagos is that many parts of the city were originally low-lying mangrove swamps and wetlands, which have been reclaimed and settled, mostly by poorer communities and more recently through concerted efforts by the government.

These low-lying areas are particularly at risk of flooding, and the situation is complicated by buildings being constructed on water ways, and bad waste dumping habits which block the drains.

Up to 70% of the population of Lagos live in slums.

What must be done

It’s clear Nigeria needs to take measures to cope with flooding. This will require both local and international interventions, and could include early warning and rapid response systems, flood data gathering and modelling, proper urban and spatial planning, flood emergency preparedness and political will.

The country can learn from others. For example, in Mumbai, India various measures have been implemented to reduce the impact of flooding. These have included an emergency control centre, automated weather stations, removal of solid waste from stormwater drains and the development of emergency response mechanisms. Nigeria must invest in these measures, and sustain them.

DAVID TILLMAN: Hello, I'm meteorologist David Tillman with your one-minute weather forecast. The threat for heavy rain is not over, and it's going to come from moisture in the Gulf of Mexico that the National Hurricane Center is now giving a 20% chance of developing. So that's an 80% chance that it will not develop.

But all of this moisture is going to be lifting in our general direction. And that means for the next couple of days, it's going to be pretty wet around here. Things are quiet out there overnight, but this moisture is going to be moving in our direction.

We think the deep moisture will start to move in as we get into Friday afternoon. That's when scattered heavy downpours are going to be likely around southeast Texas. And there could be some instances of some street flooding as well with this activity. It'll last overnight on Friday into Saturday morning.

And off and on, on Saturday, we'll see these downpours around. That as we get into Sunday, we'll begin to see some of this rain hit off to the west of us, but not before producing a good one to two, maybe three inches of rain around southeast Texas.

There could be some isolated places that get up to four inches of rain. Here's the extended forecast. We're calling for an 80% chance for rain Friday afternoon, evening and night, 70% on Saturday, 40% on Sunday, and then we'll be back to 20% as we head into next week.","Fri, 21 May 2021 01:13:14 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/21/60a7071460b4aa6168ac7cfb/60a7071460b4aa6168ac7cfc_o_U_v2.jpg,"['southeast', 'rain', 'moisture', 'tillman', 'going', 'downpours', '20', 'system', 'chance', 'gulf', 'thats', 'tropical', 'heavy', 'development']", ,flood

It had rained heavily that day in the capital city, Abuja. Trademore Estate in Lugbe, where Igwe runs a cybercafe business, was overrun by rainwater. The force of the flood pulled down the fence of Igwe’s office complex and destroyed a part of the building. In no time, the property was floating on water.

Igwe’s business was greatly affected as he lost machines and computers. It took his entire savings and the support of friends and family for him to be able to recover from the event of that day, he tells TheCable.

“I lost over two million naira worth of [electronics], my machines were all gone, my computers, everything. We didn’t expect such here,” he says.

Like Igwe, Victor Essang, a resident of Calabar, Cross River state capital, has also recorded losses to flooding.

First, his family lost a block of flats inherited from their grandparents, and later, his poultry business took a hit in 2016.

Igwe and Essang are just two of the many Nigerians who suffer the consequences of flooding that occurs yearly in different parts of the country during the rainy season.

SEVERE FLOOD PREDICTIONS

During the 2021 flood outlook presentation, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) announced that 28 states, including the FCT, will most likely experience flooding this year.

Similarly, the Nigeria Meteorological Agency, in its 2021 seasonal climate forecast, said the signals monitored by the agency in the last seven years show that things are changing on the climate front and that this year, Nigeria is expected to experience unprecedented heavy downpours.

The information is intended to alert Nigerians, government, relevant agencies and stakeholders of what is to come in order for them to prepare — prevent, mitigate and respond — for severe flooding.

Going by the alert, Igwe says he intends to raise his compound level to prevent rainwater from entering in the event of a flood.

On his part, Essang says he was already apprehensive about the severity of this year’s rainfall, even before the alert. He tells TheCable that he has relocated his belongings to a safer place.

“I have packed out my things to a safe place, I will bring them back when the rain stops. My only prayer is God will not let it bring our house down,” he says.

CLIMATE CHANGE A DRIVING FACTOR IN FLOODING

A report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) states that extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global climate change increase the likelihood of floods.

Chukwudi Njoku, a doctoral researcher on climate change at the University of Calabar, says flooding in Nigeria can be linked to both natural and human activities that influence changes in the climate.

“When there is high temperature, then there is increased possibility for evaporation – the process where water vapour is taken from the earth surface into the atmosphere — which can trigger much more rainfall,” he tells TheCable.

“The rising temperature here is a climate change feedback and when evaporation is increased, there is the possibility of more rainfall and when rainfall increases, simultaneously it could trigger flooding.”

Research by MOJ Ecology & Environmental Sciences (MOJES) has shown that human activities such as urbanisation, felling of forest trees and burning of fossil fuels, among others, lead to the emission of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.

According to the study, these activities distort the carbon cycle – the process in which carbon atoms move from the atmosphere to the earth and then back into the atmosphere. The activities also initiate climate change processes which involve a variety of changes including higher surface temperatures and changes to the hydrological cycle – the process in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and then back in form of rain.

Njoku believes that these human activities are what increases and make worse the impacts of climate change on humans and their environment.

“Such activities like urbanisation which is not properly done in a sustainable manner, for example, people building in floodplains and swampy areas which are supposed to serve as banks for water, thus reducing the ability of the environment to collect and keep excess water,” the researcher explains.

“Also, the clearing of forest areas for agriculture increases the extent of bare surfaces that would have hitherto collected runoff water and reduced the flow of water.

“These human activities are not sustainable and where they are not checked, they only go to increase the susceptibility of the people to flooding which appears to be inevitable at this time considering the increasing temperature and rainfall events.”

He advises that people living in flood-prone areas should be relocated and government should put laws in place to deter chaotic urbanisation, create more awareness about the potential increase in flooding events and their dangers, and also ensure that roads and drainages are constructed to accommodate the volume of water from the rain.

HOW IS GOVERNMENT PREPARING?

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), whose responsibility is to manage disasters, tells TheCable that the agency had information about imminent flooding since February through the seasonal climate predictions document made available by NIMET.

“Before that presentation by NIHSA, NEMA already had some information about the outlook of the rains and the consequences of the flood. So having the information, the agency had called together experts to analyse the predictions of NIMET and come out with a disaster risk management of the prediction,” says Manzo Ezekiel, public relations officer of NEMA.

“The secretary will soon convene a meeting of all the state emergency management agencies and relevant organisations that their activities or mandate have something to do with the management of floods.

“During that meeting, NEMA is going to communicate to them that this is the information we have and this information is going to cover your area of operation, what and what can you do about it. That is the next line of action that we have. That meeting will take hold very soon.”

The PRO said the zonal offices of the agency “are already on standby to take the information down to the specific communities that are at risk of flooding”.

He said the agency will ensure continuous engagement with Nigerians and create awareness at the federal, state, and local government levels to ensure that flooding does not take Nigerians by surprise.

“We are going to tell them that, this year there is a forecast of increased rainfall and this will likely interrupt your stay here,” he says.

SPEEDY MITIGATION EFFORTS NEEDED

While government agencies are still at the preparation stage, Igwe wishes they can speed up the process since the country is already in the rainy season.

He believes the annual flood events in his locality is a result of the lack of an adequate drainage system which the government had earlier promised to expand.

“I think the major cause is the drainage system. I wish the government could even rush down and do it for us today today today,” he says.

Igwe desires the speedy process because, according to him, the relief materials government agencies offer in the aftermath of flooding do not equate to the losses.

“When they were sharing their palliatives, I just refused; how can somebody lose about two point something million and you are giving him a pack of Indomie and small 5kg camping gas cylinder?” Igwe adds.","Thu, 20 May 2021 07:27:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FLOOD-PRONE-AREAS-IN-FCT1-1.png,"['information', 'water', 'process', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'arising', 'states', 'igwe', '28', 'nigeria', 'prepared', 'risk', 'agency', 'rainfall', 'matters', 'activities']", ,flood

He spoke at the public presentation of 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) tagged “Managing Flood for Sustainable Development in COVID-19 Era” organised by NIHSA, yesterday, in Abuja.

Adamu said that 302 local government areas in 36 states, including Federal Capital Territory ( FCT), would fall within moderate flood risk areas while 121 councils in 28 states would be within the highly probable risk areas.

“This year, like 2020, we will be grappling with the two threats of the COVID-19 pandemic and related hygiene challenges as well as the impending floods as predicted in the AFO. The 2021 floods levels will be higher than in the previous years but will not attain the levels of the 2012 that was devastating,” he said.

The minister also warned that states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue, including Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nassarawa and Kogi, are likely to experience river flooding.

Others are Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa states. Coastal flooding is expected to affect Rivers, Cross River, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states.

“Flash and urban floods from heavy inundation are predicted to occur in some major cities. The severity would depend on availability and adequacy of drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.”

Adamu, therefore, called on all stakeholders, including policy makers and agencies, to rise up to the challenge of impending floods and threats of COVID-19.

Director General of NIHSA, Clement Nzeh, said: “States and relevant authorities as well as farmers must take the flood outlook serious by putting in place measures to mitigated its impact.

“There is a greater awareness for this year’s outlook in terms of the level of participation and political will, looking at representation, including governors, senators and key agencies. I believe they are going to cascade this to the grassroots.”

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has identified 10 local government areas in Cross River State that fall under the probable flood risk areas in view of the Annual Flood Outlook for 2021.

The agency also identified two local government areas in the state that falls under the highly probable risk areas for 2021.

The Director-General of NEMA, Muhammadu Muhammed, said this in Ikom Local Government Area while distributing relief materials to victims of windstorm in the area.

Mr Muhammed, who was represented by Godwin Tepikor, the zonal coordinator of NEMA, South-south, urged the state government to immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities to mitigate the impact.

He mentioned the 10 local government areas to include Yakurr, Calabar Municipal, Akpabuyo, Obubra, Bakassi, Ogoja, Biase, Etung, Odukpani and Ikom.

He said the two local government areas in the state that fall under highly probable risks areas were Calabar South and Abi.

“The state should immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities so as to mitigate the impact of the predicted flood on the vulnerable local government areas,” he said.

The agency distributed relief materials to over 1,000 households affected by windstorm in four communities in Ikom local government area of Cross River.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the distribution followed the windstorm disaster that occurred on May, last year, in Ogomogom, Akorofono, Nkarasi and Abinti communities, all in Ikom Local Government Area.

The director general said the items were approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, following the recommendation from the agency as humanitarian assistance to the affected persons.

The items distributed were bags of rice, beans and garri, tomato paste, kegs of palm oil, wrappers, blankets, bundles of roofing sheets, cement, bags of nails, zinc and ceiling boards.

He urged the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the items.

In his remark, the Director General, Cross River State Emergency Management Agency, Princewill Ayim, thanked NEMA for its intervention.

The Chairman of Ikom Local Government Area, Kingsley Egumi, thanked President Buhari and NEMA for the timely response to the concerns of their people, pledging that the items would be judiciously utilised.

Mfam Akong, who responded on behalf of the beneficiaries, thanked NEMA for its assistance.

3,3,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Why Lagosians should heed flood alert | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World NewsOpinion — The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/opinion/why-lagosians-should-heed-flood-alert/,"Sir: On April 14, 2021, the Lagos State Government predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state, therefore, directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic Implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello, “…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm. It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

In downscaling the predictions of the flood alerts, the state government is therefore collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET). In addition to what the Environment and Water Resources commissioner said, the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe declared, “I…urge residents to support the government to achieve flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again being littered by residents.”

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.

4,4,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Rainy season: Fears over impending flood in the land - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/rainy-season-fears-over-impending-flood-in-the-land/,"In fact, the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, who released the prediction, warned: “…the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Jolted by the report, many residents told The Guardian that they fear for the worst, noting that they had not recovered from the devastating effects of last year’s flood.

A resident in Bello Street in Ilasamaja area of the state, Tomiwa Sulaimon, said while she would love to move to another area before the rains start, it was not financially possible for her at this time.

She recalled: “Last year when it was raining almost everyday, our street and house got flooded every other day. This street is a bit low and erosion has eaten a good part of the road and despite our little efforts to keep the flood at bay, the water always finds a way to get in. The worst part is that those refuse disposal trucks hardly come around, claiming that we owe them for several months but if they hardly come around, how do they expect to get paid? They come around only once in a blue moon and in the meantime, we have to find a way to help ourselves. I want to plead with the government to tell them to improve on their services so that people are not forced to dump refuse indiscriminately.”

x

A shop owner, who identified herself as Blessing Ogbe, lamented that residents in the area were responsible for the constant flooding in the area whenever it rains.

Ogbe said: “The landlords and agents are very greedy. Once they see one small space, they will construct shops on it, most times blocking the water channels in the process. At Taiwo Junction and Transformer bus stop, that place is a major water channel but go and see for yourself. They have built a row of shops there now, blocking the gutter. So, anytime rain falls, the water has nowhere to go.

“The residents themselves are always so eager to throw refuse into the gutter when it is raining or by the roadside, some of which also end up in the gutter. The roads are bad and gutters are very narrow; so the water has nowhere to go as such. This has been a recurring problem for many years now and we have been making private efforts but we need the government to step in for us now.”

An estate agent whose office is located along Okota road, Yusuf Isa, expressed fears that his office might not survive another rainy season, lamenting that floodwater finds its way into the office with the smallest rainfall.

He said: “No matter how shortly it rains, this side of Okota road leading to Jakande Gate always gets flooded. We have carried out several interventions by ourselves and would appreciate if the government can step in now. We tried to channel the flood through Akiti to connect it to the canal at Oke-Afa but there is a limit to what we can do on our own. Because of this, Okota and Akiti are usually flooded but what can we do?”

Many residents in Oke-Afa, Okota, Ibeju Lekki and Ikorodu areas of the state, who spoke with The Guardian, also recounted similar tales of woe. Lagosians who reside along flood plains of major rivers and drainage channels such as Owode, Iwaya, Makoko, Badia, Ijora, Isaalu, Pota and Shibiri, among others, could not be reached. But Bello had advised them to always be on the alert and ready to move to higher grounds when the need arises, adding that they would be duly notified at the appropriate time.

He stated that the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) of the ministry had been consistently de-silting and working on various linkages to the secondary and primary channels to enable them discharge efficiently and act as retention basins.

Bello also disclosed that the government was maintaining the long-established synergy with Ogun-Oshun River Basin Authority, which had ensured control and monitoring of the steady and systemic release of water from Oyan Dam to prevent flooding the downstream reaches.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, an engineer, also stated that the state government would dredge about 221 collector drains and 32 primary channels measuring about 72 km spread across the 20 local councils of the state to checkmate flooding.

He reiterated that EFAG would continue to de-silt various tertiary channels and manholes measuring about 100 kilometres across the state.

While restating the present administration’s resolve to find a lasting solution to flooding in the state, he called on residents to desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on the rights of way of canals, adding that it was regrettable that several of the canals recently cleaned up were being littered with refuse.

Lagos might appear on top of the situation. But the problem of flooding at the peak of the rainy season is not limited to the state alone; it is a national problem. Since 2012 when floods killed 363 people and displaced over 2.1 million others from their homes between early July and November 5, no year has passed without the natural disaster claiming lives and property worth billions of naira in the country. From Lagos to Delta, Anambra, Imo, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Osun, Taraba and Kebbi states, among others, flood wreaks havoc on homes and farms yearly with adverse effects on the economy of the country and health of citizens.

The most recent report on the natural disaster, which was released by the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Muhammadu Muhammed, in early December 2020, stated that, “the devastating impact of the 2020 flooding killed 68 people, affected 35 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 320 local councils and over 129,000 people.”

Now, the question is: With another rainy season at hand and with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) predicting that “the country is expected to have rainfall amounts from 400mm in the North to over 3000mm in the South,” what are communities and the state governments doing to avert a reoccurrence? The Guardian spoke with relevant stakeholders in Akwa Ibom, Osun, Imo, Delta and Cross River states on the issue. The stories are as follows:

Solution To Your Flood Problem Underway, A’Ibom Govt Re-assures Apprehensive Residents

From Inemesit Akpan-Nsoh, Uyo

AS the rains begin to set in, residents of flood prone areas in Akwa Ibom State have sent a Save Our Souls (SOS) message to the state government to come to their aid so as to avert the perennial flooding they have been experiencing year in year out.

In Uyo, the state capital, residents in areas like Abak Road, Atiku Abubakar, IBB Avenue, Esuene Street, Ukana Offot/adjourning streets, Atan, Use and Effiat Offot communities have appealed to the government to replicate the ‘magic’ it used to control flooding and erosion along Oron road by Nsikak Eduok and Edet Akpan Avenue in their areas.

x

The residents noted that controlling the flood in their areas would enable them to access their homes, have their properties secured and ensure that they would no longer live in fear whenever rain is about to fall.

Mr. Okon Etim of Ukana Offot street told The Guardian that the flooding on his street had for several years rendered many persons homeless.

According to him, the government had always given affected residents relief materials when their household properties were destroyed, with a pledge to find a permanent solution to the menace.

He, however, lamented that successive governments had tried to remedy the situation to no avail. Offot said the situation appears to have worsened as houses along Calabar, Port Harcourt and Esuene streets and parts of the Federal Housing Estate are no-go-area once the rains set in.

Other residents, including Mrs. Nkoyo Akpan and Augustine Effiong, among others, also called on the government to come to their aid, adding that they could not afford the money to relocate or construct another apartment at the moment.

Findings by The Guardian, which the residents acknowledged, indicated that structures in the areas were built on the right of way, thereby blocking free flow of floodwater.



Responding to the cries of residents, the state Commissioner for Environment and Petroleum Resources, Mr. Charles Udoh, said government was aware of the problem, noting that it has, in conjunction with the World Bank, awarded the contract that would address it to China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) at an estimated cost of N12 billion.

Udoh stated that the 7.2-kilomtre flood control project covers 17 communities in three local councils; namely Uyo, Nsit Ibom and Ibesikpo Asutan.

His words: “The reality is that the government cannot go everywhere to de-silt gutters. So, while the government is doing the common areas, the government is calling on residents and citizens to also embark on de-silting of gutters. Flooding sometimes comes from bad habits like dumping refuse into gutters. We are also calling on our people to desist from dumping refuse into gutters. The waste management agency of the state is embarking on massive de-silting of drains all over the state.



“This is in addition to the three major flagship projects of the ministry that talks about water collection and harvesting, erosion control project, one in Etim Umana, one in Anua and then the IBB erosion control. IBB will not be completed this rainy season, but this is the last rainy season that everybody affected on the IBB corridor will face flooding. Once that is done, the entire Atiku Abubakar, Abak road axis, Mechanic village, State Secretariat, Atan, Effiat and Use Offot communities will be evacuated.

“We will also evacuate water from Area ‘C’ Police Command. All the water will be taken to the outfall drain and also taking water at some point of Ring Road Two. But we cannot complete the entire process within this rainy season. The IBB project is 8.4 kilometres, the biggest flood control project ongoing in Nigeria now.”



We Don’t Want To Abandon Our Homes Again, Osun Residents Cry Out

From Timothy Agbor, Osogbo

Some residents in flood-prone areas in Osun State have cried out to the state government to assist them in mitigating the problem this year.

Speaking with The Guardian, residents in flood-prone areas like Rasco, Gbonmi and Gbodofon appealed to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to save them from losing their houses to flood this year.

A landlord at Gbonmi, Mr. Suraju Kamaruden, said many house owners and residents in the community always relocate to safe areas when the rainy season is at its peak, adding: “We don’t want to abandon our houses again. That is why we are begging our government to come to our aid and help us.”

x

A trader at Rasco area in Osogbo, Mr. Jude Okpara, said traders in the area face difficult times during rainy season as flood always submerges their shops.

“We don’t have any other place to go. If not, we would have left this area. Although the government expanded the waterways about three years ago, the water still overflows its boundaries and submerges our shops. We are tired,” he lamented.

Chairman of Olorunwa Sawmill in Oke-Baale community, Osogbo, Mr. Sunday Ajewole, said there was an urgent need for government to construct a bigger drainage channel that would accommodate much floodwater when the rain is at its peak.

He said: “For the past seven years, we have been battling with flood. Every time we are in the rainy season, we always lose our planks to flood. Our government would always clear and expand the waterways every year but we are still battling flood. Most times when government fails to do something and we are approaching rainy season, we hire some labourers to help us clear the waterways. Sometimes we contribute between N80,000 to N100,000 and give to the dredgers. Still, we are not safe.

“We have discovered that the problem is that we have only one ring that forms the bridge of the waterways. And the ring is very small. The water that gushes from Ona-Baba-Ona area and Arogunmosa community would divert at our area and the ring doesn’t have the capacity to make it flow, as it should. It usually bounces back to where we stay, sweep our goods away and even sack residents out of their homes.

“This year, to lessen the severity of the flood, the government has cleared the waterways for us but once it rains heavily, there will be flood. Until the bridge is re-constructed and a bigger ring is fixed, we may not be out of this flood problem. We don’t have the financial strength to construct a bigger bridge and that’s why we are appealing to government to come to our aid.

“We have lost millions of naira worth of goods and property to flood in this area. We are afraid that if nothing is done again this year, property or even lives may be lost to flood because we have started seeing signs that it will rain heavily this year.”

To prevent a reoccurrence of flood in the state this year, the Osun State Waste Management Agency said it has been sensitising members of the public on the need to desist from dumping refuse on floodwater channels.

T

he General Manager of the agency, Mr. Fatai Oyewole, told The Guardian in Osogbo that efforts were ongoing to rid major gutters of refuse.

“We have been mobilising people not to dump refuse on waterways and major gutters,” he said. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment has disclosed that it opened up some streams across the state during the dry season for easy flow of water. This, according to the coordinator of the ministry’s Department of Flood Control, Samorudeen Odesanmi, an engineer, was part of the state government’s efforts at preventing another incident of flooding in the state.

“This government is proactive. Before the advent of this rainy season, we optimised the opportunity of the dry season to open up series of streams across the state for easy flow of water. If at all we are going to do anything on flood control, it would be minimal.

“We have already marked off some areas we want to work on this year and they are waiting for governor’s approval. Much had been done before now and we are on top of the situation,” he said.

Imo Commences De-silting Of Drainages, Vows To Demolish Houses Built On Waterways

From Charles Ogugbuaja, Owerri

AS this year’s rainy season gradually sets in, residents in Imo State and the state government have commenced preparations to mitigate the likely effect of flooding.

x

The flood-prone local councils in the state are the riverine areas of Oguta, Ohaji/Egbema and Orsu, among others. The locals in these communities began to experience massive flooding since 2012, which has resulted in loss of lives and destruction of their property. The flood, which occurs at the peak of every rainy season, had forced many residents to abandon their homes and relocate to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), where both the state and national emergency management agencies lent them helping hands.

A resident in Oguta, Jude Igwe, who called for quick intervention by the government, told The Guardian that he would not want a repeat of his past experiences this year, likewise other members of his family. He said: “Since 2012, almost on a yearly basis, we living in riverine areas have been witnessing flooding. It is not something to behold. Now that the rains are setting in, we appeal to the state government to prepare and assist us in time. Some of us are poor. We shall be relocated to camps as usual. So, we are calling for early preparation in case such occurs.”

Also, an indigene of Orsu, who identified himself simply as Okechukwu, recounted how his family lost valuable property in previous years and called for help.

“I am not ready to allow flood engulf us again. We are preparing ahead of time. But government and good spirited individuals should please come to our assistance ahead of time. We also want government to build gutters that will channel water to the rivers,” he said.

A community leader in Ohaji, Saturday Ochia, however, urged residents to desist from blocking waterways with refuse. He said: “We want our people to adhere to the simple environment-friendly rule of clearing the waterways. We do not want to witness flooding this year in our community. We are educating our people.”

Speaking with The Guardian, the Commissioner for Environment, Dr. Ikechukwu Njoku, said the state government was not leaving anything to chances, adding that it has commenced public enlightenment on appropriate waste disposal and clearing of drainages by holding town hall meetings with the monarchs, local government officials, community leaders and residents. He also disclosed that the ministry has commenced de-silting of drainages in Owerri, the state capital.

According to Njoku, the government has marked structures built on waterways for demolition, stressing that they were constructed in contravention of the state’s master plan.

He also gave assurance that the government has put a robust plan in place to ensure flood-free environment in the state capital and other communities, stressing that the Governor, Hope Uzodimma, would ensure the construction of standard drainage systems in the state.

Delta Is Already Prepared To Tackle Flooding, Commissioner Says

From Monday Osayande, Asaba

DELTA State government has declared that it was fully prepared to mitigate the impact of flood in coastal areas of the state this year.

The Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Christ Onogba, made the declaration in an interview with The Guardian in Asaba. Onogba noted that the state did not have to wait for NIMET or other agencies’ prediction on the effect of flood before putting things right.

“Firstly, we keep on saying to everyone that we are in the era of climate change, so those communities living in the coastal line should find alternative homes before the rains set in,” he noted.

According to the commissioner, it was necessary for flood victims to have alternative abode because government was no longer ready to build camps for those that might be displaced by flood due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We cannot set up camps as it used to be, but that doesn’t mean we are sleeping. In fact, we have done a lot. We are resetting the drains, and very shortly, we will open one of the channels that is flowing into the River Niger, and good enough, the road side drain in Asaba is clean and working fine.

“The government is prepared and we will never be taken unaware in the issue of flood. And because we understand that because of climate change, flooding is something that must happen, we will not wait for any prediction before we start making our preparations,” he emphasised.

A resident in Ndokwa East council, Mr. Emma Agboma, lamented that several homes had collapsed in the area in the past as a result of flooding.

“I think now that we are approaching rainy season, government should exercise its power early so that we are not taken unaware. They should be alert so that they can relocate some of us to upland. Many are willing to leave their houses but it is not easy to relocate from where you are used to over the years.

“Government should do as much as possible to mitigate our suffering in riverine areas – Burutu, Bomadi and Patani. So, government should do the needful by building camps early enough for us to relocate,” he said.

For Dave Ogochukwu, while government should try to evacuate people in flood-prone areas to avoid loss of lives, residents should also not dispose refuse indiscriminately, thereby blocking waterways.

“The property that has been lost since 2012 till date is enormous and it is not good for the growth of the society. In recent times, several farmlands have been overrun by flood putting farmers in a difficult situation.

“Over the years, government has made efforts to relocate people from the flood-prone areas but some people have been adamant. However, government should continue to sensitise the people on the need to relocate before the flooding begins,” Ogochukwu added.

‘We Have Been Crying Out To Government For Help’

From Agosi Todo, Calabar

LAST year during the peak of the rainy season, many communities in Cross River State experienced heavy flooding that destroyed farms and homes. Over 300 residents in the state were left homeless and properties worth millions of naira destroyed due to heavy rainfalls.

The rains destroyed farmlands specifically in Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Biase and Boki local councils of the state.

Some of the residents at Ikot Eka Edem in Calabar Municipal local council identified building of houses on waterways as the cause of flooding in the area.

A resident, Mr. Gab Otei, said he was apprehensive ahead of this year’s rainy season, lamenting that he lost his valuables to flood last year.

Otei said: “Last year, the heavy rains wreaked havoc in the whole of this street. I lost my valuables because I was trying to save my little children from being taken away by the flooding.

“I cannot leave this place because this is my father’s house and I stay here with my family. For years now, we have been crying to government at all levels to come to our aid and open the canals for free flow of water, but no response.”

A resident in Kakwagom community in Boki local council, Mr. Augustine Ita, said: “Last year, most of the yam and cassava farms were basically destroyed. We lost everything and you know that hunger was the effect of it. What those of us who farm in the riverine areas are trying to do now is to either cultivate earlier or make your mounds to be bigger than what it used to be, because if the mounds are very big, and the crop are up there, if the flood comes, it starts from the bottom of the mound. If God is on our side, we will still have something to hold on to. It depends on the strength of your mounds and how heavy the flood will be.”

Speaking with The Guardian on measures the state government was taking to safeguard lives and properties against flood this year, the Director General of Cross River State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr. Princewill Ayim, disclosed that last year, over 510 persons were displaced by flood across the state.

Ayim stated that although the state had not received the yearly prediction from concerned government agencies on what to expect this year, the agency has started sensitisation campaign in communities in Calabar South, Calabar Municipality, Boki, Biase, Odukpani and Etung local councils that are prone to flood.

He lamented that people living in flood-prone areas refuse to relocate to safe areas because they insist on remaining in their ancestral homes.

Ayim explained: “The way we do it every year is that we get informed from the national bodies. They tell us when there will be heavy flood and what to expect. For now we have not gotten any prediction but we cannot keep on waiting. We need to be proactive by engaging ourselves in activities that can mitigate heavy flood.

“We have our local emergency committees spread across all the 18 local councils. They interface with the locals to inform them more about flooding and how to prepare for it. And at the same time, we are also collaborating with the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC). Luckily, we are among the states that installed emergency outfit; so if you are in distress and do not have airtime in your phone, you can dial the 122 free toll number through which help can come to you. That is in place already.

“Apart from that, we use the media houses to educate the public to clear their drainage channels and to cut the entire weeds on the waterways. If you go to Calabar South for example, you see some stagnant water that if you don’t look very well you won’t know there is an artificial pool there.”","Sat, 24 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rainy-season.jpg,"['rainy', 'residents', 'water', 'world', 'flooding', 'waterways', 'flood', 'impending', 'season', 'area', 'guardian', 'nigeria', 'land', 'state', 'areas', 'fears']", ,flood

Speaking at the public presentation of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency’s (NIHSA) 2021 annual flood outlook (AFO) in Abuja on Thursday, Adamu said the flood projection in different states are of varying severity.

He said states surrounding River Niger and Benue will experience “severe flooding”, adding that it will aggravate the problems created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This year, we will be grappling with the two threats of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the impending floods as predicted in the AFO,” NAN quoted him as saying.

“The flood projections show varying severity across parts of the country.

“In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 local government areas (LGAs) in 36 states including the FCT will fall within the moderate probable flood risk areas.

“It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the highly probable risk areas.

“The states surrounding Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience severe flooding.

“Floods come with attendant health risks through the contamination of potable water sources. The 2021 flooding will be exacerbated by the continuing ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The minister noted that the 2012 flood which brought massive destruction of lives and property across the country necessitated the creation of a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront a reoccurrence.

According to him, the NIHSA forecasts have increased citizens’ awareness and led them to take measures to prevent severe flood damage.

He urged stakeholders, including policy makers and tiers of government, to take appropriate measures such as clearing of waterways and flood paths to contain it.","Thu, 06 May 2021 17:12:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Flood-Gwagwalada.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'varying', 'states', 'minister', '28', '2021', 'covid19', 'afo', 'risk', 'severe']", ,none
6,6,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Flooding as a disaster waiting to happen - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/flooding-as-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen/,"The rains are here again. Rather than being a blessing, the rains have become a curse to many Nigerians, especially to coastal states and communities living along the bank of Rivers Niger and Benue. The federal government has issued a flood alert. Will the 2021 predictions go the way of others? TONY AKOWE reports

Since the devastating flood in Nigeria in 2012, it has become important for the government and its agency to make an annual forecast of possible flood and its impact in the country annually. Since the first forecast was made in 2013, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, working with other government agencies, has consistently warned the nation of impending flood across the country and in most cases, the intensity of such flood. Unfortunately, warnings by the agencies have often been ignored by both the people and state governments and their agencies. This year, the government has said not less than 121 local government areas across 28 states are at highly probable risk of heavy flooding, while another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will experience some level of flooding.

Flooding is categorised into river flooding, coastal flooding as well as flash and urban flooding occasioned by poor drainages, blocked drainages and poor adherence to town planning regulations.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) said flooding accounts for 15% of all natural disaster related deaths across the globe.

Floods have since become annual phenomena not only in flood plains, but also in urban and semi-urban areas. Experts link urban flooding to inadequacies of drainage channels that have become too small to contain excess runoff, the use of river channels as waste repositories thus clogging the channels, poor compliance with or non-existence of land use zoning/building codes, poor waste management practices, and removal of vegetation that create resistance and minimise flood impact. Coastal areas of Nigeria are not spared from flooding as they may be worst hit by flood this year. Interestingly, more states in Nigeria are increasingly suffering from annual flooding due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Unfortunately, Nigeria is located downstream of Rivers Niger and Benue, and therefore abounds with water resources that become a menace by causing flooding and flood disasters, the worst of which was experience in 2012 when hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property loss running into billions of naira including massive farm lands and crops when water was released from the a dam in Cameroon.

A close study of the predictions revealed that all the 20 local government areas in Lagos State (as against 18 in 2020) are likely to be affected with eight of them being at higher risk of heavy flooding. Apart from urban and river flooding, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Delta and Ondo states stand the risk of heavy coastal flooding. In 2020, similar predictions by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency and advice to states and local government areas to take precautionary measure to mitigate the flood fell on deaf ears in most parts of the country. The consequence was the displacement of over 2.3 million people and the death of 69 others. The outcome was also the washing away of farm lands in Kebbi and Jigawa as well as livestock and other valuables. The agency has continuously expressed concern over disregard for town planning regulations leading to people building on flood plains.

Minister for Water Resources Suleiman Adamu, who announced the 2021 prediction on behalf of the agency, said 121 local government areas in 28 states and the FCT as well as another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will likely experience high and moderate flooding in 2021. Acting on information from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, the minister also said there would be heavy coastal flooding in Rivers, Cross Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states. He stressed the need for concerted efforts to mitigate the impact of the expected flood.

He said: “So far, the flood levels will be higher than in previous years, but will not attain the levels of the 2012 devastating floods. In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 LGAs in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will fall within the moderate probable Flood Risk Areas. It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the Highly Probable Risk Areas. The states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience river flooding. These states and the number of local government likely to be affected include Abia (9), Akwa Ibom (2), Anambra (5), Bauchi (2), Bayelsa (5), Benue (3), Cross River (2), Delta (8), Ebonyi (4), Edo (1), FCT (2), Gombe (7), Imo (3), Jigawa (9), Kaduna (2), Kano (2), Kebbi (4), Kogi (9), Kwara (2), Lagos (8), Nasarawa (2), Niger (5), Ogun (3), Oyo (7), Rivers (12), Sokoto (7), Taraba (7) and Zamfara (1).”

The list of states to be affected by one form of flood or the other in 2021 show that northern and coastal states are at a greater risk of flooding this year, with some states along the River Niger and Benue are also likely to be affected. Adamu said flash and urban floods from heavy inundation were predicted to occur in some major cities, the severity of which would depend on the availability and adequacy of the drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.

He said: “The information contained in the AFO 2021 is a Clarion call to all stakeholders, policy makers, Federal, States and Local Governments, Departments and Agencies to rise and set up appropriate mechanism such as clearing the waterways and flood paths as well as maintaining proper water disposal management practices to curtail the ravages of the impending flood and threats of COVID-19. The year 2012 is a landmark in the annals of flood occurrence in Nigeria. It brought with it massive destruction of lives, property and critical national infrastructure. The need arose therefore, to put in place a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront the menace of this disaster of flooding, hence the coming into being of APO in the year 2013. The 2021 Annual Flood Outlook built on the successes of the previous eight (8) years forecasts by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency. The outcomes of these forecasts have been the increased awareness by the citizenry with respect to measures that need to be taken before, during and after floods. This has culminated in the progressive reduction in the severity of flood and its harmful effects on lives and property. The timeliness in the release of these forecasts is quite commendable and deserving of every possible support by all of us.”

He believed that man’s interaction with natural process has been both helpful and harmful to some degree, adding that the negative impact of man’s activities can be observed in the heightened climate change being experienced globally by way of rising temperatures, intensified rainfall, more destructive storms and floods. He maintained that the annual prediction by the agency is designed to create awareness of the inherent dangers of flooding and to inform people about locations that are prone to Flood risk at a particular time and encourage them to take appropriate actions.

Drawing attention to the 2020 experience, the minister said: “The year 2020 saw the devastating impact of extreme flood across the country with practically every state of the federation affected in one way or the other. The flood affected 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 349 Local Government Areas (LGAs) within the 36 States were affected and over 2,353,647 people were displaced with a record of 69 deaths. Kebbi and Jigawa States were worst hit with regards to agricultural lands and houses destroyed. Apart from the physical damages, other indirect losses are often overlooked. These indirect and intangible impacts are generally associated with disruption to normal life as well as long term health issues and stress-related illnesses. We must recognise that extreme weather and flooding extents do happen and that we need to be well equipped to respond to them. I am confident that our communities, infrastructure and businesses will be better protected if due attention is given to the information contained in this 9th edition of the Annual Flood Outlook.”

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs. Didi Walson-Jack, said: “The overall objective of this event is to sensitise the nation (i.e planners, decision and policy makers, farmers, stakeholders) and the general public towards embarking on preventive measures to improve on safety and reduce potential damages to lives and property from predicted flood events.”

She said the event was expected to provide ample opportunity for enlightenment campaigns in the media for better Preparedness on flood mitigation, control and management in flood risks locations across the country. She maintained that the accuracy of the predictions over the years have been fairly high and reliable, stressing however that “the focus is rather on prevention and mitigation of possible flood disasters by increasing the awareness of the populace and prompting them to take appropriate preventive, adaptive and mitigative measures”.

The Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd), stressed the need to strengthen multi-agency approach to disaster risk reduction in the country.

Mohammed said: “To enhance flood forecasting and management in Nigeria, NEMA is currently supporting NIHSA in establishing three Automatic Weather Observation Stations which are at various stages of installation located in Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti and Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. These stations will be used not only for hydrological predictions but also to train students in the field of Geography, Engineering, Agriculture, meteorology, climate change and other sciences”. He said further that “one of the lessons learnt during the 2020 flood after action review meeting is the need for proper utilization of our dams in the country. When dams meant for irrigation purpose are used for dry season agriculture, they acquire more capacities to hold more water in the rainy season. In addition, a timely controlled release of water from dams will reduce panic release of water during rainy season that can lead to further flooding.”

The Director-General of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze said government at all levels in the country must take necessary steps to avert a possible disastrous effect of flood in 2021. Nze said as the rains begin to set in, the country was gradually inching towards the peak of rainy season with its attendant flood incidents. He said Nigeria’s geographical location downstream of all the countries in the Niger Basin places it at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollution from all countries upstream, adding that this explain why persistent flooding has become an annual event since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster.

He argued that the annual flood forecast was to enable states and local government as well as individuals take concrete steps now to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past few years including clearing of blocked drainages and canals, removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinth and floats on water channels. People living along water ways as well as those having socio-economic activities in such areas should be encouraged to relocate o safer areas before the peak of rains, while there should also be an improved system for flood monitoring, flood forecasting and early warnings. He stressed that states must intensify soil conservation measuring techniques on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and encourage ecosystem protection, while also enhancing the enforcement of town planning code to allow for the construction of houses and drainage structures.

He said further that while it was not possible to eradicate flooding, efforts should be made to either reduce or minimise it, adding that state governments must educate their people, insisting that states must make efforts to avoid a repeat of the incidences of 2020 which saw over 450,000 hectare of rice plantation being washed away in Kebbi state alone as a result of flooding. Nzeh lamented that while the agency has continued to give early warning signs, many states in the country have failed to listen to the recommendations of the agency, adding that at the moment, Jigawa state has set up a committee that is working to reduce incidences of flooding in the state in line with recommendations from the agency.

The NIHSA’s Director of Hydrogeophysics, Stephen Margima Jabo, said flooding has become a global phenomenon that has increased in frequency over the years. According to him, the effective management of flood risk should be a collective responsibility of all stakeholders from the federal, state, and local to individual levels, adding that the existing synergy between Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, stakeholders and other collaborative agencies involved in flood management and disaster issues should be further strengthened. He said government at all level should also put in place measures for better town planning and effective land use zoning, effective flood disaster management in the changing environment, improved biodiversity and ecosystem management for the enhancement of rapid and sustainable development in the country. States, he said should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers particularly, where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood waters will not be lost to the sea.

The agency said among others that “stakeholders in the water sector should carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas by the removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers to improve their conveyance capacities and from dams, lakes and reservoirs to increase their storage capacities for the containment of the incoming floodwaters; there is need for construction of weirs, small reservoirs on tributary, streams and rivers for conservation of flood water to be used during the dry season thereby preventing desert encroachment, increasing irrigation food crop production, improvement of grassland areas, nomadic settlement, peace and sustainable development by relevant government agencies; intensification of soil conservation measuring technics on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and increase ecosystem protection among others; enforcement of Town Planning Codes in the country to allow for the appropriate construction of houses, and drainage structures and constantly freeing the waterways from obstructions and provision of adequate refuse dumping facilities by relevant authorities.”","Tue, 11 May 2021 00:15:10 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Flood-1.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'happen', 'local', 'flood', 'waiting', 'states', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'country', 'state', 'areas']", ,flood

September 12, 2020, around 8:00pm, residents of Alapere area of Lagos State, raised alarm as another flooding tragedy struck. Two yet-to-be-identified children were swept away as people battled flood after a heavy rainfall that lasted for hours and led to destruction of properties.

This is just one of the horrific, heart-wrenching experiences Nigerians go through, following havoc wreaked by floods every year. Yet nothing is done by stakeholders to ameliorate the disaster.

Nigeria with a population of over 200 million people, faces numerous natural disasters, with flooding being the most common. Most states in the country are increasingly suffering from annual flooding during the rainy seasons. However unlike some natural disasters, rainfall flooding can be controlled with proper planning and the provision of necessary infrastructure.

Flooding in Nigeria is usually caused by climate change, river overflowing, dam opening, current poor urban planning practices, poor drainage systems that can’t cope and so on. In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the neighboring states.

Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals. The immediate impact of it include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases. These were seen recurring this year, in various states of the federation.

Havoc in Some States

In a report on October last year, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods since September have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across 22 states in Nigeria. Furthermore, around 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people were reported to be displaced.

According to the Red Cross, the overflowing Benue and Niger rivers caused severe floods in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara States from October 6, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. At least 57 people died, 473 were injured and 22,357 displaced. Flooding was also reported in southern parts of the country, Bayelsa, Anambra, Rivers and Delta States, were affected and fatalities reported.

One of the most devastating impact of floods was seen in Kebbi State. The flood swept away villages and peoples, displacing families and destroyed about 90 per cent of crops, putting the country’s food security at risk. Over 30 lives were lost, hundreds of houses destroyed and thousands of residents displaced by the devastating flood that sacked communities in the state.

The losses incurred by the farmers, particularly rice farmers in Kebbi State were colossal and immeasurable , they run into billions of naira . Thousands of hectares of fadama rice farms in the state were affected by the flood. Rice farms , other agricultural crops, livestock and even communities were not spared by the raging floods.

Chairman of the State Emergency Management Authority (KSEMA), Alhaji Sani Dododo, revealed that five different bridges had been washed away across the state.

The Birnin-Kebbi-Makera-Kangiwa road, an international highway, which runs from the state capital to Niger Republic, is at the risk of caving in at Duku. Some of the minor bridges and culverts along the highway are already caving in, following erosion caused by rising water overflowing the nearby River Rima.

Also, the Bagudo-Tuga-Kaoje route, which leads to Benin Republic border, including the Tuga Bridge, is also submerged, cutting border communities. Dododo, who confirmed the number of deaths recorded so far, said 10 people died in a boat that capsized at Ihiru in Jega Local Government.

“Only eight bodies have so far been recovered; a family of six – father, mother and children were wiped away in Arewa council area. We recorded one death in Yauri, among others. The numbers may increase, since we are experiencing rainfall daily. In Bagudo council area is the worst hit by the flooding, as it was learnt that 98 per cent of the villages were affected.

In Iwaro Oka community of Akoko South West Local Government area, Ondo State

a middle-aged man was swept away by flood. Sources said the motorcycle of the farmer, identified as Akede, was seen inside the river very close to a popular filling station, which made people aware that the farmer was missing. Family members were thrown into mourning when all efforts to find him proved abortive. His body was later recovered in a river very close to St Patrick’s College, Iwaro Oka.

In Lokoja, Kogi State, the road linking Kogi East and Eastern Nigeria to the state capital was flooded for days as canoe and boats were employed to navigate the roads which is meant for cars and other road users.

In Niger State, officials of the state government visited communities submerged by flood to ascertain the extent of damage and to enable government render assistance to victims.

In Kano State, the Kano Emergency Management Agency confirmed four persons killed and over 5,200 houses destroyed due to flooding in Rogo and Danbatta Local Government Areas of the state. He disclosed that two persons lost their lives and 200 houses destroyed in Rogo, while two other persons and over 5,000 houses were destroyed by flood in Danbatta.

Also the South-south and South-east were wreaked by flood havoc. South-south states like Delta had over 150 houses submerged by flood. In South-east, Anambra for instance, over 5,000 persons have been displaced by flood that submerged houses, schools and churches in the Ogbaru Local Government Area. The Chairman of the council, Arinze Awaogu, said about 1,000 of the displaced persons were being catered for at Internally Displaced Persons’ camps in the area, while many others trapped in their communities needed evacuation.

He said, ”Over 5,000 families have been displaced, while churches, schools and many residential houses have been submerged by flood, with farm crops destroyed and displaced persons seeking refuge in Onitsha and surrounding communities. At the moment, we are housing over 1,000 IDPs; we have over 5,000 persons who have been displaced; some are taking refuge in the residences of their relatives, who live upland, including Onitsha. We need the Federal Government’s assistance in the areas of donation of food items, non-food items, medical supplies, establishment of sick bays and sending enough medical personnel to help in handling the situation; our fear now is that of a possible outbreak of epidemic.”

Earlier in the year, heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

In Abuja, four Area Councils, Bwari, Gwagwalada, Abaji and Kwali which are prone to flood were affected by the disaster with Gwagwala being the worst hit in July as eight lives were lost, over 100 houses submerged and properties destroyed. On July 25, after a heavy downpour which lasted for hours, five residents were swept away and several houses and cars destroyed in Gwagwalada, Dawaki, Giri and Zuba where the flood cut the bridge linking Ikwa, Yimi and other villages.

The incidence was confirmed by the Director General of FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Idris Abbas who had said there was a building collapse in Dawaki as a result of the flood. Gwagwalada is flooded from Giri. A family of five were flooded at Giri.

“We got one body and still searching for four. We rescued six people and are in the hospital. The flood has damaged a lot of houses and property, especially at Gwagwalada. The residents are still saying some are missing but they cannot give us the identities of such persons who they claim to be missing. People should be careful when it is raining. They should not drive on water. They should not build on flood plain. They must respect the master plan of FCT and ensure that all drainages are clean. What happened in Giri-Gota was because people built on flood plain”, he said

Federal Lawmakers Laments

Back in September, the Kebbi State Caucus in the House of Representatives while commiserating with the government and people of the state on the recent flood disaster that ravaged the entire state, said the disaster is a major setback to the federal government effort to boost local rice production as part of measures to end rice importation.

The Chairman, Hon. Muhammad Jega, representing Gwandu/Aliero/Jega federal constituency, lamented that the disaster could not have come at a worse time for the farmers who were looking forward to a bumper harvest this year to reduce the rising cost of food items.

The lawmaker, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari and the state Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, for the prompt response to reduce the hardship caused by the flood, also urged them to as a matter of urgency send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state.

Jega further urged the federal government to commission a study with the aim of providing a lasting solution to the perennial flood disaster in the state.

According to him, “The flood is a serious setback towards addressing food security in the country; the government, therefore, needs to address the shortfall of the food supply chain to reduce the hardship and cost of food items in the market, and also address the severe environmental degradation caused by the flood. This may include adequate and early preparation for dry-season farming and reconstruction of major infrastructures affected in the state.

‘’The estimated cost of the disaster is over N10 billion across the state. We call on the federal government as a matter of urgency to send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state, as early preparation for dry season farming should commence in earnest with provision of seedlings, fertilizer and other inputs to be made available to the farmers in good time.’’

Also, a member of the House of Representatives, representing Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency of Delta State, Hon. Ossai Nicholas Ossai, decried the submerging of over 150 houses in Delta State, by devastating floods.

He said that since past two weeks, the Ndokwa East Communities of Delta State have been bedeviled by constant and frightening heavy downpour, being accompanied by excessive flooding and erosion, that is seriously and presently wreaking havoc in the Communities.

According to him, the affected communities are; Ossissa, Onyah, Ase, Ushie, Ibedeni; Asagba, Aballa-Uno, Agballa-Obodo, AgballaOshimili, Uchi, Okpai, Onuaboh, Inyi, Benekuku, Aboh, Onyah, Asaba-Ase, Ibrede, Ashaka, Afor, Abalagáda, Umuolu, Igbuku, Obettim, Obodo-Okolafa, Iyadama,0nuogboko, UtagbaOgbe, Utagba-Uno, Ogume, Onitsha-Ukwuani, Akarri, Umuolu, just to mention a few”.

He said he was disturbed that “schools, farmlands, health centres, places of worship have seriously been affected and over 150 households has been rendered homeless particularly children and women and more is still being affected daily. About 90per cent of the ommunities in the entire Ndokwa East Local Government Area has been submerged,and worse still is the deplorable economic conditions of the peasant farmers in these agrarian communities”.

He observed that these communities are often prone to serious environmental disaster as a result of vulnerability of constant coastal flooding and erosion from the River Niger”.

The legislator, pleaded with the Federal Governnment, to Direct the Ecological Fund office to conduct an environmental survey with a view to addressing the excessive flooding in these Ndokwa Communities and urge the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to urgently provide relief materials for the Hood victims in accordance with section 6 of NEMA Act.

NIHSA Flood Alerts

In February, the Director General of Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze, alerted the government, stakeholders and all citizens to use this period of dry season to prepare ahead for 2021 flooding.

Nze lamented that Nigeria currently doesn’t have enough dams, saying more dams would help to mitigate floods.

He explained that with the increasing global population and the expanding activities of man, flooding would continue to persist, hence the need to control human activities, environmental adjustment and purposefully adopting actions in certain areas that would make adjustment possible.

According to him, “Flooding problem is a global environmental issue which is faced by many countries worldwide, particularly in areas close to low lying terrains and river valleys. Over the past years, there have been increasing concerns that human actions and natural catastrophes have been adversely impacting the environment, posing serious ecological and environmental hazards.

“Though flood is a natural environmental phenomenon, it can be greatly accelerated by human-induced activities as it is the case worldwide. Some floods may result in major disasters involving structural and erosion damages, disruption of socio-economic activities, loss of lives and properties, displacement of people, destruction of agricultural land and contamination of water and environment in general.”

The director general said this is the appropriate time to construct drainages where they are necessary (but not provided), dredge river channels, clear blocked gutters and drainages, and pull down structures that are within the floodplains and flood paths.

“There is a reasonable time to do that before the rains set in. According to the 2020 Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public recently by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), February 24 and June 22 are the predicted onset of rainfall in the South-south and Northern states respectively, while the respective predicted cessation dates are December 28th and September 26th. This implies that Nigeria is likely to experience longer period of rainy season in 2020 compared to year 2019,” he added.

Again, in September, the agency warned members of the public to expect more floods in the months of September and October.

Nze, gave the warning at a press briefing in Abuja, saying that the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country.

Nze explained that any release of excess water from the dams in countries upstream Rivers Niger and Benue this year would have more negative impacts on Nigeria, which is located downstream of countries in the Niger Basin.

He identified the highly vulnerable states as Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa.

He said that the flood that ravaged Kebbi State just about a week ago left so many damages and noted that the current flooding situation called for vigilance on the part of all the stakeholders.

The director general called the states and local governments as well as multi-national companies and public-spirited individuals to join hands to save the country from the consequences of “twin pandemic” (COVID-19 and flood) in the year 2020.

Nze warned: ‘’The rains are finally here. The volume of river flows on our river is surging and river channels could no longer accommodate significant runoff as floodplains, which traditionally serve the alluvial plains and are rich in agricultural productivity, lost its retention capacity to give way to flooding of adjacent lands.

“Farmlands and crop yields are being lost to furry of floodwaters, livestock and ecosystem species are diminishing while hope for livelihood hang in the balance due to monumental economic losses.

‘’As a matter of fact, all the states of the federation have suffered several degrees of flooding since June 2020. The danger is not yet over. Information received from the regional Niger Basin Authority (NBA) by NIHSA, has it that as at 7.30am today September 10, 2020, the River Niger flood level in Niamey, Niger Republic, attained an unprecedented level of 7.02m (702cm). This is a far cry from the value of 6.60m which I reported in my last press briefing of August 25, 2020.

“Noting that the Red Alert Warning Zone in Niamey is 6.20m and above, the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country, Nigeria, which is at the Lower portion of Niger Basin within this month of September and October.’

‘’Based on the report of the expected flood coming down from Niamey and the projected contributions by the inland rivers, both Kainji and Jebbo Dams built on River Niger have continued to spill water downstream. The Shiroro Dam on River Koduno, with reservoir level at 381.48m as at 9.00am today, has been maintaining a regulated spilling into the River Niger. The effect of all these is that the communities in the states adjoining River Niger will continue to be highly inundated by River Flooding as is being witnessed in the recent time.”

Recently, The DG of NIHSA, briefing the press on March 24, 2021, again advised the three tiers of government and citizens across the country to prepare against impending devastating floods in 2021.

Nze, who gave the advice at a press conference in Abuja, said this was because Nigeria was at the receiving end of disastrous floods among the nine countries of the River Niger Basin.

He said, “There is still time for states/LGAs (Local Government Areas) and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

“As the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin which covers nine countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season with its attendant flood incidents.

He also advised Nigerians residing at waterways to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains, just as warned that Nigerians have about three months to prepare against the disastrous effects of flood.

He explained that the country’s geographical location is downstream of all the countries in the Basin, making it to be at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollutions from all the countries upstream.

The DG lamented that relevant authorities are frustrating the effort of the Federal Government by neglecting the predictions, as could be seen in the results of last year’s damages.

Nze while urging the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past years, noted that there is still time for stakeholders to take steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

Expectations from Stakeholders

In the last few months, President Muhammadu Buhari has been sending solidarity messages to some states affected by flood disasters with promises of federal aid. The president authorised needed assistance to 12 states worst affected by the seasonal rains. The states are: Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Edo, Anambra, Delta, Kano, Jigawa, Rivers, Bayelsa and Adamawa.

However, flooding in various state has become a recurring decimal for decades, all tiers of government are expected to put all hands on deck and come up with a permanent solution. Flood is a natural disaster, but lack of preparedness is a man-made disaster.

As Nigeria is months away till the next rainy season, stakeholders have ample time to do the needful and heed to flood warnings by various monitoring agencies in order to avert another impending tragedy.

One of the main strategies as stated by NIHSA is that, the 36 States and the FCT authority should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using the flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood water will not be lost to the sea to become saline water.

The agency is also urging state governments to pull down structures built on flood plains and expand the drainages for easy flow of water as one of the strategies mapped out.

According to them, the foodstuff, meant for distribution to the vulnerable, is to cushion the ravaging hardship in the region. Flagging off the exercise in Yola, Adamawa State, one of the associates, Dahiru Hammadikko, said the gesture was courtesy of Tinubu’s associates in the 19 northern states.

He said over 10,000 households in the 21 local councils of Adamawa were targeted to benefit. He lamented that Nigerians were facing hardship, which informed the group’s move to ameliorate the suffering of Nigerians, irrespective of religious and political affiliations.

The national coordinator of the Tinubu support group said: “The gesture is to honour the national leader of APC, due to his philanthropic disposition, which is why the rice was branded with his image.”

He described Tinubu as “a detribalised Nigerian, in whom the Northern region relies” as the unifying factor.

“Today, we are flagging off the distribution of 5kg of rice to Nigerians from the northern region. We are targeting one million beneficiaries in the 19 northern states and the FCT.

“But here in Adamawa we are giving over 10,000 people,” he said.

10,10,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Many states not taking precautions against floods –NIHSA boss - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/many-states-not-taking-precautions-against-floods-nihsa-boss/,"The Director-General, Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, Mr Clement Nze, tells OKECHUKWU NNODIM that the devastation caused by floods in many states is as a result of the failure of the governments to adhere to warnings

What are the types of flooding being experienced in Nigeria?

There are three major types of flooding that we experience in Nigeria. The first one is river flooding, which is not just from rivers that are within Nigeria but from River Niger and River Benue, and these are trans-boundary waters. There is also urban/flash flooding, and these are caused by poor drainage systems or even non-existing drainage systems in many major cities in Nigeria. Lastly is coastal or tidal flooding for states that are within coastal areas such as Ondo, Lagos, Bayelsa and Rivers.

Now, it is important to state that our Annual Flood Outlook is a scientific prediction done using historical data physically collected in the field, some of them over 40 to 50 years ago. So, we use it to project and see what is going to happen tomorrow. And from what we have seen using international standards to predict, we have said that not less than 121 Local Government Areas in Nigeria, in 27 states actually, will be affected by flooding in the course of the year. Also, about 302 LGAs will experience different magnitudes of flooding. And about 351 LGAs may have a lesser severity of flooding. But like I said, it is a prediction, which we monitor closely by weekly publications. We are talking about the issue of climate change and so what you see today may not be what will happen tomorrow. So, as a result of that, we will be updating the media, states and others on what they are likely to observe in the course of the year.

How are you interfacing with the states with respect to predictions in the AFOs?

We will be doing sensitisation programmes and will downscale it to the states. We will tell the governors that these are the locations in your state that are likely to be affected in the course of the year 2021. We informed the public through the press some months ago, as preparatory to the unveiling of the 2021 AFO. And by protocol, it is the Minister of Water Resources who interfaces with the governors on behalf of the agency. Last year, for instance, the minister sent letters to each of the state governors in Nigeria and detailed the states that would be affected by flooding in that year. But what they did with it is another cup of tea.

Also, we go through other systems in the states such as their emergency management agencies, water resources and environment ministries. We interface with them directly, but what they do with our information is another issue.

Are you satisfied with what states are doing about the recommendations in the AFOs?

Frankly speaking, they are not doing as much as we expect from them, otherwise, the level of devastation that happens year in year out could have been avoided or eliminated. We’ve been telling the state governors that the tempo of political activities they embark upon during election periods should be deployed against activities that encourage flooding. Go to the grassroots, you have councillors in LGAs. They should be able to cascade this information and domesticate it in their own locations. But often time, it doesn’t happen. However, when a disaster occurs, they are quick to complain and cry out to high heavens and maybe get some support from the humanitarian ministry. But in terms of ameliorating the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.

I recall in 2016/2017, I engaged some state emergency management agencies one-on-one and we were told not to come to tell them what will happen in the course of the year except we are coming with relief materials. But we told them that that was not our jurisdiction. Ours is to inform you about what is likely to happen in your own state. If it happens, you have the National Emergency Management Agency that can support you, not NIHSA.

What are states likely going to face by failing to abide by the recommendations in the AFO?

Going by the law establishing the agency, the agency’s powers begin and stop at predicting and releasing the message. We don’t enforce anything. Each state has its own regulatory body, such as the urban planning department and emergency management agencies. They also have environmental laws and ministries that are supposed to be the regulators to ensure that the dictates of our prediction are followed. I may then say that NEMA could now insist by saying, ‘Since you failed to do the needful, don’t run to us for relief materials.’ This is because, if you recall, when the flood was very severe in 2012, the Federal Government gave out a lot of money. Some states got about N4bn to N5bn, depending on the degree of devastation.

Maybe such decisions could be taken by NEMA so as to encourage states that are doing well in terms of adhering to the predictions to ensure that lives and property are not lost. We, as an agency, can’t enforce anything; we can’t force any governor to do the needful. But the governors on their own should in the spirit of humanity protect and help those who voted them into power.

Are you collaborating with sister agencies on climate issues?

In fact, our relationship with one of them, NiMet (Nigeria Meteorological Services Agency) is very superb and cordial. First of all, at the international level, the meteorological agency is Nigeria’s permanent representative with the World Meteorological Organisation, and that falls on whoever is the Director-General. Also, whosoever heads the hydrological agency in any nation is an adviser to that permanent representative. So, in that wise, there is a very good collaboration between NIHSA and NiMet; for instance, we requested rainfall data from NiMet. And this was one of the major inputs in the model to use for predictions. They provide us those data at no cost. And once they are releasing their own predictions, such as the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction, which is now called Seasonal Climate Prediction, they inform NIHSA.

So, we collaborate a lot; they provide us with data that help us to do our prediction alongside other river measurements that we do by ourselves. We use so much data – about 12 of them, but the rainfall data are among the major data.

What are some of the recommendations in the 2021 AFO, and what advice do you have for farmers?

Farmers should heed our predictions. They should also abide by our warnings. Those who farm within the river banks should ensure that their crops have early maturity. This is to ensure that before the onset of the rainy season or flooding, the crops would have matured and be harvested. Flooding doesn’t come with the rains immediately, rather it is when the soil is saturated and its moisture content becomes high that flooding will begin to take place. So, if there is a way they can be helped to plant crops that can mature easily, it should be done, so that before the flooding starts they can harvest. And after the flooding, heavy nutrients are now brought within the flood plain, which can lead to enhanced yields when the farming starts again.

The Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, for instance, once mentioned that because of the heavy nutrients that the floods brought, they were able to regain what they lost in one of the farming seasons. That governor is very active, he works with us and comes from time to time to ask what could be done to improve farming activities in his state.

What are some of the things states should be doing now, considering the looming flood?

Like I said in our press briefing in March, there is still time for states, LGAs and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021. We made it clear at the briefing that as the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin, which covers nine countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season, with its attendant flood incidents. Nigeria’s geographical location, downstream of all the countries in this basin, places it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollution from all the countries upstream.

We know that the persistent flooding and flood disasters have become an annual event in Nigeria since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster in recent history. In 2012, hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property losses running into trillions of naira.

It is in the light of the above that NIHSA wishes to urge the states and the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly menace of flooding in the past years. We recommend that the three tiers of government should consider clearing drainage systems and canals and also embark on projects for improving hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows. They should carry out the removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinths and floats on water channels and on all avenues for river runoffs. We also encourage people living along the waterways and those having socio-economic activities on flood plains to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains.

Description of the disaster

On 6 October 2020, flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of the torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto, and Zamfara state (amongst other states) affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin, which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas. Table 1 illustrates the flood impacts of the worst flood affected states.

The situation in Kebbi – the country's biggest rice-producing state – is especially dire, as vast farmlands are completely submerged due to the most recent rains. Meanwhile in Jigawa state, a total of 18 out of 27 Local Government Areas (LGA)s have been affected, with Gwaram, Birnin Kudu, Kirikasamma, and Gumel as the worst hit. Wide swaths of farmlands have been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of Naira. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), with the support from the Federal Government, is scaling efforts to assist flood victims by providing emergency needs. So far, the agency has distributed 30 canoes to inundated communities, as well as materials to build embankments to control the floods.

Kwara State is also concerning as more than 5,000 households have been affected. The government estimates damage worth N10bn have been incurred. At least three lives in Ilorin are believed to have been lost. Scores of houses also had their roofs blown off by the raging storm that accompanied the heavy rains in the Ilorin metropolis while electricity poles were destroyed in Taiwo and Odota areas of the state capital. Telecommunication masts and building walls were also damaged in Olonkonla, Bobonkiri, Egba-Akota, Aberi, Akuji and Idiope, all in Ita-Ogunbo area, Alanamu Ward in Ilorin West Local Government Area, the worst hit.

Since September to date, torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across Nigeria. Some 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people are reported to be displaced. Most of the those affected are children. Wide swaths of farmlands have also been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of naira. These floods have so far impacted 22 states in the country’s six geo-political zones: North West (4 state), North Central (4 states), North East (4 state), South East (4 states), South-South (3 states) and South West (3 state). This earlier flooding had weakened Nigeria’s water supply and road infrastructure, killing dozens and leading to disease outbreaks.

A government team began the delivery of food palliatives to the Kwara North Senatorial District, beginning with Jebba town in Moro Local Government Area and Lafiagi in Edu Local Government Area. Over 15,000 households across 357 communities of the state are estimated to have been affected by the ugly incidents that also destroyed farmlands and human dwellings worth billions of naira. In the wake of the floods, over 100,000 hectares of rice, maize and millet farms in Kpata-Gbaradogi, fishing and agrarian settlement in Pategi LGA were destroyed. About 100 residential buildings were also submerged while 1,500 people were rendered homeless.

The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, warned flood-prone states to prepare for flood emergency, rescue and rehabilitation. According to the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rainy season is expected to continue until December 28th in the southern parts of the country. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), predicted that at least 102 LGAs in 28 states fall within the highly probable flood risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 states of the Federation, including FCT, fall within the moderately probable flood risks areas.","Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540152-Nigeria%20Floods%20-%20Emergency%20Plan%20of%20Action%20%28EPoA%29%20DREF%20n%C2%B0%20MDRNG030.png?itok=T4e01g_v,"['n', 'dref', 'affected', 'north', 'epoa', 'flood', 'local', 'floods', 'states', 'action', 'area', 'farmlands', 'plan', 'nigeria', 'state', 'mdrng030', 'areas', 'emergency']", ,none
14,14,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Nigeria Loses a Quarter of Rice Production to Floods - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/nigeria-loses-quarter-rice-production-floods,"ARGUNGU - Farmers in northern Nigeria have lost more than two million tons of rice, a quarter of the country's projected harvest, due to flooding. Despite the loss, Nigeria is so far upholding a year-long ban on land-based imports of rice to crack down on smuggling and boost local production.

Ibrahim Adullahi is looking at what remains of his 350-hectare rice farm in Nigeria’s Kebbi state.

Abdullahi was expecting a harvest of 600 tons of rice, but weeks of severe flooding means he will be lucky to get 100.

“Since when I started farming, I have never experienced intensive cultivation of rice like now, because a lot of people are into the rice farming. But unfortunately, we experienced this intensive flooding that we are still experiencing now, and farmers are now counting losses because 90 percent of our farmers have lost what they have cultivated,” he said.

Nigeria’s biggest rice producing state, Kebbi, had projected 2.5 million tons this year.

But heavy September rains washed away two million tons. Local rice miller Mohammad Anuana said this could cause a further jump in the price of the grain.

“If rain has already washed away all the farm product, you know the goods will be rising up (in price) because the little one they have on ground - they will make sure they recover (the value of) the one that the water moves away. And, so they’ll double the price,” he said.

With Africa’s largest population, Nigeria annually imports billions of dollars of rice and wheat. But the country hopes to become self-sufficient.

Last year, the government banned land-based rice imports to crack down on smuggling and boost local rice production.

Despite the lost rice, the Nigerian officials say the ban will remain in place.

Chairman of the All Farmers Association in Nigeria John Wuyep said affected farmers will be compensated.

""The government and even the financial institutions have a machinery in force. So many who have lost now are already preparing for the dry season farming,” he said.

Nigeria’s farmers association says better groundwork is needed to prevent flooding and have a steady water supply during the dry season.

Flood reduction would also help save homes and the displacement of thousands of Nigerians from overflowing rivers.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2020-09/vlcsnap-2020-09-30-12h41m36s655.png,"['farmers', 'production', 'lost', 'flooding', 'local', 'quarter', 'price', 'tons', 'floods', 'million', 'nigeria', 'imports', 'loses', 'rice']", ,flood

Heavy rains have caused extensive flooding in Chad, Niger and Nigeria since the onset of rainy seasons in June. Chad’s rainy season, expected to last until October, is the heaviest in the past 30 years (OCHA 25/08/2020). Flooding in Niger has affected almost twice the estimated population. Flooding in Nigeria is less widespread than in 2019, but is still significant (NIHSA 06/2020; OCHA 21/07/2020).

Almost 60% of all affected people and over half of reported deaths from the three countries are in Niger, the country most affected by floods (UNHCR 15/09/2020). Flooding has affected more than 516,000 people across all eight regions, and resulted in at least 71 deaths (UNHCR 17/09/2020; OCHA 24/09/2020). Nigeria is at risk of crossborder flooding, given it is downstream from other flood-affected countries along the Niger River basin, including Niger (HNO 12/2019).

In all three countries, heavy rainfall and flash floods have resulted in the widespread destruction of shelters, driving displacement. Emergency shelters are overcrowded and unsanitary, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection and the spread of water-borne diseases (IOM 1/09/2020; OCHA 07/09/2020).

The Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region complicates flood relief efforts and increases protection concerns for highly vulnerable displaced populations in all three countries. The situation is most severe in northeast Nigeria, where over 2.7 million people are displaced and 10.6 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, especially food, shelter and WASH (OCHA 14/09/2020; UNHCR 31/07/2020). Additionally, cross-border violence from Mali affects northwest Niger and insecurity caused by banditry poses further risks to flood-affected populations in northwest Nigeria.","Wed, 07 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1538484-20201006_acaps_briefing_note_flooding_in_chad_niger_nigeria_.png?itok=WwqCv9xM,"['ocha', 'affected', 'chad', 'flooding', 'briefing', 'unhcr', 'shelters', '2020', 'countries', 'note', 'nigeria', 'widespread', 'risk', 'niger', '30', 'acaps']", ,flood

But during the rainy seasons, the city's streets can become almost impassable. Home to more than 24 million, Lagos is Nigeria's economic powerhouse, making it a destination for people seeking new opportunities. But that rapid growth creates pressure on the streets, and the environment.

The streets are often flooded, in part due to the dysfunctional disposal of the 6,000-10,000 tonnes of rubbish generated daily in the city. After a downpour, rubbish piles up in open gutters and makes moving around the streets difficult. “I worry when it rains, especially when it is heavy,” says Lagos resident Stephanie Erigha. ""It makes me anxious."" On one occasion when taking a taxi through a waterlogging-prone part of the city, she recalls the water gushing right into the back seat next to her.

While the overall climate in Lagos is expected to see less rainfall overall with climate change, the intensity of rain is expected to increase, bringing with it greater risk of flooding. Meanwhile, the low-lying city is also particularly vulnerable to water from another source: rising seas. If global warming exceeds 2C, the city is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100, according to research led by marine physicist Svetlana Jevrejeva, of the UK's National Oceanography Centre.

How, in the face of flooding, blocked streets and rising waters, is Africa's most populous city adapting?

Floating architecture

There is one part of Lagos that has extensive experience of dealing with high water. Much of the Makoko neighbourhood is not built on land, but rather sits on stilts above the waterline. Makoko, known as the ""Venice of Africa"", is a labyrinthine slum built on stilts and navigated by canoe. The slum has little access to electricity or clean sanitation, but it has also been home to innovations like the Makoko Floating School, a structure resting on recycled empty plastic barrels for buoyancy. The school's pyramid shape helped lower its centre of gravity and so increase its stability, while also being an ideal roof shape for shedding heavy rains.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/live/624x351/p094q1j4.jpg,"['afloat', 'water', 'rubbish', 'streets', 'slum', 'africas', 'staying', 'rising', 'lagos', 'stilts', 'shape', 'largest', 'city', 'makoko']", ,flood

The Edo State government said it has appointed a contractor for the flood control project at Ughoha community in Esan South Local Government Area of the state, signalling the commencement of the project.

The project coordinator, Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP), Tom Obaseki, made this known on Wednesday at Ugboha, while introducing the project contractor to the community.

Mr Obaseki assured the people that the best contractor was selected to handle the project because of the importance of the community to the state.

“Ugboha is very important to us and we thank the community for producing great men that have made so many positive contributions to the development of Edo State.

“We made sure that in the process of recruiting a contractor for the job, we went for the best of the best,” he stated.

Mr Obaseki solicited the support of the traditional head of Ugboha and members of the community for the smooth implementation of the project.

“We want to solicit the support of your highness and the entire people of the kingdom so that there will not be hitches down the line.

“Every time we waste or lose cannot be recovered. So, we want to seek your support in providing the enabling environment and security for the contractor,” he said.

The traditional head of Ugboha, Ukato Steven II, assured that the community would provide a conducive environment for the successful and timely delivery of the project.

Outrage as IDPs camps overflows with displaced residence



Governor raises the alarm as terrorists hoist flag in Kaore community

Affected communities speak out: “We don’t want Govt food or money but adequate security to enable us to return home

CAN goes spiritual; declares 3-day fast

By Wole Mosadomi

Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

“I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

“We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.”

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists’ presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. “Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don’t need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,” he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: “The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.”

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God’s intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

Speaking when the 2021 flood outlook was presented in Abuja, Nze said states have maintained a carefree attitude towards flood warnings over the years.

“Last year, the minister sent a letter to all the state governors in Nigeria and informed them in detail of what to expect, yet not too many states are doing something about it,” he said.

Nze urged state governors to use the same energy for political activities when tackling environmental challenges such as flooding.

He said: “It could be avoided or eliminated. The tempo of political activities they exhibited during the elections should be replicated in tackling this disturbing issue of flooding in the states.

“LGA councillors should be able to domesticate this information in their own locations but this doesn’t happen.

“Once the disaster occurs, they are quick to cry to high heavens, but in terms of reducing the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.”

There Is No End

BLUE NOTE

8/10

Though I’d witnessed the hypnotic magic of Tony Allen while he was drumming for his Afrobeat contemporary Fela Kuti, and had long been a fan of the rhythmatist’s work with King Sunny Ade and Ginger Baker, it wasn’t until the drummer played with Damon Albarn’s Gorillaz, then his The Good, the Bad & the Queen project, where I could speak to Allen. A casually cool drum god stuffed into a regal kingseat, Allen treated Albarn’s compositions and the rhythm section he had formed with Paul Simonon (of The Clash fame) in 2006 as but one more piece of his puzzle, a West African–styled Lego set layered with the ragged, angled tiles of R&B, funk, and jazz. He talked of taking the eccentric English music touched by dub and Afrobeat in stride, and made all that he laid his hands on a simple life pleasure—like sipping fine wine. Combine that cool complexity with an innate in-the-pocket oomph more finely regulated and metronomic than Clyde Stubblefield’s steady, burrowing groove, and Allen was magnificent—the rhythm divine personified.

Allen passed in April 2020 with a handful of compositions and demos in the planning stages for a new solo album—a soulful, personal catalog which merits greater examination—and to commemorate that passing, Blue Note drops There Is No End. Completed by its co-producers Vincent Taeger and Vincent Taurelle, with vocalists and rappers such as Sampa the Great and Danny Brown, the End’s game isn’t some grand finale or explanatory note summing up a career. Like everything else Allen was about, it’s but another piece of a greater puzzle.

That metronome’s meter, with a dub-house break and a hi-hat’s ride, turns “Stumbling Down” into something eerily atmospheric, yet sharply angled, a woozy track made whole by Sampa’s giddy rap. The same floppy dub break with tuneful jazzy brass applied doesn’t so much punctuate “Deer in Headlights” as it does stir up a smoldering psychedelic stew made weirder by Allen’s phase-shifting snare sounds and Brown’s leering voice. The Afro-pop of “Cosmosis” has the feel of being everywhere and nowhere at once, and aggressively yet.

Such aggression can easily be connected to years of warring strife, racism, insurgency, and pleas for justice in Allen’s homeland of Nigeria, and throughout a cut such as “Hurt Your Soul,” you can sense the pains of Allen’s drums, even when he’s rat-tat-tatting a snare to emulate the ring of gunshots. For every dramatic snare sound of Allen’s, there’s another tom-tom romp waiting to be beheld, even quietly and rumbling during “Très Magnifique” and its warm-winded rap courtesy Tsunami.

Though hardly or specifically hip-hop, it’s fascinating that Allen’s last full album is dedicated to the drummer’s relationship with rap, sweet or sour, and young collaborators. But, as its title signals, Tony Allen was a restless soul to go with his position as the rhythm divine personified. Savor this.","Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://floodmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tony-Allen-There-Is-No-End-600x315.jpg,"['allen', 'snare', 'rhythm', 'end', 'rap', 'note', 'tony', 'piece', 'vincent', 'soul', 'allens']", ,none

By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja

A bill seeking to amend the fire service act of 1963 and include other natural disasters as emergencies to be given urgent attention has passed for second reading in the House of Representatives.

The bill is titled “An Act to repeal the Fire Service Act Cap. F29 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and enact the Fire and Emergency Service Act 2021 to provide for additional powers for effective service delivery; and for related matters”.

The non-fire occurrences listed by the bill needing emergency rescue included flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters.

The sponsor of the bill is Rep. Adejoro Adeogun Akoko South East: South West Federal Constituency of Ondo State.

Leading the debate on the general principle of the bill at Tuesday plenary, Adeogun said that the bill when passed into law would provide stricter penalties for violation of building codes and fire regulations.

He said: “The fire service act (1963) saddled the Fire service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies. This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required.

Also read:

“This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.

“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”

According to the lawmaker, the goals of the bill are essential to prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters; encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by States, Local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies; establish the office of the Fire and emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the Fire and emergency service; empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilize resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies; and provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officer.

“Mr Speaker, Hon. colleagues, the major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency.

“It will also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through the engagement of able-bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.

“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating of future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources. I am therefore seeking the support of all distinguished Honorable members of this house for the second reading of this bill and eventual passage”, Adeogun submitted.

The bill eventually received the overwhelming support of the House majority when subjected to a voice vote by the presiding officer, Ahmed Idris Wase and passed for second reading.

This was disclosed by the NHSA Director-General, Mr Clement Nze, in a press briefing on Wednesday in Abuja. He urged that strict town planning codes be enforced, calling for constructions of flood walls, buffer dams, dykes and other infrastructure that can hold water and prevent flooding.

What the NHSA is saying

“Federal, states and local governments should clear drainage systems and canals, and embark on projects that will improve hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows… carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas through removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers, to increase storage capacities,” Nze said.

READ:

The NHSA boss revealed that Nigeria is stepping into the 2021/2022 hydrological year in the River Niger Basin, which includes a total of 9 countries, citing the yearly occurrence of flooding in the country since 2012.

“It then means that Nigeria is gradually inching closer to its peak rainy season with subsequent flood incidents,” he said.

“Nigeria’s geographical location downstream, of all the countries in the Basin, puts it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollutions from all the countries upstream,” Nze added.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beat/University of North Carolina PressWho doesn’t love a book with more than one index entry for possum? Two hundred of them were cooked at an Oklahoma City bash in 1923, along with 5,000 chickens, 10 bears, 500 beef cattle, 5 tons of coffee, etc. These are but some of the many fascinating facts in Adrian Miller’s new book Black Smoke: African Americans and the United States of Barbecue.Meet One of the First Barbecue Kings: Henry ‘Poppa’ MillerThe Lost African-American Bartenders who Created the CocktailThe book has 22 recipes (bison skewers, banana pudding, alligator ribs), 16 mini-profiles (such as barbecue king Henry “Poppa” Miller), and a big mission.In the 1990s, Miller worked as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton in the One America Initiative, which had the goal of fostering dialogue and helping communities reconcile racial divisions. Miller’s books could be seen as an extension of that experience. His James Beard Award-winning Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time expounded upon the social history of key soul dishes—fried chicken, chitlins, yams. In The President’s Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas, Miller researched the contributions of African Americans who worked in the White House kitchen.So faced with a whitewashed and one-sided representation of barbecue, Miller got to work. While most people agree that barbecue is a result of European influences dovetailing with Native American techniques in Southern kitchens where the cooks were African Americans—that barbecue, in other words, is Black—evidence, by which I mean scholarly evidence, well-researched and reliably sourced, has been vanishingly scant.To find that essential information, Miller turned mostly to newspaper archives.“For all my books, the biggest boon has been newspapers,” he told me. “They were about capturing the daily life of the community, and so you got a lot more flourish and details about what was happening at a particular event.”He sifted through the records of the speakers and the attendees at big community barbecues—which was tough work, since the food was often barely mentioned.Eventually, “writers started paying more attention to the details and at a time when African Americans went unnoticed more and more of them started talking to these Black barbecuers.”“Now, let’s just be straight up,” Miller said. “Part of this was to mock them. So you’d have them speaking in plantation dialect. But you saw other writers treating this person as an expert, as an artist and showing some love.”“I’ve struggled on how to tell people this,” Miller told me. “During the racist times you actually got more details.”And by the 1830s, in order to have legit barbecue, it was thought, an African American cook and his crew were necessary and barbecue was understood to be a Black experience. Miller explained a complicated twist in the narrative in words far more polite than I might have chosen: “In the 1850s, as there’s more and more tension about slavery, you actually find pro-slavery advocates using the plantation barbecue as evidence of their generosity.”After the Civil War, a group of African Americans “emerged from slavery with a highly specialized and marketable skill.” Barbecue culture flourished because African Americans were barbecuing on their own terms. “And that shows up with political barbecue, church barbecue and also emancipation barbecues.”Barbecue, after all, is perfectly suited to big crowds. You can feed thousands of people, as many as show up, as long as you’ve got the wood, the space and the meat.But the meat, says Miller, is not as cut-and-dried, so to speak, as one might think.In words sure to bring upon him (if not me, by association) a plague of wonky BBQ commentary, Miller reports that: “The regional barbecue styles that we fight about so fiercely today, they’re only about a hundred years old. Before that, barbecue was pretty standardized. It was hardwood coals in a trench, butterflied whole carcasses, flip it and sauce it, cut it up and serve it.” Pork was common, of course, but so was lamb and mutton, and the first emancipation barbecue, which took place in Port Royal, South Carolina, was a beef barbecue.Equally fascinating are the unsung regions of barbecue that Miller has championed such as St. Louis, Chicago, and the east side of Texas, where the meat comes with sauce and the sides aren’t the Germanic salads you find in Central Texas but soul food greens and creole dirty rice.So what happened over the last century? How did we get to a place where white people are thought to own barbecue?“At the very time that people are getting interested in barbecue, the non-diverse food media basically said ‘OK, these are the people we think should tell you what barbecue is, and where to get the good stuff.’ And they just kept putting white dude after white dude out in front.”And as he says it, and we talk about the trends that get pushed in barbecue, it becomes obvious, almost to the point of hilarity: the reason the mantra of barbecue became minimal seasoning was because we kept asking white people how to make barbecue. I suggest that I hear an echo of the old joke about how white people don’t season their food, and he laughs and agrees.“We’ll just flip that to our advantage,” Miller said, “and say you don’t need to season.”This trend is a big part of what brought Miller to write this book. “Chronically, there’s been so little coverage of African American barbecue culture.” Everywhere in the food media, the lack of African American representation “just hit me over and over.”He wasn’t sure, upon setting out on the project, how much he would find, and he feared, in the beginning, that he might be embarking on a record of faded glory. “I really thought I was going to be writing an elegy about Black barbecue,” he said. But “it’s thriving. It’s resilient.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

27,27,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Man who ‘lost everything’ in flood wins $2m jackpot - Vanguard,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/04/man-who-lost-everything-in-flood-wins-2m-jackpot/,"Kindly Share This Story:

A Michigan man who “lost everything” in a flood a year ago just won $2 million from a scratch-off lottery ticket.

The lucky 29-year-old, who chose to remain anonymous, said he “couldn’t stop shaking” when he found out about his sudden change in fortune.

“Last year, I lost everything in a flood, so to win this prize is so overwhelming to me,” he said in a statement released by state lottery officials.

He was on his way to pick up his kids from school when he stopped at a grocery store in Midland — and a ticket for the lottery’s Lucky 7s instant game caught his eye.

“Seven is a lucky number for me, so I decided to take a chance and bought the ticket,” said the man, who also won $10,000 playing the lottery a few years ago.

“I scratched it off when I got back to my car. When I saw I had a match, I thought: ‘Great, I won my money back!’ When I saw I had actually won $2 million, I couldn’t stop shaking.”

He went to the lottery headquarters to claim his big prize, opting for the lump sum of about $1.3 million instead of receiving annuity payments for the full $2 million.

He said he plans to pay off bills and save what’s left of his winnings.

“Knowing my kids will be taken care of is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

28,28,FL-2019-000122-NGA,"Nigeria: Aftermath of Boko Haram Invasion - Niger State Communities in Panic Mode As Victims, Others Flood IDPs Camps - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/202104300443.html,"Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: ""I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

""I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

""We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.""

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists' presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. ""Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don't need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,"" he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: ""The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.""

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God's intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 28 Nigerian states are at risk of heavy flooding this year, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said Thursday.

This year's flood projections will, as expected, vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country, and rivers are likely to exceed flood level with some low-lying areas to be inundated, said the NIHSA in a statement following an earlier survey.

Out of the 774 local government areas in the country, it said, some 102 local government areas across 28 states are at risk of flooding -- one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria, which has a devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on floodplains for livelihood.

Although the projections showed that the floods this year might not be as severe as in previous years, it was important to begin to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns for preparedness, the agency said.

In March 2012, 32 of Nigeria's 36 states were affected by flooding, in which more than 360 people were killed and almost 2 million displaced.

The phenomenon is repeated across numerous communities in West Africa, where traffic and business come to a standstill for hours or days, waiting for the streets to drain. Sometimes the flooding becomes deadly.

Last year, hundreds of people were killed in a mudslide in Freetown, Sierra Leone, along a hillside where residents of the booming city had cleared forests to build homes. Victims were buried alive in their houses and vehicles. Environmental groups and local organizations had been warning for years that the development was risky.

In Nigeria, local television stations reported that more than 100 communities had flooded and broadcast images of muddy waters reaching the rooftops of clusters of homes. Some people died when flooding caused their homes to collapse, according to Agence France-Presse.

Local leaders in some areas were advising residents to evacuate. Officials in Anambra State set up 28 camps for fleeing residents. Thousands of people fled their homes in Cross River State, officials there said, noting that many of them lived in swampy areas or along waterways.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Nigerien student Hachimou Abdou has had to catch a boat to classes since river water swamped his route to university in the capital Niamey - one of about 760,000 people hit by severe flooding in recent weeks in parts of West and Central Africa.

Floods are common during the rainy season, but in recent years climate change, land degradation and poor urban planning have led to more frequent disasters as rapidly-growing cities struggle with heavier-than-normal rainfall.

Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Congo Republic and Senegal are among those worst-hit this year, with at least 111 people killed, according to latest figures from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Waters have yet to recede in parts of Niamey since torrential rains in August caused rivers to burst their banks, destroying nearly 32,000 houses and 5,768 hectares of farmland across Niger.

“I have to get to university - either I take a boat or I walk in the water,” Abdou said, before settling into a traditional wooden pirogue to travel up the flooded highway.

Flooding across landlocked Niger alone has so far impacted nearly 333,000 people. Over 188,000 people have been affected in neighbouring Chad, with OCHA warning of potential food shortages due to inundated land.

With further rain expected, particularly in Central Africa, the situation is expected to worsen, said OCHA’s director for West and Central Africa, Julie Belanger.

Communities’ ability to cope with natural disasters has been eroded by instability, food shortages and mass displacement in some areas. Over 25 million people are in need of humanitarian aid in the violence-plagued Sahel area, which includes Niger, Chad and Mali.

“Many of those populations live in flood-prone areas. It’s just a matter of time for them to be at risk of epidemics,” Belanger said, describing how quickly diseases can spread once floods wipe out access to clean water and sanitation.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200910&t=2&i=1532955151&r=LYNXMPEG891XR&w=800,"['recent', '760000', 'water', 'chad', 'university', 'central', 'floods', 'west', 'hit', 'parts', 'niger', 'severe', 'niamey', 'africa', 'shortages']", ,flood

An image of trucks and cars on a flooded road has been shared in multiple social media posts claiming to show a submerged highway in Nigeria’s southern Ogun state following a recent heavy downpour. This is partly false; while the location is correct, the photo has been circulating since at least 2019.

The image appears in numerous Facebook posts, including this one published on March 24, 2021, with more than 500 shares.

“Sango Ota bridge, I understand this was yesterday o (sic),” reads the Facebook post published on a page called “Lady K ifeoluwa show”. It has a history of calling for the secession of the Yoruba nation from Nigeria.

Screenshot taken on March 29, 2021, showing the misleading Facebook post

Sango Ota is a town in Nigeria’s southwestern Ogun state and is home to the country’s former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. The majority of inhabitants in the region are Yorubas, a large ethnic group in the west African country.

The rest of the post, translated from Yoruba into English, pleads for the “intervention” of state officials and then declares “end Nigeria now”.

The photo it refers to shows submerged vehicles on a flooded road, and features alongside an almost identical claim in this Facebook post with more than 800 shares, as well as on Twitter.

However, the image has been circulating online for more than a year.

Old photo

Using the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check traced earlier versions of the claim to Facebook accounts here and here on March 22, 2021.

It was reposted on Facebook the next day by Joe Igbokwe, the special adviser to the Lagos state governor for drainage and water resources.

“Sango Bridge after yesterday's rain, this is sign of what the people of that area should be expecting this year except the drainages are cleared. Please tell Ogun State to consult me (sic),” reads Igbokwe’s Facebook post.

Screenshot taken on March 29, 2021, showing the misleading claim on Joe Igbokwe’s page

AFP Fact Check has previously debunked misleading information shared on Igbokwe’s account.

In this case, AFP Fact Check confirmed that it actually rained in Sango Ota on March 22, 2021, according to the World Weather Online site.

Furthermore, an AFP journalist in Nigeria confirmed that the photo was indeed taken in the town.

However, the viral image is not evidence of any recent rainfall or flooding.

A Google reverse image search led to this Facebook post and the same picture from September 7, 2019, captioned ""Yesterday Rain @ Sango"". Five days later, global humanitarian organisation ReliefWeb reported that heavy rainfall in the preceding weeks had caused flooding in some parts of the country.

Flooding has long been an issue in the town. In 2011, residents called on the government to construct drainage to prevent an environmental disaster.

Now, like thousands of hectares of rice in Nigeria’s Kebbi state, it is under water.

“Almost all my farm has been flooded. I didn’t harvest any rice,” Ladan told Reuters News Agency. “It’s going to be devastating.”

Floods early this month across northwest Nigeria destroyed 90 percent of the two million tonnes that Kebbi state officials expected to harvest this autumn, the head of the state branch of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. The loss amounts to some 20 percent of the rice Nigeria grew last year, and the waters are still rising.

Further south, outside Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, chicken farmer Hippolite Adigwe is also worried. A shortage of maize forced him to sell most of his flock of more than 1,000 birds, and the 300 he has left are hungry. Chicken feed prices have more than doubled, and he is not sure how long he can cope.

Twin crises, floods and maize shortages, come just after movement restrictions and financing difficulties caused by COVID-19 containment measures complicated spring planting.

Some farmers and economists said it could push Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, into a food crisis. Rice is the country’s staple grain, and chicken is a core protein.

“There is a real fear of having food shortages,” Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. “The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Nigeria took roughly 4,000 tonnes of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s (ECOWAS) strategic stocks last month and released 30,000 tonnes of its own maize. It also gave four companies special permission to import maize.

The prominent Nigerian Economic Summit Group has called for “a complete overhaul” of agriculture policy.

Problems accessing foreign exchange to import food are adding to shortages. In July, the central bank added maize to a list of items for which importers are banned from using its dollars. Rice and fertiliser were already on the list, along with other items that Nigeria wants to be made locally.

Last week, even as food prices spiked, President Muhammadu Buhari promised that not one cent of central bank dollars would go to food or fertiliser imports, as Nigeria would continue encouraging local farmers over imports.

Importers can use dollars from pricier parallel markets. But these are tough to find due to an oil price crash that has cut Nigeria’s core source of foreign exchange.

Switching grains

Rice prices had already risen substantially due to a land border closure last year that aimed to stamp out smuggling and boost local production.

The worst is yet to happen. Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex

Peter Clubb of the International Grains Council said the spike drove consumers to eat maize instead. This, along with a disappointing crop late last year and the foreign exchange issues, boosted maize prices to 180,000 naira ($470) per tonne from approximately 70,000 naira ($183) in March.

Farmers sid that consumers grappling with inflation, as well as the first rise in fuel prices since 2016 and a power price spike, can only pay so much more for food.

Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex, said the central bank’s lending scheme for farmers has significantly expanded output, and can work long term.

But the coming months will be tough. Fertiliser prices hit a record after a COVID-19 outbreak shut down country’s sole urea plant for two weeks, meaning more farmers will skip fertilisers, limiting crop yields.

“The worst is yet to happen,” Balogun said. “It is a problem across grains.”

Buhari has pledged more support, and Agriculture Minister Muhammed Sabo Nanono visited the northwest area this weekend and promised to provide farmers with high-quality seeds and to set up a special committee to ensure they have all they need to plant new crops as soon as possible.

Is the government doing enough?

Over the last few years in Nigeria, seasonal flooding has killed hundreds, destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, and displaced millions of people.

This year, since the rainy season began in June, twelve states have been badly affected. In four of them – Anambra, Delta, Kogi and Niger – the government declared a state of emergency. The National Emergency management agency (NEMA), which coordinate disaster management in Nigeria, estimates that two hundred people have died so far and over 600,000 people have had to flee their homes.

The havoc wrought by heavy rains this year has been devastating. But this level of destruction is not new to Nigeria. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and scores have died in floods. In 2012, particularly severe flooding led to two million displacements and 363 deaths.

Why Nigeria floods

Nigeria’s flooding problem derives from a combination of factors, natural and man-made alike.

On the one hand, rainfall has become significantly heavier in recent years due to climate change. This year, the Niger River reached 11.06m above sea level and could rise further, approaching the record 12.84m of 2012. Water levels have also risen in upstream Cameroon, Mali and Niger. These countries feed the Niger and Benue rivers, which flow through Nigeria. The towns along these two main rivers are particularly vulnerable.

Man-made issues have also contributed to the problem.

For example, Nigeria has several dams along its rivers, ranging from huge hydroelectric stations to smaller constructions for irrigation and fishing. These structures can, in theory, help manage water levels. But in reality, many have been poorly maintained and run, contributing to the build-up of water levels, endangering nearby towns and villages.

“Dams are not necessary facilitators of flood,” says James Akanmu, a water resource and environmental engineering expert. “But we often mismanage dams and they lead us into problems.”

Another contributing factor is a lack of town planning. As Nigeria rapidly urbanises, towns and cities have sprawled with little regard for environmental concerns. Waterways and canals that are crucial for flows are often filled in as part of building developments, while informal settlements in some areas vulnerable to flooding have doubled in population.

“People are building on water ways. People build houses without drainages. The government builds roads without drainages,” says Alabi Soneye, Professor of Geography at the University of Lagos.

“There is pressure in Nigeria cities. Too many people squeezed into small space and everything overstretched,” adds urban planner, Ugochukwu Donald.

The response

In response to this year’s floods, the government pledged $8.2 million for relief efforts as well as declaring a state of emergency in four states. NEMA set up five emergency operation centres to facilitate search and rescue operations and humanitarian support. These efforts have faced huge practical barriers in reaching flood victims, however, while they have also reportedly been undermined by poor management, bad governance and corruption.

Many also argue that such a reactive approach is insufficient in anything but the short-term. Experts say that Nigeria must proactively predict and prepare if it is to reduce the huge damage caused by floods.

Geography professor Soneye argues that the main problem is not planning but implementation. “Master plans are not Nigeria’s problem,” he says. “We have master plan documents, [but] nobody is acting on it. The disaster continues to grow.”

One area in which Nigeria has attempted to establish forward-thinking is through early warning systems. But this has not been straightforward. Nigerian meteorological agencies make predictions about potential flooding and warnings are meant to be sent to locations at risk, but the system is not always effective.

Furthermore, even when information is passed on, there are challenges associated with getting people to act accordingly. Around half of Nigeria’s population lives below the poverty line and moving households to safe areas can be complex and costly.

“It is not enough to tell people to move that the rains are coming. The early warning system needs to provide that support for such response to take place,” says Peter Nwilo, professor of surveying and geo-informatics at the University of Lagos.

Soneye suggests that many citizens are distrustful of state orders and that warning systems should work through local intelligence and community collaboration to be effective. “The people are not in the mood to believe anything that comes from the government,” he says.

Nwilo concurs. “Our warning system needs to be domesticated and localised before it works,” he says. “People are reluctant to comply with the early warning system until disaster catches up with them. Ignorance is huge and we must improve.”

Indeed, as floods continue to devastate areas of Nigeria year on year, the environmental, economic and – most importantly – the human toll is huge. The necessary actions in many cases are known, but as climate changes leads to more unpredictable and heavy rainfall, Nigeria’s flooding problems will only increase unless there is reliable forward planning, sound management and careful implementation.

“The situation is straight forward,” says urban planner Donald. “Flooding is a natural disaster. We cannot entirely rule it out. But somehow, Nigeria has failed to do the right thing: to make corrections from the past.”","Thu, 15 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://africanarguments.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nigeria-flood.jpg,"['problem', 'pours', 'water', 'seasonal', 'flooding', 'huge', 'emergency', 'management', 'floods', 'warning', 'system', 'nigeria', 'rains', 'growing', 'niger', 'nigerias']", ,flood

IT was past noon – lunch time – but there was only one customer at the bukka. Loretta Eze, the proprietor, surveyed the busy street as she stood by the entrance of her restaurant located by the corner of a street in the Wuse 2 area of Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. A number of girls in yellow shirts, who worked as attendants in the restaurant, were hanging around waiting for the solitary customer to finish his meal.

“It was not always like this,” Loretta told The ICIR‘s correspondent, who visited the restaurant while investigating the impact of rising prices of foodstuffs on the preparation and consumption of food, especially jollof rice.

“Food items are very expensive these days and the situation is very hard for those of us that are into catering and food business. Things are hard and as a result, we are not getting as many customers as in the past when things were cheaper,” Loretta added.

Higher cost of foodstuffs has forced restaurants, including roadside bukkas and ‘Mama put‘ joints, to increase the prices of different dishes on their menu and Loretta observed that the development had, in turn, forced some customers to stay away because they could not afford meals as in the past.

Loretta’s observations and concerns mirrored the findings in the SBM Jollof Index report for the first quarter of 2021.

The SBM Jollof Index, developed by SBM Intel, an Africa-focused research firm, simplified the appreciation of food inflationary trends using a common delicacy that most Nigerian households enjoy – jollof rice.

Across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, SBM collects data on the most common ingredients that go into cooking jollof rice in 13 markets on a monthly basis except for December, due to the seasonal spikes caused by Yuletide celebrations. From the prices collated, the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for a family of five or six is averaged and used as a proxy for measuring food inflation across the country.

The commodities that make up the Jollof Index include rice, curry, thyme, seasoning, groundnut oil, chicken/turkey (poultry), beef, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions.

The SBM Index is published three times a year – at the end of the first three quarters. Data from October and November are reflected in the Quarter 1 Jollof Index of the following year.

Cost of making pot of jollof rice rose between March 2020 and March 2021

According to the latest SBM Jollof Index report, the average cost of making a pot of jollof rice rose by 7.8 per cent between March 2020 and March 2021.

The sharp spike in the cost of preparing the delicacy was attributed to a number of events which impacted on food prices. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020, the border closure and foreign exchange restrictions in August 2020 were worsened by a sharp hike in energy tariffs by September of that year.

The situation was further compounded by the the #EndSARS protests, as well as the food blockade imposed by northern traders on the southern part of the country, which disrupted agricultural supply chain and the movement of people and goods.

The reopening of land borders in December 2020 did not result in a significant drop in the cost of food items – the price of a bag of rice only dropped slightly by a margin of N1000 to N3000 depending on the market but that did not translate into a drop in the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for the majority of Nigerians who buy from retailers.

The SBM Jollof Index noted that food prices remained high due to factors such as reduced local production, exchange rate fluctuations, poor harvest due to adverse weather, and high cost of energy and transportation.

Insecurity was also a major factor for the increasing cost of preparing a pot of jollof rice, translating into rising food inflation in Nigeria.

“Some of the jollof rice ingredients such as rice, onions and tomatoes have witnessed reduced local production because of protracted conflicts and terrorist attacks on farmers. Out of the 11 main rice producing states in the country, Benue, Borno, Ebonyi and Kaduna have witnessed attacks on farmers with the most gruesome being the execution of about 110 rice farmers in Borno in November 2020,” the report said.

Faced with deaths from terror attacks in insecure agrarian communities, several farmers are leaving the countryside and moving to the cities to take up menial jobs.

Despite recent drop in inflation rate, Nigerians are still groaning over increasing cost of food items

According to latest figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria’s inflation rate dropped from 18.17 per cent in March 2021 to 18.12 per cent in April 2021.

The 0.05 percentage points decline was the first recorded in headline inflation in about 20 months.

Food inflation also recorded a decline – from 22.95 per cent in March 2021 to 22.72 per cent in April, 2021.

However, while the NBS suggested that inflation might have peaked and could continue to drop, Nigerians are yet to get any reprieve while purchasing foodstuffs.

For Loretta, a food vendor who deals in foodstuffs, the price of food items has continued to spike in the market.

Making a comparison of what was obtainable in the past and the present, she told The ICIR, “Before now, I used to buy a small basket of tomatoes between N300 and N500, but now, it is N1500. Some tomatoes even go for N2500 per basket. Also, a basket of fresh pepper is N1500 now. Before now, you could get a pint of groundnut oil for N300, but it is now N650.”

She added, “Before now, with N2500 or N3000, I could prepare a normal pot of soup or stew but now, if you don’t have at least N7000 you will not get the taste you want due to the high cost of food items.”

Further lamenting the daily hike in the price of staple food items, she observed that, not too long ago, a mudu, or regular measure of beans, was between N250 and N300. But a mudu of beans is N800 now.

“It is the same case as meat. Before now, with N6000 or N8000, you could get the quantity of goat meat that would be enough for you, but now, you will have up to N15000 or more for that same quantity.”

According to her, the increase in the price of onions was ‘manageable’. “The quantity we were getting for N100 before is about N400 or N500 at the moment.”

Loretta also pointed to the sharp increase in the price of rice.

“Before now, a mudu of rice was N300, but now, a mudu of local rice is about N800,” a development which she admitted had increased the cost of preparing a pot of regular jollof rice.

Speaking further, Loretta said, “crayfish and stockfish are totally out of the question” due to recent hike in the prices of the food items.

Nkechi Emmanuel, a housewife, had a frown on her face as she walked out of Dutse Market, in the Bwari area of Abuja. She was clutching a handful of food items.

In a brief encounter with The ICIR‘s correspondent, Nkechi explained that the feeding allowance her husband gave her each month, which was never enough in the best of times, was now barely able to provide a pot of stew and soup.

“It has never been this bad and it is getting worse by the day,” the woman said in a frustrated tone.

All types of foodstuffs are becoming out of reach for the poor and the lower middle-class by the day.

Mary Okon-Essien operates a restaurant in the FCT. She took a break from serving a customer to respond to questions by The ICIR‘s correspondent on May 20.

Okon-Essien stressed that the increase in the prices of basic food items, which had driven up the cost of food, had resulted in reduced patronage for food vendors.

“Before now, the highest amount you could get egusi is N250 or N300 for a mudu, but now, a mudu of egusi is N700 or N800.

“The situation is very difficult for those of us that are into food business. Due to the high cost of foodstuff, it is not easy to sell and make profit anymore because customers are having problems with the higher prices,” she said.

Garri is generally regarded as ‘poor man’s food,’ but Okon-Essien said that was in the past.

“Garri is longer a poor man’s food. A mudu of garri is now N500,” she told The ICIR.

Okon-Essien also noted that another staple foudstuff – red oil – had become more expensive.

“Before now, you could get a tin of red oil for N200, but now, it is not less than N500,” she said, while observing that the situation was more worrisome because the food items were locally produced and not imported.

Besides becoming more expensive, some food items which Nigerians took for granted, due to their availability, are becoming scarce.

The increase in the price of fufu, a cassava meal, goes with the increasing scarcity of the food item, according to Okon-Essien.

“Fufu is a food item that is loved by Nigerians but right now, fufu is scarce and that has made it very expensive. I don’t know if Nigerians are not planting cassava again. Fish has also become very expensive. People now find it very difficult to afford fish for their meals.”

Okon-Essien corroborated the findings of the SBM Jollof Index for the first quarter of 2021.

“Not too long ago, with as little as N1000, you could prepare a pot of jollof rice for your family because with that amount, you would get rice and some amount of crayfish, onion, maggi and other foodstuff you needed. But now, that N1000 will only be enough for a mudu of foreign rice and if you want to cook local rice, then you will need N700 or N800 to buy a mudu of rice and as a result, you will not have much left for the ingredients needed for the jollof rice.”

Highlighting the dismal impact of high food inflation on the food industry, she observed, “Before now, when it was lunch time, you would see many people coming to eat, but now, lunch time seems like morning time, you hardly see anybody. You only see a few people coming to eat and this is because there is no money and everybody is ‘checking his pocket.’ Before now, they could get a plate of food for N250 or N300, but the least you can get a plate of now is N400 or N500,” the woman said.

The number of customers in restaurants has dropped, Okon-Essien noted.

Inflation rate still very high despite recorded decline

Nigeria’s inflation rate might have recorded a marginal decline in April but it remains very high and this is especially so for food inflation.

This was stated by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) which decried the current inflation rate of 18.12 per cent.

Director General of LCCI Muda Yusuf noted that despite the recently recorded decline in the inflation rate, “food inflation at over 22 per cent is still very high in spite of the marginal moderation in food prices in April 2021.”

Yusuf said the situation had continued to exert a negative impact on the activities of every economic agents, including households, businesses and investors, with profound impact on the citizenry, particularly the low and middle-income households.

“The high level of inflation continues to dampen consumer purchasing power at a time households incomes are not increasing in proportion to cost,” he said, adding that the development had resulted in rising production costs and depressed margins for businesses.

Nigeria at risk of famine

Meanwhile, the latest SBM Jollof Index report, which said Nigeria was currently on a slippery slope, noted that Nigeria might experience famine in the nearest future if production, consumption and political-economic dynamics remained unchanged from what was currently obtainable.

Noting that decline in food availability, exponential population growth and decline in entitlements were the main contributors to famine, the report observed that “history shows that the famines with the highest mortality rates resulted from poor harvests, natural disasters (droughts, flood), war/conflict, poor governance and policy failures – conditions which Nigeria fulfills easily.”

The SBM Jollof Index noted that over the last 10 years, food production in Nigeria had been dismally affected by continuous conflicts between farmers and herders in the Middle Belt, where more than 62,000 farmers were displaced from their homeland between 2010 and 2015, including terrorist attacks on farmers in the North-East and bandits’ onslaught in the North-West.

Added to these are adverse weather conditions and decreasing agricultural land due to urbanisation, and the effects of governance failure and some government policies, such as border closer, foreign exchange restriction, hike in electricity tariff and petrol pump price.

The SBM Jollof Index stated that the different factors had combined to continuously drive up food prices in Nigeria.

Poverty rising

The 2020 report by World Poverty Clock showed that over 105 million Nigerians lived in extreme poverty – as against 98 million in October 2019. The figure represented more than 51 per cent of the population.

This placed Nigeria as world poverty capital for two years running. Unemployment in Nigeria reached 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020. Nigeria is among most miserable countries in Africa, scoring 50.6 points in March 2021, as against 14.8 points in Ghana, 6.9 in Ethiopia, 13 in Kenya and 12.1 points in Egypt, among others.","Fri, 21 May 2021 17:07:41 GMT",https://www.icirnigeria.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Goat-meat-jollof-rice.jpg,"['sbm', 'inflation', 'food', 'mudu', 'cost', 'worsening', 'jollof', 'signals', 'rising', 'prices', 'index', 'pot', 'insecurity', 'preparing', 'rice', 'nigerias']", ,flood

As of 23 October, flooding has affected 2.2 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Nigeria, Togo and the Central African Republic, and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

In West Coast, Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Ghana have also experienced flooding throughout August-September 2020.","Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539716-Africa%20-%20Floods%20and%20multiple%20disasters%20-%20Information%20bulletin%2C%2006%20September%202020.png?itok=7OMwtMBe,"['affected', 'chad', 'sudan', 'flooding', '06', 'bulletin', '2020', 'floods', 'states', 'displaced', 'multiple', 'rains', 'information', 'niger', 'disasters', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

Lagos State plans to stop being a receiver of processed rice and start processing its own Lake Rice, starting with the Kebbi State government.

Continuous heavy rainfall since July reached its peak in late September, causing severe and extensive flooding in 34 out of 36 states in Nigeria. Two major rivers, the Niger River and Benue River overflowed into the surrounding communities resulting in widespread destruction. The Nigerian government has declared a state of emergencies in nine states. The floods have affected 1.9 million people, destroyed 82,000 houses, displaced 210,000 people and devastated crops and livestock. Though flood water has receded in some communities, many people still do not have homes, businesses and farms to return to. They continue to seek refuge in schools and other public buildings where conditions are extremely poor. Fear of health outbreaks including malaria, cholera and typhoid remain high, as sanitary conditions have deteriorated especially in the temporary shelters.

Red Cross Actions

The International Red Cross has mobilized HKD 2 million from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to support the Nigerian Red Cross Society’s immediate relief activities. An emergency appeal was launched on 21 September 2018 seeking HKD 43.7 million globally targeting to assist 300,000 people for nine months in 10 states.

Since the onset of the floods the Nigerian Red Cross Society has mobilized over 2,000 volunteers and supported affected communities with evacuations, search and rescue, distribution of food and essential household items, provided first aid, psychosocial support and sensitized communities on good hygiene practices.

Hong Kong Red Cross Actions

Hong Kong Red Cross has mobilized HK$200,000 to support the relief efforts in Nigeria via the International Red Cross, and will continue to monitor the humanitarian situation to define further support.","Wed, 24 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['2018', 'work', 'relief', 'situation', 'support', 'floods', 'mobilized', 'states', 'cross', 'million', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'communities', 'report', 'red']", ,flood
47,47,FL-2019-000122-NGA,"Nigeria: Flood of Tears, As Homes, Farmlands Get Washed Away - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009050051.html,"Floods have again hit several parts of the country, severely affecting farmlands and displacing thousands of people, especially in Kebbi State where our correspondent reports that it ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5billion, while also rendering people homeless in other states, heightening threats to food security.

Besides other factors threatening food security in Nigeria, including the seemingly intractable terrorism, banditry and killer herdsmen's onslaught which are steadily spreading across the country, harvest of farm produce might be imperiled this year and even the next as a result of flooding.

In Kebbi State for instance, 500,000 hectares was recently devastated by flood, 450,000 hectares of it being for rice farms.

This has heightened fears that by next year, majority of farmers in the state, particularly rice farmers, would be out of business.

Many farmlands visited by our correspondent were overrun by floods, just as rice farms were submerged.

A farmer, Libabatu Usman Kamba, expressed fears over imminent food scarcity, particularly as most of the farmers would not be able to mobilize for the next farming season due to the zero harvest this year.

Kamba said she cultivated over 20 hectares of rice this year at Cida Kai village in Dandi Local Government Area but lost over 16 hectares of the rice farm to flood.

She said her crop was ready for harvest and was hoping to get 40 bags of rice per hectare and 700 bags of paddy rice.

Though she could not say what she spent on the hectares submerged in the flood, she added that most farmers would not be able to go for dry season farming this year, hence the need for urgent government intervention.

""The losses recorded this year are so enormous that majority of small holder farmers would not go back for this year's dry season farming.

""The usual practice by most farmers is to re-invest what they realized from rainy season farming for dry season farming,"" she said.

Zuwaira Abubakar, another rice farmer in Argungu, said barely all rice farms in the area were submerged and that would affect farmers' capital for dry season farming. Zuwaira, who cultivated over 25 hectares of rice, said she lost all to flood, adding that she had spent over N300,000 in the farm before the flood came.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid. Many of us will be out of business if no intervention comes our way.

""Farmers don't keep money, the more we make in the business the more we open more farmlands, that is the secret of the farming business otherwise you won't last long in it,"" she said.

In Danko Wasagu Local Government Area, a farmer, Usman Umar, told Daily Trust that they did not experience massive destruction as was the case in most parts of the state, noting that only about a hectare of seven hectares of his rice farm was washed away by the flood.

Another farmer, Suleiman Bashir, who stood helplessly by his rice farm which was submerged along Dukku/Makera road in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area, appealed to the state and federal governments to come to their aid.

""I don't know what to do, I have two large rice farms and they have been completely submerged.

""We are appealing to the state and federal governments to assist us,"" he said.

The chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Sani Dododo, said farm produce worth over N5 billion was destroyed by flood.

He added that the loss recorded in rice farming could be put at 90 percent of the total value of farm produce in the state.

""Over 500,000 hectares of farmlands have been destroyed by flood, the destruction translates to over N5billion worth of farm produce.

""Rice farms constitute to about 90 percent of the farm produce destroyed,"" he said.

The National President of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Aminu Goronyo, who toured some of the affected places while in the entourage of the Kebbi State governor, described the incident as devastating.

Goronyo assured the farmers of federal government intervention because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had sent its officials to the state to assess the situation for immediate intervention.

""The CBN governor has directed RIFAN to mobilise one million farmers that can produce five million metric tonnes of rice during the dry season commencing in November for support,"" he said.

Also speaking with newsmen at Bakin Gada in Argungu Local Government Area after inspecting rice farms destroyed in some local government areas, Governor Abubakar Bagudu expressed shock over the incident, describing it as regrettable.

Thousands rendered homeless in Bauchi

Thousands of displaced people including women and children and the aged have moved into public schools, primary healthcare centres and shops while hundreds of others have relocated to neighboring Jama'are, Azare and Giade local government areas of Bauchi State for shelter.

When our correspondent visited some of the affected areas on Wednesday, dozens of families had taken refuge at various public schools including the Adamami Primary School which was still occupied by the flood.

A victim and father of 11 children, Hamisu Magaji, said three families were sharing two classes.

""One class is accommodating 42 children sleeping on school desks while the male heads of families are sleeping on tables because water has taken over the environment.

""We are staying here due to the flood which destroyed our houses, properties, food and farmlands but we leave everything to God.

""We are yet to receive support or assistance from anybody four days after the incident, life has been difficult, especially taking care of the families but we are struggling to feed them, that notwithstanding, we are appealing to the government and organizations to come to our aid,"" he said.

His daughter, 18-year-old Halima Hamisu, who cooked food for children in the camp, told Daily Trust how they managed to sleep on school desks.

""We arrange the desks laying mats on top and putting long sticks on four angles to hang mosquito nets.

""We line up between 8 and 12 children inside the net and that is how we have managed in this class for the past four days as our mothers have relocated to a nearby village because they are nursing babies,"" she said.

A woman with four children at the Government Day Secondary School camp in Adamami, Barakana Mohammed, said her six months old daughter had been infected with cold.

""I have been sleeping on the floor with my children for four days due to the flood that destroyed our house and property and the bad condition coupled with the weather affecting the children.

""Life has become difficult living in a classroom but we pray for God's intervention.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid.""

A 60-year-old woman, Aishatu Abdullahi, now taking refuge at the camp, decried the absence of essential commodities and the sanitary situation in the camp, saying, ""We don't have food in the camp because water has destroyed everything and the little our caregivers are struggling to bring to the camp is not enough as we have small children.

""I am appealing to the government and privileged individuals in the name of God to support us with food and other relief materials so as to rescue us from additional hardship.""

The village head of Adamami, Malam Isa Nalaraba, said the flood had caused a lot of destruction but, ""We thank God for saving our lives and our children because almost more than half of Adamami is destroyed by the flood which displaced many people to neighboring communities while others have become refugees in their locality while many other residents have relocated to neighboring towns and villages.

""We are appealing to the government and individuals to assist the victims with relief materials to support them and continue their lives.""

Habiba Sani who was to wed in three months and three others including a 14-year-old girl and a 60-year-old woman drowned in flood waters in Bakatma, Shira Local Government Area of the state.

Habiba's father, Malam Sani Biidis, told Daily Trust that he was away when his neighbor invited her and his daughter to accompany him to remove weeds in a rice farm beside a river that was flooded following heavy downpour.

He described the deceased as a kind hearted and obedient girl who hardly argued or disagreed with people within and outside the family.

""They met their sad end when they tried to cross the river at a point where everybody including children used to pass from the village because the area is not deep or wide but as a result of the flood the volume and speed of the water had increased, unfortunately the moment they entered the river the flow dragged them down and they could not swim out of the water.

""It was some children who witnessed the incident that rushed to inform the family that they tried to cross the river but drowned in the process.

""When they launched the search operation their corpses were found in a nearby area some meters from the point of passage.

""I was away from home when I received a phone call that my daughter and one other girl had drowned.

""Habiba's death is painful but I leave everything to God and pray for their souls,"" Bidis said.

Badamasi Shittu, the father of the 14-year-old Ziyada Badamasi, said he asked them to go to his rice farm to assist him remove weeds and apply fertilizer.

""My daughter, Ziyada, told me that they would go before I arrived to apply the fertilizer.

""When they reached the point where people cross the river, they met some children but decided to cross and when they reached the center of the river, Ziyada shouted for help as the flow pulled them down and there was no mature person around to rescue them.

""It was one of the children who rushed home and notified us that Habiba and Ziyada had drowned,"" he said.

The Acting Permanent Secretary in the State Emergency Management Agency, Habu Ningi, said the flood affected 11 villages including Adamami, Bakatma, Alkaleri, Sawi, Dirmi, dago, Shira, Yana , Bege, Bukul, Fago , Tsafi and Disina all, in Shira LGA.

Bakatma village, Adamami, Alkaleri, and Disina town and other villages in Shira Local Government Area were flooded following heavy downpour between Sunday and Monday morning, destroying over 2,600 houses and many hectares of farmlands.

A resident of Adamami, Adamu Oni Adamami, said the heavy rain started on Sunday and around 11 pm people in the town were confused because water had taken over everywhere, gushing into houses at a high speed.

""The rain continued unabated and people started running for safety, especially women and children, to higher areas.

""The rain did not stop until 6am on Monday thousands of houses collapsed and many hectares of farmlands were destroyed.""

Oni added; ""Another devastation the flood caused is destruction of food.

""Apart from losing houses majority of the victims have no food and the farmlands have been destroyed, leaving us in a big calamity now and in future because the time to cultivate new crops has passed.

""We are calling on the government, individuals and corporate organizations to come to our aid before the situation goes out of hand.""

Niger farmers count losses

Many farmlands have been wiped out in Niger State where there is wide lamentation among farmers who are appealing to the government to come to their aid.

Our correspondent gathered that entire farmlands were washed away by floods, leaving farmers with nothing to harvest.

An affected farmer, Tukura Saidu from Kuyi village, said over 40 farmers were affected in his village as yams, maize and rice planted were all wiped out, adding that it was the first time of experiencing such a huge loss to flood.

Also, fish worth over N100 million were washed away by flood at Lapai Gwari in Bosso Local Government Area of the state, it was gathered.

A fish farm according to Daily Trust findings, the major place where fish sellers get fresh fish, was greatly affected, causing a rise in the price of fish in the area as residents now have to travel elsewhere to get fish.

A fish farmer, Malam Mohammad Tukur, lamented that the devastation caused by ravaging floods in Lapai Gwari was the first of its kind and appealed to the state government to urgently assist them.

He said about 2000 fish farms had been washed away.

Another farmer, Malam Abdullahi Saidu, said customers from across Nigeria were trooping to the farm before the incident but many farmers had lost millions of naira worth of investments to floods.

The Vice Chairman of Bosso Local Government Area, Malam Saidu Zegi, said in April this year, rainstorms affected over 200 people, just as many farmers lost their farmlands.

The Director General, Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, described the incident as not only pathetic and tragic but also devastating.

Inga said they had sent a team of experts from the agency to investigate the extent of damage caused.

This according to him is to enable the state government come up with modalities of assisting victims.

He said though the state government was battling with insufficient funds occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, it would not fold its arms to allow the people suffer without any aid.

Floods hit Enugu farms

Enugu State is not left out of the massive flooding and destruction of crops. Mr. Austin Obiora has a rice farm of about 235 hectares at Ihuokpara community in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

Speaking with Daily Trust, he recalled how a heavy rainfall on August 26 caused a massive flood which affected his farm. About 16 hectares of the rice field was adversely affected.

According to him, the rice had started flowering when the flood came.

""I had to start afresh because the rice planting season was almost over.

""I started doing another ""broadcasting"" (spreading) of rice seeds in a systematic and orderly way to enable them germinate very well,"" he said.

""It costs about N250,000 to cultivate one hectare of rice field and when multiplied by 16 hectares, it will be over N4m because I have to add the cost of labour,"" Obiora said, adding: ""Therefore, I lost over N4m due to the massive and devastating flood.""

He, however, didn't feel discouraged by the huge loss because he said upon realizing that some large hectares were still there for him, the unaffected hectares represent compensation for his loss.

""We pray that it doesn't happen again in the next planting season, nobody wants to incur losses,"" he said.

Asked whether any government agency came to his aide, he said he considered it would be a waste of time and energy to approach any government body, just as he did not insure his farm in the first place.

However, Obiora said he had learnt his lesson as he has started making arrangements for insuring his farms in future.

Another farmer, an elderly Rev Dr Lambert Echetu who is into maize and cassava farming, told our correspondent that the combined misfortune of flooding and activities of herdsmen had caused a lot of havoc to his maize farm of two hectares at Amagunze in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

He said: ""The cattle and flood messed up my maize farm.

""I planted maize covering two hectares.

""I spent about N240,000 on clearing the bush, seeds and fertilizer.

""We went to the Government House, Enugu to complain about the Fulani herdsmen and their cows destroying our farms.

""The first tragedy was done to the farm by the cows.

""The second tragedy was caused by the huge flooding, even though the place is swampy.

""When I got to the Government House, they would refer me from one office to the other and it was like a wild goose chase and I left,"" he said.

Echetu further said: ""As a servant of God, when I tried to get help from people and I didn't succeed, I handed everything over to God.

""I love farming because I have passion for it.

""I prayed over the farm project before I decided to farm.

""I have a lot of people who need my help in the village.

""My intention is after harvesting the maize, and bringing it to the church, I will distribute the maize to the congregation.""

He said despite the setback, he won't give up farming and had acquired over 100 hectares of land at Ihu-Okpara community, specifically for planting cassava in the next planting season.

Kano, Jigawa farmers cry out

Last month, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) revealed that 20 of the 44 local government areas in Kano State were at high risk of flooding during this year's rainy season.

Tarauni, Garum Malam, Rimin Gado, Gaya, Gezawa, Gwale, Shanono, Gabasawa, Gwarzo, Ungoggo, Warawa, Dawakin Kudu, Dambatta, Bebeji, Kabo, Wudil, Kura, Nassarawa, Kano Municipal and Kumbotso were the local government areas identified in the report.

With the recent wave of rainfall in the state, some of the identified local governments have already begun to experience heavy flooding which resulted in the destruction of several hectares of farmlands by flood, causing loss of millions of naira worth of farm products.

According to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) in Kano, so far, hundreds of rice farmers in five local governments have reported to have been affected by the flood.

The state chapter chairman of RIFAN, Alhaji Haruna Abubakar Aliyu, said farmers in Dambatta, Makoda, Ajingi, Gaya and Rinim Gado have been seriously affected by the flooding.

""Based on the directives received from the RIFAN head office after we had sent our report on the damages caused to our various members, the head office asked us to compile a detailed report on the flood which currently we are working on.

""We have so far identified five local governments, though we are aware there are more than that but we are still working on it,"" he said.

The state chapter chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Alhaji Zubairu Ibrahim, said the association was still assessing the areas affected and number of farmers and farm lands affected.

He added that the outcome of the ongoing assessment would be made public and the association was working on measures to be adopted in assisting the affected farmers.

Attempts to contact the state commissioner for agriculture and who is also the deputy governor proved abortive but sources close to the ministry said a committee had been inaugurated by the state government to look into the issue and present its report for further action.

In Jigawa State, following a two-day heavy downpour in Birninkudu Local Government Area, several houses and farmlands were said to have been destroyed.

Alhaji Wada Faka, the chairman of the local government, said a yet-to-be ascertained number of houses and farmlands were destroyed in Malamawar Gangaran, Babaldu, Wurno, Kiyako and Samamiya villages.

NEMA had also stated that the Nigerian Hydrological Agency (NIHSA) 2020 Annual Flood Outlook already listed 12 local government areas in the state as flood-prone areas.

The NIHSA report listed Kaugama, Taura, Guri, Gwaram, Dutse, Auyo, Miga, Malam Madori, Ringim, Birniwa, Jahun and Kafin Hausa as probable flood risk areas.

Nasarawa farmers groan under flood

Many farms and farming communities were recently submerged in flood waters in Nasarawa, a state with many small, medium and large scale farms.

A farmer in Doma Local Government Area, Abu Doma, said his farm and many others were washed away in a few days.

Same goes with people residing on the bank of the River Benue along the state's boundary with Benue State.

This is the second year in a row that River Kilema in Lafia has flooded and submerged farms, houses and cemeteries among others.

An official of the State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) who prefers anonymity said it was taking measures to mitigate a possible humanitarian crisis in the state.

The agency has been urging those living in flood-prone areas to leave such places.

He said last month, heavy floods occurred in three local government areas including Awe, Nasarawa and Toto.

The Director of flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr. Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umasha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.","Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn03.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00521229:97559b81f1c74f189f2c92809408b0aa:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'washed', 'children', 'homes', 'flood', 'local', 'farm', 'area', 'farmlands', 'nigeria', 'tears', 'state', 'away', 'rice', 'hectares']", ,none
48,48,FL-2019-000122-NGA,A Flood of Polluting Air Conditioners Hampers Africa's Climate Efforts - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-flood-of-polluting-air-conditioners-hampers-africas-climate-efforts,"As air conditioning sales in Africa soar, many of the units imported there are old and inefficient, driving up electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. But some countries are taking action, banning the import of used air conditioners and adopting tough energy standards.

It’s early August and a dozen air conditioners are keeping Joy Obehi’s clients cool on another hot steamy day in Lagos, Nigeria. But invariably the electricity flickers off and her expensive diesel generator rumbles to life. “The power goes out pretty much every day, usually for one hour or two hours,” said Obehi, who rents out short-term meeting space and spends as much as $300 a month on diesel fuel. “[Air conditioners] use a lot of power, but our clients expect our locations to be cooler.” As African incomes rise and the number of hotter days from climate change increases, demand is exploding for air conditioners around the continent. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, more than 500,000 air conditioning units are bought each year and the number is increasing by 4 to 5 percent annually, according to a recent report. But that demand comes at a price: the plethora of energy-sapping — but inexpensive — air conditioners that are stressing already overburdened electricity grids, saddling consumers with high energy bills, contributing to more frequent outages that damage local economies, and making a significant contribution to the continent’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of used and new inefficient AC appliances are being sold in Africa every year, many of them illegally. Many are obsolete secondhand appliances imported mostly from Europe, despite international laws forbidding such activity. The appliances also contain banned ozone-depleting refrigerants that are potent contributors to climate change.

Electricity demand for air conditioners is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040.

And with cooling demand proliferating due to urbanization and hotter temperatures, Africa’s air conditioning market is poised to get bigger. Electricity demand for air conditioners and other cooling appliances is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040, from 11 terawatt-hours (TWh) to 112 terawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency. If African countries adopt stricter air conditioning efficiency standards, energy demand could be cut in half, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 million tons by 2040, according to the United Nations. Africa’s cooling challenge is part of a much larger trend. Worldwide demand for air conditioners is expected to more than triple in the next 30 years, from 1.6 billion units in 2018 to 5.6 billion units by 2050. That amounts to 10 new air conditioners being sold every second for the next three decades. Without government policies to make air conditioners cleaner and more efficient, greenhouse gas emissions from ACs and other cooling equipment will jump by a projected 90 percent by 2050 — a huge step backward in international efforts to limit global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, says a new UN report. Now, some African countries are trying to tamp down on energy-guzzling cooling. Ghana is successfully enforcing a ban on imports of used cooling appliances, including air conditioners. Rwanda approved a similar ban, along with Africa’s toughest-ever energy performance standards for new cooling appliances, both of which are set to come into effect next year. A half-dozen other countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, have minimum performance standards for new air conditioners and refrigerators. But success is still largely elusive due to weak policies and minimal enforcement. “There are not many harmonized efficiency policies at the moment in Africa, and many of them are out of date, not enforced, and not stringent,” said Patrick Blake, a policy expert at the UN’s United for Efficiency Program (U4E).

Among the countries struggling with the issue is Nigeria, Africa’s second-largest AC market behind Egypt. “Compliance with our energy standards is very, very slow,” said Etiosa Uyigue, executive director of a Nigerian environmental group, the Community Research and Development Center (CREDC), which has been pushing for more stringent mandatory energy standards and environmentally friendly refrigerants for all cooling appliances sold in the country. The stakes are enormous. Air conditioner sales are rising steadily across the continent, especially in hotter, more prosperous countries in West Africa. Morocco, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast have all seen a doubling in air conditioner imports since 2010, whether used or new units, according to government data. The United Nations projects that air conditioner stocks will hit 1.5 billion units in Africa by 2030, up from 660 million in 2015. The strains are already being felt. Nigeria’s limited power supplies, which are half the size of North Carolina’s despite having nearly 20 times more people, turn on and off every day and occasionally cause national blackouts, as happened 11 times in 2019. Hot sticky days when air conditioners are humming full throttle are the worst. “We just had two outages today,” said Uyigue, speaking in July from his home in the capital Abuja, where he uses three generators and a small solar energy system to keep the lights on. A Nigeria Energy Commission study in 2014 estimated that air conditioners account for 25 percent of total energy consumption in Abuja and 17 percent nationally. Nigeria’s annual CO2 emissions have tripled since 1990. The country’s widespread reliance on noisy, polluting diesel generators costs the economy nearly $14 billion a year, primarily in added fuel expenses. Meanwhile, Africa is tethered to an AC market dominated by high-polluting inefficient appliances.

Many air conditioners sold in Africa are low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made.

For years, many African countries have been flooded with millions of antiquated secondhand air conditioners and refrigerators imported primarily from Europe. Nigeria and other West African countries with high summer temperatures and close proximity to European shipping ports are especially popular destinations for used cooling appliances, which arrive stuffed into containers, cargo vehicles, and even used cars. The appliances are often broken and those that still work often consume two to three times more electricity than new models. “They come in branded as new, but when they’re off-loaded it’s mostly near-end-of-life e-waste,” said Leslie Adogame, executive director of SRADev, a Nigerian nonprofit environmental health research group. “They’re certainly cheaper to buy, but they use a lot more energy and don’t meet environmental standards.” A half-dozen African countries have joined a United Nations working group, launched in April, that is trying to stop these flows, many of which are unlawful. Shipping non-working electronic equipment is illegal under both the Basel Convention, an international treaty governing hazardous waste, and the European Union’s Waste Shipment Directive. New cooling appliances being sold in Africa are not much better. Recent research by the energy efficiency nonprofit CLASP and the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development (IGSD) showed that 35 percent of new room air conditioners sold in Africa’s 10 largest countries in 2018 were low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China. A quarter of the 650,000 low-efficiency units — none of which meet common efficiency standards used in developed countries — were imported from non-African countries, primarily China. The remaining three-quarters were largely imported and then assembled in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Egypt.

“Environmentally harmful dumping is occurring in Africa,” said Gabrielle Dreyfus, senior scientist at IGSD. “These kinds of markets deprive consumers of a smarter choice by flooding markets with lower-price products that cost consumers more over time.” The report also showed that 790,000 air conditioning units sold in Africa contained obsolete ozone-depleting, greenhouse gas refrigerants known as R-22, which are being phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol. Another 820,000 units contained R-410A refrigerants, a highly potent greenhouse gas with 2,000 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide. They are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol’s Kigali Amendment, beginning in 2019 in developed countries and later this decade in developing countries. Efforts to halt these damaging trade flows have been going on for years, but most have been unsuccessful, in large part simply because more and more African consumers want affordable devices to stay cool. Ghana is a noteworthy exception. Alarmed by the millions of obsolete cooling appliances that were entering the country and the widening gap between energy demand and power production, the country banned all used air conditioner and refrigerator imports in 2008. In 2013, when the government began enforcing the ban, illegal imports plummeted. Last year, new appliances, mostly from China, made up 95 percent of the market. “We succeeded in reversing the market in favor of new appliances,” said Kofi Agyarko, director of energy efficiency and climate change at the Ghana Energy Commission, who credits tough enforcement for catalyzing the shift. While new, more efficient appliances cost two to three times as much as used ones, they consume a third as much electricity, with Ghanaians saving on average $140 a year on energy bills, Agyarko said. But even if countries can effectively ban used imports, how can they limit the flood of inefficient new appliances into Africa? Rwanda thinks it has the answer. Last year, as part of a comprehensive national cooling strategy, Rwanda enacted Africa’s toughest energy standards and energy labeling for new air conditioners and other cooling appliances. The mandatory standards, which take effect next year, are modeled after guidelines developed by the UN’s United for Efficiency program. Brian Holuj, who leads the program’s work on cooling appliances, says Rwanda’s efforts are an important breakthrough. “For the first time in Africa, Rwanda will demonstrate the impact of mandatory policies, coupled with strong energy efficiency requirements and limits on global warming-damaging coolants in new products,” he said.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, AC energy demand would be cut in half from current projections.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, air conditioning energy demand would be cut in half from current projections, according to the UN. “More than two-dozen full-sized power plants could be avoided through more efficient air conditioners and refrigerators in Africa,” Holuj said. A critical step, Holuj said, is for countries to come together regionally on consistent policies, backed by enforcement, that send a strong market signal to the industry. “The key is regional alignment,” he said, citing the EU’s success in developing common requirements and energy labeling. Dreyfus, the scientist at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, echoed this point: As long as markets for cheap products are able to flourish, high-efficiency appliances will have a hard time competing. “If a manufacturer feels they have to compete for market share by selling low-efficiency obsolete equipment, we have to close the loopholes to bring the market up so that they have the right marketplace in which to sell better products,” she said. Nigeria has tried some of the approaches Ghana and Rwanda are using, but they are not working, according to CREDC’s Uyigue. Nigeria imposed an import ban on obsolete used cooling appliances in 2010, but it is not being enforced. It adopted voluntary energy performance standards and energy labels for air conditioners in 2017, but compliance is broadly lacking. Numerous obstacles are impeding progress. The first is price — a low-performing air conditioner costs only $100 to $200. The second is trade barriers such as a 20 percent duty on imported assembled air conditioners, an important source of government revenue. The third — perhaps the biggest — is the government’s unwillingness to take the tough steps necessary to force a market shift.","Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/site/GP01QLI_High_res_Nigeria_web.jpg,"['africa', 'air', 'demand', 'climate', 'hampers', 'flood', 'conditioners', 'africas', 'efforts', 'cooling', 'used', 'units', 'appliances', 'countries', 'energy', 'polluting']", ,flood
49,49,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Nigeria: 10 Things Nigerians Should Expect in 2021 - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/202101030130.html,"The year 2020 has come and gone with its challenges which include the coronavirus pandemic, banditry, kidnapping, terrorism and several other depressing episodes, and of course some spirit-lifting events. Here, Daily Trust on Sunday gives a list of what to expect this New Year.

Increased agitation for 2023

There is likely going to be increased agitation ahead of the 2023 general elections this year, and among other issues, whether or not zoning will determine who political parties decide to make their flagbearer, for the presidency.

The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) is likely to entrench its position on the subject, as its president, Alhaji Yerima Shetima, has rejected the agitation for the zoning of the number one position. Holding the same position is Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari's nephew, who said competency and not zoning should be the consideration in electing Buhari's successor.

However, people like Alhaji Shuaib Mustapha Kano, political adviser to a former governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, are likely to remain adamant on zoning the presidency to Eastern Nigeria.

Both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have debated whether or not their parties' tickets should be zoned to the North or to the South. This debate will most likely deepen this year.

Floods still in sight

Flooding has become one of the disasters that never seems to go away, and 2020 is a typical example. It happened again despite forecasts by the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and the Hydrological Services Agency (HAS) that revealed there would be massive flooding across many states from the beginning of the year. Also, donor agencies and even private firms repeatedly warned of the impending and imminent floods. The floods came and agricultural output and property worth billions were lost. It happened in Akwa Ibom State where 100 houses were destroyed and 300 persons displaced in Eket Local Government Area (LGA) in 2020, and in Borno where hundreds of shelters in Internally Displaced People's (IDP) camps were destroyed. Thousands of people were displaced and property destroyed in several parts of the country.

A report by Relief Web posted on October 19, 2020, indicated that flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara states, among others, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas.

In Kebbi State were a massive flood ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5bn and rendered people homeless, the Director of Flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umaisha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.

This is an example of promises Nigerians continue to get and there is no certainty that this will not happen again.

COVID-19 vaccine for 20m people

The Federal Government is making efforts to procure 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 to check the spread of the virus. Everything being equal, this means less than a quarter of Nigeria's over 200 million population may be vaccinated. Nigeria's Health Minister, Osagie Ehanire, who said this at a press conference in December, 2020, pointed out that health sector employees would be vaccinated first, then the vulnerable and those with chronic illnesses.

So far, Nigeria has recorded not less than 70,500 COVID-19 cases with 1,184 fatalities, and more than 65,000 patients have recovered from the disease. As of January 1, 2021, 1074 new confirmed cases and deaths were recorded. Therefore, there is a high possibility of another lockdown in 2021 to curtail the spread of the virus across states, but whether this would have a positive impact is left to be seen because there are arguably more Nigerians in slums and ghettos where families share toilet facilities and other basic amenities, and then there is the danger of a rise in criminality and rape as was the case in 2020.

Budget increase impact

President Muhammadu Buhari recently signed into law the 2021 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly. The National Assembly had on December 21, 2020, passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill with an aggregate expenditure of N13,588,027,886,175 trillion.

It comprises total Capital Supplementation of N1,060,751,051,650 and total Capital Expenditure of N4,125,149,354,222. Statutory Transfer stands at N496,528,471,273; Rrecurrent Expenditure of N5,641,970,060,680 with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 3.00 per cent.

The National Assembly also provided N3,324,380,000tn for debt servicing which would obviously serve as a drain on the country's finances.

The legislators had increased the budget estimate by N505,607,317,942 from the estimate of N13,082,420,568,233 presented to the joint sitting of the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 8, 2020. This means Nigeria would have more money to pump into vital sectors of the economy like healthcare, education and security.

Insecurity still looms

The abduction of over 300 schoolboys by gunmen in an all-boys Government Science School in Kankara, Katsina State, is probably one of the biggest highlights of insecurity in 2020. Even though the boys have been released, the incident still raises questions about Nigeria's dwindling security. Kidnappings continue to happen on the Kaduna-Abuja road, Lokoja-Abuja Expressway, the Obajana-Okene axis in Kogi State, among others. In the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, Kuje Area Council has recorded several cases of people being abducted, particularly in their homes. Terrorism in the North East and banditry in Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna states, among others, is yet to stop and there is no clear sign that 2021 is going to be different. Nigeria still has the same security chiefs from 2020 and the cost of goods and services are still on the rise.

Stiffer laws against rape, gender-based violence

In June, 2020, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, said Nigeria recorded 717 rape incidents between January and May of the same year. This was before the lockdown due to COVID-19 which saw a spike in rape cases and gender-based violence. Some states have since taken steps to tackle the issue. One of such is Kaduna, where Governor Nasir el-Rufai signed into law the amended Penal Code Law 2020 that provides for stiff penalties for rape of a child, including death, surgical castration for male convicts, and bilateral salpingectomy for female rapists.

Also, in 2019 Nigeria launched a sex offenders' register as a vital step towards tackling reported cases of sexual abuse. With these steps, there is hope for the fight against rape and gender-based violence this year as many Nigerians, especially Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), continue to call for stiffer laws.

Possible food shortage

As the activities of the terrorist group Boko Haram continue, including that of bandits and kidnappers who have been reported to have whisked or attacked people from their farms, there is a possible food shortage in sight, especially in Northern Nigeria. In addition is the effect of the 2020 flood that destroyed many farms across the country.

The year 2021 promises to be eventful with the release of movies like the musical drama 'Dreamers' written by Michael Castiel and scheduled for release on January 31; 'Mamba's Diamond' directed by Seyi Babatope, written by Darlington Abuda and starring actors like Osas Ighodaro, Uchembe Williams and Nse Ikpe-Etim set for March 19; 'Retribution' which is still in development; 'Willie-Willie' also in the development stage, among others.

Music

Meanwhile, nominations for the 63rd annual Grammy Awards were recently announced with Nigeria's Burna Boy (for his recent album 'Twice as Tall') and Wizkid on the list for the 2021 awards by the Recording Academy. Burna Boy was nominated under the World Music Album while Wizkid for his feature in Beyonce's Brownskin Girl song.

Books! Books!! Books!!!

This year TJ Benson's debut novel 'Madhouse' is set for release. Also, 'The Days of Silence' by Angel Patricks Amegbe; 'What Happened to Janet Uzor' by Miracle Emeka-Nkwor and Onyeka Nwelue's 'The Strangers of Braamfontein', to mention a few.

Festivals

As always there are a number of festivals to look forward to this year. There is the Lagos Carnival held during the Lagos Black Heritage Festival, Afan National Festival, Argungu Fishing Festival, Atyap Annual Cultural Festival and several more.

Most book and art festivals come towards year-end such as the Ake Arts and Book Festival, Lagos Book and Art Festival (LABAF), Benue Books and Art Festival and the Abuja Literary and Arts Festival (ALITFEST).

• Short - range forecasts up to 31 th October, marking the end of the season shows continued favorable seasonal conditions in most of the region except some localized pockets of moderate dryness. It is thus likely that the rainy season will be abnormally late particularly in the Sahel region.

• Early October, the end of the rainy season in the Sahel, West Africa has been characterized by mostly adequate and well-distributed rains: this results in average to above-average seasonal rainfall The Sahel region benefited the most from very good conditions with well above-average seasonal rains, while belowaverage rainfall spread over the southernmost part of the region across the Gulf of Guinea. The cumulative heavy rainfall recorded from mid-August to September resulted in flooding, that have affected about 760,000 people in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal with at least 111 fatalities.

• As a result of increase in rainfall since late July and wetter conditions in August and September: a pattern of strongly above-average vegetation emerged during September and October in all of the Sahel. Agricultural areas benefitted from very good seasonal conditions. Good production prospects are certain this year in the region (in biomass and crops production). As a result of good seasonal performance in mid-October water resources remain at a good level. Overall they have reached their highest level throughout the West African region.

• Across the Sahel, harvest has started for main season millet and sorghum crops in southern Mali, Burkina Faso, southern Niger, and eastern Senegal. Meanwhile favourable harvesting of main season crops reached completion in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, southern Ghana, southern Togo, Benin, and central Cameroon, while crops are still developing in Guinea, northern Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, and northern Nigeria under generally favourable conditions. Despite localized floods impacting the Sahel and drier-than-average conditions along the Gulf of Guinea countries, overall conditions are favourable except in conflict-affected northern Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, and northeast Nigeria along with the conflict and floodaffected Far North region of Cameroon.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540757-WFP-0000120139.png?itok=iitFCIc-,"['crops', 'monitor', 'situation', 'seasonal', 'region', '2020', 'west', 'season', 'floods', 'conditions', 'update', 'good', 'mali', 'southern', 'rainfall', 'sahel', 'africa', 'cameroon']", ,flood

Despite this success, the firm is also “confronted by growing support for activists’ demands to set more ambitious targets”, the newspaper adds. It notes that a separate resolution by Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This calling for Shell to set more “inspirational” targets attracted the support of 30% of shareholders, although such resolutions require 75% to pass. According to the Times, Follow This “insists that Shell’s goals are not consistent with achieving the Paris climate accord, in part because it lacks near-term targets for absolute emissions reductions”. The Guardian notes that this “significant shareholder rebellion” came on the day that the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its net-zero pathway, in which all exploration for new oil and gas fields stops this year to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It quotes Charlie Kronick, a senior climate finance adviser for Greenpeace UK, who notes that Shell’s plans would increase gas production by 20% by 2030, “contravening the advice of the IEA”. Reuters states that, under its current plans, Shell intends to increase its investment in low-carbon energy sources in the coming years, “but at least 75% of its spending will continue to go towards oil and gas”. In Bloomberg’s coverage, it says that the oil giant also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its “spill-prone operations in Nigeria”.

Meanwhile, another Guardian story reports that, in Australia, politicians and companies are being urged by campaigners to abandon plans for new coal power, gas and oil investments in light of the new IEA report. In Europe, Politico reports that the landmark report is “giving Brussels new ammunition in its war on fossil fuels”, as its conclusions support the European Commission’s efforts to discontinue EU funding for oil and gas projects. According to EurActiv, environmentalists have “warned against some of the assumptions in the scenario” developed by the IEA, notably the growing shares of biomass used for energy. The piece adds that IEA modellers have explained that their scenario assumes no overall increase in cropland use for bioenergy production, or new bioenergy crops on forested land. The Guardian reports on comments from the UK climate champion, Nigel Topping, who says he is “stubbornly optimistic” that the world will arrive at an agreement to “forge a transition to a net-zero future” at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year. (For more on the IEA’s latest report, see Carbon Brief‘s coverage.)

52,52,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Conflicting reports emerge in Nigeria over video of downed plane - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/03/conflicting-reports-emerge-in-nigeria-over-video-of-downed-plane/,"National-World

Conflicting reports have emerged in Nigeria over a video of a downed plane, after the country’s air force disputed claims from Boko Haram that its militants shot down a jet.

The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) strongly questioned the authenticity of the Boko Haram clip which purports to show fighters shooting at the military plane, eventually causing it to fall to the ground.

The NAF suggested that the crash was due to an air accident.

The video was published by the SITE Intelligence Group and is circulating across Nigerian media.

“It is evident that most parts of the video were deliberately doctored to give the false impression that the aircraft was shot down” when it was “obviously an air accident,” the NAF said in a statement posted on Facebook Friday.

The NAF rejected the seven-and-a-half-minute edited clip, calling it “false propaganda” and urging Nigerians “to ignore the contents of the videos making the rounds until all investigations as to how the aircraft crashed are completed.”

The NAF reported the plane missing on Wednesday, with two pilots on board.

A spokesperson told CNN Thursday afternoon the fighter jet had been deployed near Borno State in northeastern Nigeria to provide air support to ground troops, who were under fire from Boko Haram fighters before radar contact was lost.

“The cause of the crash as well as the whereabouts of the 2 pilots remain unknown. The pilots are Flight Lieutenant John Abolarinwa and Flight Lieutenant Ebiakpo Chapele,” the NAF said earlier Friday.

In the disputed video Boko Haram claims to have shot down the Alpha Jet.

The footage shows multiple fighters shooting into the air before a blast lights up the sky as a plane ignites into flames and falls to the ground. The video then cuts to fighters standing around what appears to be the wreckage of the jet.

It then cuts to the plane, showing “NAF 475” — the missing aircraft’s ID number. It later shows a charred body.

Separately the video then shows what appears to be a patch laying on the ground, displaying John Abolarinwa’s name.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Boko Haram has increased attacks against the Nigerian military as it tries to regain control of lost territories in pockets of the country’s northeast.

Frequent air raids by the Nigerian military have continued to rattle the insurgents — dislodging them from their hideouts.","Sat, 03 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['air', 'video', 'plane', 'conflicting', 'reports', 'boko', 'haram', 'emerge', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'shot', 'naf', 'fighters', 'downed', 'shows']", ,flood
53,53,FL-2019-000122-NGA,"Nigeria: Dozens Killed, Houses Destroyed As Floods Ravage North-Central Nigeria - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009250681.html,"Torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks wreaked havoc in the North-central sub-region of Nigeria.

State governments in the North-central region of Nigeria are employing measures to halt the perennial flooding ravaging parts of the zone and alleviate the sufferings of the victims.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks claimed many lives, destroyed hundreds of houses and washed away farmlands and domestic animals in the sub-region.

The catastrophe compelled the governments in the zone to take steps to avert further flooding and provide succour to the affected people such as temporary shelters, food and medicines.

In Nasarawa State, Governor Abdullahi Sule ordered the immediate evacuation of persons whose houses had been submerged by flood in Nasarawa, headquarters of Nasarawa Local Government Area.

Mr Sule also directed that foodstuff, mattresses and other relief items be provided to the victims immediately.

His spokesperson, Ibrahim Addra, said the governor had visited the ancient town and sympathised with the people over the incident.

He urged the people to desist from erecting structures on waterways and stop indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the drains.

In response to the governor's directive, the Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) distributed food and non-food relief materials to over 45 communities ravaged by flood in Awe and Nasarawa local government areas of the state.

The Executive Secretary of the agency, Zakari Allumagas, said the governor gave the order during his visit to Nasarawa following the flood in the town.

Mr Allumagas said the relief materials comprised 44 trucks of 600 bags each of assorted grains and three trucks of non-food items such as building materials, children's clothing, cooking utensils and mats.

He warned against diversion of the items.

He also disclosed that over 700 households were displaced by floods in such communities as Ara, Udenyi Magaji, Ugya and Gude, Nasarawa town in Nasarawa Local Government Area, and Ribi and Gidan Soja in Awe Local Government Area.

The executive secretary said the state government was working with traditional and community leaders to come up with a directive banning approval and sale of lands near riverine areas of the state.

In Kogi, the State Commissioner for Environment, Victor Omofaiye, said many communities in some local government areas in the state had been ravaged by floods.

Mr Omofaiye said such communities included places in Kotonkarfe, Lokoja, Ajaokuta and Ibaji local government areas.

He said some victims of the disaster had already been moved to IDPs camps in Kotonkarfe, while the IDPs camps and flood estates in Lokoja were being prepared through clearing of their surroundings and fumigation for resettlement of the flood victims.

He said that the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had predicted that in 2020, about 10 local government areas would be affected by flood in Kogi.

They are Lokoja, Kogi/Kotonkarfe, Ajaokuta, Bassa, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela, Ofu, Adavi and Omala.

""The water level of River Niger is still fluctuating within the range of 10.5 to 10.7, but as at September 21, it was 10.7 compared to the 12.5 as at the same period in 2012 in Kogi.

""Flood is a menace that we experience in Kogi every year. The flood we experienced in Kogi in 2012 was massive and devastating; we do not pray for such in 2020, but we are actually on red alert,"" the commissioner said.

He attributed flooding in the state to human and natural factors.

According to him, the human factor has to do with the people's habit in managing the environment as they dump refuse on waterways and drains, thereby obstructing free flow of water.

Mr Omofaiye said that the confluence of two major rivers in Kogi: River Niger and Benue, which most times overflowed their banks, was affecting communities along the river paths, including those of other small rivers that took their sources from river Niger and Benue.

""Opening of dams, especially along River Niger, such as Lagdo Dam from Cameroon and other dams also cause flooding in Kogi due to high volume of water.

""We have done a lot of sensitisation and awareness creation to educate the general public, especially the people living in the flood prone areas in all the predicted local government areas.

""We are also partnering with the relevant stakeholders including SEMA to ensure that we are ahead of any emerging situation,"" he said.

He said he had led a team on assessment tour of some affected communities in Lokoja to ascertain the level of damage done by flood in the area and begin to tackle them head on.

The commissioner said the Governor Yahaya Bello administration would not relent in its efforts at tackling environmental challenges including flooding across the state.

He, therefore, advised the people living in the flood prone areas to relocate and move to high grounds in order not to endanger their lives as a result of floods.

The situation is similar in Plateau as the acting Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Rose Dakwar, said that floods had affected seven local government areas in the state recently.

Mrs Dakwar listed the affected local government areas as Mangu, Pankshin, Shendam, Quan Pan, Langtang South, Mikang and Wase.

She said that many farmlands, houses bridges and other valuables were destroyed by the floods in the listed areas.

""We as an emergency management agency, have already visited each of the affected local government areas in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).

""We visited and ascertained the level of damage and reported back to government.

""Government has, therefore, included the affected areas in the distribution of palliatives before the major assistance will come their way,"" she said.

Also, the NEMA Zonal Coordinator in Jos, Eugene Nyenlong, said the agency had composed jingles in local languages to educate the people on how to tackle floods if they occurred.

Mr Nyenlong also disclosed that the agency in the zone was making use of Flood Vanguards comprising youth corps members who raised alarms if flood occurred.

""We also have locals that are engaged to act in terms of response and evacuation when flood occurs,"" he said.

In Niger, not less than 500 communities have been flooded since the onset of the 2020 raining season in the state.

The Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Ahmed Inga, who disclosed this also said about 22 local government areas had so far been affected by the floods.

Mr Inga said 29 deaths were recorded during the floods, while 45,000 farmers were directly affected by the disaster.

""Farmlands and houses have been destroyed and assessment is still ongoing, "" he said.

He said Governor Abubakar Bello had directed the agency to look inward and design a better way of mitigating the situation by relocating the affected communities to safe areas.

The Governor of Niger-State, Abubakar Sani Bello [PHOTO CREDIT: Official Twitter handle of Mr Bello || @abusbello]He said that the state government had identified 13 resettlement sites in Muregi, Akere and Ketso, among others, where the affected communities were being resettled.

He said that compensations had been paid and allocation of plots to the affected communities would soon commence.

The director-general blamed the flooding partly on the situation where the state was home to three hydro-electric dams- Shiroro, Kainji and Jebba, and River Niger and River Kaduna flowing across parts of the state.

Similarly, the Benue Government has assured residents of flood prone areas of its plans to tackle the incessant flooding in communities in the state.

The State Director of Environment, Richarge Azaagee, who disclosed this, said plans were underway to address some of the flooding challenges, especially in Makurdi.

Mr Azaagee denied that the government had abandoned communities suffering from flood related challenges.

He said the government had already identified the causes of flooding in some communities/settlements and was working toward fixing them.

""The problem of erosion and flood is not just in Kaamem community alone, it cuts across many communities in Makurdi and the state at large.

In 2020, Nigeria has dealt with destructive floods that have killed at least 40 and have displaced over 15,000 people. Recently, in September of 2020, intense flooding caused by heavy rainfall in northern Nigeria destroyed thousands of homes and wide areas of crops. As reported by Reuters, the flooding in northern Nigeria has destroyed 90% of the 2 million tons of rice that was expected to be harvested this Autumn. This loss is equivalent to 20% of the rice that Nigeria harvested last year.

Destruction of rice paddies is not the only food-related casualty of these floods. A shortage of maize has made it extremely difficult for chicken farmers to feed their flocks due to the price of chicken feed more than doubling. For Nigeria, rice is the staple grain, and chicken is a core protein. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many movement restrictions and financing difficulties that complicated the spring planting of many crops including maize. The combination of crop-destroying floods and an already existent maize shortage makes it look as if Nigeria is on the brink of a damaging food crisis. Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, told Reuters that “there is a real fear of having food shortages. The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Another effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is on fertilizer. After the virus’s outbreak caused a shutdown of Nigeria’s sole urea plant for two weeks, many farmers opted to skip using fertilizer on their crops, which has limited their crop yields.

Through all of this, the Nigerian government is still doing everything it can to promote domestic food production and local Nigerian farmers, but that may not be enough to sustain a country of nearly 200 million people through a looming food crisis. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that not one cent of the country’s central bank dollars would go towards food or fertilizer imports in an attempt to encourage local farmers and producers over imports. In August 2020, Nigeria took about 4,000 tons of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s strategic stocks (ECOWAS), released 30,000 tons of its own maize, and gave four companies special permission to import maize into the country, according to Reuters. The Nigerian Economic Summit Group has also called for “a complete overhaul” of agricultural policy.

In an interview with Reuters, Nigeria’s Agriculture Minister Muhammad Sabo Nanono said that “there is no question about it that there is an imminent problem with food insecurity, not only in Nigeria, but also in nations all over the world.” He is absolutely correct in that statement. According to a report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) called the Ecological Threat Register (ETR), food security is a major symptom of the ongoing climate crisis that is projected to worsen over the next several decades. By the ETR’s estimates, the global demand for food will increase by 50% by 2050. Approximately two billion people already experience moderate to severe food insecurity currently, and that number is expected to increase to 3.5 billion people by the year 2050. 822 million people currently experience undernutrition globally, leaving them at an extremely high risk of starvation. Additionally, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of food insecurity, at 52% of the population, and 18 of the 20 most food-insecure countries globally are located in the region.

What is happening in Nigeria should sound an alarm for the rest of the world. If the world continues on this trajectory, the climate crisis will only escalate in the coming years and decades. With that will come an increase in natural disasters, with flooding being the most common natural disaster to occur since 1990, according to the ETR. Flooding not only threatens people’s lives and property, but it also threatens the survival and harvestability of important crops, as seen with the current situation in Nigeria. Floods are also not the only natural disasters that will worsen with climate change, but wildfires and storm events like hurricanes will become more frequent and more damaging as well. All of these have the potential to threaten the food security of nations all over the globe. The ETR reports that 22% of countries will face catastrophic food insecurity by the year 2050, which would result in “substantial displacement of people or substantial increase in undernourishment.” That statistic shows that a food crisis like this will not be an event unique to Nigeria but could potentially threaten many other countries across the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst in worsening food security for countries around the globe. The United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) has warned that the number of people facing food insecurity could potentially double by the end of the pandemic. According to the Pullitzer Center, global shutdowns and border closures to curb the virus have caused tightened credit access to farmers, limited access to inputs for farmers, limited food transport services and food imports. Constraints like these have led to surges in food prices and limited many populations’ access to nutritious food. The effects of this can be seen in what is happening in Nigeria, and it has worsened food shortages that the country was already experiencing pre-pandemic.

The other countries of the world who have the means should take this opportunity to send humanitarian aid to Nigeria during this time in order to offset or prevent the looming food crisis. It would also be in the interest of the U.N. and other peacekeeping or human rights focused international organizations to aid Nigeria in any way that is possible so that the situation does not worsen into a debilitating crisis that could threaten millions of lives. The situation in Nigeria is of utmost urgency, so it is important that the international community acts with haste.

Furthermore, in order to take action towards preventing devastating food crises and worsening natural disasters in the future, the most important steps that nations can take is implementing aggressive climate change policies that curb emissions and aim to use cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy. This is especially true for countries who are the world’s biggest emitters and polluters, including but not limited to the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Combatting climate change will require an immense collective effort and continued inaction will only lead to more human suffering in places like Nigeria where people are already seeing the harsh effects of the climate crisis.

The impending food crisis in Nigeria is demonstrative of many issues that the world is facing. Swift action should be taken not only to aid Nigeria in combatting a destructive food crisis, but in the long run, all nations of the world should be putting progressive climate policies into effect. Growing food insecurity is a major symptom of a worsening climate, and the action should be taken now to ensure global food insecurity does not reach frightening levels in the future.","Sat, 19 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,"['farmers', 'climate', 'world', 'food', 'threaten', 'floods', 'push', 'crisis', 'nations', 'nigeria', 'insecurity', 'maize', 'countries', 'shortages']", ,none

In September 2018, heavy rains were experienced in Nigeria which caused severe flooding in 129 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of 12 States which affected 2,321,592 people, based on the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) situation report. An estimated 722,741 people were internally displaced, and 351,236 people had immediate humanitarian needs in food; shelter; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and health.

On 17 September, the NEMA declared a state of emergency in four of the worst-affected states (Niger, Kogi, Anambra and Delta), where thousands of communities had been forced to evacuate from submerged settlements and seek refuge in temporary Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps. As the Niger River continued to flow above danger level, and additional dams were released, a state of emergency also was declared in five more states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Taraba, Kebbi and Adamawa) on 11 October 2018. The flooding situation exceeded thresholds of local capacity to respond to the people in need.

The floods resulted in rapid population displacement, destruction of shelters, extensive losses to livelihoods and the local economy, in addition to high rates of water-borne diseases among the affected population and their host communities. Internally Displaced Persons staying with host communities were particularly susceptible to cholera and other water-borne diseases due to the poor access to potable water, hygiene infrastructure and medical care in those locations. These challenges also impacted displaced people in IDP camps, who similarly lacked access to basic water and sanitation services.

Upon the request of Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), IFRC launched an Emergency Appeal in October 2018 for 5.4 million Swiss francs to support 300,000 flood-affected people in the areas of focus of shelter and non-food items, livelihoods and basic needs; health; WASH; and protection, gender and inclusion (PGI) for 9 months. The objective was to provide lifesaving and recovery interventions in 6 out of the over 18 states in Nigeria affected by flooding. The intervention focused on 6 states identified during the multi-sector needs assessment as those in most need of assistance, namely Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Niger, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The initial plan was to have the affected population supported in an IDP camp setup (schools and health facilities).

However, the flood-affected population moved out of the camps earlier than expected. The government also aimed to vacate the schools that were used to host the IDPs to be vacated to avoid the disruption of the resuming of classes in January 2019. As a result, these changes affected the geographical context of the operation as the flood-affected population dispersed to different Local Government Areas (LGAs) and villages.

The operation had to strategize to ensure planned activities were to be held in their current location. Even though all affected families returned to their communities after the acute phase, the flooding resulted in long-term impacts, including a cholera outbreak in December when IDPs returned to their communities. The devastating loss to livelihoods and trauma of displacement also created psychosocial needs within the affected population.","Mon, 06 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1493663-MDRNG025eafr.png?itok=KHVy4p40,"['states', 'communities', 'n', 'nigeria', 'plan', 'needs', 'report', 'local', 'flood', 'population', 'emergency', 'mdrng025', 'water', 'flooding', 'final', 'displaced', 'response', 'appeal', 'affected']", ,flood

ABUJA, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Death toll has risen to 18 due to the floods caused by persistent rainfall in central Nigeria, said a local official on Wednesday.

Confirming the figure to reporters, Ibrahim Inga, head of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency in Nigeria's central region, said eight more deaths were recorded recently.

On October 16, Inga had earlier confirmed 10 deaths recorded over the past two months as the floods wreaked havoc in the state.

So far, 41,959 people have been displaced due to the disaster, the official said.

The floods, as a result of a localized high-intensity rainfall accompanied by torrential winds since August, also triggered massive run-off activities in streams and rivers in the state.

""The combined effect of the micro-climate trend and severe rainfall regime upstream of rivers Niger and Kaduna increased inflow in the basin, which resulted in the spillage of the water from the three hydropower dams,"" Inga told reporters.

He said 2,714 houses have been destroyed so far by the disaster. The flood swept through 20 local government areas, with 152 communities submerged.

The floods also badly damaged, roads, bridges, culverts and other buildings, the official said.

Inga said the excess waters had inundated several hectares of farmlands and displaced some dwellers in hinterland communities.

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, which is responsible for issuing flood alerts here, had since early August issued an alert over possible flooding due to the high intensity of rainfall across the country.

The hydrological body said the flooding incidents are due to high rainfall intensity of long duration, rainstorms, blockage of drainage systems and poor urban planning resulting from the erection of structures within the floodplains and waterways.

This year, Nigeria's 36 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja, would witness different levels of flooding, the hydrological body predicted.","Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['official', 'death', 'roundup', 'nigerias', 'recorded', 'xinhua', 'rises', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'flood', 'central', 'hydrological', 'disaster', 'inga', 'flooding', '18', 'floods', 'toll', 'rivers']", ,flood

59,59,FL-2019-000122-NGA,The new 'jollof wars' and why Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria for its first Africa base - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/14/the-new-jollof-wars-and-why-twitter-chose-ghana-over-nigeria-for-its-first-africa-base/,"National-World

Twitter’s announcement Monday that it will set up its first Africa base in Ghana, West Africa, has generated fierce debate among Nigerian users of the social media app, and reignited the never-ending rivalry between the two countries, known colloquially as the ‘jollof wars.’

Many Nigerians believe that Twitter’s decision is a snub to the continent’s largest economy, which is seeing rapid growth and investment in its tech scene.

According to NOI polls, 39.6 million Nigerians have a Twitter account, which is more than the entire 32 million population of Ghana.

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey capped a whirlwind tour of Africa in 2019 by pledging to move to the continent for several months in 2020.

Now it seems that his business will make that move first.

In a statement announcing the decision, Twitter described Ghana “as a champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet.”

The social media giant also cited Ghana’s hosting of the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) as another reason for moving there, saying it aligns with “its ambition to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa.”

Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said “the choice of Ghana as headquarters for Twitter’s Africa operations is EXCELLENT news,” and described it as a “beautiful partnership between Ghana and Twitter and which is critical for the dev’t of Ghana’s hugely important tech sector.”

‘No ease of doing business’

Some Nigerians blamed an “inconducive business environment” for Twitter choosing Ghana over Nigeria.

“Under @MBuhari our ease of doing business is so bad that it’s easier for terrorists to get phone lines than law-abiding residents. You can land at Ghana’s Kotoka Airport and get a SIM card at the airport. But a camel has to pass through the eye of a needle to get one in Nigeria,” said Reno Omokri via Twitter, a former presidential aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan.

Omokri was referring to the suspension of new phone lines registration because of a federal government policy to link all active SIM cards in the country to a national identity number (NIN) for security reasons.

The exercise is time consuming and the deadline has been extended multiple times, leaving new arrivals unable to obtain a local number, until at least May.

Another Twitter user, lawyer Moe Odele wrote: “One of our clients wanted to open shop in Nigeria for their West Africa office. Once we sent them a breakdown of the regulatory requirements for their industry (also tech), they hit us with ‘we will get back to you.’ We haven’t heard back since then.”

Another commenter, Onye Ajuju, said Twitter’s decision was justified and that Nigerians had a “bloated sense of entitlement.”

“It’s unbelievable seeing Nigerians throwing a tantrum because Twitter went to Ghana. The lack of awareness of how bad things are in the country, the bloated sense of entitlement, the unhinged expectations that everyone should accept Nigeria’s dysfunction…it’s incredible!” she said.

In 2019, Ghana ranked 13 places higher than Nigeria in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index.

Google,Microsoft and Huawei are among international tech giants that have expanded their operations in Ghana, targeting software developers and young creatives on the continent.

In 2018, Facebook opened its first community hub space in Africa in Nigeria’s commercial city, Lagos, while announcing plans last year to open an operational office also in Lagos, but for tech investors such as Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, there are lessons to be learned if Nigeria will continue to attract much-needed foreign investment.

“We have to think carefully about the reasons why Twitter chose Ghana — not necessarily in the context of whether we want to bring Twitter to Nigeria or not, but in the context of what it will take for us to remain a competitive destination for investors,” Aboyeji told CNN on Tuesday.

“We need to start thinking very carefully about enhancing democracy and the rule of law, freedom of speech, and most importantly, our role in enabling the Africa Free Trade Agreement. It’s not enough for us to just be a big market… We have next door to us, a very competitive neighbor, who’s doing all the right things to make itself the hub of West Africa,” he added.

‘A more productive market’

Another Nigerian tech entrepreneur and investor Bosun Tijani, told CNN that Twitter simply chose a more productive market to run its Africa operations.

“While Nigeria has a huge market that Twitter would love to target, the business environment here is quite demanding… It’s strenuous…the cost of running a business here is high. But with the AfCFTA single market agreement which Africa is signed up to, a company like Twitter can choose to set up shop in a small market like Ghana — that gives the best opportunity for it to operate — and still serve the Nigerian market,” said Tijani, who heads a tech innovation lab, CcHUB.

From tourism to tech, Ghana has been actively courting investors from the diaspora and in particular African-Americans, some of whom were given citizenship and encouraged to return to their roots.

Ghana also ranked as the 43rd most peaceful country in the world, in the 2020 Global Peace Index, placing 104 spots ahead of Nigeria — which grapples with Boko Haram insurgency and periodic outbreaks of violence.","Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['tech', 'market', 'twitter', 'chose', 'nigerians', 'doing', 'west', 'jollof', 'ghana', 'wars', 'nigeria', 'base', 'business', 'africa']", ,flood

Nigeria is approaching the peak of its rainy season, and flooding is expected to hit 15 out of its 36 states this month. The agency has issued a red alert because of above-normal water levels on the country's two largest rivers, the Benue and the Niger.

In August, many communities along the rivers were cut off due to collapsed bridges and impassable roads. Four students were killed when a pedestrian bridge fell at a university in the northern region.

FILE - Houses partially submerged in flood waters are pictured in Lokoja city, Kogi State, Nigeria, Sept. 17, 2018.

With thousands of houses and hectares of farmland and produce destroyed along with schools and shops, the economic impact of this year'sflooding is expected to be high. The country's emergency management agency is stepping in to distribute items like cement bags, blankets and hygiene products.

Peter Odjugo, a professor of geography at Nigeria's University of Benin, works with the Nigerian Meteorological Society. He has been tracking the extreme weather patterns and says the government has repeatedly failed to take preemptive measures to reduce the impact of flooding.

""What they prefer doing or what they are doing now is services after the impact, rather than preventing it from occurring,"" he said.

Odjugo suggests that the silt be removed from the rivers to increase the volume of water they can hold. He also recommends that town planners enforce regulation on where buildings are constructed, saying this is a glaring weak spot across the country.

City regulators look out for buildings being constructed near waterways. Such buildings are often marked with an X, designating an order to stop construction work.

Stella Ojeme, the director for information in the Federal Capital Territory Administration, says that even in the nation's capital ofAbuja, enforcing building codes is a challenge.

""Most of our people will go, buy white paint, paint off the stop work mark,"" she said. ""First of all, you find people [building] where they shouldn't build. You find people build on flood plains. You find some people dump their refuse in the gutter.""

Odjugo says climate change is making a real impact in Nigeria, but the government has not made the issue a priority.

Additional challenges

Additionally, the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency says its weather data collection equipment is being vandalized and stolen.

Clement Eze, the agency's director general, spoke at a workshop last month, asking the public to help stop the illegal activity, as it is hindering the agency's ability to forecast extreme weather.

""We can no longer take readings, maybe accumulated or about a week or two,"" he said. ""Or if there are no resources, it can even take more than six months before we can go back and replenish or repair and this equipment is imported from outside Nigeria.""

During Nigeria's worst flooding in 2012, the Niger River reached a record high level of 12.84 meters. Two million Nigerians were forced from their homes and 363 people were killed, according to the National Emergency Management Agency.","Thu, 05 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-09/RTX6J5VG.jpg,"['floodravaged', 'flooding', 'month', 'stop', 'unprepared', 'buildings', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'nigerian', 'rains', 'communities', 'impact', 'services', 'rivers', 'weather']", ,flood

…Urges residents in coastal areas to relocate, predicts 261 days of rainfall

By Olasunkanmi Akoni

Lagos State Government, yesterday, predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with attendant flooding across the state, even as it directed residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas of the state to move upland to avert needless loss of lives and property.

Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, accompanied by Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, said this at a media briefing on the 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions, and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja.

Bello said: “The forecast for 2021 is based on the informed global consensus that el-Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, is at the cool phase, which will continue till around June and likely give to a dominant el-Nino phase till the end of 2021.

“Generally, the Seasonal Climate Prediction for Lagos State signifies that on-set dates ranged between March 17 in the earliest, and April 6, while the season-ending may range between November 20 and December 5, 2021.

READ ALSO:

“The connotation is that Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while the maximum annual rainfall amount is predicted to be 1,747mm.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Besides, he said the state government is collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NiMET, in downscaling the predictions to all stakeholders.

Also speaking, Mr. Igbokwe, stated that the government planned to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72kilometres spread across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state to checkmate flooding.

“I, therefore, urge residents to support the government to achieve a flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again been littered by residents,” Igbokwe said.

Meteorologist Luke Robinson said there could be significant rain in some areas around west central Montana.

“We are looking at some rain moving into the area starting mid week to the end of the week,” said Robinson. “This week we are looking at some pretty good soaking rains, particularly in southwest Montana and west central Montana. We will see the rivers and streams rising but right now we're not really anticipating any impacts from it.”

Robinson said the cold front will bring accompanying snow to the higher mountain areas.

“This system is moving in, it's going to be relatively cold, so we're actually looking at some accumulating snow in the mountains,” he said. “Those cooler temperatures will cut off all the hot mountain snow melt that we've had the past few days and most of the rise in the rivers and streams will be coming from mid to low level moisture coming into the area.”

Robinson said people who live in areas that usually flood in the spring may be nervous to see the river levels rising.

It could be more of just a nervous thing, right now,” he said. “We're looking at the cresting below flood stage, and that will be sometime Thursday or Friday. But right now we're not expecting any flooding at this at this point.”

By Joseph Erunke

THE Executive Director, Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE, Dr. Ganiyu Agbaje, Tuesday, said Nigeria has improved on its possession of requisite equipment’s to better forecast flood, thereby mitigating the effects.

To this end, he expressed optimism that the negative socioeconomic impacts of flooding in the country would henceforth be mitigated through effective and accurate forecast.

Agbaje, speaking at the opening ceremony of Online Regional Training on Flood Monitoring and Forecasting Modelling, in Abuja, insisted that with the latest technology in the country, it will henceforth be easier to predict flood and locate the people who are really affected, a development he noted, would make the country make informed decision to reduce the disaster associated with the flood.

But he tasked experts on accuracy in their forecast using satellite technology, saying such was necessary in order to monitor flood as well as identify its hotspot areas with a view to making a quick damage assessment.

He spoke as Nigeria joined other West African nations to adopt satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

He explained that the training was held to equip participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-hotspot areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse which is a major cause of flooding in Africa.

Hear him:“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction but more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower in Nigeria and other countries.”

According to him, the training was not to teach participants how to predict but to show them how to use additional satellite data to do their prediction better and support other methods.

He said that the technology has been on for a while around the world, adding that African leaders in collaboration with the EU initiated the training to help Africa better monitor the environment and mitigate disasters.

Agbaje said that with the data, rainfall, rivers and the environment will be better monitored, adding that in the case of Nigeria, more information on the activities of River Niger will be known using the technology.

“We need to support our rural communities on how best use flood when it occurs because at times if it coming far away from this country, you can harness the water overflowing for many other things in agriculture. In raining season, you can channel it for irrigation.

“We are feeling the economic impact of this disaster. We are looking at riverine flooding. You know our people settle along the rivers. And they have their livelihoods there; they are farmers and can’t come to towns,” he added.

The three-day training, which holds simultaneously in four other West African countries, was backed by the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) under its Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) initiative.

It was conducted by the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE.

Also speaking at the event, the GMES & Africa Programme Coordinator at the African Union Commission, Dr. Tidiane Ouattara, who joined via video conferencing, expressed joy that the activities of the CSSTE consortium was able to continue despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Emphasising the need for the constant training of young people and experts on the African continent, he described the training as a major achievement that would help Africa to build infrastructure and reduce the economic damage of flooding.

Participants at the workshop were drawn from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

In their separate goodwill messages, representatives of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said the training is aimed at building the capacity of stakeholders to better utilise satellite technology in providing accurate, timely and easily assessable information to improve the management of the environment.

FLOODS

Heavy rains have been recorded in West and Central Africa in the past weeks, including in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Senegal, leading to devastating floods that have killed dozens and displaced thousands of people. In Niger, 329,958 people had been affected by flooding with 65 deaths. About 31,960 houses have collapsed and 5,768 hectares of farmland destroyed. Maradi, Dosso, Tahoua and Niamey are the most affected regions. In 2019, at the same time, 35,384 people were affected across the country.

In northern Nigeria, thousands of homes and wide areas of crops have been destroyed in recent flooding in the states of Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi and Sokoto. More than 30 people reportedly have died. In Borno State, about 26,000 people, including IDPs, have been affected by heavy flooding across camps and communities. Borno and Adamawa states remain at risk of heavy flooding according to the Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) released by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) in June.

In Chad, some 188,915 people (37,783 households) were affected by flooding in the central and southern provinces, in the Lac and N’Djamena respectively. Large pieces of farmland are inundated with a potential impact on food security and livelihoods.

In Senegal, an emergency aid plan has been activated following exceptional rains in the capital Dakar and large part of the country that caused devastating floods on 5 September. At least four people were killed, the exact number of the people affected is yet to be determined.

Mali has also seen severe flooding that began in July. By early August, more than 13,200 people, including 5,400 internally displaced persons, were affected by floods in the country. The worst affected regions are Gao, Mopti, Ségou and Sikasso. A total of 1,160 homes have been destroyed.

In Cameroon, more than 30,000 people have been affected by floods caused by heavy rains in Far North, West, Coastal, South and South-West regions, destroying homes, washing away livestock and devastating plantations.

Heavy rainfall at the end of July caused rivers to overflow in the Far North, affecting over 5,000 people. More flooding was recently reported in the area, with over 1,500 families displaced around Maroua.

Flooding also affected the city of Douala and surrounding areas of Littoral region in the South-West after a torrential downpour on 21 August 2020.

In Ghana, roads, bridges, homes and farmland were inundated in the Northern and North East Regions due to heavy rainfall and releases from the Bagre Dam in neighbouring Burkina Faso, which began in mid-August 2020. At least eight people have lost their lives. The spillage was necessary due to a sharp increase in the water level. Several areas remain inaccessible, making assessments impossible.

In Burkina Faso, three people died in Kaya, Centre-Nord after heavy rainfall on 4 September. Earlier flooding affected the capital Ouagadougou, reportedly killing one person and damaging houses and property.

Early warning systems, contingency planning and local action can strengthen West Africa’s responses to increasingly frequent severe flooding, but more investment is needed in forecasting, panelists said in a recent webinar organized by the African Development Bank.

“We need to explore new and innovative approaches to better forecast and communicate floods and early warning information,” said Anthony Nyong, the Bank’s Director for Climate Change and Green Growth, in his opening remarks for the webinar Flood Forecasting and Early Warning in West Africa: Gaps, Innovation, and Lessons Learned.

In 2019 alone, extreme flooding caused the displacement of up to 5.1 million people in Africa, including 3.8 million from countries experiencing food insecurity. West Africa is a hotspot for extreme weather due to its long coastline, which is home to densely populated low-lying cities and economic hubs, from Lagos to Abidjan and Dakar.

This year, floods in eight West African countries affected over 750,000 people and claimed at least 100 lives. With rapid urbanization and increasing climate risks, the impact of floods in the region will likely accelerate over the next five decades.

The November 19 webinar, organized by the Bank’s Clim-Dev Africa Special Fund, brought together experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Senegal’s national meteorological agencies to provide an update on flood forecasting and early warning systems (EWS) in West Africa.

A representative for the Niger Basin Authority discussed regional collaboration on flood forecasting among its nine members. The event included a panel discussion with leading experts from the Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.

“We know that flood EWS is a crucial flood management tool, comprising key components of disaster risk knowledge, monitoring, and forecasting-as well as communication and response. Yet, little is being done to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and operationalize flood forecasts and early warning systems,” said James Kinyangi, Coordinator of the Clim-Dev Fund.

Ousmane N’diaye, Director of Senegal’s National Meteorological Agency, said that better preparedness through climate information and multi-disciplinary planning targeting vulnerable populations is crucial to saving lives and property. He emphasized the importance of early forecasting and the use of social media platforms to broadcast alerts and provide real-time weather information in local languages.

Michael Talhami of the Red Cross said acting early and anticipating risk would reduce human exposure to disaster. All too often, he said, local actors and humanitarian organizations have to work with weather and climate data that is dated, of poor quality, or non-existent. One example is the abandonment of hydrometeorological data collection in rural Mali, which has had detrimental consequences for emergency preparedness and response.

The Bank’s Institutional Support to African Climate Centers Project (ISACIP) has invested over $35 million to improve climate information services throughout Africa since 2010. As a follow-up to ISACIP, the Bank, through the Clim-Dev Fund, is investing over $27 million in regional and country operations to modernize Africa’s climate and weather infrastructure and provide high-quality and reliable data.","Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['green', 'improve', 'head', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'flood', 'growth', 'forecasting', 'west', 'early', 'warning', 'million', 'plan', 'preparedness', 'information', 'africa', 'weather']", ,flood

In 2020, flooding has affected 2.7 million people in 18 countries in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact has been particularly severe, and the number of people affected is more than double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, recent flooding have occurred in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This year 197,000 houses were reported destroyed in thirteen countries of the region. 422,000 hectares of farmland were affected by floods, which resulted in the destruction of crops and fields, threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions were already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities have led the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organizations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO has supported the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million.

By Robert Reid, Iguniwari Thomas Ekeu-Wei, and Zirra Banu

Ibadan is the third most populous city in Nigeria—Africa’s largest country in terms of population and economy. This city of six million also happens to be the country’s largest in terms of geographic area, but like many other cities, urbanization is largely uncontrolled, and people are exposed to disasters like floods.

We had the opportunity to experience Nigeria’s creativity and innovation in Lagos city, when the World Bank partnered with Co-Creation Hub and other players to organize a hackathon that focused on leveraging data and technology to improve accountability and service delivery in governance. People, including data and software engineers, professional and academic experts, and civil servants, came together to develop solutions for improved policy, governance and development impact.

The Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project (IUFMP) —set up to tackle the city’s urban resilience challenges—submitted datasets for the hackathon, and one of the teams that worked on the data from the project emerged as winner in February, 2020. Teams developed a geospatial visualization platform to overlay and view the datasets from the geodatabases created as part of the Ibadan city, and flood and drainage masterplans preparation, demonstrating how the government and other stakeholders can use insights from geospatial data to accelerate effective decision making in urban planning, flood risk and environmental management. With this open data, the state government can now use up-to-the-minute information to identify, manage, prevent, and prepare for flood risks, and other ensuing impacts from floods.

Building on this with support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and with the collaboration of technical initiatives from experts in Ibadan and around Oyo state, the project scaled up the use of data for flood risk management and developed an advanced geospatial visualization platform that empowers the government to seamlessly apply geospatial data in daily operations.

This innovation strengthens the capacity of the Oyo state government to manage flood risk and inform decision making in other sectors in Ibadan using data, coupled with previous capacity building efforts, gigabytes of geospatial data available and GIS innovation laboratories have been setup under the project. The labs established at the department of Urban Renewal Enforcement Monitoring and Compliance and Office of the Surveyor General under the Oyo State Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. The Project Implementation Unit has been equipped with computers, servers, printers, plotters and software needed to apply these datasets in decision making. These datasets, which are publicly available via an advanced geospatial visualization platform, now strategically inform technical decision making and engagements. This enhances urban resilience and disaster risk management, aligning strongly with the Oyo State Government’s E-governance Program and leveraging internet connectivity infrastructure provided by the government in locations where the labs are present to facilitate data exchange.

From the people to policy—students sparking innovation

In August, the University of Ibadan and the project signed a formal memorandum of understanding, to foster capacity development, knowledge exchange and promote long-term project sustainability through collaborative research, data information exchange, internship programs for students, short courses and training programs for government staff and other professionals, and all-round collaborations that bridge the academic-policy-industry gap through open data and innovation.

With the rising thirst for innovative responses to managing flood risks in Ibadan, the University of Ibadan, in collaboration with the project, GIS Konsult Limited and other partners hosted the second season of the Ibadan Geo-Hackathon completed in November with the theme, “Ibadan Urban Resilience,” leveraging the advanced geospatial visualization platform and geodatabases to deliver solutions focusing on three thematic areas: risk-informed decision making, urban resilient design, and innovative technology solutions for urban resilience. The winning submissions for the respective categories include: Smart Citi, a web-based application for automated flood-risk assessment and waste management,, and Flood Health Risk Mapper an industrial research innovation, and Fire Incidents - A Reoccurring Menace, a story on disaster resilience. The city of Ibadan has now developed two comprehensive masterplans: A Flood Risk Management and Drainage Masterplan and a City Masterplan. Both documents create a vision for resilient and sustainable urban development in the face of climate change, identifying opportunities to boost inclusive economic development, and identify and prioritize the structures most at risk of failing (bridges, culverts, drainages, dam, etc.) to strengthen the government's capacity to detect and respond more effectively to floods, and build resilience long-term. The amount of data, maps and information generated by these master plans is vast. They include spatial datasets, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) topography, high resolution aerial imagery, and outputs of urban analytics, hydrological and hydraulic modelling. By making this information accessible to the public, it becomes useful for many stakeholders, and will inform individuals, private sector, and government decision making to better manage risks and improve urban development.

Open data for innovation and entrepreneurship in development

Entrepreneurship is on the rise—and so is innovation and collaboration for the benefit of all. With data open and publicly accessible, businesses, academia and university students alike can utilize information for research and development. This innovation helps civil servants in their work as they tactically tackle disaster and urban development challenges. In turn, the increased resilience helps everyone from kindergarteners to tailors, and keeps the city’s six million people protected from preventable disaster risks. That’s the impact of open data, open governance, and effective resilience building—all together, they spark cooperation, preparedness and innovation for the benefit of everyone.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['data', 'geospatial', 'sparked', 'urban', 'ibadan', 'hackathon', 'flood', 'innovation', 'making', 'risk', 'resilience', 'cities', 'project', 'largest', 'western', 'african']", ,flood

The floods are also the worst in the state since 1988, residents and state officials told PREMIUM TIMES, amidst fears the floods could worsen Nigeria’s current food insufficiency that has led to an increase in prices of basic food like rice.

The Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) said the deaths occurred in about 19 local government areas of the state

Hadejia Emirate, with eight council areas, is the worst hit, the executive secretary of SEMA, Sani Yusuf, told PREMIUM TIMES.

Mr Yusuf said the deaths were recorded since the commencement of the current rainy season.

“These are the number of deaths so far reported to the agency since the beginning of this rainy season,” he said.

He explained that the agency, with federal government support, is doing the needful to cushion the effects of the disaster by providing emergency needs to the victims of the flood.

He added that the agency has so far distributed 30 canoes to communities affected by the flood, as well as materials to the affected communities to build embankments in order to control the water.

Worst Flood in over 30 years

Hamza Muhammad, special assistant to Governor Muhammad Badaru on community development and social inclusion, said this year’s flood is the worst since 1988 with Hadejia emirate as the worst affected area.

He listed the affected local governments as Buji, Hadejia, Ringim, Taura, Jahun, Miga, Malammadori, Auyo, Kafinhausa and Guri.

Others include Gwaram, Kiyawa, Kaugama, Birninkudu, kirikasamma, Garki and Babura.

Cause of flood

Mr Muhammad attributed the cause of the flood to an overflow of Tiga and Challawa dams in Kano State as well as effects of climate change.

He also said torrential rainfall, as earlier forecast by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, contributed to the disaster.

In an earlier report done by this newspaper, Isa Mustapha, the executive director, Exceptional Leadership and Integrity Promotion, listed the major causes of the flood as insufficient drainage channels, silted dams, weeds, trypa grass overgrowing on river channels and river beds, as well as illegal diversion and encroachment of waterways.

Other causes, according to Mr Mustapha, include lackadaisical attitude towards the desiltation of the Hadeija-Yobe Kwamadugu River basin, as well as poor coordination among stakeholders on the control of the menace of flood.

Government’s intervention

Mr Muhammad said the state government has been doing its best since January 2020 to prevent the flood including directing officials to conduct a survey in flood-prone areas of the state.

He said the government had also deployed water pumping machines to the affected communities to evacuate the flooded water.

“Where we cannot use the machines to evacuate the water, we organized self help groups in such communities and empower them with tools for embarkment,” he said.

Affected communities deny government’s intervention

Contrary to Mr Muhammad’s claims, residents of the affected communities said the government is not doing enough.

They accused the government of not providing any remedial measures to help mitigate the impact of the flood.

Mr Mustapha and some officials of SEMA, while on an assessment visit to some of the flooded areas on Monday, were mobbed by angry residents who decried the government’s negligence of the areas.

One of the vehicles conveying the officials got damaged while journalists trying to take footage of the flooded areas were also chased away by the angry residents.

Impact of Flooding on Food Production

Officials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, are already lamenting the impact of the flood on food production in Jigawa, and Nigeria, especially rice production.

Jigawa is one of the states that has benefitted most from the federal government’s Anchors Borrowers Programme to assist farmers boost rice production in the country.

Mr Muhammad, the governor’s aide, expressed the fear that the state may experience food shortage, saying that “Sixty-five per cent of Fadama farmland were washed away by the flood especially in Hadejia where much anticipated rice is expected.”

He added that grains like millet, maize and sorghum were also lost to the flood.

Officials could not give the exact number of farmlands and houses that were destroyed by the flood but said the damage is unprecedented while assessment is ongoing.

In his reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari described this year’s flood in Jigawa as ”unprecedented and devastating.”

In a statement by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, Mr Buhari, on Tuesday, sympathised with the victims of the flood while assuring them of federal government’s intervention.

He described the flood, which has reportedly destroyed over 100,000 hectares of rice farms in the state, as a setback to agriculture especially rice production which his administration has actively promoted and discouraged its importation.

The price of rice has also doubled in the past few months across Nigeria due to various reasons including the floods affecting rice-producing states like Jigawa and Kebbi.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/09/Jigawa-flood.jpg?fit=718%2C405&ssl=1,"['experiences', 'affected', 'destroyed', 'flood', 'governments', 'food', 'farms', 'dead', 'muhammad', 'communities', 'worst', 'jigawa', '40', 'officials', 'state', 'maize', 'rice']", ,flood

As of 25 September, flooding has affected around 1.7 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected exceeding last year’s totals, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains are expected to subside in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, they will affect more areas in Central Africa. Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. Due to the frequency and scale of the incidents, additional support is often required. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.","Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1537011-WCA%202020%20Flooding%20Snapshot_20020925.png?itok=IBDn7ASh,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', '25', 'floods', 'communities', 'impact', 'million', 'insecurity', 'niger', 'affected', 'africa']", ,flood

The training, organised by the Centre for Space Science & Technology Education (CSSTE) was part of the Multi-Scale Flood Monitoring and Assessment Services for West Africa (MiFMASS) project under the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) Support Programme which seeks to help Nigeria and other West African nations to adopt a new system of utilising satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

Participants were mainly technical operational staff from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

The training, which holds simultaneously across four other West African countries, aimed at equiping participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-prone areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model, as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

According to the Lead of the CSSTE Consortium, Dr Ganiyu Agbaje, the training was in alignment with one of the major pillars of the GMES & Africa support programme, which was capacity building, and this had led the CSSTE consortium to identify strategic training needs of its collaborating stakeholders on the MIFMASS project with the aim to train and empower them to sustain the product and service outcomes after the lifetime of the programme.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, a major cause of flooding in Africa.

“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here,’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of the Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction and more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower,” he said.

Dr. Agbaje, who also doubles as the Executive Director of the African Regional Centre for Space Science & Technology Education – English (ARCSSTE-E) in Ile-Ife, added that GMES & Africa is a joint initiative of the African Union and the European Union to harness the benefits of earth observation (satellite) data for inherent environmental challenges in Africa and their own MiFMASS project is one of the many ongoing research and development projects under the programme.

He pledged that two more training courses will be held as the consortium prepares for the conclusion of the project and the handover of its products and services to relevant agencies.

“This is the third in the series of our training and we have two more to go,” he said.","Thu, 11 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/flood.jpg,"['world', 'flood', 'african', 'management', 'west', 'technology', 'mifmass', 'guardian', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'services', 'monitoring', 'agencies', 'training', 'project', 'africa', 'satellite']", ,flood

At the Official Presentation of the outlook in Abuja, the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, noted that the outlook was a fallout from the devastating effect of the 2012 flood in the country.

He said the purpose of the outlook was to present probable flood scenarios for this year and to disseminate information to all, especially in flood-prone areas and further reduce resultant effects.

He said flood is one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria with devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on flood plains for livelihoods.

He said although the flood outlook had shown that 2020 floods might not be as severe as previous years, it was important for all stakeholders to carry out an aggressive awareness campaign for preparedness.

“It is pertinent to note that the impending flooding season with COVID-19 presents a fight against two threats; on one hand, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and on the other hand, the likelihood of an active 2020 flood season.

“The 2020 flood projections will as expected vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country.

“Overall, the flood level may not be as severe as previous years, but it is a certainty that our rivers will exceed flood level and many will be inundated again this year.”

The minister said as always, flooding was associated with increased risk of infections when the displaced persons were high and polluted water sources, added that it was important for all stakeholders to prepare earnestly.

He added that part of the intervention to promote hygiene was the recently signed Executive Order 009 by the President Muhammadu Buhari aimed at ending Open Defecation by 2025.

“Many state governors have bought into this idea, the ministry declared emergency in the water and sanitation sector to encourage hand washing and put in place the National WASH Response Committee for COVID -19,” he said.

The minister also commended the efforts of NIHSA in the development of a new Flood Mobile App, saying that it would add practical value to water managers and for overall disaster risks management.

The NIHSA’s Director-General, Clement Nze, said the 2020 AFO would go beyond borders and defer all barriers to reach the needy in providing information on early flood warnings required for mitigating risks in the country.

Mr Nze noted that the need to carry out aggressive sensitisation and awareness campaigns on consistent clearing of all waterways and maintenance of dams and reservoirs to ensure free flow of water in drainages.

The D-G said the Flood Mobile App would also be used to give actual daily flood situations to everyone, especially those at the rural areas through the use of SMS services.

The new Flood Mobile App is designed to be of practical value to the Water Managers, Technical Experts, Disaster Risk Managers, Policy Makers and Flood Forecasting Community for flood prevention and for enhancing flood early warning systems in Nigeria.

83,83,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Lagos flood alert: Heeding the augurs - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/lagos-flood-alert-heeding-the-augurs/,"By Kayode Ojewale

SIR: Flooding does not just suddenly happen; it is usually preceded by some occurrences hinting its imminent arrival. When the flow of rain water on its way to the drainage channels or river is impeded, then flooding occurs. Flooding is having too much water in the wrong place. The cause of flooding is mainly man-made because of our unclean environmental habits. With just few days of rains, some parts of Lagos are flooded. How will residents of these areas, especially flood-prone areas fare when the peak of rainy season which usually comes with attendant flooding eventually arrives? The omens of flooding are here with us coupled with the warnings issued by appropriate authorities; are we heeding the augurs?

What’s the end gain if the rains, meant to bless us and water our plants, turn out to damage our crops, properties and even destroy lives due to our actions and inactions? Does it appear many have forgotten the losses, pains and agony that accompanied the ravaging heavy rains which caused disasters in different parts of the country in 2012, the year of flood fury?

Of recent, it is observed that sometimes the rains no longer pre-inform or send any signal before its arrival through warnings like cloudy sky, windy atmosphere and dark clouds. Rather, it will just begin to rain suddenly without any pre-notification and it will pour heavily. That’s another indication that the rains this year would be in a different dimension.

On April 14, the Lagos State government predicted high intensity high of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello.

“…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm”.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding”, he further added.

As a way of checkmating the looming flood, the state government plans to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72 kilometers spread across all the Local Government Areas of the State.

Flood alerts and warnings are usually issued to sensitize residents and the authorities on the need to prepare. Ignoring these warnings or not heeding the flood alerts may come with deadly consequences. In order to be prepared for the predicted floods, agencies in charge of disaster management and emergencies should be ready to ensure safety of lives during the peak of the rainy season.

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lagos-flood.jpg,"['residents', 'rainy', 'warnings', 'water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'days', 'heeding', 'flow', 'lagos', 'alert', 'rains', 'state', 'areas', 'augurs']", ,flood
84,84,FL-2019-000122-NGA,ACAPS Briefing Note: Nigeria - Floods (26 September 2018) - Nigeria - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/acaps-briefing-note-nigeria-floods-26-september-2018,"Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, river levels in most of the 12 affected states remain high due to flooding, which has affected 441,251 people, and displaced 141,369 people between late August and 24 September. A total of 108 deaths and 192 injuries have been reported as of late August. Rainfall is expected to continue for the next week. Rivers and Bayelsa states are estimated to be amongst the worst affected states where water levels continue to rise. Initial assessments indicate that 13,031 homes were damaged or destroyed across all affected states as of late August. Shelter, food, NFIs and medical assistance continue to be key needs for the affected population

Crisis impact

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, widespread flooding due to ongoing rainfall has affected 441,250 people and displaced 141,400 people in Adamawa, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Delta, Edo, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Niger, Rivers, and Taraba states since late August (NEMA 24/09/2018; ERCC; 24/09/2018).

As of 24 September, flooding across 12 states and 50 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in central and southern Nigeria has caused 108 deaths and 192 injuries (NEMA 24/09/2018). Across all affected states, there is an urgent need for shelter, with around 13,000 houses damaged (NEMA 24/09/2018). The affected population has lost household and personal belongings. The floods have caused considerable damage to agricultural land across Nigeria, with 122,653 hectares of agricultural land destroyed. In addition to shelter, there is an urgent need for food, NFIs and medicine (NEMA 24/09/2018). The flooding is widespread and situation is rapidly evolving. As assessments are ongoing, the number of the affected people is expected to further increase.

Initial assessments indicate that Rivers and Bayelsa are amongst the most affected states. Water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa. As of 24 September, water levels in lower Benue state have subsided to 10m, compared to 11m on 21 September.

The Niger River at Lokoja city, Kogi state, has not receded, as it recorded water levels of 11.05m on 24 September (NEMA 24/09/2018). Light to moderate rainfall is expected to continue until early October.

Shelter: Flooding has displaced around 141,400 people across the 12 affected states, of which 80,600 people are estimated to be living with friends and family (NEMA 24/09/2018). Over 13,000 houses have been partially or totally damaged. IDPs have relocated to emergency shelters, such as LGA offices, schools, stadiums and churches.

Some of the affected population is staying in IDP camps that have been recently constructed by the Presidential Committee on Flood Relief and Rehabilitation (NEMA 21/09/2018). As assessments are ongoing, and water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa states, the amount of houses damaged, which are typically built with mud and thatch roods, is likely to increase (IFCR 23/09/2018). The affected population are in urgent need of shelter support and NFIs, such as blankets, mats, hygiene kits and kitchen sets (IFCR 23/09/2018).

Livelihood: New estimates indicate that 122,653 hectares of agricultural land have been flooded across central and southern Nigeria. Crops were destroyed before the harvesting season begins in October (NYTimes 17/08/2018). This makes the affected population more vulnerable to food insecurity, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of farmers. Flooding is also likely to affect other livelihoods, such as fishers and petty traders.

Food: There continues to be an urgent need for food assistance for IDPs across all affected states. Severe flood damage to agricultural crops means there is a risk that some communities will experience increased food insecurity throughout the harvest season. (Daily Trust 20/09/2018). There are still no reports on whether markets that have been flooded and closed. Transportation of food is likely to be severely restricted because main roads have been flooded.

Health: Since the publication of the briefing note on 21 September, 192 injuries have been reported since late August. Flood affected victims are likely to be in urgent medical care, as result of injuries and the risk of outbreaks made worse due to the extensive flooding. Health care support is particularly needed in IDP camps (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The risk that diarrhoea and cholera will spread remains high, as water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa, and have mostly not subsided in other communities.

Particularly in more populated areas, and overcrowded IDP camps where WASH facilities are inadequate, there continues to be a high concern for cholera to spread further. There have been reports of an increase in diarrhoea cases in four of the flood affected states (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of geographical information and data indicating which states are affected by the spike in diarrhoea cases. 27,927 cases of suspected cholera were reported between 1 January and 10 September countrywide (NCDC 10/09/2018). Between 1 January and 10 September, suspected cholera cases were reported in the flood affected states of Adamawa (2,002), Anambra (23), Bayelsa (no data), Benue (no data), Delta (no data), Edo (no data), Kebbi (198), Kogi (102), Kwara (no data), Niger (547), Rivers (no data), and Taraba (no data). (NCDC 10/09/2018). In Adamawa, an increase of 119 suspected cholera cases was observed between 17-23 September, most likely due to flooding facilitating the spread (Adamawa State Ministry of Health 23/09/2018)

As flooding has not receded, the escalation of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and-or West Nile fever remains a concern (WHO 2018). The Government recently confirmed that the malaria cases have increased due to the floods (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The current malaria incidence in Nigeria is 380.8/1,000 (2015) (PMI 2017). A distribution of mosquito nets for the flood affected population has been identified as a key priority (NEMA 24-09-2018 NaijaNews 18/09/2018).

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, there have been additional reports in local media sources that indicate antenatal care for pregnant women remains a key concern. This was reported in Uzanu community, Estako East LGA, Edo state and in Ogbaru, Amambra.

There is a need for psychosocial support, as flood victims have lost or been separated from their loved ones (IFCR 23/09/2018).

WASH: The displaced population is still staying in emergency shelters, such LGA offices, stadiums, schools and churches, which have inadequate sanitation facilities and are in urgent need of safe water. In most of the affected states, water sources have been contaminated by flooding (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of data on the potential amount of damaged water points.

Education: Schools continue to be used as evacuation centres across all affected states. On 18 September, primary and secondary schools were closed in Ogbaru, Southern Anambra state as a safety measure, following floods that displaced more than 1,1000 people (OCHA 24/09/2018). Considering the ongoing flooding, it is likely that many schools have been damaged by flooding (Premium Times 19/09/2018).

Protection: While there is no disaggregated data available on the amount of women and girls affected by the floods, it is likely that this group is disproportionately affected.

Women and girls that are displaced and staying in IDP camps continue to be at increased risk to gender-based violence. Overcrowding at IDP camps, with a lack of privacy and inadequate toilets and washing facilities, increases the risks and vulnerability of women and girls to gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (UNHCR 12/2017; OCHA 2016).

Impact on critical infrastructure

Since the start of the rainy season, in June, main roads have been flooded and bridges collapsed (Vanguard 15/09/2018). As water levels have not subsided and heavy rainfall is expected to continue until the beginning of October, main roads continue to be flooded across all affected states.

Power and telecommunications are affected in some of the flood-affected states. The Okpai Gas Independent Power Plant in Ndokwa East Council, Delta State, with power supply to Aso Villa, Abuja has been flooded (TheGuardian 25/09/2018). Communities in Kdokwa West and Ukwuani councils are also affected by the power cut.

Some LGA offices in affected are also likely to be impacted, as they are being used as emergency shelters for the flood affected population.","Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1171619-20180925_acaps_briefing_note_nigeria_floods_update_i_0.png?itok=EOQvdbLy,"['2018', 'data', 'likely', 'water', '26', 'flooding', 'continue', 'nema', 'flood', 'floods', 'states', 'levels', 'note', 'nigeria', 'briefing', 'affected', 'acaps']", ,flood
85,85,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Nigeria: Food Security Threatened As Floods Destroy Farms - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202009030184.html,"Fear of food crisis is heightening in Nigeria following massive floods that are ravaging crop farms in many parts of the country.

Many farmlands were reportedly destroyed by floods in Kebbi, Zamfara, Niger, Rivers, C/Rivers, Sokoto, Bauchi and some parts of Kwara State.

Rice and maize farmlands were most affected and farmers fear this could further hike the prices of the staple food in the country.

A Daily Trust market survey showed that prices of food items are already going up in the market.

In Kano, a 100kg of maize now costs N20,000, N22,000 in Benue, N24, 000 in Abuja and as high as N25,000 in Lagos State.

The same size of maize sold between N9, 000 and N11, 000 last year across the country.

Also, 100kg of local rice now costs N55,000 in Kano, N58,000 in Abuja, while prices of beans range from N22,000 to N24, 000 per 100kg depending on the market and state.

- The warnings -

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had warned that the current water level in the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin portends some level of concern for Nigeria as there could be a likelihood of river flooding in the states contiguous to River Niger.

The states, according to the Agency, are Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The Director-General of the agency, Engr. Clement Onyeaso Nze said the country through Kebbi State might be flooded beginning from September 6

Reports from Kebbi had shown that several hectares of rice farms were washed away by flood and similar incidence was also reported in some parts of Zamfara, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kwara, Cross Rivers, Rivers and Niger states.

The incident is already a source of concern for stakeholders in the food sector as they are expressing fears that if the ugly trend continues, there might be food crisis in the country.

In Kebbi State, over 500,000 hectares of farmlands were reported to have been destroyed by flood.

The Chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, Sani Dododo, who announced the incident said rice farms accounted for about 450,000 of the hectares while the remaining 50,000 were for other crops.

- Farmers narrate ordeal -

It was reported that farmers in Kebbi State lost over N5 billon to the flood.

A victim and female rice farmer in the state, Lubabatu Bunza, said she lost about 16,000 hectares to the recent flood in the state.

Also, Mallam Isa Ahman, another victim from Patigi LGA of Kwara State, said early last month, flood washed away about six hectares of his rice farm and four hectares of his maize farm.

The farmer said he obtained a loan from a commercial bank and invested on the farm, saying it would be difficult to repay the loan.

Many of the affected farmers in Kebbi and Niger states said they got their inputs from the Anchor Borrowers' Programme of the federal government and wondered how they would be able to repay the loans.

President of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Ibrahim Kabiru, said even though it would be difficult to ascertain the damages done to the farms by the flood across the country, the trend portents a great danger ahead.

He said the flood-affected rice, maize, sorghum and other crops in the affected states.

According to him, the situation was being worsened by the insecurity in the rural areas where the farms are located.

The farmers' leader had earlier warned that bandits were preventing farmers from accessing their farms, which he said was a dangerous pointer to food security.

Mr. Mathew Ajayi, a food security expert told Daily Trust on phone yesterday that already the country was nearing food crisis as this could be seen in the skyrocketing prices of food items across the country.

""It is obvious that we are approaching a serious food crisis considering the rising prices of food items across the country.

""And now look at the flood ravaging the farms' couple with the bandits chasing away farmers from their farms,"" he said.

Alhaji Muktar Umar, a farmer and local rice miller in Sabo-Wuse, Niger State, told Daily Trust on phone Wednesday that the country might experience serious rice crisis this year because of the flood incidence and security challenges threatening the farmers.

""From my experience as a farmer, I know many people go into rice farming this year but the farms are being washed away by the flood.

""Many farmers can no longer go to their farms now, most especially here in Niger State,"" he said.

- Buhari orders release of food items from reserves -

President Muhammadu Buhari said Wednesday that the flood disaster in Kebbi State had exposed the country to a major setback in the efforts to boost local food production.

Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed concerns over the heavy floods that took a number of lives, submerged thousands of hectares of farmlands and houses, destroying farm produce and personal belongings in the affected communities.

The president said: ""I am particularly sad over this incident because it is a setback to our efforts to boost local rice production as part of measures to stop food importation.

""Kebbi State is the focal point of our policy to produce rice locally as part of this administration's commitment to agricultural revival, which suffered relative neglect in favour of food importation.

""With the loss of six lives and still counting; thousands of hectares of land flooded and estimated economic losses of more than one billion naira by rice farmers in Kebbi State, we face a major setback in our efforts to boost local food production.

""This bad news couldn't have come at a worse time for our farmers and other Nigerians who looked forward to a bumper harvest this year in order to reduce the current astronomical rise in the costs of food items in the markets.""

The president, while sympathising with the bereaved families and farmers affected by the devastating floods, assured that ""we are going to work closely with the Kebbi State government in order to bring relief to the victims.""

In another statement yesterday by Shehu, Buhari expressed the concern of his administration about the sudden spiral of food prices at a time when the economy was already mired in a slowdown occasioned by the global coronavirus situation.

Buhari, however, assured Nigerians that the situation was transient.

He said his administration had already begun looking and putting in place measures to ameliorate the situation.

""While Providence has been kind to us with the rains and as such an expectation that a bumper harvest would lead to crashing of food prices and ease the burdens on the population, the government's concern is that the exploitative market behaviour by actors has significantly increased among traders in the past few years and may make any such relief a short-lived one.

""This year has indeed tested us in ways that globalisation has never been tested since the turn of the century.

""These challenges have disrupted lives and supply chains all over the world and Nigeria has not been spared.

""The effect has been deeply felt in the delays encountered in the procurement of raw materials for local production of fertilizer (damaging standing crops before harvest) and the speculative activities by a number of rice processors who are ready to pay for paddy at any price to keep their mills running non-stop.

""But of all these problems, the most worrisome is the activities of ""corrupt"" middlemen (with many of them discovered to be foreigners) and other food traders who serve as the link between farmers and consumers found to be systematically creating an artificial scarcity so that they can sell at higher prices.

""In dealing with these problems, the administration has, in line with its ease of doing business mantra, avoided imposing stockholding restrictions in order not to discourage investments in modern warehousing and cold storage.

""The president has just approved the release of food items from the strategic reserves, including 30,000 tons of maize to animal feeds producers to ease the high cost of poultry production.

""President Buhari's administration has raised some of these issues with the various food producer associations involved, particularly those of rice and other grains.

""With their cooperation, the high food prices should soon be a thing of the past.

""In addition, investments in the agro-allied sector by the private sector will significantly increase domestic production of farming inputs especially fertilizer, further crash prices, create employment and ease the pressure on our foreign reserves.

""One of these major investments is the Dangote Fertilizer plant, which is projected to come on stream by the 4th quarter of 2020,"" the president said.

- Experts suggest ways out -

The National President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Arc. Ibrahim Kabiru noted that to mitigate the effect of these calamities on the food system or food security, farmers should be encouraged to embark on full-scale dry season farming, which could lead to all-year-round farming

He advised that government should expand the nation's irrigable lands by investing more in water resources.

He also advised farmers to quickly plant alternative crops that require little time to mature in order to mitigate the crisis.

He said government at all levels could support such farmers with seeds and other inputs.

""Whereupon the time left for the rainy season cannot be sufficient for any crop, some form of compensation commensurate to the ascertained loss could be given to the affected farmers,"" he advised.

The farmer's leader urged his members to insure their farms, adding that the association is already working with National Agricultural Insurance Company (NAIC) to that all farmers insure their farms.

The women leader of the Kebbi State Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Lubabatu Usman Kamba suggested that the way out for some of the challenges was for the farmers to be provided with good knowledge of forecasting the planting season.

She said flooding has been the farmers' biggest nightmare, adding that they could only be addressed with good forecasting knowledge on when and where to plant the crops, which she said was currently lacking because of the near absence of extension service workers.","Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn05.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00540445:bd25877f5988946c2e238d58cdc5cf6e:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'niger', 'food', 'kebbi', 'security', 'floods', 'farms', 'prices', 'threatened', 'nigeria', 'destroy', 'rice', 'hectares', 'state']", ,flood
86,86,FL-2019-000122-NGA,"April 2021: Ninth-warmest April on record, NOAA and NASA report - Yale Climate Connections",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/05/april-2021-ninth-warmest-april-on-record-noaa-and-nasa-report/,"April 2021 was the ninth-warmest April since global record-keeping began in 1880, 0.79 degrees Celsius (1.42°F) above the 20th-century average, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, NCEI, reported May 13. NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europe’s coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Figure 1. Departure of temperature from average for April 2021, the ninth-warmest April for the globe since record keeping began in 1880. Record-warm April temperatures were limited to parts of southern South America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, as well as small parts of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. No portion of the globe was record-cold. (Image credit: NOAA/NCEI)

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy. Above: Smoke rises from fires lit to prevent freeze damage in a French vineyard on April 8, 2021. (Image credit: Christiane Lambert, FNSEA)

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK. Above: Infrared satellite image of supercell thunderstorms over Texas and Oklahoma near sunset on April 28. (Image credit: NOAA)

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated. Above: California’s largest reservoir, Lake Oroville, as seen on April 26, 2021. (Image credit: California DWR)

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

Francis Ighorurhie, aged 38, reportedly drowned on Thursday night at Kaiama Community in Kolokuma-Opokuma Council of Bayelsa State. Two Primary school pupils also drowned along Goodnews street in Azikoro Town in Yenagoa Council of the state.

It was gathered on Friday that Fr. Francis Ighorurhie, a Missionary of St. Paul (MSP) from Delta State, was until his death the Parish Priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church, Kaiama.

A priest, who spoke anonymously, said, “this is a sad moment for us. Father was on his way back from Bomadi in Delta State when he met his untimely death. But for the flood, he could have driven his car straight to his residence instead of parking same by the road.”

“It was as he was walking on the wooden bridge part of which had been submerged that he slipped and got drowned. Those staying at his residence had to raise alarm when they saw his car by the roadside and he was nowhere to be found.

“They however became suspicious when they saw a bag containing some provision floating on the water not far from the bridge. Divers were contracted and his remains were recovered.”

He added that his remains had been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa.

Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State government, yesterday, in a statement, sympathised with residents of the state over the impact of the rising flood, assuring that efforts are underway to mitigate its devastating effects on the people.

The state government, during its Eight Executive Council Meeting, presided over by the Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stressed that government is aware of the difficulties being experienced as a result of the flood, which has become a perennial problem due to climate change.

Speaking on behalf of the Governor, Ewhrudjakpo appealed to Bayelsans to exercise patience with the state government over the inconveniences being experienced as a result of the ongoing expansion of the Etegwe roundabout.","Sun, 18 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekiti-flood.jpg,"['saw', 'bayelsa', 'flood', 'residence', 'st', 'catholic', 'drowned', 'drown', 'remains', 'pupils', 'council', 'state', 'priest', 'result']", ,flood

90,90,FL-2019-000122-NGA,An Inland Delta Flooded - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147692/an-inland-delta-flooded,"Drought is a perennial problem in the semi-arid Sahel region of Africa. But in 2020, in Mali and other countries in West Africa, excessive rainfall has been the problem at times. Exceptionally heavy summer rains pushed seasonal floods on the Niger River and its inland delta to destructive levels.

After intense rains fell in July and August in the Guinea Highlands and overloaded many streams and rivers, it took several weeks for flood waters to work their way through the vast inland delta in central Mali. When the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured a natural-color image on October 29, 2020, water had spread widely across the nearly flat delta, which was once a lake bottom. Standing water appears black. Many flooded areas appear green because bourgou grass, rice, and other plants grow in the shallow flood waters. For comparison, the other image shows the dry landscape in May 2020, before the rains.

In late October, floodwaters reached their peak height at Mopti, a town at the confluence of the Niger and Bani Rivers. Water levels in the delta were recorded at 670 centimeters (22 feet) on October 26 and remained at that level until November 2, according to Mali’s National Directorate of Water Resources. That tied the peak water levels from 2018, the highest since 1969.

After November 2, waters receded at Mopti even as they continued to rise at points downstream such as Akka and Diré. It typically takes water a full six months from falling in the Guinea Highlands to reach the ocean at the Niger Delta in Nigeria. People watch the timing of flooding closely because it affects when rice can be grown, when fish will be available to catch, and when pastures can be ready for grazing. Water levels were expected to be low enough in mid-December 2020 for the annual cattle crossing on the Niger River at Diafarabé. In the much anticipated event, nomadic herders drive cattle across the river toward rich grazing lands in the inland delta and are reunited with their families after months apart.

While seasonal floods are common in Mali, the severity of the floods this year caused widespread damage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 1,160 homes were destroyed by flooding.

91,91,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Reps to expand fire service operations - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/reps-to-expand-fire-service-operations/,"The House of Representatives is considering an expansion of the scope of operations of the fire service to include accidents and emergency situations in the transport sector and at construction sites in the real estate sector.



When the bill becomes law, officers of the fire service who show gallantry will be specially rewarded.



This proposal is contained in the legislation titled ‘A Bill for an Act to Repeal the Fire Service Act, Cap. F29, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and Enact the Fire and Emergency Service Bill to Provide for Additional Powers for Effective Service Delivery; and for Related Matters.’



The bill passed second reading at the plenary on Tuesday.



Sponsor of the bill, Mr Adejoro Adeogun, while leading the debate for the second reading, said the proposal was to provide for additional powers and expansion of responsibilities of the fire service



He said, “The major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed, would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency. It would also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through engagement of able bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.



“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources.”



Adeogun noted that the Fire Service Act (1963) saddled the Fire Service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies.



“This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and such other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required,” he said.



The lawmaker added, “This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.



“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”



The lawmaker listed the specific goals of the bill, saying it is to “prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters.”



He added that it would “encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by states, local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies.



“Establish the Office of the Fire and Emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the fire and emergency service.



“Empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilise resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies.



“Provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officers.”","Wed, 19 May 2021 08:43:56 GMT",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/19155231/Reps.fw_.png,"['flooding', 'service', 'construction', 'collapse', 'accidents', 'operations', 'scope', 'related', 'bill', 'reps', 'disasters', 'expand', 'emergency']", ,none

This is as the government has warned against heavy rainfall, flooding and possible flood disasters.

While making the disclosure through a signed statement, the Honorable Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said 23 million cubic meters of water will be released in October, which is the peak of the rainfall season.

READ:

Bello explained that the release of more water from the Oyan Dam, which will be the highest so far, is due to intensive rainfall over the past few days, expected to peak in the current month.

He, therefore, enjoined all residents of Agboyi-Ketu, Owode Onirin, Isheri, Ajegunle, Agiliti, Kara, Majidun and all areas bordering the rivers and the sea in Lagos to be wary of the staggered Oyan Dam release, adding that by November, a reduced release of 11million cubic meters will be affected as the intensity of the rainfall declines.

Bello pointed out that data provided by the Nigerian Hydrological Services noted that the months of July, August, September and October would be characterized by heavy rainfall, flooding and flood disasters in most parts of the country.

READ:

Reiterating that the reminder became necessary because the projected heavy rainfall, which had increased in September, would continue with high intensity this month leading to the staggered release of water from the dam, the Commissioner disclosed that Lagos is, however, intensifying measures to minimize the effect of the heavy rainfall on lives and property.

He averred that, in continuation of the preventive efforts against flooding by the State Government, work is almost completed on all the primary and secondary channels, stating that this is in addition to the efforts of the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) that are being deployed around the State to undertake quick fixes of clogged manholes or drains manually.

Bello said, “For a coastal city like Lagos, let me remind everyone that once it rains consistently for a minimum of eight hours, we are bound to have flash floods caused by the increasing inability of effective discharge into the lagoon, which is brought about by a rise in the ocean level. This will automatically lock up all our drainages and would be unable to discharge until the water level goes down.’’

“Flash floods are not peculiar to Lagos. It is the new wave in most coastal cities around the world, including those who have adopted the best of technological advancements to curtail flooding. Lagos is at the receiving end of three types of flooding, namely Coastal, Urban and River flooding because of the peculiarity of its location.”

While urging residents to adopt an attitudinal change by not dumping refuse in drainage channels and erecting structures on drainage alignments, Bello vowed that anyone caught violating the environmental laws of the State would be punished accordingly.

The Commissioner also emphasized that all residents owe the state a duty to support the efforts of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration to ensure that heavy rainfall does not wreak havoc in any part of the metropolis.","Mon, 05 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sanwo-olu.jpg?fit=900%2C618&ssl=1,"['residents', 'release', 'water', 'flooding', 'state', 'cautions', 'flood', 'lagos', 'disaster', 'warns', 'rainfall', 'dam', 'heavy', 'oyan']", ,none

The Director-General of FEMA, Idriss Abbas, made the call in a statement on Sunday.

He said most of the deaths recorded in the past from flood in the FCT were as a result of non-compliance to instructions and early warnings.

Mr Abbas, therefore, emphasised the need for residents to adhere to instructions and early warnings from relevant authorities.

He added that attitudinal change was the key to reducing disasters to the barest minimum in the FCT.

He disclosed that the Search and Rescue team of the agency recently discovered the body of one Garba Joseph, 43-year-old from Akoka-Edo of Edo State, after two days search from a flooded river around TradeMoore Estate, Lugbe, in Abuja

“Narrating the incident, an eye witness account (one of FEMA’s volunteer/vanguard Kenneth Chima) who captured the incident on video explained that they were four men that tried walking through the water.

“And I kept warning them to go back, three of them went back but only this man insisted on crossing, unfortunately the water overpowered him and washed him away,” he said.

He decried the increasing rate of flood in the FCT due to residents’ apathy towards the government’s directives and early warnings.

“This is also despite FEMA’s consistent sensitisations based on The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) predictions of torrential rainfall and dangers of flooding.“

He said NIHSA’s most recent predictions warned of torrential rainfall and flooding from August, adding that FEMA had carried out aggressive sensitisation to educate residents on ways to prevent the impending flood.

He said FEMA was conducting sensitisation programmes in five different indigenous languages in the FCT using different media channels.

“We recently organized a meeting with our Volunteers, Vangards and Divers from all the area Councils within the FCT to educate them on how they can sensitise their people on how to prevent disasters to minimize loss of lives and properties.

“We also embarked on community to community flood sensitisation campaigns in the FCT and mounted billboards at all the flood prone points warning off and cautioning residents from these danger areas.”

The DG, who reiterated the agency’s commitment to reducing disasters to a barest minimum in the FCT, called on residents to complement the efforts of the FCT Administration by doing the needful.

He also advised residents not to underestimate the strength of water when it was flooded.

“What we are experiencing now is flash flood, the water builds up speedily and comes unnoticed hence very dangerous,” he said.

He called on community and religious leaders to take responsibility of sensitising their subjects, especially those who are living close to flood prone areas to move to higher grounds to avoid being washed away by flood.

He said that relevant authorities have been on their toes evacuating refuse around the FCT, distilling drainages and expanding narrow water channels to enable free flow of water for a safer FCT.

94,94,FL-2019-000122-NGA,Agency warns states contiguous to River Niger to brace up for impending flood - Guardian Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/news/agency-warns-states-contiguous-to-river-niger-to-brace-up-for-impending-flood/,"As River Niger reaches red alert

Following warning alert received from the Niger Basin Authority indicating that River Niger has reached Red alert of 6.60m the Nigerian Hydrological Service Agency has warned states contiguous to the Niger River to brace up for impending flood disaster.

The agency warned that It is expected that the flood magnitude sighted in Niamey, Niger Republic on the 23rd August 2020 would arrive Nigeria through Kebbi state on the 6th of September and flood other states contiguous to River Niger including Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa

NHSA Director General Engr Clement Nze in a press statement made available to journalists yesterday explained that he River Niger Basin which covers nine (9) countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, has Nigeria at the lowest portion of the Basin, meaning that that once the upper catchment of the Basin gets flooded, Nigeria should be prepared to experience flooding incident.

He said “As at today, the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin made up of Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso and part of Mali, have been flooded. The flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malanville (Benin Republic) have gotten to the Red Alert Zone”

Nze pointed out that Operators of Kainji and Jebba Dams have long been alerted to take appropriate measures in the operation of the reservoirs and accordingly, Kainji Dam is now spilling water at the rate of 1,000 m3/s that is 86.4 million cubic metres/day, saying this means that communities downstream Kainji and Jebba Dams could be flooded while Shiroro Dam on Kaduna River is still impounding, though there is the possibility of spilling water in the weeks ahead.

On River Benue sub-basin, the DG stated that the agency has maintained close contact with the Cameroonian authorities with regards to flood scenarios in the upper catchment of the sub-basin and Information received by NIHSA from the relevant authority in Cameroon stated that the Lagdo Dam is still impounding water.

He noted that the high intensity of rainfall during the last week of August has already saturated the soil and any rainfall of high intensity with long duration would translate into flooding in most part of the country.

He revealed that So far, Urban/Flash Flood has wrecked havocs in about 70 council areas in 20 states of the federation and the FCTof the Federation, including the FCT.

The NHSA boss recalled that the year 2020 Annual Flood Outlook predicted that some parts of at least 102 LGAs in 28 States fall within the Highly Probable Flood Risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 States of the Federation, including the FCT, fall within the Moderately Probable Flood Risk areas. The remaining 397 LGAs fall within the Low Probable Flood Risks areas.

It also warned The states that are contiguous to rivers Niger and Benue, namely: – Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa are likely to be affected by river flooding, while Coastal flooding is expected in Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, and Bayelsa States.

On account of poor drainage systems, flash and urban floods are expected to occur in major cities across the country, namely Birnin–Kebbi, Sokoto, Lokoja, Kaduna, Suleja, Gombe, Yola, Makurdi, Abuja, Lafia, Asaba, Port Harcourt, Yenagoa, Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Benin City, Oshogbo, Ado-Ekiti, Abakaliki, Awka, Nsukka.

The DG warned that the country still has many days of rainfall in the course of the year and More floods are expected in the months of August, September and October this year, in the event there is release of excess water from the Dams in other countries upstream rivers Niger and Benue this year, this will have more negative impacts on Nigeria which is located downstream other countries in the Niger Basin.

He urged that to prevent flood disaster,

blocked drainages and gutters should be cleared, river channels dredged and structures within the waterways and floodplains and flood paths pulled down.","Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-74.jpeg,"['river', 'world', 'flooding', 'flood', 'impending', 'expected', 'states', 'guardian', 'warned', 'nigeria', 'rivers', 'niger', 'contiguous', 'basin', 'warns']", ,flood

The analysis by SBMIntel, an Africa focused research firm, revealed that the harvests of 26.3 per cent of Nigerian farmers were greatly affected by extreme weather conditions.

It said 52.60 per cent ”were somewhat affected and a fifth (21.1 per cent) were not affected by drought and flooding in the year under review.”

The survey, titled: “Nigerians just want to eat” and published this month, chronicled the major challenges bedevilling Nigerian farmers and food transporters which are capable of impeding national food security.

Survey

Data for the survey were sampled from seven Nigerian states, namely; Nasarawa, Osun, Benue, Oyo, Katsina, Ogun and Lagos.

Of the seven states surveyed, the report noted that the majority of the respondents (farmers) had their farms in the South-west States (73.7 per cent)—Lagos (36.8 per cent ), Oyo (21.1 per cent ) and Ogun (15.8 per cent ) .

Meanwhile, 10.5 per cent of the respondents had their farms in Benue and the remaining 15.9 per cent were equally distributed between Nasarawa, Osun and Katsina states respectively.

The farmers surveyed were mostly crop farmers who grew a wide range of staples with fruits, vegetables, cassava and maize farmers in the majority, the report noted.

Scourge

According to the survey, extreme climatic events such as flooding and drought witnessed in some states within the country triggered the negative effects being noticed on the prices of staple foods.

It said flooding in Nigeria was experienced in the north, mostly in states like Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara, and some parts of Kwara.

“In fact, in Kebbi alone, 500,000 hectares of farmland were destroyed by flooding, with the cost being upward of N5 billion,” the report said.

Also, it stated that the problem that faced farmers in the South-western region was the lack of rainfall experienced during the mid-planting season last year.

“Last year, the ‘August break’ actually began in early July and lasted through till the end of August. This prevented the planting of maize, cassava and cash crops like cocoa,” the survey added.

According to the survey, ”more than half of the farmers engaged had no irrigation system, even when they believed that it will help greatly in their farming endeavours.”

It said 57.90 per cent of the respondents said ”they do not own any irrigation system that could help complement the absence of rainfall when asked if they have, only 42.10 per cent had”.

”However, about 94.7 per cent of the respondents agreed to a large extent that an irrigation system would help their farming system while 10.5 per cent said it would only help to a small extent and 5.3 per cent said to no extent,” it added.

The survey said most farmers are getting discouraged over their inability to own irrigation systems or the technology of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) to support crops during adverse weather conditions.

Recommendations

In order to mitigate the challenges being faced by these farmers and food transporters, the report recommends that both state and federal governments adopt ”wider irrigation systems and as well facilitate the provision of early maturing and drought-resistant crop varieties.”

“Switching to climate-smart agriculture is the best way to guard against crop failure and poor yields,” the survey reads in part.

The report said respondents asked the government to fix access roads and provide adequate transportation that is cheap, effective and efficient.

“An efficient rail system will reduce the cost of transporting farm produce to the markets and improve food security. Security remains paramount followed by access to land and irrigation infrastructure,” the report quoted the farmers to have said.","Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/06/IMG-20200628-WA0015-e1593352816374.jpg?fit=970%2C436&ssl=1,"['farmers', 'flooding', 'survey', '2020', 'floods', 'cent', 'states', 'irrigation', 'respondents', 'system', '80', 'nigerian', 'affected', 'nearly', 'report', 'drought']", ,flood

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos by Dallas County Police DepartmentDALLAS—After the kidnapping and killing of 4-year-old Cash Gernon in Dallas last week, neighbor Jose Alvarado checked his security cameras for any footage that might help investigators.What he found sent a chill up his spine.The video is from 10 weeks before little Cash was left dead of stab wounds on the ground. But it shows the teenager charged with abducting him, Darriynn Brown, skulking down the street, opening Alvarado’s backyard gate and peering in before quickly walking away.“It’s really scary,” Alvarado told The Daily Beast. “I have two kids, one girl and one boy, and they play basketball in the backyard.”Alvarado’s house shares a back alley with the home of Monica Sherrod, 35, who was taking care of Cash and his twin, Carter. She has said she was dating the twins’ father, Trevor Gernon, a 31-year-old construction worker, until he reportedly left town in March when a court ordered him to report to rehab.That left Sherrod to care for the boys for the next two months—unbeknownst to their mother, Melinda Seagroves, who lives in Houston.Early on the morning of May 15, a young man crept into the twins’ bedroom, lifted a still-sleeping Cash out of the toddler bed he shared with Carter, and walked out—a chilling scene captured in grainy black and white by a baby monitor.The footage, obtained by the Daily Mail, shows the intruder returning about two hours later, hovering over the bed where Carter remained in slumber, before abruptly leaving as though he was startled by something.By then, Cash was already dead.Antwainese Square, a Dallas teacher who lives in the area, was out for her morning walk around 6:45 a.m. when she saw a clump of hair on the ground she thought belonged to a dog.“I was on the phone with my mom,” Square told The Daily Beast. “As I got closer, I could see an arm and a foot and I just began crying, saying, ‘Mom, I think I'm coming up on a body.’ And I started, ‘Mommy, it’s a child! It’s a child!’ And the baby had blood all over his face. At that point, my mom told me to get off the phone with her and immediately call 911… The baby had ants all over the bottom of his feet. So I pretty much knew that he was gone.”Square said she remembers “being in denial,” and hoped Cash was actually just sleeping even though he was obviously dead. “I was just trying to put together all possible stories; there was no way in my mind that I would think somebody would do that to a kid,” she said, adding that she stayed with Cash’s body until police and paramedics arrived so no one would run over him.“One couple that was leaving out of their garage, I had to stop them to let them know that this baby was on the ground,” Square said.More than three hours later, Sherrod reported Cash missing. “The day that he was missing, I got up late and thought it was weird,” Sherrod would later tell the Daily Mail. “I was like, ‘It's 10 o'clock already, you guys.’ So I figured Cash was still in bed.” Cash Gernon was abducted out of his bed on May 15. Handout Later that day, police arrested Brown, 18, who lives with his parents about a half-mile from where Cash’s body was found, according to court documents. He was charged with kidnapping and burglary, but not murder because police said they are waiting for the result of forensic tests.Held in lieu of $1.5 million bail, Brown could not be reached for comment and does not have a lawyer listed in court records. His mother, Mimi, has told reporters that she believes her son is being framed.A tangled web of relationships, criminal records, and an unknown motive hangs over the case.Sherrod, the mother of several children, has a criminal record that includes assault and DWI. Trevor Gernon, who has an extensive rap sheet, appears to have vanished; a phone number listed under his name was disconnected. Darriynn Brown, meanwhile, is reportedly a friend of one of Sherrod’s children and had been seen playing with children in Sherrod’s care.Sherrod initially characterized any relationship she or her kids had with Brown, who attended the same high school as at least one of the boys living in her house, as minimal. She later told a reporter that Brown had visited her home two days before Cash’s murder, but she was out grocery shopping at the time.According to multiple neighbors, Brown was definitely not an unfamiliar face around the neighborhood. One told The Daily Beast the teen regularly played football and basketball with some of the kids who lived with Sherrod. Others said they had spotted Brown on their Ring security cameras hanging out in the area.Little information has emerged about Seagroves, who now has custody of Carter. Seagroves did not respond to multiple interview requests, but her mother, Connie Ward, told The Daily Beast this week: “We are not ready to give any kind of statement. My family is broken. It has been a nightmare listening and watching the news about our baby and stories being reported that are false.”Seagroves does not appear to have had any brushes with the law, but court records show both Sherrod and Gernon have records that include arrests for assaulting their own parents.In 2013, Sherrod pleaded guilty to attacking her mother, Lezlee Pinkerton. According to a criminal affidavit signed by Officer Glenn Burkheimer-Lubeck of the Harris County Constable’s Office, Sherrod “intentionally struck” Pinkerton in the head and chest with her hand and pulled her to the ground, then “cause[d] bodily injury” to Pinkerton “by stomping on [Pinkerton’s] toes with her feet.”“Complainant reports that she believes her toes are broken,” the affidavit says. Sherrod was sentenced to two years of community supervision, participation in a domestic violence treatment program, a $100 donation to a family violence center, and a $200 fine.In 2018, Gernon was arrested by deputies from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office for assaulting his father, Roger Gernon, during a dispute over a credit card bill, Texas court records show. When Roger Gernon told his son that he was going to call the police, Trevor grabbed the phone away, bloodied his dad’s arm with his fingernails, and elbowed him in the chest. Charged with misdemeanor assault and interference with an emergency telephone call, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 68 days in county jail.In addition to the assault of family members, both Sherrod and Gernon have a history of theft, fraud, and drug possession.Sherrod’s most recent arrest was for DWI; she has also pleaded guilty to identity fraud charges, meth possession, driving without a license, and misdemeanor theft.Gernon’s most recent arrest was for the possession of narcotics in 2020. He was previously charged for possession of methamphetamine in 2016. His rap sheet includes a range of other crimes.Neal Flanagan, who co-owns a corrosion-proofing business, told The Daily Beast he met Gernon in high school, then reconnected in 2016. He gave Gernon a bit of work because he was struggling. Then things went sideways.“My ex-wife and I were married at the time,” said Flanagan. “We had started having issues. She separated from me in January 2017. That’s when Trevor and her started seeing each other.”“I never did see him after,” said Flanagan. “A couple years later, he messaged me on Facebook. Like, ‘Hey buddy. How you been?’ Like nothing ever happened.""When he was sober, Gernon “was as good as you could ask for,” Neal’s father, Johnny Flanagan, said. But he added that he wasn’t surprised Gernon took off without his boys.“He's one of these guys that kind of goes whichever way the wind blows, you know, and he'll do good for several months and then do bad for several months and you know, just up and disappear,” Flanagan said.Gernon’s whereabouts are unknown. Following his indictment on felony drug possession charges last November, he failed to appear for a March 29, 2021, hearing and thus forfeited a $10,000 bond payment. There is now an open warrant out for his arrest.None of the various defense lawyers who represented Sherrod or Gernon in court agreed to speak, citing attorney-client privilege.Cash’s death has raised many questions about those responsible for him. But in the neighborhood where he spent his last months, the overriding mystery is why would someone kill a defenseless child and leave him on the street like trash. Steven Monacelli The solidly working-class Mountain Creek section of Dallas is a quiet place, bordered on one side by the 600-acre Cedar Ridge nature preserve. Houses are in decent shape, and yards are clean. On the street where Cash’s body was found, locals have been stopping at a shrine to leave toys, flowers, and other mementos.The woman who found Cash’s body, meanwhile, has been struggling with her emotions since that morning.“It's been difficult. It really has been difficult,” Square told The Daily Beast.“I have a 3-year-old and as we're dealing with this and processing this, I'm learning that I have little triggers. If I see a little boy, 4, 3, 5, I will burst out crying. It’s just a trigger for me. My own daughter is like a trigger. Sometimes she'll say something and I'll cry.“Because even though I didn't know that baby, he was just robbed of his life. So, it's been really hard. It's been really hard to just process this. And no matter how much you try to move on, you can't unsee what you saw.”Rohrlich reported from New York and Monacelli from DallasRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

97,97,FL-2019-000122-NGA,"Climate Change in Nigeria: Floods in Lagos, Abuja, Niger Delta are going to get a lot worse - Quartz Africa",https://qz.com/africa/1054825/climate-change-in-nigeria-floods-in-lagos-abuja-niger-delta-are-going-to-get-a-lot-worse/,"Earlier this year heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos, Nigeria’s economic nerve centre and one of Africa’s most populous cities. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

Pictures and videos later posted online showed dramatic and even bizarre scenes of flooding in the city, including the capture of a crocodile in the floodwater. Another video, which went viral, was one of a man kayaking in floodwater on one of the streets.

Lagos has not been alone. Suleija, a town near the capital city Abuja hundreds of kilometres away, suffered its own flooding challenge in early July. Heavy rains washed houses away and caused others to collapse, trapping occupants. Thirteen people were reported to have died.

The two primary factors of flooding in Nigeria are climate change and poor urban planning.

Some of the worst flooding in recent memory happened five years ago in March 2012 when 32 of Nigeria’s 36 states were affected, 24 severely. More than 360 people were killed and almost two million people were displaced.

The seriousness of the flooding was attributed to a combination of two events: very heavy local rainfall and the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in nearby Cameroon.

Although the degree and seriousness of flooding in Nigeria fluctuates, flooding remains a recurring phenomenon in most parts of the country. The first factor aggravating flooding is climate change, which has been shown to contribute to more extreme storms and rainfall. Another factor contributing to flooding in cities is that Nigeria has experienced rapid urban growth and planning is poor.

The problem of flooding is not peculiar to Nigeria alone. In 2007, floods affected 1.5 million people across several countries in Africa, including Uganda, Sudan, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and Niger. Alluvial flooding is common for major rivers—such as Nile, Niger, Benue, Orange, Zambezi—in Africa. Major cities in Africa are also susceptible to fluvial flooding which occurs when excessive rainfall, over an extended period of time, causes rivers to overflow.

Why Nigeria suffers

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria (1978 to 2007) suggests that rainstorms are getting more intense. The data show that there are fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed much from previous decades. This means that more rain is falling on the days that there is rain, which in turn means that rain storms in the city are getting more intense, increasing the threat of flooding.

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria suggests rainstorms are getting more intense with fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed.

In addition to more intense rain storms, the other possible cause of flooding in coastal regions is rising sea levels. Although up-to-date data on the rising sea levels in Nigeria are scarce, it’s believed that if nothing is done, this is likely to aggravate flooding in the future, particularly in coastal cities.

Areas at risk include Lagos, which is on the coast, as well as the Niger Delta region which has many low-lying towns and villages. Being on the coast also makes these places more susceptible to storm surges. While these areas are no stranger to floods, evidence suggests that floods have become increasingly common and intense in recent times.

In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the adjoining states. The changes in rainfall patterns, particularly in frequency and intensity, have meant that these events have begun to happen more frequently.

In Nigeria’s cities, the most common cause of flooding after excessive rains is poor drainage systems that can’t cope. This is called pluvial flooding. Lagos provides a good case study.

Lagos as a case study

Lagos has been urbanizing rapidly. By some estimates there will be 19 million in the city by 2050, making it the 11th most populous city in the world. It is also home to most of the country’s industrial, commercial and non-oil operations.

Urbanisation and industrialisation increase the number of roads and buildings. This in turn increases the proportion of surface area where water cannot be absorbed into the ground, leading to rapid runoff which then causes flooding during storms. And in cities that manage their infrastructure well, storm water drainage systems are built so that water can be directed to rivers efficiently and quickly.

Lagos has not kept up with its infrastructure needs. The growth and expansion of the city has been largely unregulated. The has resulted in inadequate and poor housing, the development of slum areas and inadequate water supply and waste disposal, among other problems.

What’s complicated the situation for Lagos is that many parts of the city were originally low-lying mangrove swamps and wetlands, which have been reclaimed and settled, mostly by poorer communities and more recently through concerted efforts by the government.

These low-lying areas are particularly at risk of flooding, and the situation is complicated by buildings being constructed on water ways, and bad waste dumping habits which block the drains.

Up to 70% of the population of Lagos live in slums.

What must be done

It’s clear Nigeria needs to take measures to cope with flooding. This will require both local and international interventions, and could include early warning and rapid response systems, flood data gathering and modelling, proper urban and spatial planning, flood emergency preparedness and political will.

The country can learn from others. For example, in Mumbai, India various measures have been implemented to reduce the impact of flooding. These have included an emergency control centre, automated weather stations, removal of solid waste from stormwater drains and the development of emergency response mechanisms. Nigeria must invest in these measures, and sustain them.

Video Transcript

DAVID TILLMAN: Hello, I'm meteorologist David Tillman with your one-minute weather forecast. The threat for heavy rain is not over, and it's going to come from moisture in the Gulf of Mexico that the National Hurricane Center is now giving a 20% chance of developing. So that's an 80% chance that it will not develop.

But all of this moisture is going to be lifting in our general direction. And that means for the next couple of days, it's going to be pretty wet around here. Things are quiet out there overnight, but this moisture is going to be moving in our direction.

We think the deep moisture will start to move in as we get into Friday afternoon. That's when scattered heavy downpours are going to be likely around southeast Texas. And there could be some instances of some street flooding as well with this activity. It'll last overnight on Friday into Saturday morning.

And off and on, on Saturday, we'll see these downpours around. That as we get into Sunday, we'll begin to see some of this rain hit off to the west of us, but not before producing a good one to two, maybe three inches of rain around southeast Texas.

There could be some isolated places that get up to four inches of rain. Here's the extended forecast. We're calling for an 80% chance for rain Friday afternoon, evening and night, 70% on Saturday, 40% on Sunday, and then we'll be back to 20% as we head into next week.","Fri, 21 May 2021 01:13:14 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/21/60a7071460b4aa6168ac7cfb/60a7071460b4aa6168ac7cfc_o_U_v2.jpg,"['southeast', 'rain', 'moisture', 'tillman', 'going', 'downpours', '20', 'system', 'chance', 'gulf', 'thats', 'tropical', 'heavy', 'development']", ,flood

0,0,FL-2019-000093-NGA,MATTERS ARISING: 28 states at risk of flooding -- how prepared is Nigeria? - TheCable,https://www.thecable.ng/states-risk-flooding-nigeria-2021,"Uche Igwe will not forget August 26, 2020 in a hurry. It had rained heavily that day in the capital city, Abuja. Trademore Estate in Lugbe, where Igwe runs a cybercafe business, was overrun by rainwater. The force of the flood pulled down the fence of Igwe’s office complex and destroyed a part of the building. In no time, the property was floating on water.

Igwe’s business was greatly affected as he lost machines and computers. It took his entire savings and the support of friends and family for him to be able to recover from the event of that day, he tells TheCable.

“I lost over two million naira worth of [electronics], my machines were all gone, my computers, everything. We didn’t expect such here,” he says.

Like Igwe, Victor Essang, a resident of Calabar, Cross River state capital, has also recorded losses to flooding.

First, his family lost a block of flats inherited from their grandparents, and later, his poultry business took a hit in 2016.

Igwe and Essang are just two of the many Nigerians who suffer the consequences of flooding that occurs yearly in different parts of the country during the rainy season.

SEVERE FLOOD PREDICTIONS

During the 2021 flood outlook presentation, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) announced that 28 states, including the FCT, will most likely experience flooding this year.

Similarly, the Nigeria Meteorological Agency, in its 2021 seasonal climate forecast, said the signals monitored by the agency in the last seven years show that things are changing on the climate front and that this year, Nigeria is expected to experience unprecedented heavy downpours.

The information is intended to alert Nigerians, government, relevant agencies and stakeholders of what is to come in order for them to prepare — prevent, mitigate and respond — for severe flooding.

Going by the alert, Igwe says he intends to raise his compound level to prevent rainwater from entering in the event of a flood.

On his part, Essang says he was already apprehensive about the severity of this year’s rainfall, even before the alert. He tells TheCable that he has relocated his belongings to a safer place.

“I have packed out my things to a safe place, I will bring them back when the rain stops. My only prayer is God will not let it bring our house down,” he says.

CLIMATE CHANGE A DRIVING FACTOR IN FLOODING

A report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) states that extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global climate change increase the likelihood of floods.

Chukwudi Njoku, a doctoral researcher on climate change at the University of Calabar, says flooding in Nigeria can be linked to both natural and human activities that influence changes in the climate.

“When there is high temperature, then there is increased possibility for evaporation – the process where water vapour is taken from the earth surface into the atmosphere — which can trigger much more rainfall,” he tells TheCable.

“The rising temperature here is a climate change feedback and when evaporation is increased, there is the possibility of more rainfall and when rainfall increases, simultaneously it could trigger flooding.”

Research by MOJ Ecology & Environmental Sciences (MOJES) has shown that human activities such as urbanisation, felling of forest trees and burning of fossil fuels, among others, lead to the emission of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.

According to the study, these activities distort the carbon cycle – the process in which carbon atoms move from the atmosphere to the earth and then back into the atmosphere. The activities also initiate climate change processes which involve a variety of changes including higher surface temperatures and changes to the hydrological cycle – the process in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and then back in form of rain.

Njoku believes that these human activities are what increases and make worse the impacts of climate change on humans and their environment.

“Such activities like urbanisation which is not properly done in a sustainable manner, for example, people building in floodplains and swampy areas which are supposed to serve as banks for water, thus reducing the ability of the environment to collect and keep excess water,” the researcher explains.

“Also, the clearing of forest areas for agriculture increases the extent of bare surfaces that would have hitherto collected runoff water and reduced the flow of water.

“These human activities are not sustainable and where they are not checked, they only go to increase the susceptibility of the people to flooding which appears to be inevitable at this time considering the increasing temperature and rainfall events.”

He advises that people living in flood-prone areas should be relocated and government should put laws in place to deter chaotic urbanisation, create more awareness about the potential increase in flooding events and their dangers, and also ensure that roads and drainages are constructed to accommodate the volume of water from the rain.

HOW IS GOVERNMENT PREPARING?

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), whose responsibility is to manage disasters, tells TheCable that the agency had information about imminent flooding since February through the seasonal climate predictions document made available by NIMET.

“Before that presentation by NIHSA, NEMA already had some information about the outlook of the rains and the consequences of the flood. So having the information, the agency had called together experts to analyse the predictions of NIMET and come out with a disaster risk management of the prediction,” says Manzo Ezekiel, public relations officer of NEMA.

“The secretary will soon convene a meeting of all the state emergency management agencies and relevant organisations that their activities or mandate have something to do with the management of floods.

“During that meeting, NEMA is going to communicate to them that this is the information we have and this information is going to cover your area of operation, what and what can you do about it. That is the next line of action that we have. That meeting will take hold very soon.”

The PRO said the zonal offices of the agency “are already on standby to take the information down to the specific communities that are at risk of flooding”.

He said the agency will ensure continuous engagement with Nigerians and create awareness at the federal, state, and local government levels to ensure that flooding does not take Nigerians by surprise.

“We are going to tell them that, this year there is a forecast of increased rainfall and this will likely interrupt your stay here,” he says.

SPEEDY MITIGATION EFFORTS NEEDED

While government agencies are still at the preparation stage, Igwe wishes they can speed up the process since the country is already in the rainy season.

He believes the annual flood events in his locality is a result of the lack of an adequate drainage system which the government had earlier promised to expand.

“I think the major cause is the drainage system. I wish the government could even rush down and do it for us today today today,” he says.

Igwe desires the speedy process because, according to him, the relief materials government agencies offer in the aftermath of flooding do not equate to the losses.

“When they were sharing their palliatives, I just refused; how can somebody lose about two point something million and you are giving him a pack of Indomie and small 5kg camping gas cylinder?” Igwe adds.","Thu, 20 May 2021 07:27:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FLOOD-PRONE-AREAS-IN-FCT1-1.png,"['information', 'water', 'process', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'arising', 'states', 'igwe', '28', 'nigeria', 'prepared', 'risk', 'agency', 'rainfall', 'matters', 'activities']", ,flood
1,1,FL-2019-000093-NGA,"Expect greater floods this year, FG tells Nigerians - Guardian",https://guardian.ng/news/expect-greater-floods-this-year-fg-tells-nigerians/,"Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, has said that Nigerians should expect more floods this year based on reports by Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA).

He spoke at the public presentation of 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) tagged “Managing Flood for Sustainable Development in COVID-19 Era” organised by NIHSA, yesterday, in Abuja.

Adamu said that 302 local government areas in 36 states, including Federal Capital Territory ( FCT), would fall within moderate flood risk areas while 121 councils in 28 states would be within the highly probable risk areas.

“This year, like 2020, we will be grappling with the two threats of the COVID-19 pandemic and related hygiene challenges as well as the impending floods as predicted in the AFO. The 2021 floods levels will be higher than in the previous years but will not attain the levels of the 2012 that was devastating,” he said.

The minister also warned that states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue, including Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nassarawa and Kogi, are likely to experience river flooding.

Others are Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa states. Coastal flooding is expected to affect Rivers, Cross River, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states.

“Flash and urban floods from heavy inundation are predicted to occur in some major cities. The severity would depend on availability and adequacy of drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.”

Adamu, therefore, called on all stakeholders, including policy makers and agencies, to rise up to the challenge of impending floods and threats of COVID-19.

Director General of NIHSA, Clement Nzeh, said: “States and relevant authorities as well as farmers must take the flood outlook serious by putting in place measures to mitigated its impact.

“There is a greater awareness for this year’s outlook in terms of the level of participation and political will, looking at representation, including governors, senators and key agencies. I believe they are going to cascade this to the grassroots.”

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has identified 10 local government areas in Cross River State that fall under the probable flood risk areas in view of the Annual Flood Outlook for 2021.

The agency also identified two local government areas in the state that falls under the highly probable risk areas for 2021.

The Director-General of NEMA, Muhammadu Muhammed, said this in Ikom Local Government Area while distributing relief materials to victims of windstorm in the area.

Mr Muhammed, who was represented by Godwin Tepikor, the zonal coordinator of NEMA, South-south, urged the state government to immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities to mitigate the impact.

He mentioned the 10 local government areas to include Yakurr, Calabar Municipal, Akpabuyo, Obubra, Bakassi, Ogoja, Biase, Etung, Odukpani and Ikom.

He said the two local government areas in the state that fall under highly probable risks areas were Calabar South and Abi.

“The state should immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities so as to mitigate the impact of the predicted flood on the vulnerable local government areas,” he said.

The agency distributed relief materials to over 1,000 households affected by windstorm in four communities in Ikom local government area of Cross River.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the distribution followed the windstorm disaster that occurred on May, last year, in Ogomogom, Akorofono, Nkarasi and Abinti communities, all in Ikom Local Government Area.

The director general said the items were approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, following the recommendation from the agency as humanitarian assistance to the affected persons.

The items distributed were bags of rice, beans and garri, tomato paste, kegs of palm oil, wrappers, blankets, bundles of roofing sheets, cement, bags of nails, zinc and ceiling boards.

He urged the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the items.

In his remark, the Director General, Cross River State Emergency Management Agency, Princewill Ayim, thanked NEMA for its intervention.

The Chairman of Ikom Local Government Area, Kingsley Egumi, thanked President Buhari and NEMA for the timely response to the concerns of their people, pledging that the items would be judiciously utilised.

Mfam Akong, who responded on behalf of the beneficiaries, thanked NEMA for its assistance.

3,3,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Why Lagosians should heed flood alert | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World NewsOpinion — The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/opinion/why-lagosians-should-heed-flood-alert/,"Sir: On April 14, 2021, the Lagos State Government predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state, therefore, directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic Implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello, “…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm. It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

In downscaling the predictions of the flood alerts, the state government is therefore collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET). In addition to what the Environment and Water Resources commissioner said, the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe declared, “I…urge residents to support the government to achieve flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again being littered by residents.”

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.

4,4,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Rainy season: Fears over impending flood in the land - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/rainy-season-fears-over-impending-flood-in-the-land/,"In fact, the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, who released the prediction, warned: “…the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Jolted by the report, many residents told The Guardian that they fear for the worst, noting that they had not recovered from the devastating effects of last year’s flood.

A resident in Bello Street in Ilasamaja area of the state, Tomiwa Sulaimon, said while she would love to move to another area before the rains start, it was not financially possible for her at this time.

She recalled: “Last year when it was raining almost everyday, our street and house got flooded every other day. This street is a bit low and erosion has eaten a good part of the road and despite our little efforts to keep the flood at bay, the water always finds a way to get in. The worst part is that those refuse disposal trucks hardly come around, claiming that we owe them for several months but if they hardly come around, how do they expect to get paid? They come around only once in a blue moon and in the meantime, we have to find a way to help ourselves. I want to plead with the government to tell them to improve on their services so that people are not forced to dump refuse indiscriminately.”

A shop owner, who identified herself as Blessing Ogbe, lamented that residents in the area were responsible for the constant flooding in the area whenever it rains.

Ogbe said: “The landlords and agents are very greedy. Once they see one small space, they will construct shops on it, most times blocking the water channels in the process. At Taiwo Junction and Transformer bus stop, that place is a major water channel but go and see for yourself. They have built a row of shops there now, blocking the gutter. So, anytime rain falls, the water has nowhere to go.

“The residents themselves are always so eager to throw refuse into the gutter when it is raining or by the roadside, some of which also end up in the gutter. The roads are bad and gutters are very narrow; so the water has nowhere to go as such. This has been a recurring problem for many years now and we have been making private efforts but we need the government to step in for us now.”

An estate agent whose office is located along Okota road, Yusuf Isa, expressed fears that his office might not survive another rainy season, lamenting that floodwater finds its way into the office with the smallest rainfall.

He said: “No matter how shortly it rains, this side of Okota road leading to Jakande Gate always gets flooded. We have carried out several interventions by ourselves and would appreciate if the government can step in now. We tried to channel the flood through Akiti to connect it to the canal at Oke-Afa but there is a limit to what we can do on our own. Because of this, Okota and Akiti are usually flooded but what can we do?”

Many residents in Oke-Afa, Okota, Ibeju Lekki and Ikorodu areas of the state, who spoke with The Guardian, also recounted similar tales of woe. Lagosians who reside along flood plains of major rivers and drainage channels such as Owode, Iwaya, Makoko, Badia, Ijora, Isaalu, Pota and Shibiri, among others, could not be reached. But Bello had advised them to always be on the alert and ready to move to higher grounds when the need arises, adding that they would be duly notified at the appropriate time.

He stated that the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) of the ministry had been consistently de-silting and working on various linkages to the secondary and primary channels to enable them discharge efficiently and act as retention basins.

Bello also disclosed that the government was maintaining the long-established synergy with Ogun-Oshun River Basin Authority, which had ensured control and monitoring of the steady and systemic release of water from Oyan Dam to prevent flooding the downstream reaches.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, an engineer, also stated that the state government would dredge about 221 collector drains and 32 primary channels measuring about 72 km spread across the 20 local councils of the state to checkmate flooding.

He reiterated that EFAG would continue to de-silt various tertiary channels and manholes measuring about 100 kilometres across the state.

While restating the present administration’s resolve to find a lasting solution to flooding in the state, he called on residents to desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on the rights of way of canals, adding that it was regrettable that several of the canals recently cleaned up were being littered with refuse.

Lagos might appear on top of the situation. But the problem of flooding at the peak of the rainy season is not limited to the state alone; it is a national problem. Since 2012 when floods killed 363 people and displaced over 2.1 million others from their homes between early July and November 5, no year has passed without the natural disaster claiming lives and property worth billions of naira in the country. From Lagos to Delta, Anambra, Imo, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Osun, Taraba and Kebbi states, among others, flood wreaks havoc on homes and farms yearly with adverse effects on the economy of the country and health of citizens.

The most recent report on the natural disaster, which was released by the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Muhammadu Muhammed, in early December 2020, stated that, “the devastating impact of the 2020 flooding killed 68 people, affected 35 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 320 local councils and over 129,000 people.”

Now, the question is: With another rainy season at hand and with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) predicting that “the country is expected to have rainfall amounts from 400mm in the North to over 3000mm in the South,” what are communities and the state governments doing to avert a reoccurrence? The Guardian spoke with relevant stakeholders in Akwa Ibom, Osun, Imo, Delta and Cross River states on the issue. The stories are as follows:

Solution To Your Flood Problem Underway, A’Ibom Govt Re-assures Apprehensive Residents

From Inemesit Akpan-Nsoh, Uyo

AS the rains begin to set in, residents of flood prone areas in Akwa Ibom State have sent a Save Our Souls (SOS) message to the state government to come to their aid so as to avert the perennial flooding they have been experiencing year in year out.

In Uyo, the state capital, residents in areas like Abak Road, Atiku Abubakar, IBB Avenue, Esuene Street, Ukana Offot/adjourning streets, Atan, Use and Effiat Offot communities have appealed to the government to replicate the ‘magic’ it used to control flooding and erosion along Oron road by Nsikak Eduok and Edet Akpan Avenue in their areas.

x

The residents noted that controlling the flood in their areas would enable them to access their homes, have their properties secured and ensure that they would no longer live in fear whenever rain is about to fall.

Mr. Okon Etim of Ukana Offot street told The Guardian that the flooding on his street had for several years rendered many persons homeless.

According to him, the government had always given affected residents relief materials when their household properties were destroyed, with a pledge to find a permanent solution to the menace.

He, however, lamented that successive governments had tried to remedy the situation to no avail. Offot said the situation appears to have worsened as houses along Calabar, Port Harcourt and Esuene streets and parts of the Federal Housing Estate are no-go-area once the rains set in.

Other residents, including Mrs. Nkoyo Akpan and Augustine Effiong, among others, also called on the government to come to their aid, adding that they could not afford the money to relocate or construct another apartment at the moment.

Findings by The Guardian, which the residents acknowledged, indicated that structures in the areas were built on the right of way, thereby blocking free flow of floodwater.



Responding to the cries of residents, the state Commissioner for Environment and Petroleum Resources, Mr. Charles Udoh, said government was aware of the problem, noting that it has, in conjunction with the World Bank, awarded the contract that would address it to China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) at an estimated cost of N12 billion.

Udoh stated that the 7.2-kilomtre flood control project covers 17 communities in three local councils; namely Uyo, Nsit Ibom and Ibesikpo Asutan.

His words: “The reality is that the government cannot go everywhere to de-silt gutters. So, while the government is doing the common areas, the government is calling on residents and citizens to also embark on de-silting of gutters. Flooding sometimes comes from bad habits like dumping refuse into gutters. We are also calling on our people to desist from dumping refuse into gutters. The waste management agency of the state is embarking on massive de-silting of drains all over the state.



“This is in addition to the three major flagship projects of the ministry that talks about water collection and harvesting, erosion control project, one in Etim Umana, one in Anua and then the IBB erosion control. IBB will not be completed this rainy season, but this is the last rainy season that everybody affected on the IBB corridor will face flooding. Once that is done, the entire Atiku Abubakar, Abak road axis, Mechanic village, State Secretariat, Atan, Effiat and Use Offot communities will be evacuated.

“We will also evacuate water from Area ‘C’ Police Command. All the water will be taken to the outfall drain and also taking water at some point of Ring Road Two. But we cannot complete the entire process within this rainy season. The IBB project is 8.4 kilometres, the biggest flood control project ongoing in Nigeria now.”



We Don’t Want To Abandon Our Homes Again, Osun Residents Cry Out

From Timothy Agbor, Osogbo

Some residents in flood-prone areas in Osun State have cried out to the state government to assist them in mitigating the problem this year.

Speaking with The Guardian, residents in flood-prone areas like Rasco, Gbonmi and Gbodofon appealed to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to save them from losing their houses to flood this year.

A landlord at Gbonmi, Mr. Suraju Kamaruden, said many house owners and residents in the community always relocate to safe areas when the rainy season is at its peak, adding: “We don’t want to abandon our houses again. That is why we are begging our government to come to our aid and help us.”

x

A trader at Rasco area in Osogbo, Mr. Jude Okpara, said traders in the area face difficult times during rainy season as flood always submerges their shops.

“We don’t have any other place to go. If not, we would have left this area. Although the government expanded the waterways about three years ago, the water still overflows its boundaries and submerges our shops. We are tired,” he lamented.

Chairman of Olorunwa Sawmill in Oke-Baale community, Osogbo, Mr. Sunday Ajewole, said there was an urgent need for government to construct a bigger drainage channel that would accommodate much floodwater when the rain is at its peak.

He said: “For the past seven years, we have been battling with flood. Every time we are in the rainy season, we always lose our planks to flood. Our government would always clear and expand the waterways every year but we are still battling flood. Most times when government fails to do something and we are approaching rainy season, we hire some labourers to help us clear the waterways. Sometimes we contribute between N80,000 to N100,000 and give to the dredgers. Still, we are not safe.

“We have discovered that the problem is that we have only one ring that forms the bridge of the waterways. And the ring is very small. The water that gushes from Ona-Baba-Ona area and Arogunmosa community would divert at our area and the ring doesn’t have the capacity to make it flow, as it should. It usually bounces back to where we stay, sweep our goods away and even sack residents out of their homes.

“This year, to lessen the severity of the flood, the government has cleared the waterways for us but once it rains heavily, there will be flood. Until the bridge is re-constructed and a bigger ring is fixed, we may not be out of this flood problem. We don’t have the financial strength to construct a bigger bridge and that’s why we are appealing to government to come to our aid.

“We have lost millions of naira worth of goods and property to flood in this area. We are afraid that if nothing is done again this year, property or even lives may be lost to flood because we have started seeing signs that it will rain heavily this year.”

To prevent a reoccurrence of flood in the state this year, the Osun State Waste Management Agency said it has been sensitising members of the public on the need to desist from dumping refuse on floodwater channels.

T

he General Manager of the agency, Mr. Fatai Oyewole, told The Guardian in Osogbo that efforts were ongoing to rid major gutters of refuse.

“We have been mobilising people not to dump refuse on waterways and major gutters,” he said. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment has disclosed that it opened up some streams across the state during the dry season for easy flow of water. This, according to the coordinator of the ministry’s Department of Flood Control, Samorudeen Odesanmi, an engineer, was part of the state government’s efforts at preventing another incident of flooding in the state.

“This government is proactive. Before the advent of this rainy season, we optimised the opportunity of the dry season to open up series of streams across the state for easy flow of water. If at all we are going to do anything on flood control, it would be minimal.

“We have already marked off some areas we want to work on this year and they are waiting for governor’s approval. Much had been done before now and we are on top of the situation,” he said.

Imo Commences De-silting Of Drainages, Vows To Demolish Houses Built On Waterways

From Charles Ogugbuaja, Owerri

AS this year’s rainy season gradually sets in, residents in Imo State and the state government have commenced preparations to mitigate the likely effect of flooding.

x

The flood-prone local councils in the state are the riverine areas of Oguta, Ohaji/Egbema and Orsu, among others. The locals in these communities began to experience massive flooding since 2012, which has resulted in loss of lives and destruction of their property. The flood, which occurs at the peak of every rainy season, had forced many residents to abandon their homes and relocate to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), where both the state and national emergency management agencies lent them helping hands.

A resident in Oguta, Jude Igwe, who called for quick intervention by the government, told The Guardian that he would not want a repeat of his past experiences this year, likewise other members of his family. He said: “Since 2012, almost on a yearly basis, we living in riverine areas have been witnessing flooding. It is not something to behold. Now that the rains are setting in, we appeal to the state government to prepare and assist us in time. Some of us are poor. We shall be relocated to camps as usual. So, we are calling for early preparation in case such occurs.”

Also, an indigene of Orsu, who identified himself simply as Okechukwu, recounted how his family lost valuable property in previous years and called for help.

“I am not ready to allow flood engulf us again. We are preparing ahead of time. But government and good spirited individuals should please come to our assistance ahead of time. We also want government to build gutters that will channel water to the rivers,” he said.

A community leader in Ohaji, Saturday Ochia, however, urged residents to desist from blocking waterways with refuse. He said: “We want our people to adhere to the simple environment-friendly rule of clearing the waterways. We do not want to witness flooding this year in our community. We are educating our people.”

Speaking with The Guardian, the Commissioner for Environment, Dr. Ikechukwu Njoku, said the state government was not leaving anything to chances, adding that it has commenced public enlightenment on appropriate waste disposal and clearing of drainages by holding town hall meetings with the monarchs, local government officials, community leaders and residents. He also disclosed that the ministry has commenced de-silting of drainages in Owerri, the state capital.

According to Njoku, the government has marked structures built on waterways for demolition, stressing that they were constructed in contravention of the state’s master plan.

He also gave assurance that the government has put a robust plan in place to ensure flood-free environment in the state capital and other communities, stressing that the Governor, Hope Uzodimma, would ensure the construction of standard drainage systems in the state.

Delta Is Already Prepared To Tackle Flooding, Commissioner Says

From Monday Osayande, Asaba

DELTA State government has declared that it was fully prepared to mitigate the impact of flood in coastal areas of the state this year.

The Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Christ Onogba, made the declaration in an interview with The Guardian in Asaba. Onogba noted that the state did not have to wait for NIMET or other agencies’ prediction on the effect of flood before putting things right.

“Firstly, we keep on saying to everyone that we are in the era of climate change, so those communities living in the coastal line should find alternative homes before the rains set in,” he noted.

According to the commissioner, it was necessary for flood victims to have alternative abode because government was no longer ready to build camps for those that might be displaced by flood due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We cannot set up camps as it used to be, but that doesn’t mean we are sleeping. In fact, we have done a lot. We are resetting the drains, and very shortly, we will open one of the channels that is flowing into the River Niger, and good enough, the road side drain in Asaba is clean and working fine.

“The government is prepared and we will never be taken unaware in the issue of flood. And because we understand that because of climate change, flooding is something that must happen, we will not wait for any prediction before we start making our preparations,” he emphasised.

A resident in Ndokwa East council, Mr. Emma Agboma, lamented that several homes had collapsed in the area in the past as a result of flooding.

“I think now that we are approaching rainy season, government should exercise its power early so that we are not taken unaware. They should be alert so that they can relocate some of us to upland. Many are willing to leave their houses but it is not easy to relocate from where you are used to over the years.

“Government should do as much as possible to mitigate our suffering in riverine areas – Burutu, Bomadi and Patani. So, government should do the needful by building camps early enough for us to relocate,” he said.

For Dave Ogochukwu, while government should try to evacuate people in flood-prone areas to avoid loss of lives, residents should also not dispose refuse indiscriminately, thereby blocking waterways.

“The property that has been lost since 2012 till date is enormous and it is not good for the growth of the society. In recent times, several farmlands have been overrun by flood putting farmers in a difficult situation.

“Over the years, government has made efforts to relocate people from the flood-prone areas but some people have been adamant. However, government should continue to sensitise the people on the need to relocate before the flooding begins,” Ogochukwu added.

‘We Have Been Crying Out To Government For Help’

From Agosi Todo, Calabar

LAST year during the peak of the rainy season, many communities in Cross River State experienced heavy flooding that destroyed farms and homes. Over 300 residents in the state were left homeless and properties worth millions of naira destroyed due to heavy rainfalls.

The rains destroyed farmlands specifically in Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Biase and Boki local councils of the state.

Some of the residents at Ikot Eka Edem in Calabar Municipal local council identified building of houses on waterways as the cause of flooding in the area.

A resident, Mr. Gab Otei, said he was apprehensive ahead of this year’s rainy season, lamenting that he lost his valuables to flood last year.

Otei said: “Last year, the heavy rains wreaked havoc in the whole of this street. I lost my valuables because I was trying to save my little children from being taken away by the flooding.

“I cannot leave this place because this is my father’s house and I stay here with my family. For years now, we have been crying to government at all levels to come to our aid and open the canals for free flow of water, but no response.”

A resident in Kakwagom community in Boki local council, Mr. Augustine Ita, said: “Last year, most of the yam and cassava farms were basically destroyed. We lost everything and you know that hunger was the effect of it. What those of us who farm in the riverine areas are trying to do now is to either cultivate earlier or make your mounds to be bigger than what it used to be, because if the mounds are very big, and the crop are up there, if the flood comes, it starts from the bottom of the mound. If God is on our side, we will still have something to hold on to. It depends on the strength of your mounds and how heavy the flood will be.”

Speaking with The Guardian on measures the state government was taking to safeguard lives and properties against flood this year, the Director General of Cross River State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr. Princewill Ayim, disclosed that last year, over 510 persons were displaced by flood across the state.

Ayim stated that although the state had not received the yearly prediction from concerned government agencies on what to expect this year, the agency has started sensitisation campaign in communities in Calabar South, Calabar Municipality, Boki, Biase, Odukpani and Etung local councils that are prone to flood.

He lamented that people living in flood-prone areas refuse to relocate to safe areas because they insist on remaining in their ancestral homes.

Ayim explained: “The way we do it every year is that we get informed from the national bodies. They tell us when there will be heavy flood and what to expect. For now we have not gotten any prediction but we cannot keep on waiting. We need to be proactive by engaging ourselves in activities that can mitigate heavy flood.

“We have our local emergency committees spread across all the 18 local councils. They interface with the locals to inform them more about flooding and how to prepare for it. And at the same time, we are also collaborating with the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC). Luckily, we are among the states that installed emergency outfit; so if you are in distress and do not have airtime in your phone, you can dial the 122 free toll number through which help can come to you. That is in place already.

“Apart from that, we use the media houses to educate the public to clear their drainage channels and to cut the entire weeds on the waterways. If you go to Calabar South for example, you see some stagnant water that if you don’t look very well you won’t know there is an artificial pool there.”","Sat, 24 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rainy-season.jpg,"['rainy', 'residents', 'water', 'world', 'flooding', 'waterways', 'flood', 'impending', 'season', 'area', 'guardian', 'nigeria', 'land', 'state', 'areas', 'fears']", ,flood

Speaking at the public presentation of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency’s (NIHSA) 2021 annual flood outlook (AFO) in Abuja on Thursday, Adamu said the flood projection in different states are of varying severity.

He said states surrounding River Niger and Benue will experience “severe flooding”, adding that it will aggravate the problems created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This year, we will be grappling with the two threats of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the impending floods as predicted in the AFO,” NAN quoted him as saying.

“The flood projections show varying severity across parts of the country.

“In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 local government areas (LGAs) in 36 states including the FCT will fall within the moderate probable flood risk areas.

“It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the highly probable risk areas.

“The states surrounding Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience severe flooding.

“Floods come with attendant health risks through the contamination of potable water sources. The 2021 flooding will be exacerbated by the continuing ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The minister noted that the 2012 flood which brought massive destruction of lives and property across the country necessitated the creation of a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront a reoccurrence.

According to him, the NIHSA forecasts have increased citizens’ awareness and led them to take measures to prevent severe flood damage.

He urged stakeholders, including policy makers and tiers of government, to take appropriate measures such as clearing of waterways and flood paths to contain it.","Thu, 06 May 2021 17:12:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Flood-Gwagwalada.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'varying', 'states', 'minister', '28', '2021', 'covid19', 'afo', 'risk', 'severe']", ,none

Rather than being a blessing, the rains have become a curse to many Nigerians, especially to coastal states and communities living along the bank of Rivers Niger and Benue. The federal government has issued a flood alert. Will the 2021 predictions go the way of others? TONY AKOWE reports

Since the devastating flood in Nigeria in 2012, it has become important for the government and its agency to make an annual forecast of possible flood and its impact in the country annually. Since the first forecast was made in 2013, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, working with other government agencies, has consistently warned the nation of impending flood across the country and in most cases, the intensity of such flood. Unfortunately, warnings by the agencies have often been ignored by both the people and state governments and their agencies. This year, the government has said not less than 121 local government areas across 28 states are at highly probable risk of heavy flooding, while another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will experience some level of flooding.

Flooding is categorised into river flooding, coastal flooding as well as flash and urban flooding occasioned by poor drainages, blocked drainages and poor adherence to town planning regulations.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) said flooding accounts for 15% of all natural disaster related deaths across the globe.

Floods have since become annual phenomena not only in flood plains, but also in urban and semi-urban areas. Experts link urban flooding to inadequacies of drainage channels that have become too small to contain excess runoff, the use of river channels as waste repositories thus clogging the channels, poor compliance with or non-existence of land use zoning/building codes, poor waste management practices, and removal of vegetation that create resistance and minimise flood impact. Coastal areas of Nigeria are not spared from flooding as they may be worst hit by flood this year. Interestingly, more states in Nigeria are increasingly suffering from annual flooding due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Unfortunately, Nigeria is located downstream of Rivers Niger and Benue, and therefore abounds with water resources that become a menace by causing flooding and flood disasters, the worst of which was experience in 2012 when hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property loss running into billions of naira including massive farm lands and crops when water was released from the a dam in Cameroon.

A close study of the predictions revealed that all the 20 local government areas in Lagos State (as against 18 in 2020) are likely to be affected with eight of them being at higher risk of heavy flooding. Apart from urban and river flooding, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Delta and Ondo states stand the risk of heavy coastal flooding. In 2020, similar predictions by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency and advice to states and local government areas to take precautionary measure to mitigate the flood fell on deaf ears in most parts of the country. The consequence was the displacement of over 2.3 million people and the death of 69 others. The outcome was also the washing away of farm lands in Kebbi and Jigawa as well as livestock and other valuables. The agency has continuously expressed concern over disregard for town planning regulations leading to people building on flood plains.

Minister for Water Resources Suleiman Adamu, who announced the 2021 prediction on behalf of the agency, said 121 local government areas in 28 states and the FCT as well as another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will likely experience high and moderate flooding in 2021. Acting on information from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, the minister also said there would be heavy coastal flooding in Rivers, Cross Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states. He stressed the need for concerted efforts to mitigate the impact of the expected flood.

He said: “So far, the flood levels will be higher than in previous years, but will not attain the levels of the 2012 devastating floods. In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 LGAs in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will fall within the moderate probable Flood Risk Areas. It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the Highly Probable Risk Areas. The states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience river flooding. These states and the number of local government likely to be affected include Abia (9), Akwa Ibom (2), Anambra (5), Bauchi (2), Bayelsa (5), Benue (3), Cross River (2), Delta (8), Ebonyi (4), Edo (1), FCT (2), Gombe (7), Imo (3), Jigawa (9), Kaduna (2), Kano (2), Kebbi (4), Kogi (9), Kwara (2), Lagos (8), Nasarawa (2), Niger (5), Ogun (3), Oyo (7), Rivers (12), Sokoto (7), Taraba (7) and Zamfara (1).”

The list of states to be affected by one form of flood or the other in 2021 show that northern and coastal states are at a greater risk of flooding this year, with some states along the River Niger and Benue are also likely to be affected. Adamu said flash and urban floods from heavy inundation were predicted to occur in some major cities, the severity of which would depend on the availability and adequacy of the drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.

He said: “The information contained in the AFO 2021 is a Clarion call to all stakeholders, policy makers, Federal, States and Local Governments, Departments and Agencies to rise and set up appropriate mechanism such as clearing the waterways and flood paths as well as maintaining proper water disposal management practices to curtail the ravages of the impending flood and threats of COVID-19. The year 2012 is a landmark in the annals of flood occurrence in Nigeria. It brought with it massive destruction of lives, property and critical national infrastructure. The need arose therefore, to put in place a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront the menace of this disaster of flooding, hence the coming into being of APO in the year 2013. The 2021 Annual Flood Outlook built on the successes of the previous eight (8) years forecasts by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency. The outcomes of these forecasts have been the increased awareness by the citizenry with respect to measures that need to be taken before, during and after floods. This has culminated in the progressive reduction in the severity of flood and its harmful effects on lives and property. The timeliness in the release of these forecasts is quite commendable and deserving of every possible support by all of us.”

He believed that man’s interaction with natural process has been both helpful and harmful to some degree, adding that the negative impact of man’s activities can be observed in the heightened climate change being experienced globally by way of rising temperatures, intensified rainfall, more destructive storms and floods. He maintained that the annual prediction by the agency is designed to create awareness of the inherent dangers of flooding and to inform people about locations that are prone to Flood risk at a particular time and encourage them to take appropriate actions.

Drawing attention to the 2020 experience, the minister said: “The year 2020 saw the devastating impact of extreme flood across the country with practically every state of the federation affected in one way or the other. The flood affected 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 349 Local Government Areas (LGAs) within the 36 States were affected and over 2,353,647 people were displaced with a record of 69 deaths. Kebbi and Jigawa States were worst hit with regards to agricultural lands and houses destroyed. Apart from the physical damages, other indirect losses are often overlooked. These indirect and intangible impacts are generally associated with disruption to normal life as well as long term health issues and stress-related illnesses. We must recognise that extreme weather and flooding extents do happen and that we need to be well equipped to respond to them. I am confident that our communities, infrastructure and businesses will be better protected if due attention is given to the information contained in this 9th edition of the Annual Flood Outlook.”

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs. Didi Walson-Jack, said: “The overall objective of this event is to sensitise the nation (i.e planners, decision and policy makers, farmers, stakeholders) and the general public towards embarking on preventive measures to improve on safety and reduce potential damages to lives and property from predicted flood events.”

She said the event was expected to provide ample opportunity for enlightenment campaigns in the media for better Preparedness on flood mitigation, control and management in flood risks locations across the country. She maintained that the accuracy of the predictions over the years have been fairly high and reliable, stressing however that “the focus is rather on prevention and mitigation of possible flood disasters by increasing the awareness of the populace and prompting them to take appropriate preventive, adaptive and mitigative measures”.

The Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd), stressed the need to strengthen multi-agency approach to disaster risk reduction in the country.

Mohammed said: “To enhance flood forecasting and management in Nigeria, NEMA is currently supporting NIHSA in establishing three Automatic Weather Observation Stations which are at various stages of installation located in Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti and Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. These stations will be used not only for hydrological predictions but also to train students in the field of Geography, Engineering, Agriculture, meteorology, climate change and other sciences”. He said further that “one of the lessons learnt during the 2020 flood after action review meeting is the need for proper utilization of our dams in the country. When dams meant for irrigation purpose are used for dry season agriculture, they acquire more capacities to hold more water in the rainy season. In addition, a timely controlled release of water from dams will reduce panic release of water during rainy season that can lead to further flooding.”

The Director-General of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze said government at all levels in the country must take necessary steps to avert a possible disastrous effect of flood in 2021. Nze said as the rains begin to set in, the country was gradually inching towards the peak of rainy season with its attendant flood incidents. He said Nigeria’s geographical location downstream of all the countries in the Niger Basin places it at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollution from all countries upstream, adding that this explain why persistent flooding has become an annual event since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster.

He argued that the annual flood forecast was to enable states and local government as well as individuals take concrete steps now to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past few years including clearing of blocked drainages and canals, removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinth and floats on water channels. People living along water ways as well as those having socio-economic activities in such areas should be encouraged to relocate o safer areas before the peak of rains, while there should also be an improved system for flood monitoring, flood forecasting and early warnings. He stressed that states must intensify soil conservation measuring techniques on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and encourage ecosystem protection, while also enhancing the enforcement of town planning code to allow for the construction of houses and drainage structures.

He said further that while it was not possible to eradicate flooding, efforts should be made to either reduce or minimise it, adding that state governments must educate their people, insisting that states must make efforts to avoid a repeat of the incidences of 2020 which saw over 450,000 hectare of rice plantation being washed away in Kebbi state alone as a result of flooding. Nzeh lamented that while the agency has continued to give early warning signs, many states in the country have failed to listen to the recommendations of the agency, adding that at the moment, Jigawa state has set up a committee that is working to reduce incidences of flooding in the state in line with recommendations from the agency.

The NIHSA’s Director of Hydrogeophysics, Stephen Margima Jabo, said flooding has become a global phenomenon that has increased in frequency over the years. According to him, the effective management of flood risk should be a collective responsibility of all stakeholders from the federal, state, and local to individual levels, adding that the existing synergy between Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, stakeholders and other collaborative agencies involved in flood management and disaster issues should be further strengthened. He said government at all level should also put in place measures for better town planning and effective land use zoning, effective flood disaster management in the changing environment, improved biodiversity and ecosystem management for the enhancement of rapid and sustainable development in the country. States, he said should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers particularly, where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood waters will not be lost to the sea.

The agency said among others that “stakeholders in the water sector should carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas by the removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers to improve their conveyance capacities and from dams, lakes and reservoirs to increase their storage capacities for the containment of the incoming floodwaters; there is need for construction of weirs, small reservoirs on tributary, streams and rivers for conservation of flood water to be used during the dry season thereby preventing desert encroachment, increasing irrigation food crop production, improvement of grassland areas, nomadic settlement, peace and sustainable development by relevant government agencies; intensification of soil conservation measuring technics on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and increase ecosystem protection among others; enforcement of Town Planning Codes in the country to allow for the appropriate construction of houses, and drainage structures and constantly freeing the waterways from obstructions and provision of adequate refuse dumping facilities by relevant authorities.”","Tue, 11 May 2021 00:15:10 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Flood-1.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'happen', 'local', 'flood', 'waiting', 'states', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'country', 'state', 'areas']", ,flood
7,7,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Collaborative Call to Mitigate Flooding - THISDAY Newspapers,https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/04/26/collaborative-call-to-mitigate-flooding/,"Udora Orizu writes that the widespread destruction and loss of lives caused by flooding in 2020, calls for all hands on deck by all tiers of government to put in place structures and adhere to warnings issued by flood monitoring agencies ahead of the next flooding season

September 12, 2020, around 8:00pm, residents of Alapere area of Lagos State, raised alarm as another flooding tragedy struck. Two yet-to-be-identified children were swept away as people battled flood after a heavy rainfall that lasted for hours and led to destruction of properties.

This is just one of the horrific, heart-wrenching experiences Nigerians go through, following havoc wreaked by floods every year. Yet nothing is done by stakeholders to ameliorate the disaster.

Nigeria with a population of over 200 million people, faces numerous natural disasters, with flooding being the most common. Most states in the country are increasingly suffering from annual flooding during the rainy seasons. However unlike some natural disasters, rainfall flooding can be controlled with proper planning and the provision of necessary infrastructure.

Flooding in Nigeria is usually caused by climate change, river overflowing, dam opening, current poor urban planning practices, poor drainage systems that can’t cope and so on. In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the neighboring states.

Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals. The immediate impact of it include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases. These were seen recurring this year, in various states of the federation.

Havoc in Some States

In a report on October last year, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods since September have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across 22 states in Nigeria. Furthermore, around 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people were reported to be displaced.

According to the Red Cross, the overflowing Benue and Niger rivers caused severe floods in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara States from October 6, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. At least 57 people died, 473 were injured and 22,357 displaced. Flooding was also reported in southern parts of the country, Bayelsa, Anambra, Rivers and Delta States, were affected and fatalities reported.

One of the most devastating impact of floods was seen in Kebbi State. The flood swept away villages and peoples, displacing families and destroyed about 90 per cent of crops, putting the country’s food security at risk. Over 30 lives were lost, hundreds of houses destroyed and thousands of residents displaced by the devastating flood that sacked communities in the state.

The losses incurred by the farmers, particularly rice farmers in Kebbi State were colossal and immeasurable , they run into billions of naira . Thousands of hectares of fadama rice farms in the state were affected by the flood. Rice farms , other agricultural crops, livestock and even communities were not spared by the raging floods.

Chairman of the State Emergency Management Authority (KSEMA), Alhaji Sani Dododo, revealed that five different bridges had been washed away across the state.

The Birnin-Kebbi-Makera-Kangiwa road, an international highway, which runs from the state capital to Niger Republic, is at the risk of caving in at Duku. Some of the minor bridges and culverts along the highway are already caving in, following erosion caused by rising water overflowing the nearby River Rima.

Also, the Bagudo-Tuga-Kaoje route, which leads to Benin Republic border, including the Tuga Bridge, is also submerged, cutting border communities. Dododo, who confirmed the number of deaths recorded so far, said 10 people died in a boat that capsized at Ihiru in Jega Local Government.

“Only eight bodies have so far been recovered; a family of six – father, mother and children were wiped away in Arewa council area. We recorded one death in Yauri, among others. The numbers may increase, since we are experiencing rainfall daily. In Bagudo council area is the worst hit by the flooding, as it was learnt that 98 per cent of the villages were affected.

In Iwaro Oka community of Akoko South West Local Government area, Ondo State

a middle-aged man was swept away by flood. Sources said the motorcycle of the farmer, identified as Akede, was seen inside the river very close to a popular filling station, which made people aware that the farmer was missing. Family members were thrown into mourning when all efforts to find him proved abortive. His body was later recovered in a river very close to St Patrick’s College, Iwaro Oka.

In Lokoja, Kogi State, the road linking Kogi East and Eastern Nigeria to the state capital was flooded for days as canoe and boats were employed to navigate the roads which is meant for cars and other road users.

In Niger State, officials of the state government visited communities submerged by flood to ascertain the extent of damage and to enable government render assistance to victims.

In Kano State, the Kano Emergency Management Agency confirmed four persons killed and over 5,200 houses destroyed due to flooding in Rogo and Danbatta Local Government Areas of the state. He disclosed that two persons lost their lives and 200 houses destroyed in Rogo, while two other persons and over 5,000 houses were destroyed by flood in Danbatta.

Also the South-south and South-east were wreaked by flood havoc. South-south states like Delta had over 150 houses submerged by flood. In South-east, Anambra for instance, over 5,000 persons have been displaced by flood that submerged houses, schools and churches in the Ogbaru Local Government Area. The Chairman of the council, Arinze Awaogu, said about 1,000 of the displaced persons were being catered for at Internally Displaced Persons’ camps in the area, while many others trapped in their communities needed evacuation.

He said, ”Over 5,000 families have been displaced, while churches, schools and many residential houses have been submerged by flood, with farm crops destroyed and displaced persons seeking refuge in Onitsha and surrounding communities. At the moment, we are housing over 1,000 IDPs; we have over 5,000 persons who have been displaced; some are taking refuge in the residences of their relatives, who live upland, including Onitsha. We need the Federal Government’s assistance in the areas of donation of food items, non-food items, medical supplies, establishment of sick bays and sending enough medical personnel to help in handling the situation; our fear now is that of a possible outbreak of epidemic.”

Earlier in the year, heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

In Abuja, four Area Councils, Bwari, Gwagwalada, Abaji and Kwali which are prone to flood were affected by the disaster with Gwagwala being the worst hit in July as eight lives were lost, over 100 houses submerged and properties destroyed. On July 25, after a heavy downpour which lasted for hours, five residents were swept away and several houses and cars destroyed in Gwagwalada, Dawaki, Giri and Zuba where the flood cut the bridge linking Ikwa, Yimi and other villages.

The incidence was confirmed by the Director General of FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Idris Abbas who had said there was a building collapse in Dawaki as a result of the flood. Gwagwalada is flooded from Giri. A family of five were flooded at Giri.

“We got one body and still searching for four. We rescued six people and are in the hospital. The flood has damaged a lot of houses and property, especially at Gwagwalada. The residents are still saying some are missing but they cannot give us the identities of such persons who they claim to be missing. People should be careful when it is raining. They should not drive on water. They should not build on flood plain. They must respect the master plan of FCT and ensure that all drainages are clean. What happened in Giri-Gota was because people built on flood plain”, he said

Federal Lawmakers Laments

Back in September, the Kebbi State Caucus in the House of Representatives while commiserating with the government and people of the state on the recent flood disaster that ravaged the entire state, said the disaster is a major setback to the federal government effort to boost local rice production as part of measures to end rice importation.

The Chairman, Hon. Muhammad Jega, representing Gwandu/Aliero/Jega federal constituency, lamented that the disaster could not have come at a worse time for the farmers who were looking forward to a bumper harvest this year to reduce the rising cost of food items.

The lawmaker, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari and the state Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, for the prompt response to reduce the hardship caused by the flood, also urged them to as a matter of urgency send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state.

Jega further urged the federal government to commission a study with the aim of providing a lasting solution to the perennial flood disaster in the state.

According to him, “The flood is a serious setback towards addressing food security in the country; the government, therefore, needs to address the shortfall of the food supply chain to reduce the hardship and cost of food items in the market, and also address the severe environmental degradation caused by the flood. This may include adequate and early preparation for dry-season farming and reconstruction of major infrastructures affected in the state.

‘’The estimated cost of the disaster is over N10 billion across the state. We call on the federal government as a matter of urgency to send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state, as early preparation for dry season farming should commence in earnest with provision of seedlings, fertilizer and other inputs to be made available to the farmers in good time.’’

Also, a member of the House of Representatives, representing Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency of Delta State, Hon. Ossai Nicholas Ossai, decried the submerging of over 150 houses in Delta State, by devastating floods.

He said that since past two weeks, the Ndokwa East Communities of Delta State have been bedeviled by constant and frightening heavy downpour, being accompanied by excessive flooding and erosion, that is seriously and presently wreaking havoc in the Communities.

According to him, the affected communities are; Ossissa, Onyah, Ase, Ushie, Ibedeni; Asagba, Aballa-Uno, Agballa-Obodo, AgballaOshimili, Uchi, Okpai, Onuaboh, Inyi, Benekuku, Aboh, Onyah, Asaba-Ase, Ibrede, Ashaka, Afor, Abalagáda, Umuolu, Igbuku, Obettim, Obodo-Okolafa, Iyadama,0nuogboko, UtagbaOgbe, Utagba-Uno, Ogume, Onitsha-Ukwuani, Akarri, Umuolu, just to mention a few”.

He said he was disturbed that “schools, farmlands, health centres, places of worship have seriously been affected and over 150 households has been rendered homeless particularly children and women and more is still being affected daily. About 90per cent of the ommunities in the entire Ndokwa East Local Government Area has been submerged,and worse still is the deplorable economic conditions of the peasant farmers in these agrarian communities”.

He observed that these communities are often prone to serious environmental disaster as a result of vulnerability of constant coastal flooding and erosion from the River Niger”.

The legislator, pleaded with the Federal Governnment, to Direct the Ecological Fund office to conduct an environmental survey with a view to addressing the excessive flooding in these Ndokwa Communities and urge the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to urgently provide relief materials for the Hood victims in accordance with section 6 of NEMA Act.

NIHSA Flood Alerts

In February, the Director General of Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze, alerted the government, stakeholders and all citizens to use this period of dry season to prepare ahead for 2021 flooding.

Nze lamented that Nigeria currently doesn’t have enough dams, saying more dams would help to mitigate floods.

He explained that with the increasing global population and the expanding activities of man, flooding would continue to persist, hence the need to control human activities, environmental adjustment and purposefully adopting actions in certain areas that would make adjustment possible.

According to him, “Flooding problem is a global environmental issue which is faced by many countries worldwide, particularly in areas close to low lying terrains and river valleys. Over the past years, there have been increasing concerns that human actions and natural catastrophes have been adversely impacting the environment, posing serious ecological and environmental hazards.

“Though flood is a natural environmental phenomenon, it can be greatly accelerated by human-induced activities as it is the case worldwide. Some floods may result in major disasters involving structural and erosion damages, disruption of socio-economic activities, loss of lives and properties, displacement of people, destruction of agricultural land and contamination of water and environment in general.”

The director general said this is the appropriate time to construct drainages where they are necessary (but not provided), dredge river channels, clear blocked gutters and drainages, and pull down structures that are within the floodplains and flood paths.

“There is a reasonable time to do that before the rains set in. According to the 2020 Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public recently by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), February 24 and June 22 are the predicted onset of rainfall in the South-south and Northern states respectively, while the respective predicted cessation dates are December 28th and September 26th. This implies that Nigeria is likely to experience longer period of rainy season in 2020 compared to year 2019,” he added.

Again, in September, the agency warned members of the public to expect more floods in the months of September and October.

Nze, gave the warning at a press briefing in Abuja, saying that the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country.

Nze explained that any release of excess water from the dams in countries upstream Rivers Niger and Benue this year would have more negative impacts on Nigeria, which is located downstream of countries in the Niger Basin.

He identified the highly vulnerable states as Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa.

He said that the flood that ravaged Kebbi State just about a week ago left so many damages and noted that the current flooding situation called for vigilance on the part of all the stakeholders.

The director general called the states and local governments as well as multi-national companies and public-spirited individuals to join hands to save the country from the consequences of “twin pandemic” (COVID-19 and flood) in the year 2020.

Nze warned: ‘’The rains are finally here. The volume of river flows on our river is surging and river channels could no longer accommodate significant runoff as floodplains, which traditionally serve the alluvial plains and are rich in agricultural productivity, lost its retention capacity to give way to flooding of adjacent lands.

“Farmlands and crop yields are being lost to furry of floodwaters, livestock and ecosystem species are diminishing while hope for livelihood hang in the balance due to monumental economic losses.

‘’As a matter of fact, all the states of the federation have suffered several degrees of flooding since June 2020. The danger is not yet over. Information received from the regional Niger Basin Authority (NBA) by NIHSA, has it that as at 7.30am today September 10, 2020, the River Niger flood level in Niamey, Niger Republic, attained an unprecedented level of 7.02m (702cm). This is a far cry from the value of 6.60m which I reported in my last press briefing of August 25, 2020.

“Noting that the Red Alert Warning Zone in Niamey is 6.20m and above, the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country, Nigeria, which is at the Lower portion of Niger Basin within this month of September and October.’

‘’Based on the report of the expected flood coming down from Niamey and the projected contributions by the inland rivers, both Kainji and Jebbo Dams built on River Niger have continued to spill water downstream. The Shiroro Dam on River Koduno, with reservoir level at 381.48m as at 9.00am today, has been maintaining a regulated spilling into the River Niger. The effect of all these is that the communities in the states adjoining River Niger will continue to be highly inundated by River Flooding as is being witnessed in the recent time.”

Recently, The DG of NIHSA, briefing the press on March 24, 2021, again advised the three tiers of government and citizens across the country to prepare against impending devastating floods in 2021.

Nze, who gave the advice at a press conference in Abuja, said this was because Nigeria was at the receiving end of disastrous floods among the nine countries of the River Niger Basin.

He said, “There is still time for states/LGAs (Local Government Areas) and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

“As the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin which covers nine countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season with its attendant flood incidents.

He also advised Nigerians residing at waterways to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains, just as warned that Nigerians have about three months to prepare against the disastrous effects of flood.

He explained that the country’s geographical location is downstream of all the countries in the Basin, making it to be at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollutions from all the countries upstream.

The DG lamented that relevant authorities are frustrating the effort of the Federal Government by neglecting the predictions, as could be seen in the results of last year’s damages.

Nze while urging the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past years, noted that there is still time for stakeholders to take steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

Expectations from Stakeholders

In the last few months, President Muhammadu Buhari has been sending solidarity messages to some states affected by flood disasters with promises of federal aid. The president authorised needed assistance to 12 states worst affected by the seasonal rains. The states are: Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Edo, Anambra, Delta, Kano, Jigawa, Rivers, Bayelsa and Adamawa.

However, flooding in various state has become a recurring decimal for decades, all tiers of government are expected to put all hands on deck and come up with a permanent solution. Flood is a natural disaster, but lack of preparedness is a man-made disaster.

As Nigeria is months away till the next rainy season, stakeholders have ample time to do the needful and heed to flood warnings by various monitoring agencies in order to avert another impending tragedy.

One of the main strategies as stated by NIHSA is that, the 36 States and the FCT authority should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using the flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood water will not be lost to the sea to become saline water.

The agency is also urging state governments to pull down structures built on flood plains and expand the drainages for easy flow of water as one of the strategies mapped out.

According to them, the foodstuff, meant for distribution to the vulnerable, is to cushion the ravaging hardship in the region. Flagging off the exercise in Yola, Adamawa State, one of the associates, Dahiru Hammadikko, said the gesture was courtesy of Tinubu’s associates in the 19 northern states.

He said over 10,000 households in the 21 local councils of Adamawa were targeted to benefit. He lamented that Nigerians were facing hardship, which informed the group’s move to ameliorate the suffering of Nigerians, irrespective of religious and political affiliations.

The national coordinator of the Tinubu support group said: “The gesture is to honour the national leader of APC, due to his philanthropic disposition, which is why the rice was branded with his image.”

He described Tinubu as “a detribalised Nigerian, in whom the Northern region relies” as the unifying factor.

“Today, we are flagging off the distribution of 5kg of rice to Nigerians from the northern region. We are targeting one million beneficiaries in the 19 northern states and the FCT.

“But here in Adamawa we are giving over 10,000 people,” he said.

10,10,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Many states not taking precautions against floods –NIHSA boss - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/many-states-not-taking-precautions-against-floods-nihsa-boss/,"The Director-General, Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, Mr Clement Nze, tells OKECHUKWU NNODIM that the devastation caused by floods in many states is as a result of the failure of the governments to adhere to warnings

What are the types of flooding being experienced in Nigeria?

There are three major types of flooding that we experience in Nigeria. The first one is river flooding, which is not just from rivers that are within Nigeria but from River Niger and River Benue, and these are trans-boundary waters. There is also urban/flash flooding, and these are caused by poor drainage systems or even non-existing drainage systems in many major cities in Nigeria. Lastly is coastal or tidal flooding for states that are within coastal areas such as Ondo, Lagos, Bayelsa and Rivers.

Now, it is important to state that our Annual Flood Outlook is a scientific prediction done using historical data physically collected in the field, some of them over 40 to 50 years ago. So, we use it to project and see what is going to happen tomorrow. And from what we have seen using international standards to predict, we have said that not less than 121 Local Government Areas in Nigeria, in 27 states actually, will be affected by flooding in the course of the year. Also, about 302 LGAs will experience different magnitudes of flooding. And about 351 LGAs may have a lesser severity of flooding. But like I said, it is a prediction, which we monitor closely by weekly publications. We are talking about the issue of climate change and so what you see today may not be what will happen tomorrow. So, as a result of that, we will be updating the media, states and others on what they are likely to observe in the course of the year.

How are you interfacing with the states with respect to predictions in the AFOs?

We will be doing sensitisation programmes and will downscale it to the states. We will tell the governors that these are the locations in your state that are likely to be affected in the course of the year 2021. We informed the public through the press some months ago, as preparatory to the unveiling of the 2021 AFO. And by protocol, it is the Minister of Water Resources who interfaces with the governors on behalf of the agency. Last year, for instance, the minister sent letters to each of the state governors in Nigeria and detailed the states that would be affected by flooding in that year. But what they did with it is another cup of tea.

Also, we go through other systems in the states such as their emergency management agencies, water resources and environment ministries. We interface with them directly, but what they do with our information is another issue.

Are you satisfied with what states are doing about the recommendations in the AFOs?

Frankly speaking, they are not doing as much as we expect from them, otherwise, the level of devastation that happens year in year out could have been avoided or eliminated. We’ve been telling the state governors that the tempo of political activities they embark upon during election periods should be deployed against activities that encourage flooding. Go to the grassroots, you have councillors in LGAs. They should be able to cascade this information and domesticate it in their own locations. But often time, it doesn’t happen. However, when a disaster occurs, they are quick to complain and cry out to high heavens and maybe get some support from the humanitarian ministry. But in terms of ameliorating the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.

I recall in 2016/2017, I engaged some state emergency management agencies one-on-one and we were told not to come to tell them what will happen in the course of the year except we are coming with relief materials. But we told them that that was not our jurisdiction. Ours is to inform you about what is likely to happen in your own state. If it happens, you have the National Emergency Management Agency that can support you, not NIHSA.

What are states likely going to face by failing to abide by the recommendations in the AFO?

Going by the law establishing the agency, the agency’s powers begin and stop at predicting and releasing the message. We don’t enforce anything. Each state has its own regulatory body, such as the urban planning department and emergency management agencies. They also have environmental laws and ministries that are supposed to be the regulators to ensure that the dictates of our prediction are followed. I may then say that NEMA could now insist by saying, ‘Since you failed to do the needful, don’t run to us for relief materials.’ This is because, if you recall, when the flood was very severe in 2012, the Federal Government gave out a lot of money. Some states got about N4bn to N5bn, depending on the degree of devastation.

Maybe such decisions could be taken by NEMA so as to encourage states that are doing well in terms of adhering to the predictions to ensure that lives and property are not lost. We, as an agency, can’t enforce anything; we can’t force any governor to do the needful. But the governors on their own should in the spirit of humanity protect and help those who voted them into power.

Are you collaborating with sister agencies on climate issues?

In fact, our relationship with one of them, NiMet (Nigeria Meteorological Services Agency) is very superb and cordial. First of all, at the international level, the meteorological agency is Nigeria’s permanent representative with the World Meteorological Organisation, and that falls on whoever is the Director-General. Also, whosoever heads the hydrological agency in any nation is an adviser to that permanent representative. So, in that wise, there is a very good collaboration between NIHSA and NiMet; for instance, we requested rainfall data from NiMet. And this was one of the major inputs in the model to use for predictions. They provide us those data at no cost. And once they are releasing their own predictions, such as the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction, which is now called Seasonal Climate Prediction, they inform NIHSA.

So, we collaborate a lot; they provide us with data that help us to do our prediction alongside other river measurements that we do by ourselves. We use so much data – about 12 of them, but the rainfall data are among the major data.

What are some of the recommendations in the 2021 AFO, and what advice do you have for farmers?

Farmers should heed our predictions. They should also abide by our warnings. Those who farm within the river banks should ensure that their crops have early maturity. This is to ensure that before the onset of the rainy season or flooding, the crops would have matured and be harvested. Flooding doesn’t come with the rains immediately, rather it is when the soil is saturated and its moisture content becomes high that flooding will begin to take place. So, if there is a way they can be helped to plant crops that can mature easily, it should be done, so that before the flooding starts they can harvest. And after the flooding, heavy nutrients are now brought within the flood plain, which can lead to enhanced yields when the farming starts again.

The Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, for instance, once mentioned that because of the heavy nutrients that the floods brought, they were able to regain what they lost in one of the farming seasons. That governor is very active, he works with us and comes from time to time to ask what could be done to improve farming activities in his state.

What are some of the things states should be doing now, considering the looming flood?

Like I said in our press briefing in March, there is still time for states, LGAs and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021. We made it clear at the briefing that as the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin, which covers nine countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season, with its attendant flood incidents. Nigeria’s geographical location, downstream of all the countries in this basin, places it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollution from all the countries upstream.

We know that the persistent flooding and flood disasters have become an annual event in Nigeria since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster in recent history. In 2012, hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property losses running into trillions of naira.

It is in the light of the above that NIHSA wishes to urge the states and the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly menace of flooding in the past years. We recommend that the three tiers of government should consider clearing drainage systems and canals and also embark on projects for improving hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows. They should carry out the removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinths and floats on water channels and on all avenues for river runoffs. We also encourage people living along the waterways and those having socio-economic activities on flood plains to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains.

Description of the disaster

On 6 October 2020, flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of the torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto, and Zamfara state (amongst other states) affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin, which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas. Table 1 illustrates the flood impacts of the worst flood affected states.

The situation in Kebbi – the country's biggest rice-producing state – is especially dire, as vast farmlands are completely submerged due to the most recent rains. Meanwhile in Jigawa state, a total of 18 out of 27 Local Government Areas (LGA)s have been affected, with Gwaram, Birnin Kudu, Kirikasamma, and Gumel as the worst hit. Wide swaths of farmlands have been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of Naira. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), with the support from the Federal Government, is scaling efforts to assist flood victims by providing emergency needs. So far, the agency has distributed 30 canoes to inundated communities, as well as materials to build embankments to control the floods.

Kwara State is also concerning as more than 5,000 households have been affected. The government estimates damage worth N10bn have been incurred. At least three lives in Ilorin are believed to have been lost. Scores of houses also had their roofs blown off by the raging storm that accompanied the heavy rains in the Ilorin metropolis while electricity poles were destroyed in Taiwo and Odota areas of the state capital. Telecommunication masts and building walls were also damaged in Olonkonla, Bobonkiri, Egba-Akota, Aberi, Akuji and Idiope, all in Ita-Ogunbo area, Alanamu Ward in Ilorin West Local Government Area, the worst hit.

Since September to date, torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across Nigeria. Some 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people are reported to be displaced. Most of the those affected are children. Wide swaths of farmlands have also been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of naira. These floods have so far impacted 22 states in the country’s six geo-political zones: North West (4 state), North Central (4 states), North East (4 state), South East (4 states), South-South (3 states) and South West (3 state). This earlier flooding had weakened Nigeria’s water supply and road infrastructure, killing dozens and leading to disease outbreaks.

A government team began the delivery of food palliatives to the Kwara North Senatorial District, beginning with Jebba town in Moro Local Government Area and Lafiagi in Edu Local Government Area. Over 15,000 households across 357 communities of the state are estimated to have been affected by the ugly incidents that also destroyed farmlands and human dwellings worth billions of naira. In the wake of the floods, over 100,000 hectares of rice, maize and millet farms in Kpata-Gbaradogi, fishing and agrarian settlement in Pategi LGA were destroyed. About 100 residential buildings were also submerged while 1,500 people were rendered homeless.

The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, warned flood-prone states to prepare for flood emergency, rescue and rehabilitation. According to the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rainy season is expected to continue until December 28th in the southern parts of the country. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), predicted that at least 102 LGAs in 28 states fall within the highly probable flood risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 states of the Federation, including FCT, fall within the moderately probable flood risks areas.","Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540152-Nigeria%20Floods%20-%20Emergency%20Plan%20of%20Action%20%28EPoA%29%20DREF%20n%C2%B0%20MDRNG030.png?itok=T4e01g_v,"['n', 'dref', 'affected', 'north', 'epoa', 'flood', 'local', 'floods', 'states', 'action', 'area', 'farmlands', 'plan', 'nigeria', 'state', 'mdrng030', 'areas', 'emergency']", ,none
14,14,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Nigeria Loses a Quarter of Rice Production to Floods - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/nigeria-loses-quarter-rice-production-floods,"ARGUNGU - Farmers in northern Nigeria have lost more than two million tons of rice, a quarter of the country's projected harvest, due to flooding. Despite the loss, Nigeria is so far upholding a year-long ban on land-based imports of rice to crack down on smuggling and boost local production.

Ibrahim Adullahi is looking at what remains of his 350-hectare rice farm in Nigeria’s Kebbi state.

Abdullahi was expecting a harvest of 600 tons of rice, but weeks of severe flooding means he will be lucky to get 100.

“Since when I started farming, I have never experienced intensive cultivation of rice like now, because a lot of people are into the rice farming. But unfortunately, we experienced this intensive flooding that we are still experiencing now, and farmers are now counting losses because 90 percent of our farmers have lost what they have cultivated,” he said.

Nigeria’s biggest rice producing state, Kebbi, had projected 2.5 million tons this year.

But heavy September rains washed away two million tons. Local rice miller Mohammad Anuana said this could cause a further jump in the price of the grain.

“If rain has already washed away all the farm product, you know the goods will be rising up (in price) because the little one they have on ground - they will make sure they recover (the value of) the one that the water moves away. And, so they’ll double the price,” he said.

With Africa’s largest population, Nigeria annually imports billions of dollars of rice and wheat. But the country hopes to become self-sufficient.

Last year, the government banned land-based rice imports to crack down on smuggling and boost local rice production.

Despite the lost rice, the Nigerian officials say the ban will remain in place.

Chairman of the All Farmers Association in Nigeria John Wuyep said affected farmers will be compensated.

""The government and even the financial institutions have a machinery in force. So many who have lost now are already preparing for the dry season farming,” he said.

Nigeria’s farmers association says better groundwork is needed to prevent flooding and have a steady water supply during the dry season.

Flood reduction would also help save homes and the displacement of thousands of Nigerians from overflowing rivers.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2020-09/vlcsnap-2020-09-30-12h41m36s655.png,"['farmers', 'production', 'lost', 'flooding', 'local', 'quarter', 'price', 'tons', 'floods', 'million', 'nigeria', 'imports', 'loses', 'rice']", ,flood

Heavy rains have caused extensive flooding in Chad, Niger and Nigeria since the onset of rainy seasons in June. Chad’s rainy season, expected to last until October, is the heaviest in the past 30 years (OCHA 25/08/2020). Flooding in Niger has affected almost twice the estimated population. Flooding in Nigeria is less widespread than in 2019, but is still significant (NIHSA 06/2020; OCHA 21/07/2020).

Almost 60% of all affected people and over half of reported deaths from the three countries are in Niger, the country most affected by floods (UNHCR 15/09/2020). Flooding has affected more than 516,000 people across all eight regions, and resulted in at least 71 deaths (UNHCR 17/09/2020; OCHA 24/09/2020). Nigeria is at risk of crossborder flooding, given it is downstream from other flood-affected countries along the Niger River basin, including Niger (HNO 12/2019).

In all three countries, heavy rainfall and flash floods have resulted in the widespread destruction of shelters, driving displacement. Emergency shelters are overcrowded and unsanitary, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection and the spread of water-borne diseases (IOM 1/09/2020; OCHA 07/09/2020).

The Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region complicates flood relief efforts and increases protection concerns for highly vulnerable displaced populations in all three countries. The situation is most severe in northeast Nigeria, where over 2.7 million people are displaced and 10.6 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, especially food, shelter and WASH (OCHA 14/09/2020; UNHCR 31/07/2020). Additionally, cross-border violence from Mali affects northwest Niger and insecurity caused by banditry poses further risks to flood-affected populations in northwest Nigeria.","Wed, 07 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1538484-20201006_acaps_briefing_note_flooding_in_chad_niger_nigeria_.png?itok=WwqCv9xM,"['ocha', 'affected', 'chad', 'flooding', 'briefing', 'unhcr', 'shelters', '2020', 'countries', 'note', 'nigeria', 'widespread', 'risk', 'niger', '30', 'acaps']", ,flood
16,16,FL-2019-000093-NGA,How Africa's largest city is staying afloat - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210121-lagos-nigeria-how-africas-largest-city-is-staying-afloat,"Navigating the thronging streets of Lagos, Nigeria, is a challenge at the best of times. But during the rainy seasons, the city's streets can become almost impassable. Home to more than 24 million, Lagos is Nigeria's economic powerhouse, making it a destination for people seeking new opportunities. But that rapid growth creates pressure on the streets, and the environment.

The streets are often flooded, in part due to the dysfunctional disposal of the 6,000-10,000 tonnes of rubbish generated daily in the city. After a downpour, rubbish piles up in open gutters and makes moving around the streets difficult. “I worry when it rains, especially when it is heavy,” says Lagos resident Stephanie Erigha. ""It makes me anxious."" On one occasion when taking a taxi through a waterlogging-prone part of the city, she recalls the water gushing right into the back seat next to her.

While the overall climate in Lagos is expected to see less rainfall overall with climate change, the intensity of rain is expected to increase, bringing with it greater risk of flooding. Meanwhile, the low-lying city is also particularly vulnerable to water from another source: rising seas. If global warming exceeds 2C, the city is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100, according to research led by marine physicist Svetlana Jevrejeva, of the UK's National Oceanography Centre.

How, in the face of flooding, blocked streets and rising waters, is Africa's most populous city adapting?

Floating architecture

There is one part of Lagos that has extensive experience of dealing with high water. Much of the Makoko neighbourhood is not built on land, but rather sits on stilts above the waterline. Makoko, known as the ""Venice of Africa"", is a labyrinthine slum built on stilts and navigated by canoe. The slum has little access to electricity or clean sanitation, but it has also been home to innovations like the Makoko Floating School, a structure resting on recycled empty plastic barrels for buoyancy. The school's pyramid shape helped lower its centre of gravity and so increase its stability, while also being an ideal roof shape for shedding heavy rains.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/live/624x351/p094q1j4.jpg,"['afloat', 'water', 'rubbish', 'streets', 'slum', 'africas', 'staying', 'rising', 'lagos', 'stilts', 'shape', 'largest', 'city', 'makoko']", ,flood

The Edo State government said it has appointed a contractor for the flood control project at Ughoha community in Esan South Local Government Area of the state, signalling the commencement of the project.

The project coordinator, Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP), Tom Obaseki, made this known on Wednesday at Ugboha, while introducing the project contractor to the community.

Mr Obaseki assured the people that the best contractor was selected to handle the project because of the importance of the community to the state.

“Ugboha is very important to us and we thank the community for producing great men that have made so many positive contributions to the development of Edo State.

“We made sure that in the process of recruiting a contractor for the job, we went for the best of the best,” he stated.

Mr Obaseki solicited the support of the traditional head of Ugboha and members of the community for the smooth implementation of the project.

“We want to solicit the support of your highness and the entire people of the kingdom so that there will not be hitches down the line.

“Every time we waste or lose cannot be recovered. So, we want to seek your support in providing the enabling environment and security for the contractor,” he said.

The traditional head of Ugboha, Ukato Steven II, assured that the community would provide a conducive environment for the successful and timely delivery of the project.

Outrage as IDPs camps overflows with displaced residence



Governor raises the alarm as terrorists hoist flag in Kaore community

Affected communities speak out: “We don’t want Govt food or money but adequate security to enable us to return home

CAN goes spiritual; declares 3-day fast

By Wole Mosadomi

Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

“I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

“We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.”

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists’ presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. “Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don’t need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,” he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: “The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.”

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God’s intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

Speaking when the 2021 flood outlook was presented in Abuja, Nze said states have maintained a carefree attitude towards flood warnings over the years.

“Last year, the minister sent a letter to all the state governors in Nigeria and informed them in detail of what to expect, yet not too many states are doing something about it,” he said.

Nze urged state governors to use the same energy for political activities when tackling environmental challenges such as flooding.

He said: “It could be avoided or eliminated. The tempo of political activities they exhibited during the elections should be replicated in tackling this disturbing issue of flooding in the states.

“LGA councillors should be able to domesticate this information in their own locations but this doesn’t happen.

“Once the disaster occurs, they are quick to cry to high heavens, but in terms of reducing the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.”

The NIHSA DG also warned that going by historical data, there are indications that 121 LGAs in 27 states and the federal capital territory (FCT) are likely to experience flooding this year.","Sat, 08 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Flooding-River-Niger.jpg,"['political', 'rallies', 'flooding', 'tackling', 'occurs', 'states', 'nze', 'nigeria', 'governors', 'state', 'nihsa', 'treat', 'seriousness']", ,flood

There Is No End

BLUE NOTE

8/10

Though I’d witnessed the hypnotic magic of Tony Allen while he was drumming for his Afrobeat contemporary Fela Kuti, and had long been a fan of the rhythmatist’s work with King Sunny Ade and Ginger Baker, it wasn’t until the drummer played with Damon Albarn’s Gorillaz, then his The Good, the Bad & the Queen project, where I could speak to Allen. A casually cool drum god stuffed into a regal kingseat, Allen treated Albarn’s compositions and the rhythm section he had formed with Paul Simonon (of The Clash fame) in 2006 as but one more piece of his puzzle, a West African–styled Lego set layered with the ragged, angled tiles of R&B, funk, and jazz. He talked of taking the eccentric English music touched by dub and Afrobeat in stride, and made all that he laid his hands on a simple life pleasure—like sipping fine wine. Combine that cool complexity with an innate in-the-pocket oomph more finely regulated and metronomic than Clyde Stubblefield’s steady, burrowing groove, and Allen was magnificent—the rhythm divine personified.

Allen passed in April 2020 with a handful of compositions and demos in the planning stages for a new solo album—a soulful, personal catalog which merits greater examination—and to commemorate that passing, Blue Note drops There Is No End. Completed by its co-producers Vincent Taeger and Vincent Taurelle, with vocalists and rappers such as Sampa the Great and Danny Brown, the End’s game isn’t some grand finale or explanatory note summing up a career. Like everything else Allen was about, it’s but another piece of a greater puzzle.

That metronome’s meter, with a dub-house break and a hi-hat’s ride, turns “Stumbling Down” into something eerily atmospheric, yet sharply angled, a woozy track made whole by Sampa’s giddy rap. The same floppy dub break with tuneful jazzy brass applied doesn’t so much punctuate “Deer in Headlights” as it does stir up a smoldering psychedelic stew made weirder by Allen’s phase-shifting snare sounds and Brown’s leering voice. The Afro-pop of “Cosmosis” has the feel of being everywhere and nowhere at once, and aggressively yet.

Such aggression can easily be connected to years of warring strife, racism, insurgency, and pleas for justice in Allen’s homeland of Nigeria, and throughout a cut such as “Hurt Your Soul,” you can sense the pains of Allen’s drums, even when he’s rat-tat-tatting a snare to emulate the ring of gunshots. For every dramatic snare sound of Allen’s, there’s another tom-tom romp waiting to be beheld, even quietly and rumbling during “Très Magnifique” and its warm-winded rap courtesy Tsunami.

Though hardly or specifically hip-hop, it’s fascinating that Allen’s last full album is dedicated to the drummer’s relationship with rap, sweet or sour, and young collaborators. But, as its title signals, Tony Allen was a restless soul to go with his position as the rhythm divine personified.

By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja

A bill seeking to amend the fire service act of 1963 and include other natural disasters as emergencies to be given urgent attention has passed for second reading in the House of Representatives.

The bill is titled “An Act to repeal the Fire Service Act Cap. F29 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and enact the Fire and Emergency Service Act 2021 to provide for additional powers for effective service delivery; and for related matters”.

The non-fire occurrences listed by the bill needing emergency rescue included flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters.

The sponsor of the bill is Rep. Adejoro Adeogun Akoko South East: South West Federal Constituency of Ondo State.

Leading the debate on the general principle of the bill at Tuesday plenary, Adeogun said that the bill when passed into law would provide stricter penalties for violation of building codes and fire regulations.

He said: “The fire service act (1963) saddled the Fire service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies. This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required.

Also read:

“This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.

“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”

According to the lawmaker, the goals of the bill are essential to prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters; encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by States, Local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies; establish the office of the Fire and emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the Fire and emergency service; empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilize resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies; and provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officer.

“Mr Speaker, Hon. colleagues, the major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency.

“It will also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through the engagement of able-bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.

“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating of future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources. I am therefore seeking the support of all distinguished Honorable members of this house for the second reading of this bill and eventual passage”, Adeogun submitted.

The bill eventually received the overwhelming support of the House majority when subjected to a voice vote by the presiding officer, Ahmed Idris Wase and passed for second reading.

This was disclosed by the NHSA Director-General, Mr Clement Nze, in a press briefing on Wednesday in Abuja. He urged that strict town planning codes be enforced, calling for constructions of flood walls, buffer dams, dykes and other infrastructure that can hold water and prevent flooding.

What the NHSA is saying

“Federal, states and local governments should clear drainage systems and canals, and embark on projects that will improve hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows… carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas through removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers, to increase storage capacities,” Nze said.

READ:

The NHSA boss revealed that Nigeria is stepping into the 2021/2022 hydrological year in the River Niger Basin, which includes a total of 9 countries, citing the yearly occurrence of flooding in the country since 2012.

“It then means that Nigeria is gradually inching closer to its peak rainy season with subsequent flood incidents,” he said.

“Nigeria’s geographical location downstream, of all the countries in the Basin, puts it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollutions from all the countries upstream,” Nze added.

In case you missed it: According to the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rising heatwave in the month of March just before the rainfalls was caused by NorthWestern and South Western air masses from the Sahara and Atlantic Ocean which generates so much heat during the transition month period of March-April.","Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Rainfall.jpg?fit=900%2C506&ssl=1,"['rainy', 'river', 'nhsa', 'urged', 'floods', 'peak', 'season', 'states', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'closer', 'nze', 'countries', 'expected']", ,flood

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beat/University of North Carolina PressWho doesn’t love a book with more than one index entry for possum? Two hundred of them were cooked at an Oklahoma City bash in 1923, along with 5,000 chickens, 10 bears, 500 beef cattle, 5 tons of coffee, etc. These are but some of the many fascinating facts in Adrian Miller’s new book Black Smoke: African Americans and the United States of Barbecue.Meet One of the First Barbecue Kings: Henry ‘Poppa’ MillerThe Lost African-American Bartenders who Created the CocktailThe book has 22 recipes (bison skewers, banana pudding, alligator ribs), 16 mini-profiles (such as barbecue king Henry “Poppa” Miller), and a big mission.In the 1990s, Miller worked as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton in the One America Initiative, which had the goal of fostering dialogue and helping communities reconcile racial divisions. Miller’s books could be seen as an extension of that experience. His James Beard Award-winning Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time expounded upon the social history of key soul dishes—fried chicken, chitlins, yams. In The President’s Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas, Miller researched the contributions of African Americans who worked in the White House kitchen.So faced with a whitewashed and one-sided representation of barbecue, Miller got to work. While most people agree that barbecue is a result of European influences dovetailing with Native American techniques in Southern kitchens where the cooks were African Americans—that barbecue, in other words, is Black—evidence, by which I mean scholarly evidence, well-researched and reliably sourced, has been vanishingly scant.To find that essential information, Miller turned mostly to newspaper archives.“For all my books, the biggest boon has been newspapers,” he told me. “They were about capturing the daily life of the community, and so you got a lot more flourish and details about what was happening at a particular event.”He sifted through the records of the speakers and the attendees at big community barbecues—which was tough work, since the food was often barely mentioned.Eventually, “writers started paying more attention to the details and at a time when African Americans went unnoticed more and more of them started talking to these Black barbecuers.”“Now, let’s just be straight up,” Miller said. “Part of this was to mock them. So you’d have them speaking in plantation dialect. But you saw other writers treating this person as an expert, as an artist and showing some love.”“I’ve struggled on how to tell people this,” Miller told me. “During the racist times you actually got more details.”And by the 1830s, in order to have legit barbecue, it was thought, an African American cook and his crew were necessary and barbecue was understood to be a Black experience. Miller explained a complicated twist in the narrative in words far more polite than I might have chosen: “In the 1850s, as there’s more and more tension about slavery, you actually find pro-slavery advocates using the plantation barbecue as evidence of their generosity.”After the Civil War, a group of African Americans “emerged from slavery with a highly specialized and marketable skill.” Barbecue culture flourished because African Americans were barbecuing on their own terms. “And that shows up with political barbecue, church barbecue and also emancipation barbecues.”Barbecue, after all, is perfectly suited to big crowds. You can feed thousands of people, as many as show up, as long as you’ve got the wood, the space and the meat.But the meat, says Miller, is not as cut-and-dried, so to speak, as one might think.In words sure to bring upon him (if not me, by association) a plague of wonky BBQ commentary, Miller reports that: “The regional barbecue styles that we fight about so fiercely today, they’re only about a hundred years old. Before that, barbecue was pretty standardized. It was hardwood coals in a trench, butterflied whole carcasses, flip it and sauce it, cut it up and serve it.” Pork was common, of course, but so was lamb and mutton, and the first emancipation barbecue, which took place in Port Royal, South Carolina, was a beef barbecue.Equally fascinating are the unsung regions of barbecue that Miller has championed such as St. Louis, Chicago, and the east side of Texas, where the meat comes with sauce and the sides aren’t the Germanic salads you find in Central Texas but soul food greens and creole dirty rice.So what happened over the last century? How did we get to a place where white people are thought to own barbecue?“At the very time that people are getting interested in barbecue, the non-diverse food media basically said ‘OK, these are the people we think should tell you what barbecue is, and where to get the good stuff.’ And they just kept putting white dude after white dude out in front.”And as he says it, and we talk about the trends that get pushed in barbecue, it becomes obvious, almost to the point of hilarity: the reason the mantra of barbecue became minimal seasoning was because we kept asking white people how to make barbecue. I suggest that I hear an echo of the old joke about how white people don’t season their food, and he laughs and agrees.“We’ll just flip that to our advantage,” Miller said, “and say you don’t need to season.”This trend is a big part of what brought Miller to write this book. “Chronically, there’s been so little coverage of African American barbecue culture.” Everywhere in the food media, the lack of African American representation “just hit me over and over.”He wasn’t sure, upon setting out on the project, how much he would find, and he feared, in the beginning, that he might be embarking on a record of faded glory. “I really thought I was going to be writing an elegy about Black barbecue,” he said. But “it’s thriving. It’s resilient.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A Michigan man who “lost everything” in a flood a year ago just won $2 million from a scratch-off lottery ticket.

The lucky 29-year-old, who chose to remain anonymous, said he “couldn’t stop shaking” when he found out about his sudden change in fortune.

“Last year, I lost everything in a flood, so to win this prize is so overwhelming to me,” he said in a statement released by state lottery officials.

He was on his way to pick up his kids from school when he stopped at a grocery store in Midland — and a ticket for the lottery’s Lucky 7s instant game caught his eye.

“Seven is a lucky number for me, so I decided to take a chance and bought the ticket,” said the man, who also won $10,000 playing the lottery a few years ago.

“I scratched it off when I got back to my car. When I saw I had a match, I thought: ‘Great, I won my money back!’ When I saw I had actually won $2 million, I couldn’t stop shaking.”

He went to the lottery headquarters to claim his big prize, opting for the lump sum of about $1.3 million instead of receiving annuity payments for the full $2 million.

He said he plans to pay off bills and save what’s left of his winnings.

“Knowing my kids will be taken care of is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

28,28,FL-2019-000093-NGA,"Nigeria: Aftermath of Boko Haram Invasion - Niger State Communities in Panic Mode As Victims, Others Flood IDPs Camps - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/202104300443.html,"Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: ""I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

""I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

""We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.""

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists' presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. ""Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don't need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,"" he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: ""The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.""

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God's intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 28 Nigerian states are at risk of heavy flooding this year, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said Thursday.

This year's flood projections will, as expected, vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country, and rivers are likely to exceed flood level with some low-lying areas to be inundated, said the NIHSA in a statement following an earlier survey.

Out of the 774 local government areas in the country, it said, some 102 local government areas across 28 states are at risk of flooding -- one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria, which has a devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on floodplains for livelihood.

Although the projections showed that the floods this year might not be as severe as in previous years, it was important to begin to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns for preparedness, the agency said.

In March 2012, 32 of Nigeria's 36 states were affected by flooding, in which more than 360 people were killed and almost 2 million displaced.

The phenomenon is repeated across numerous communities in West Africa, where traffic and business come to a standstill for hours or days, waiting for the streets to drain. Sometimes the flooding becomes deadly.

Last year, hundreds of people were killed in a mudslide in Freetown, Sierra Leone, along a hillside where residents of the booming city had cleared forests to build homes. Victims were buried alive in their houses and vehicles. Environmental groups and local organizations had been warning for years that the development was risky.

In Nigeria, local television stations reported that more than 100 communities had flooded and broadcast images of muddy waters reaching the rooftops of clusters of homes. Some people died when flooding caused their homes to collapse, according to Agence France-Presse.

Local leaders in some areas were advising residents to evacuate. Officials in Anambra State set up 28 camps for fleeing residents. Thousands of people fled their homes in Cross River State, officials there said, noting that many of them lived in swampy areas or along waterways.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Nigerien student Hachimou Abdou has had to catch a boat to classes since river water swamped his route to university in the capital Niamey - one of about 760,000 people hit by severe flooding in recent weeks in parts of West and Central Africa.

Floods are common during the rainy season, but in recent years climate change, land degradation and poor urban planning have led to more frequent disasters as rapidly-growing cities struggle with heavier-than-normal rainfall.

Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Congo Republic and Senegal are among those worst-hit this year, with at least 111 people killed, according to latest figures from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Waters have yet to recede in parts of Niamey since torrential rains in August caused rivers to burst their banks, destroying nearly 32,000 houses and 5,768 hectares of farmland across Niger.

“I have to get to university - either I take a boat or I walk in the water,” Abdou said, before settling into a traditional wooden pirogue to travel up the flooded highway.

Flooding across landlocked Niger alone has so far impacted nearly 333,000 people. Over 188,000 people have been affected in neighbouring Chad, with OCHA warning of potential food shortages due to inundated land.

With further rain expected, particularly in Central Africa, the situation is expected to worsen, said OCHA’s director for West and Central Africa, Julie Belanger.

Communities’ ability to cope with natural disasters has been eroded by instability, food shortages and mass displacement in some areas. Over 25 million people are in need of humanitarian aid in the violence-plagued Sahel area, which includes Niger, Chad and Mali.

“Many of those populations live in flood-prone areas. It’s just a matter of time for them to be at risk of epidemics,” Belanger said, describing how quickly diseases can spread once floods wipe out access to clean water and sanitation.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200910&t=2&i=1532955151&r=LYNXMPEG891XR&w=800,"['recent', '760000', 'water', 'chad', 'university', 'central', 'floods', 'west', 'hit', 'parts', 'niger', 'severe', 'niamey', 'africa', 'shortages']", ,flood

An image of trucks and cars on a flooded road has been shared in multiple social media posts claiming to show a submerged highway in Nigeria’s southern Ogun state following a recent heavy downpour. This is partly false; while the location is correct, the photo has been circulating since at least 2019.

The image appears in numerous Facebook posts, including this one published on March 24, 2021, with more than 500 shares.

“Sango Ota bridge, I understand this was yesterday o (sic),” reads the Facebook post published on a page called “Lady K ifeoluwa show”. It has a history of calling for the secession of the Yoruba nation from Nigeria.

Screenshot taken on March 29, 2021, showing the misleading Facebook post

Sango Ota is a town in Nigeria’s southwestern Ogun state and is home to the country’s former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. The majority of inhabitants in the region are Yorubas, a large ethnic group in the west African country.

The rest of the post, translated from Yoruba into English, pleads for the “intervention” of state officials and then declares “end Nigeria now”.

The photo it refers to shows submerged vehicles on a flooded road, and features alongside an almost identical claim in this Facebook post with more than 800 shares, as well as on Twitter.

However, the image has been circulating online for more than a year.

Old photo

Using the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check traced earlier versions of the claim to Facebook accounts here and here on March 22, 2021.

It was reposted on Facebook the next day by Joe Igbokwe, the special adviser to the Lagos state governor for drainage and water resources.

“Sango Bridge after yesterday's rain, this is sign of what the people of that area should be expecting this year except the drainages are cleared. Please tell Ogun State to consult me (sic),” reads Igbokwe’s Facebook post.

AFP Fact Check has previously debunked misleading information shared on Igbokwe’s account.

In this case, AFP Fact Check confirmed that it actually rained in Sango Ota on March 22, 2021, according to the World Weather Online site.

Furthermore, an AFP journalist in Nigeria confirmed that the photo was indeed taken in the town.

However, the viral image is not evidence of any recent rainfall or flooding.

A Google reverse image search led to this Facebook post and the same picture from September 7, 2019, captioned ""Yesterday Rain @ Sango"". Five days later, global humanitarian organisation ReliefWeb reported that heavy rainfall in the preceding weeks had caused flooding in some parts of the country.

Flooding has long been an issue in the town. In 2011, residents called on the government to construct drainage to prevent an environmental disaster.

Now, like thousands of hectares of rice in Nigeria’s Kebbi state, it is under water.

“Almost all my farm has been flooded. I didn’t harvest any rice,” Ladan told Reuters News Agency. “It’s going to be devastating.”

Floods early this month across northwest Nigeria destroyed 90 percent of the two million tonnes that Kebbi state officials expected to harvest this autumn, the head of the state branch of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. The loss amounts to some 20 percent of the rice Nigeria grew last year, and the waters are still rising.

Further south, outside Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, chicken farmer Hippolite Adigwe is also worried. A shortage of maize forced him to sell most of his flock of more than 1,000 birds, and the 300 he has left are hungry. Chicken feed prices have more than doubled, and he is not sure how long he can cope.

Twin crises, floods and maize shortages, come just after movement restrictions and financing difficulties caused by COVID-19 containment measures complicated spring planting.

Some farmers and economists said it could push Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, into a food crisis. Rice is the country’s staple grain, and chicken is a core protein.

“There is a real fear of having food shortages,” Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. “The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Nigeria took roughly 4,000 tonnes of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s (ECOWAS) strategic stocks last month and released 30,000 tonnes of its own maize. It also gave four companies special permission to import maize.

The prominent Nigerian Economic Summit Group has called for “a complete overhaul” of agriculture policy.

Problems accessing foreign exchange to import food are adding to shortages. In July, the central bank added maize to a list of items for which importers are banned from using its dollars. Rice and fertiliser were already on the list, along with other items that Nigeria wants to be made locally.

Last week, even as food prices spiked, President Muhammadu Buhari promised that not one cent of central bank dollars would go to food or fertiliser imports, as Nigeria would continue encouraging local farmers over imports.

Importers can use dollars from pricier parallel markets. But these are tough to find due to an oil price crash that has cut Nigeria’s core source of foreign exchange.

Switching grains

Rice prices had already risen substantially due to a land border closure last year that aimed to stamp out smuggling and boost local production.

The worst is yet to happen. Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex

Peter Clubb of the International Grains Council said the spike drove consumers to eat maize instead. This, along with a disappointing crop late last year and the foreign exchange issues, boosted maize prices to 180,000 naira ($470) per tonne from approximately 70,000 naira ($183) in March.

Farmers sid that consumers grappling with inflation, as well as the first rise in fuel prices since 2016 and a power price spike, can only pay so much more for food.

Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex, said the central bank’s lending scheme for farmers has significantly expanded output, and can work long term.

But the coming months will be tough. Fertiliser prices hit a record after a COVID-19 outbreak shut down country’s sole urea plant for two weeks, meaning more farmers will skip fertilisers, limiting crop yields.

“The worst is yet to happen,” Balogun said. “It is a problem across grains.”

Buhari has pledged more support, and Agriculture Minister Muhammed Sabo Nanono visited the northwest area this weekend and promised to provide farmers with high-quality seeds and to set up a special committee to ensure they have all they need to plant new crops as soon as possible.

Adigwe, the chicken farmer, said he thinks barring foreign food in order to help farmers is not a bad idea, but “there are some factors that were not considered.”

Is the government doing enough?

Over the last few years in Nigeria, seasonal flooding has killed hundreds, destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, and displaced millions of people.

This year, since the rainy season began in June, twelve states have been badly affected. In four of them – Anambra, Delta, Kogi and Niger – the government declared a state of emergency. The National Emergency management agency (NEMA), which coordinate disaster management in Nigeria, estimates that two hundred people have died so far and over 600,000 people have had to flee their homes.

The havoc wrought by heavy rains this year has been devastating. But this level of destruction is not new to Nigeria. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and scores have died in floods. In 2012, particularly severe flooding led to two million displacements and 363 deaths.

Why Nigeria floods

Nigeria’s flooding problem derives from a combination of factors, natural and man-made alike.

On the one hand, rainfall has become significantly heavier in recent years due to climate change. This year, the Niger River reached 11.06m above sea level and could rise further, approaching the record 12.84m of 2012. Water levels have also risen in upstream Cameroon, Mali and Niger. These countries feed the Niger and Benue rivers, which flow through Nigeria. The towns along these two main rivers are particularly vulnerable.

Man-made issues have also contributed to the problem.

For example, Nigeria has several dams along its rivers, ranging from huge hydroelectric stations to smaller constructions for irrigation and fishing. These structures can, in theory, help manage water levels. But in reality, many have been poorly maintained and run, contributing to the build-up of water levels, endangering nearby towns and villages.

“Dams are not necessary facilitators of flood,” says James Akanmu, a water resource and environmental engineering expert. “But we often mismanage dams and they lead us into problems.”

Another contributing factor is a lack of town planning. As Nigeria rapidly urbanises, towns and cities have sprawled with little regard for environmental concerns. Waterways and canals that are crucial for flows are often filled in as part of building developments, while informal settlements in some areas vulnerable to flooding have doubled in population.

“People are building on water ways. People build houses without drainages. The government builds roads without drainages,” says Alabi Soneye, Professor of Geography at the University of Lagos.

“There is pressure in Nigeria cities. Too many people squeezed into small space and everything overstretched,” adds urban planner, Ugochukwu Donald.

The response

In response to this year’s floods, the government pledged $8.2 million for relief efforts as well as declaring a state of emergency in four states. NEMA set up five emergency operation centres to facilitate search and rescue operations and humanitarian support. These efforts have faced huge practical barriers in reaching flood victims, however, while they have also reportedly been undermined by poor management, bad governance and corruption.

Many also argue that such a reactive approach is insufficient in anything but the short-term. Experts say that Nigeria must proactively predict and prepare if it is to reduce the huge damage caused by floods.

Geography professor Soneye argues that the main problem is not planning but implementation. “Master plans are not Nigeria’s problem,” he says. “We have master plan documents, [but] nobody is acting on it. The disaster continues to grow.”

One area in which Nigeria has attempted to establish forward-thinking is through early warning systems. But this has not been straightforward. Nigerian meteorological agencies make predictions about potential flooding and warnings are meant to be sent to locations at risk, but the system is not always effective.

Furthermore, even when information is passed on, there are challenges associated with getting people to act accordingly. Around half of Nigeria’s population lives below the poverty line and moving households to safe areas can be complex and costly.

“It is not enough to tell people to move that the rains are coming. The early warning system needs to provide that support for such response to take place,” says Peter Nwilo, professor of surveying and geo-informatics at the University of Lagos.

Soneye suggests that many citizens are distrustful of state orders and that warning systems should work through local intelligence and community collaboration to be effective. “The people are not in the mood to believe anything that comes from the government,” he says.

Nwilo concurs. “Our warning system needs to be domesticated and localised before it works,” he says. “People are reluctant to comply with the early warning system until disaster catches up with them. Ignorance is huge and we must improve.”

Indeed, as floods continue to devastate areas of Nigeria year on year, the environmental, economic and – most importantly – the human toll is huge. The necessary actions in many cases are known, but as climate changes leads to more unpredictable and heavy rainfall, Nigeria’s flooding problems will only increase unless there is reliable forward planning, sound management and careful implementation.

“The situation is straight forward,” says urban planner Donald. “Flooding is a natural disaster. We cannot entirely rule it out. But somehow, Nigeria has failed to do the right thing: to make corrections from the past.”","Thu, 15 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://africanarguments.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nigeria-flood.jpg,"['problem', 'pours', 'water', 'seasonal', 'flooding', 'huge', 'emergency', 'management', 'floods', 'warning', 'system', 'nigeria', 'rains', 'growing', 'niger', 'nigerias']", ,flood

IT was past noon – lunch time – but there was only one customer at the bukka. Loretta Eze, the proprietor, surveyed the busy street as she stood by the entrance of her restaurant located by the corner of a street in the Wuse 2 area of Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. A number of girls in yellow shirts, who worked as attendants in the restaurant, were hanging around waiting for the solitary customer to finish his meal.

“It was not always like this,” Loretta told The ICIR‘s correspondent, who visited the restaurant while investigating the impact of rising prices of foodstuffs on the preparation and consumption of food, especially jollof rice.

“Food items are very expensive these days and the situation is very hard for those of us that are into catering and food business. Things are hard and as a result, we are not getting as many customers as in the past when things were cheaper,” Loretta added.

Higher cost of foodstuffs has forced restaurants, including roadside bukkas and ‘Mama put‘ joints, to increase the prices of different dishes on their menu and Loretta observed that the development had, in turn, forced some customers to stay away because they could not afford meals as in the past.

Loretta’s observations and concerns mirrored the findings in the SBM Jollof Index report for the first quarter of 2021.

The SBM Jollof Index, developed by SBM Intel, an Africa-focused research firm, simplified the appreciation of food inflationary trends using a common delicacy that most Nigerian households enjoy – jollof rice.

Across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, SBM collects data on the most common ingredients that go into cooking jollof rice in 13 markets on a monthly basis except for December, due to the seasonal spikes caused by Yuletide celebrations. From the prices collated, the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for a family of five or six is averaged and used as a proxy for measuring food inflation across the country.

The commodities that make up the Jollof Index include rice, curry, thyme, seasoning, groundnut oil, chicken/turkey (poultry), beef, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions.

The SBM Index is published three times a year – at the end of the first three quarters. Data from October and November are reflected in the Quarter 1 Jollof Index of the following year.

Cost of making pot of jollof rice rose between March 2020 and March 2021

According to the latest SBM Jollof Index report, the average cost of making a pot of jollof rice rose by 7.8 per cent between March 2020 and March 2021.

The sharp spike in the cost of preparing the delicacy was attributed to a number of events which impacted on food prices. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020, the border closure and foreign exchange restrictions in August 2020 were worsened by a sharp hike in energy tariffs by September of that year.

The situation was further compounded by the the #EndSARS protests, as well as the food blockade imposed by northern traders on the southern part of the country, which disrupted agricultural supply chain and the movement of people and goods.

The reopening of land borders in December 2020 did not result in a significant drop in the cost of food items – the price of a bag of rice only dropped slightly by a margin of N1000 to N3000 depending on the market but that did not translate into a drop in the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for the majority of Nigerians who buy from retailers.

The SBM Jollof Index noted that food prices remained high due to factors such as reduced local production, exchange rate fluctuations, poor harvest due to adverse weather, and high cost of energy and transportation.

Insecurity was also a major factor for the increasing cost of preparing a pot of jollof rice, translating into rising food inflation in Nigeria.

“Some of the jollof rice ingredients such as rice, onions and tomatoes have witnessed reduced local production because of protracted conflicts and terrorist attacks on farmers. Out of the 11 main rice producing states in the country, Benue, Borno, Ebonyi and Kaduna have witnessed attacks on farmers with the most gruesome being the execution of about 110 rice farmers in Borno in November 2020,” the report said.

Faced with deaths from terror attacks in insecure agrarian communities, several farmers are leaving the countryside and moving to the cities to take up menial jobs.

Despite recent drop in inflation rate, Nigerians are still groaning over increasing cost of food items

According to latest figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria’s inflation rate dropped from 18.17 per cent in March 2021 to 18.12 per cent in April 2021.

The 0.05 percentage points decline was the first recorded in headline inflation in about 20 months.

Food inflation also recorded a decline – from 22.95 per cent in March 2021 to 22.72 per cent in April, 2021.

However, while the NBS suggested that inflation might have peaked and could continue to drop, Nigerians are yet to get any reprieve while purchasing foodstuffs.

For Loretta, a food vendor who deals in foodstuffs, the price of food items has continued to spike in the market.

Making a comparison of what was obtainable in the past and the present, she told The ICIR, “Before now, I used to buy a small basket of tomatoes between N300 and N500, but now, it is N1500. Some tomatoes even go for N2500 per basket. Also, a basket of fresh pepper is N1500 now. Before now, you could get a pint of groundnut oil for N300, but it is now N650.”

She added, “Before now, with N2500 or N3000, I could prepare a normal pot of soup or stew but now, if you don’t have at least N7000 you will not get the taste you want due to the high cost of food items.”

Further lamenting the daily hike in the price of staple food items, she observed that, not too long ago, a mudu, or regular measure of beans, was between N250 and N300. But a mudu of beans is N800 now.

“It is the same case as meat. Before now, with N6000 or N8000, you could get the quantity of goat meat that would be enough for you, but now, you will have up to N15000 or more for that same quantity.”

According to her, the increase in the price of onions was ‘manageable’. “The quantity we were getting for N100 before is about N400 or N500 at the moment.”

Loretta also pointed to the sharp increase in the price of rice.

“Before now, a mudu of rice was N300, but now, a mudu of local rice is about N800,” a development which she admitted had increased the cost of preparing a pot of regular jollof rice.

Speaking further, Loretta said, “crayfish and stockfish are totally out of the question” due to recent hike in the prices of the food items.

Nkechi Emmanuel, a housewife, had a frown on her face as she walked out of Dutse Market, in the Bwari area of Abuja. She was clutching a handful of food items.

In a brief encounter with The ICIR‘s correspondent, Nkechi explained that the feeding allowance her husband gave her each month, which was never enough in the best of times, was now barely able to provide a pot of stew and soup.

“It has never been this bad and it is getting worse by the day,” the woman said in a frustrated tone.

All types of foodstuffs are becoming out of reach for the poor and the lower middle-class by the day.

Mary Okon-Essien operates a restaurant in the FCT. She took a break from serving a customer to respond to questions by The ICIR‘s correspondent on May 20.

Okon-Essien stressed that the increase in the prices of basic food items, which had driven up the cost of food, had resulted in reduced patronage for food vendors.

“Before now, the highest amount you could get egusi is N250 or N300 for a mudu, but now, a mudu of egusi is N700 or N800.

“The situation is very difficult for those of us that are into food business. Due to the high cost of foodstuff, it is not easy to sell and make profit anymore because customers are having problems with the higher prices,” she said.

Garri is generally regarded as ‘poor man’s food,’ but Okon-Essien said that was in the past.

“Garri is longer a poor man’s food. A mudu of garri is now N500,” she told The ICIR.

Okon-Essien also noted that another staple foudstuff – red oil – had become more expensive.

“Before now, you could get a tin of red oil for N200, but now, it is not less than N500,” she said, while observing that the situation was more worrisome because the food items were locally produced and not imported.

Besides becoming more expensive, some food items which Nigerians took for granted, due to their availability, are becoming scarce.

The increase in the price of fufu, a cassava meal, goes with the increasing scarcity of the food item, according to Okon-Essien.

“Fufu is a food item that is loved by Nigerians but right now, fufu is scarce and that has made it very expensive. I don’t know if Nigerians are not planting cassava again. Fish has also become very expensive. People now find it very difficult to afford fish for their meals.”

Okon-Essien corroborated the findings of the SBM Jollof Index for the first quarter of 2021.

“Not too long ago, with as little as N1000, you could prepare a pot of jollof rice for your family because with that amount, you would get rice and some amount of crayfish, onion, maggi and other foodstuff you needed. But now, that N1000 will only be enough for a mudu of foreign rice and if you want to cook local rice, then you will need N700 or N800 to buy a mudu of rice and as a result, you will not have much left for the ingredients needed for the jollof rice.”

Highlighting the dismal impact of high food inflation on the food industry, she observed, “Before now, when it was lunch time, you would see many people coming to eat, but now, lunch time seems like morning time, you hardly see anybody. You only see a few people coming to eat and this is because there is no money and everybody is ‘checking his pocket.’ Before now, they could get a plate of food for N250 or N300, but the least you can get a plate of now is N400 or N500,” the woman said.

Inflation rate still very high despite recorded decline

Nigeria’s inflation rate might have recorded a marginal decline in April but it remains very high and this is especially so for food inflation.

This was stated by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) which decried the current inflation rate of 18.12 per cent.

Director General of LCCI Muda Yusuf noted that despite the recently recorded decline in the inflation rate, “food inflation at over 22 per cent is still very high in spite of the marginal moderation in food prices in April 2021.”

Yusuf said the situation had continued to exert a negative impact on the activities of every economic agents, including households, businesses and investors, with profound impact on the citizenry, particularly the low and middle-income households.

“The high level of inflation continues to dampen consumer purchasing power at a time households incomes are not increasing in proportion to cost,” he said, adding that the development had resulted in rising production costs and depressed margins for businesses.

Nigeria at risk of famine

Meanwhile, the latest SBM Jollof Index report, which said Nigeria was currently on a slippery slope, noted that Nigeria might experience famine in the nearest future if production, consumption and political-economic dynamics remained unchanged from what was currently obtainable.

Noting that decline in food availability, exponential population growth and decline in entitlements were the main contributors to famine, the report observed that “history shows that the famines with the highest mortality rates resulted from poor harvests, natural disasters (droughts, flood), war/conflict, poor governance and policy failures – conditions which Nigeria fulfills easily.”

The SBM Jollof Index noted that over the last 10 years, food production in Nigeria had been dismally affected by continuous conflicts between farmers and herders in the Middle Belt, where more than 62,000 farmers were displaced from their homeland between 2010 and 2015, including terrorist attacks on farmers in the North-East and bandits’ onslaught in the North-West.

Added to these are adverse weather conditions and decreasing agricultural land due to urbanisation, and the effects of governance failure and some government policies, such as border closer, foreign exchange restriction, hike in electricity tariff and petrol pump price.

The SBM Jollof Index stated that the different factors had combined to continuously drive up food prices in Nigeria.

Poverty rising

The 2020 report by World Poverty Clock showed that over 105 million Nigerians lived in extreme poverty – as against 98 million in October 2019. The figure represented more than 51 per cent of the population.

This placed Nigeria as world poverty capital for two years running. Unemployment in Nigeria reached 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020. Nigeria is among most miserable countries in Africa, scoring 50.6 points in March 2021, as against 14.8 points in Ghana, 6.9 in Ethiopia, 13 in Kenya and 12.1 points in Egypt, among others.","Fri, 21 May 2021 17:07:41 GMT",https://www.icirnigeria.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Goat-meat-jollof-rice.jpg,"['sbm', 'inflation', 'food', 'mudu', 'cost', 'worsening', 'jollof', 'signals', 'rising', 'prices', 'index', 'pot', 'insecurity', 'preparing', 'rice', 'nigerias']", ,flood

As of 23 October, flooding has affected 2.2 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Nigeria, Togo and the Central African Republic, and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1541305-West%20and%20Central%20Africa%20-%20Flooding%20Situation%20As%20of%2023%20October%202020.png?itok=ZU-fKzR-,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', '23', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'rains', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,fldood

Respective National Societies, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), are working to respond to each of these disasters through different means. Some have Disaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREFs) or Emergency Appeals (EAs) launched, and others may require additional support in the future.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

In West Coast, Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Ghana have also experienced flooding throughout August-September 2020.","Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539716-Africa%20-%20Floods%20and%20multiple%20disasters%20-%20Information%20bulletin%2C%2006%20September%202020.png?itok=7OMwtMBe,"['affected', 'chad', 'sudan', 'flooding', '06', 'bulletin', '2020', 'floods', 'states', 'displaced', 'multiple', 'rains', 'information', 'niger', 'disasters', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

Thousands of people have been displaced following weeks of heavy rainfall in some central and southern states, the country's emergency response agency, NEMA said Tuesday.

Nigeria's two major rivers have burst their banks sweeping away homes in the central part of the country.

Residents steer a dugout canoe past flooded houses in Lokoja capital of Kogi State on September 14, 2018.

The agency warned the situation could worsen as water levels continue to rise in Lokoja capital of Kogi State, which lies at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers and is often one of the most affected states during the rainy season.

Five emergency operation centers have been created to coordinate search and rescue operations, while also providing humanitarian support for those displaced by the floods, Sani Datti, a spokesman for NEMA said.

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

Lagos State plans to stop being a receiver of processed rice and start processing its own Lake Rice, starting with the Kebbi State government.

Continuous heavy rainfall since July reached its peak in late September, causing severe and extensive flooding in 34 out of 36 states in Nigeria. Two major rivers, the Niger River and Benue River overflowed into the surrounding communities resulting in widespread destruction. The Nigerian government has declared a state of emergencies in nine states. The floods have affected 1.9 million people, destroyed 82,000 houses, displaced 210,000 people and devastated crops and livestock. Though flood water has receded in some communities, many people still do not have homes, businesses and farms to return to. They continue to seek refuge in schools and other public buildings where conditions are extremely poor. Fear of health outbreaks including malaria, cholera and typhoid remain high, as sanitary conditions have deteriorated especially in the temporary shelters.

Red Cross Actions

The International Red Cross has mobilized HKD 2 million from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to support the Nigerian Red Cross Society’s immediate relief activities. An emergency appeal was launched on 21 September 2018 seeking HKD 43.7 million globally targeting to assist 300,000 people for nine months in 10 states.

Since the onset of the floods the Nigerian Red Cross Society has mobilized over 2,000 volunteers and supported affected communities with evacuations, search and rescue, distribution of food and essential household items, provided first aid, psychosocial support and sensitized communities on good hygiene practices.

Besides other factors threatening food security in Nigeria, including the seemingly intractable terrorism, banditry and killer herdsmen's onslaught which are steadily spreading across the country, harvest of farm produce might be imperiled this year and even the next as a result of flooding.

In Kebbi State for instance, 500,000 hectares was recently devastated by flood, 450,000 hectares of it being for rice farms.

This has heightened fears that by next year, majority of farmers in the state, particularly rice farmers, would be out of business.

Many farmlands visited by our correspondent were overrun by floods, just as rice farms were submerged.

A farmer, Libabatu Usman Kamba, expressed fears over imminent food scarcity, particularly as most of the farmers would not be able to mobilize for the next farming season due to the zero harvest this year.

Kamba said she cultivated over 20 hectares of rice this year at Cida Kai village in Dandi Local Government Area but lost over 16 hectares of the rice farm to flood.

She said her crop was ready for harvest and was hoping to get 40 bags of rice per hectare and 700 bags of paddy rice.

Though she could not say what she spent on the hectares submerged in the flood, she added that most farmers would not be able to go for dry season farming this year, hence the need for urgent government intervention.

""The losses recorded this year are so enormous that majority of small holder farmers would not go back for this year's dry season farming.

""The usual practice by most farmers is to re-invest what they realized from rainy season farming for dry season farming,"" she said.

Zuwaira Abubakar, another rice farmer in Argungu, said barely all rice farms in the area were submerged and that would affect farmers' capital for dry season farming. Zuwaira, who cultivated over 25 hectares of rice, said she lost all to flood, adding that she had spent over N300,000 in the farm before the flood came.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid. Many of us will be out of business if no intervention comes our way.

""Farmers don't keep money, the more we make in the business the more we open more farmlands, that is the secret of the farming business otherwise you won't last long in it,"" she said.

In Danko Wasagu Local Government Area, a farmer, Usman Umar, told Daily Trust that they did not experience massive destruction as was the case in most parts of the state, noting that only about a hectare of seven hectares of his rice farm was washed away by the flood.

Another farmer, Suleiman Bashir, who stood helplessly by his rice farm which was submerged along Dukku/Makera road in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area, appealed to the state and federal governments to come to their aid.

""I don't know what to do, I have two large rice farms and they have been completely submerged.

""We are appealing to the state and federal governments to assist us,"" he said.

The chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Sani Dododo, said farm produce worth over N5 billion was destroyed by flood.

He added that the loss recorded in rice farming could be put at 90 percent of the total value of farm produce in the state.

""Over 500,000 hectares of farmlands have been destroyed by flood, the destruction translates to over N5billion worth of farm produce.

""Rice farms constitute to about 90 percent of the farm produce destroyed,"" he said.

The National President of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Aminu Goronyo, who toured some of the affected places while in the entourage of the Kebbi State governor, described the incident as devastating.

Goronyo assured the farmers of federal government intervention because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had sent its officials to the state to assess the situation for immediate intervention.

""The CBN governor has directed RIFAN to mobilise one million farmers that can produce five million metric tonnes of rice during the dry season commencing in November for support,"" he said.

Also speaking with newsmen at Bakin Gada in Argungu Local Government Area after inspecting rice farms destroyed in some local government areas, Governor Abubakar Bagudu expressed shock over the incident, describing it as regrettable.

Thousands rendered homeless in Bauchi

Thousands of displaced people including women and children and the aged have moved into public schools, primary healthcare centres and shops while hundreds of others have relocated to neighboring Jama'are, Azare and Giade local government areas of Bauchi State for shelter.

When our correspondent visited some of the affected areas on Wednesday, dozens of families had taken refuge at various public schools including the Adamami Primary School which was still occupied by the flood.

A victim and father of 11 children, Hamisu Magaji, said three families were sharing two classes.

""One class is accommodating 42 children sleeping on school desks while the male heads of families are sleeping on tables because water has taken over the environment.

""We are staying here due to the flood which destroyed our houses, properties, food and farmlands but we leave everything to God.

""We are yet to receive support or assistance from anybody four days after the incident, life has been difficult, especially taking care of the families but we are struggling to feed them, that notwithstanding, we are appealing to the government and organizations to come to our aid,"" he said.

His daughter, 18-year-old Halima Hamisu, who cooked food for children in the camp, told Daily Trust how they managed to sleep on school desks.

""We arrange the desks laying mats on top and putting long sticks on four angles to hang mosquito nets.

""We line up between 8 and 12 children inside the net and that is how we have managed in this class for the past four days as our mothers have relocated to a nearby village because they are nursing babies,"" she said.

A woman with four children at the Government Day Secondary School camp in Adamami, Barakana Mohammed, said her six months old daughter had been infected with cold.

""I have been sleeping on the floor with my children for four days due to the flood that destroyed our house and property and the bad condition coupled with the weather affecting the children.

""Life has become difficult living in a classroom but we pray for God's intervention.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid.""

A 60-year-old woman, Aishatu Abdullahi, now taking refuge at the camp, decried the absence of essential commodities and the sanitary situation in the camp, saying, ""We don't have food in the camp because water has destroyed everything and the little our caregivers are struggling to bring to the camp is not enough as we have small children.

""I am appealing to the government and privileged individuals in the name of God to support us with food and other relief materials so as to rescue us from additional hardship.""

The village head of Adamami, Malam Isa Nalaraba, said the flood had caused a lot of destruction but, ""We thank God for saving our lives and our children because almost more than half of Adamami is destroyed by the flood which displaced many people to neighboring communities while others have become refugees in their locality while many other residents have relocated to neighboring towns and villages.

""We are appealing to the government and individuals to assist the victims with relief materials to support them and continue their lives.""

Habiba Sani who was to wed in three months and three others including a 14-year-old girl and a 60-year-old woman drowned in flood waters in Bakatma, Shira Local Government Area of the state.

Habiba's father, Malam Sani Biidis, told Daily Trust that he was away when his neighbor invited her and his daughter to accompany him to remove weeds in a rice farm beside a river that was flooded following heavy downpour.

He described the deceased as a kind hearted and obedient girl who hardly argued or disagreed with people within and outside the family.

""They met their sad end when they tried to cross the river at a point where everybody including children used to pass from the village because the area is not deep or wide but as a result of the flood the volume and speed of the water had increased, unfortunately the moment they entered the river the flow dragged them down and they could not swim out of the water.

""It was some children who witnessed the incident that rushed to inform the family that they tried to cross the river but drowned in the process.

""When they launched the search operation their corpses were found in a nearby area some meters from the point of passage.

""I was away from home when I received a phone call that my daughter and one other girl had drowned.

""Habiba's death is painful but I leave everything to God and pray for their souls,"" Bidis said.

Badamasi Shittu, the father of the 14-year-old Ziyada Badamasi, said he asked them to go to his rice farm to assist him remove weeds and apply fertilizer.

""My daughter, Ziyada, told me that they would go before I arrived to apply the fertilizer.

""When they reached the point where people cross the river, they met some children but decided to cross and when they reached the center of the river, Ziyada shouted for help as the flow pulled them down and there was no mature person around to rescue them.

""It was one of the children who rushed home and notified us that Habiba and Ziyada had drowned,"" he said.

The Acting Permanent Secretary in the State Emergency Management Agency, Habu Ningi, said the flood affected 11 villages including Adamami, Bakatma, Alkaleri, Sawi, Dirmi, dago, Shira, Yana , Bege, Bukul, Fago , Tsafi and Disina all, in Shira LGA.

Bakatma village, Adamami, Alkaleri, and Disina town and other villages in Shira Local Government Area were flooded following heavy downpour between Sunday and Monday morning, destroying over 2,600 houses and many hectares of farmlands.

A resident of Adamami, Adamu Oni Adamami, said the heavy rain started on Sunday and around 11 pm people in the town were confused because water had taken over everywhere, gushing into houses at a high speed.

""The rain continued unabated and people started running for safety, especially women and children, to higher areas.

""The rain did not stop until 6am on Monday thousands of houses collapsed and many hectares of farmlands were destroyed.""

Oni added; ""Another devastation the flood caused is destruction of food.

""Apart from losing houses majority of the victims have no food and the farmlands have been destroyed, leaving us in a big calamity now and in future because the time to cultivate new crops has passed.

""We are calling on the government, individuals and corporate organizations to come to our aid before the situation goes out of hand.""

Niger farmers count losses

Many farmlands have been wiped out in Niger State where there is wide lamentation among farmers who are appealing to the government to come to their aid.

Our correspondent gathered that entire farmlands were washed away by floods, leaving farmers with nothing to harvest.

An affected farmer, Tukura Saidu from Kuyi village, said over 40 farmers were affected in his village as yams, maize and rice planted were all wiped out, adding that it was the first time of experiencing such a huge loss to flood.

Also, fish worth over N100 million were washed away by flood at Lapai Gwari in Bosso Local Government Area of the state, it was gathered.

A fish farm according to Daily Trust findings, the major place where fish sellers get fresh fish, was greatly affected, causing a rise in the price of fish in the area as residents now have to travel elsewhere to get fish.

A fish farmer, Malam Mohammad Tukur, lamented that the devastation caused by ravaging floods in Lapai Gwari was the first of its kind and appealed to the state government to urgently assist them.

He said about 2000 fish farms had been washed away.

Another farmer, Malam Abdullahi Saidu, said customers from across Nigeria were trooping to the farm before the incident but many farmers had lost millions of naira worth of investments to floods.

The Vice Chairman of Bosso Local Government Area, Malam Saidu Zegi, said in April this year, rainstorms affected over 200 people, just as many farmers lost their farmlands.

The Director General, Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, described the incident as not only pathetic and tragic but also devastating.

Inga said they had sent a team of experts from the agency to investigate the extent of damage caused.

This according to him is to enable the state government come up with modalities of assisting victims.

He said though the state government was battling with insufficient funds occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, it would not fold its arms to allow the people suffer without any aid.

Floods hit Enugu farms

Enugu State is not left out of the massive flooding and destruction of crops. Mr. Austin Obiora has a rice farm of about 235 hectares at Ihuokpara community in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

Speaking with Daily Trust, he recalled how a heavy rainfall on August 26 caused a massive flood which affected his farm. About 16 hectares of the rice field was adversely affected.

According to him, the rice had started flowering when the flood came.

""I had to start afresh because the rice planting season was almost over.

""I started doing another ""broadcasting"" (spreading) of rice seeds in a systematic and orderly way to enable them germinate very well,"" he said.

""It costs about N250,000 to cultivate one hectare of rice field and when multiplied by 16 hectares, it will be over N4m because I have to add the cost of labour,"" Obiora said, adding: ""Therefore, I lost over N4m due to the massive and devastating flood.""

He, however, didn't feel discouraged by the huge loss because he said upon realizing that some large hectares were still there for him, the unaffected hectares represent compensation for his loss.

""We pray that it doesn't happen again in the next planting season, nobody wants to incur losses,"" he said.

Asked whether any government agency came to his aide, he said he considered it would be a waste of time and energy to approach any government body, just as he did not insure his farm in the first place.

However, Obiora said he had learnt his lesson as he has started making arrangements for insuring his farms in future.

Another farmer, an elderly Rev Dr Lambert Echetu who is into maize and cassava farming, told our correspondent that the combined misfortune of flooding and activities of herdsmen had caused a lot of havoc to his maize farm of two hectares at Amagunze in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

He said: ""The cattle and flood messed up my maize farm.

""I planted maize covering two hectares.

""I spent about N240,000 on clearing the bush, seeds and fertilizer.

""We went to the Government House, Enugu to complain about the Fulani herdsmen and their cows destroying our farms.

""The first tragedy was done to the farm by the cows.

""The second tragedy was caused by the huge flooding, even though the place is swampy.

""When I got to the Government House, they would refer me from one office to the other and it was like a wild goose chase and I left,"" he said.

Echetu further said: ""As a servant of God, when I tried to get help from people and I didn't succeed, I handed everything over to God.

""I love farming because I have passion for it.

""I prayed over the farm project before I decided to farm.

""I have a lot of people who need my help in the village.

""My intention is after harvesting the maize, and bringing it to the church, I will distribute the maize to the congregation.""

He said despite the setback, he won't give up farming and had acquired over 100 hectares of land at Ihu-Okpara community, specifically for planting cassava in the next planting season.

Kano, Jigawa farmers cry out

Last month, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) revealed that 20 of the 44 local government areas in Kano State were at high risk of flooding during this year's rainy season.

Tarauni, Garum Malam, Rimin Gado, Gaya, Gezawa, Gwale, Shanono, Gabasawa, Gwarzo, Ungoggo, Warawa, Dawakin Kudu, Dambatta, Bebeji, Kabo, Wudil, Kura, Nassarawa, Kano Municipal and Kumbotso were the local government areas identified in the report.

With the recent wave of rainfall in the state, some of the identified local governments have already begun to experience heavy flooding which resulted in the destruction of several hectares of farmlands by flood, causing loss of millions of naira worth of farm products.

According to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) in Kano, so far, hundreds of rice farmers in five local governments have reported to have been affected by the flood.

The state chapter chairman of RIFAN, Alhaji Haruna Abubakar Aliyu, said farmers in Dambatta, Makoda, Ajingi, Gaya and Rinim Gado have been seriously affected by the flooding.

""Based on the directives received from the RIFAN head office after we had sent our report on the damages caused to our various members, the head office asked us to compile a detailed report on the flood which currently we are working on.

""We have so far identified five local governments, though we are aware there are more than that but we are still working on it,"" he said.

The state chapter chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Alhaji Zubairu Ibrahim, said the association was still assessing the areas affected and number of farmers and farm lands affected.

He added that the outcome of the ongoing assessment would be made public and the association was working on measures to be adopted in assisting the affected farmers.

Attempts to contact the state commissioner for agriculture and who is also the deputy governor proved abortive but sources close to the ministry said a committee had been inaugurated by the state government to look into the issue and present its report for further action.

In Jigawa State, following a two-day heavy downpour in Birninkudu Local Government Area, several houses and farmlands were said to have been destroyed.

Alhaji Wada Faka, the chairman of the local government, said a yet-to-be ascertained number of houses and farmlands were destroyed in Malamawar Gangaran, Babaldu, Wurno, Kiyako and Samamiya villages.

NEMA had also stated that the Nigerian Hydrological Agency (NIHSA) 2020 Annual Flood Outlook already listed 12 local government areas in the state as flood-prone areas.

The NIHSA report listed Kaugama, Taura, Guri, Gwaram, Dutse, Auyo, Miga, Malam Madori, Ringim, Birniwa, Jahun and Kafin Hausa as probable flood risk areas.

Nasarawa farmers groan under flood

Many farms and farming communities were recently submerged in flood waters in Nasarawa, a state with many small, medium and large scale farms.

A farmer in Doma Local Government Area, Abu Doma, said his farm and many others were washed away in a few days.

Same goes with people residing on the bank of the River Benue along the state's boundary with Benue State.

This is the second year in a row that River Kilema in Lafia has flooded and submerged farms, houses and cemeteries among others.

An official of the State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) who prefers anonymity said it was taking measures to mitigate a possible humanitarian crisis in the state.

The agency has been urging those living in flood-prone areas to leave such places.

He said last month, heavy floods occurred in three local government areas including Awe, Nasarawa and Toto.

The Director of flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr. Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umasha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.","Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn03.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00521229:97559b81f1c74f189f2c92809408b0aa:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'washed', 'children', 'homes', 'flood', 'local', 'farm', 'area', 'farmlands', 'nigeria', 'tears', 'state', 'away', 'rice', 'hectares']", ,none
48,48,FL-2019-000093-NGA,A Flood of Polluting Air Conditioners Hampers Africa's Climate Efforts - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-flood-of-polluting-air-conditioners-hampers-africas-climate-efforts,"As air conditioning sales in Africa soar, many of the units imported there are old and inefficient, driving up electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. But some countries are taking action, banning the import of used air conditioners and adopting tough energy standards.

It’s early August and a dozen air conditioners are keeping Joy Obehi’s clients cool on another hot steamy day in Lagos, Nigeria. But invariably the electricity flickers off and her expensive diesel generator rumbles to life. “The power goes out pretty much every day, usually for one hour or two hours,” said Obehi, who rents out short-term meeting space and spends as much as $300 a month on diesel fuel. “[Air conditioners] use a lot of power, but our clients expect our locations to be cooler.” As African incomes rise and the number of hotter days from climate change increases, demand is exploding for air conditioners around the continent. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, more than 500,000 air conditioning units are bought each year and the number is increasing by 4 to 5 percent annually, according to a recent report. But that demand comes at a price: the plethora of energy-sapping — but inexpensive — air conditioners that are stressing already overburdened electricity grids, saddling consumers with high energy bills, contributing to more frequent outages that damage local economies, and making a significant contribution to the continent’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of used and new inefficient AC appliances are being sold in Africa every year, many of them illegally. Many are obsolete secondhand appliances imported mostly from Europe, despite international laws forbidding such activity. The appliances also contain banned ozone-depleting refrigerants that are potent contributors to climate change.

Electricity demand for air conditioners is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040.

And with cooling demand proliferating due to urbanization and hotter temperatures, Africa’s air conditioning market is poised to get bigger. Electricity demand for air conditioners and other cooling appliances is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040, from 11 terawatt-hours (TWh) to 112 terawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency. If African countries adopt stricter air conditioning efficiency standards, energy demand could be cut in half, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 million tons by 2040, according to the United Nations. Africa’s cooling challenge is part of a much larger trend. Worldwide demand for air conditioners is expected to more than triple in the next 30 years, from 1.6 billion units in 2018 to 5.6 billion units by 2050. That amounts to 10 new air conditioners being sold every second for the next three decades. Without government policies to make air conditioners cleaner and more efficient, greenhouse gas emissions from ACs and other cooling equipment will jump by a projected 90 percent by 2050 — a huge step backward in international efforts to limit global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, says a new UN report. Now, some African countries are trying to tamp down on energy-guzzling cooling. Ghana is successfully enforcing a ban on imports of used cooling appliances, including air conditioners. Rwanda approved a similar ban, along with Africa’s toughest-ever energy performance standards for new cooling appliances, both of which are set to come into effect next year. A half-dozen other countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, have minimum performance standards for new air conditioners and refrigerators. But success is still largely elusive due to weak policies and minimal enforcement. “There are not many harmonized efficiency policies at the moment in Africa, and many of them are out of date, not enforced, and not stringent,” said Patrick Blake, a policy expert at the UN’s United for Efficiency Program (U4E).

Among the countries struggling with the issue is Nigeria, Africa’s second-largest AC market behind Egypt. “Compliance with our energy standards is very, very slow,” said Etiosa Uyigue, executive director of a Nigerian environmental group, the Community Research and Development Center (CREDC), which has been pushing for more stringent mandatory energy standards and environmentally friendly refrigerants for all cooling appliances sold in the country. The stakes are enormous. Air conditioner sales are rising steadily across the continent, especially in hotter, more prosperous countries in West Africa. Morocco, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast have all seen a doubling in air conditioner imports since 2010, whether used or new units, according to government data. The United Nations projects that air conditioner stocks will hit 1.5 billion units in Africa by 2030, up from 660 million in 2015. The strains are already being felt. Nigeria’s limited power supplies, which are half the size of North Carolina’s despite having nearly 20 times more people, turn on and off every day and occasionally cause national blackouts, as happened 11 times in 2019. Hot sticky days when air conditioners are humming full throttle are the worst. “We just had two outages today,” said Uyigue, speaking in July from his home in the capital Abuja, where he uses three generators and a small solar energy system to keep the lights on. A Nigeria Energy Commission study in 2014 estimated that air conditioners account for 25 percent of total energy consumption in Abuja and 17 percent nationally. Nigeria’s annual CO2 emissions have tripled since 1990. The country’s widespread reliance on noisy, polluting diesel generators costs the economy nearly $14 billion a year, primarily in added fuel expenses. Meanwhile, Africa is tethered to an AC market dominated by high-polluting inefficient appliances.

Many air conditioners sold in Africa are low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made.

For years, many African countries have been flooded with millions of antiquated secondhand air conditioners and refrigerators imported primarily from Europe. Nigeria and other West African countries with high summer temperatures and close proximity to European shipping ports are especially popular destinations for used cooling appliances, which arrive stuffed into containers, cargo vehicles, and even used cars. The appliances are often broken and those that still work often consume two to three times more electricity than new models. “They come in branded as new, but when they’re off-loaded it’s mostly near-end-of-life e-waste,” said Leslie Adogame, executive director of SRADev, a Nigerian nonprofit environmental health research group. “They’re certainly cheaper to buy, but they use a lot more energy and don’t meet environmental standards.” A half-dozen African countries have joined a United Nations working group, launched in April, that is trying to stop these flows, many of which are unlawful. Shipping non-working electronic equipment is illegal under both the Basel Convention, an international treaty governing hazardous waste, and the European Union’s Waste Shipment Directive. New cooling appliances being sold in Africa are not much better. Recent research by the energy efficiency nonprofit CLASP and the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development (IGSD) showed that 35 percent of new room air conditioners sold in Africa’s 10 largest countries in 2018 were low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China. A quarter of the 650,000 low-efficiency units — none of which meet common efficiency standards used in developed countries — were imported from non-African countries, primarily China. The remaining three-quarters were largely imported and then assembled in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Egypt.

“Environmentally harmful dumping is occurring in Africa,” said Gabrielle Dreyfus, senior scientist at IGSD. “These kinds of markets deprive consumers of a smarter choice by flooding markets with lower-price products that cost consumers more over time.” The report also showed that 790,000 air conditioning units sold in Africa contained obsolete ozone-depleting, greenhouse gas refrigerants known as R-22, which are being phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol. Another 820,000 units contained R-410A refrigerants, a highly potent greenhouse gas with 2,000 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide. They are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol’s Kigali Amendment, beginning in 2019 in developed countries and later this decade in developing countries. Efforts to halt these damaging trade flows have been going on for years, but most have been unsuccessful, in large part simply because more and more African consumers want affordable devices to stay cool. Ghana is a noteworthy exception. Alarmed by the millions of obsolete cooling appliances that were entering the country and the widening gap between energy demand and power production, the country banned all used air conditioner and refrigerator imports in 2008. In 2013, when the government began enforcing the ban, illegal imports plummeted. Last year, new appliances, mostly from China, made up 95 percent of the market. “We succeeded in reversing the market in favor of new appliances,” said Kofi Agyarko, director of energy efficiency and climate change at the Ghana Energy Commission, who credits tough enforcement for catalyzing the shift. While new, more efficient appliances cost two to three times as much as used ones, they consume a third as much electricity, with Ghanaians saving on average $140 a year on energy bills, Agyarko said. But even if countries can effectively ban used imports, how can they limit the flood of inefficient new appliances into Africa? Rwanda thinks it has the answer. Last year, as part of a comprehensive national cooling strategy, Rwanda enacted Africa’s toughest energy standards and energy labeling for new air conditioners and other cooling appliances. The mandatory standards, which take effect next year, are modeled after guidelines developed by the UN’s United for Efficiency program. Brian Holuj, who leads the program’s work on cooling appliances, says Rwanda’s efforts are an important breakthrough. “For the first time in Africa, Rwanda will demonstrate the impact of mandatory policies, coupled with strong energy efficiency requirements and limits on global warming-damaging coolants in new products,” he said.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, AC energy demand would be cut in half from current projections.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, air conditioning energy demand would be cut in half from current projections, according to the UN. “More than two-dozen full-sized power plants could be avoided through more efficient air conditioners and refrigerators in Africa,” Holuj said. A critical step, Holuj said, is for countries to come together regionally on consistent policies, backed by enforcement, that send a strong market signal to the industry. “The key is regional alignment,” he said, citing the EU’s success in developing common requirements and energy labeling. Dreyfus, the scientist at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, echoed this point: As long as markets for cheap products are able to flourish, high-efficiency appliances will have a hard time competing. “If a manufacturer feels they have to compete for market share by selling low-efficiency obsolete equipment, we have to close the loopholes to bring the market up so that they have the right marketplace in which to sell better products,” she said. Nigeria has tried some of the approaches Ghana and Rwanda are using, but they are not working, according to CREDC’s Uyigue. Nigeria imposed an import ban on obsolete used cooling appliances in 2010, but it is not being enforced. It adopted voluntary energy performance standards and energy labels for air conditioners in 2017, but compliance is broadly lacking. Numerous obstacles are impeding progress. The first is price — a low-performing air conditioner costs only $100 to $200. The second is trade barriers such as a 20 percent duty on imported assembled air conditioners, an important source of government revenue. The third — perhaps the biggest — is the government’s unwillingness to take the tough steps necessary to force a market shift.","Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/site/GP01QLI_High_res_Nigeria_web.jpg,"['africa', 'air', 'demand', 'climate', 'hampers', 'flood', 'conditioners', 'africas', 'efforts', 'cooling', 'used', 'units', 'appliances', 'countries', 'energy', 'polluting']", ,flood
49,49,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Nigeria: 10 Things Nigerians Should Expect in 2021 - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/202101030130.html,"The year 2020 has come and gone with its challenges which include the coronavirus pandemic, banditry, kidnapping, terrorism and several other depressing episodes, and of course some spirit-lifting events. Here, Daily Trust on Sunday gives a list of what to expect this New Year.

Increased agitation for 2023

There is likely going to be increased agitation ahead of the 2023 general elections this year, and among other issues, whether or not zoning will determine who political parties decide to make their flagbearer, for the presidency.

The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) is likely to entrench its position on the subject, as its president, Alhaji Yerima Shetima, has rejected the agitation for the zoning of the number one position. Holding the same position is Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari's nephew, who said competency and not zoning should be the consideration in electing Buhari's successor.

However, people like Alhaji Shuaib Mustapha Kano, political adviser to a former governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, are likely to remain adamant on zoning the presidency to Eastern Nigeria.

Both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have debated whether or not their parties' tickets should be zoned to the North or to the South. This debate will most likely deepen this year.

Floods still in sight

Flooding has become one of the disasters that never seems to go away, and 2020 is a typical example. It happened again despite forecasts by the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and the Hydrological Services Agency (HAS) that revealed there would be massive flooding across many states from the beginning of the year. Also, donor agencies and even private firms repeatedly warned of the impending and imminent floods. The floods came and agricultural output and property worth billions were lost. It happened in Akwa Ibom State where 100 houses were destroyed and 300 persons displaced in Eket Local Government Area (LGA) in 2020, and in Borno where hundreds of shelters in Internally Displaced People's (IDP) camps were destroyed. Thousands of people were displaced and property destroyed in several parts of the country.

A report by Relief Web posted on October 19, 2020, indicated that flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara states, among others, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas.

In Kebbi State were a massive flood ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5bn and rendered people homeless, the Director of Flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umaisha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.

This is an example of promises Nigerians continue to get and there is no certainty that this will not happen again.

COVID-19 vaccine for 20m people

The Federal Government is making efforts to procure 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 to check the spread of the virus. Everything being equal, this means less than a quarter of Nigeria's over 200 million population may be vaccinated. Nigeria's Health Minister, Osagie Ehanire, who said this at a press conference in December, 2020, pointed out that health sector employees would be vaccinated first, then the vulnerable and those with chronic illnesses.

So far, Nigeria has recorded not less than 70,500 COVID-19 cases with 1,184 fatalities, and more than 65,000 patients have recovered from the disease. As of January 1, 2021, 1074 new confirmed cases and deaths were recorded. Therefore, there is a high possibility of another lockdown in 2021 to curtail the spread of the virus across states, but whether this would have a positive impact is left to be seen because there are arguably more Nigerians in slums and ghettos where families share toilet facilities and other basic amenities, and then there is the danger of a rise in criminality and rape as was the case in 2020.

Budget increase impact

President Muhammadu Buhari recently signed into law the 2021 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly. The National Assembly had on December 21, 2020, passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill with an aggregate expenditure of N13,588,027,886,175 trillion.

It comprises total Capital Supplementation of N1,060,751,051,650 and total Capital Expenditure of N4,125,149,354,222. Statutory Transfer stands at N496,528,471,273; Rrecurrent Expenditure of N5,641,970,060,680 with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 3.00 per cent.

The National Assembly also provided N3,324,380,000tn for debt servicing which would obviously serve as a drain on the country's finances.

The legislators had increased the budget estimate by N505,607,317,942 from the estimate of N13,082,420,568,233 presented to the joint sitting of the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 8, 2020. This means Nigeria would have more money to pump into vital sectors of the economy like healthcare, education and security.

Insecurity still looms

The abduction of over 300 schoolboys by gunmen in an all-boys Government Science School in Kankara, Katsina State, is probably one of the biggest highlights of insecurity in 2020. Even though the boys have been released, the incident still raises questions about Nigeria's dwindling security. Kidnappings continue to happen on the Kaduna-Abuja road, Lokoja-Abuja Expressway, the Obajana-Okene axis in Kogi State, among others. In the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, Kuje Area Council has recorded several cases of people being abducted, particularly in their homes. Terrorism in the North East and banditry in Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna states, among others, is yet to stop and there is no clear sign that 2021 is going to be different. Nigeria still has the same security chiefs from 2020 and the cost of goods and services are still on the rise.

Stiffer laws against rape, gender-based violence

In June, 2020, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, said Nigeria recorded 717 rape incidents between January and May of the same year. This was before the lockdown due to COVID-19 which saw a spike in rape cases and gender-based violence. Some states have since taken steps to tackle the issue. One of such is Kaduna, where Governor Nasir el-Rufai signed into law the amended Penal Code Law 2020 that provides for stiff penalties for rape of a child, including death, surgical castration for male convicts, and bilateral salpingectomy for female rapists.

Also, in 2019 Nigeria launched a sex offenders' register as a vital step towards tackling reported cases of sexual abuse. With these steps, there is hope for the fight against rape and gender-based violence this year as many Nigerians, especially Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), continue to call for stiffer laws.

Possible food shortage

As the activities of the terrorist group Boko Haram continue, including that of bandits and kidnappers who have been reported to have whisked or attacked people from their farms, there is a possible food shortage in sight, especially in Northern Nigeria. In addition is the effect of the 2020 flood that destroyed many farms across the country.

Movies

The year 2021 promises to be eventful with the release of movies like the musical drama 'Dreamers' written by Michael Castiel and scheduled for release on January 31; 'Mamba's Diamond' directed by Seyi Babatope, written by Darlington Abuda and starring actors like Osas Ighodaro, Uchembe Williams and Nse Ikpe-Etim set for March 19; 'Retribution' which is still in development; 'Willie-Willie' also in the development stage, among others.

Music

Meanwhile, nominations for the 63rd annual Grammy Awards were recently announced with Nigeria's Burna Boy (for his recent album 'Twice as Tall') and Wizkid on the list for the 2021 awards by the Recording Academy. Burna Boy was nominated under the World Music Album while Wizkid for his feature in Beyonce's Brownskin Girl song.

Books! Books!! Books!!!

This year TJ Benson's debut novel 'Madhouse' is set for release. Also, 'The Days of Silence' by Angel Patricks Amegbe; 'What Happened to Janet Uzor' by Miracle Emeka-Nkwor and Onyeka Nwelue's 'The Strangers of Braamfontein', to mention a few.

Festivals

As always there are a number of festivals to look forward to this year. There is the Lagos Carnival held during the Lagos Black Heritage Festival, Afan National Festival, Argungu Fishing Festival, Atyap Annual Cultural Festival and several more.

Most book and art festivals come towards year-end such as the Ake Arts and Book Festival, Lagos Book and Art Festival (LABAF), Benue Books and Art Festival and the Abuja Literary and Arts Festival (ALITFEST).

• Short - range forecasts up to 31 th October, marking the end of the season shows continued favorable seasonal conditions in most of the region except some localized pockets of moderate dryness. It is thus likely that the rainy season will be abnormally late particularly in the Sahel region.

• Early October, the end of the rainy season in the Sahel, West Africa has been characterized by mostly adequate and well-distributed rains: this results in average to above-average seasonal rainfall The Sahel region benefited the most from very good conditions with well above-average seasonal rains, while belowaverage rainfall spread over the southernmost part of the region across the Gulf of Guinea. The cumulative heavy rainfall recorded from mid-August to September resulted in flooding, that have affected about 760,000 people in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal with at least 111 fatalities.

• As a result of increase in rainfall since late July and wetter conditions in August and September: a pattern of strongly above-average vegetation emerged during September and October in all of the Sahel. Agricultural areas benefitted from very good seasonal conditions. Good production prospects are certain this year in the region (in biomass and crops production). As a result of good seasonal performance in mid-October water resources remain at a good level. Overall they have reached their highest level throughout the West African region.

• Across the Sahel, harvest has started for main season millet and sorghum crops in southern Mali, Burkina Faso, southern Niger, and eastern Senegal. Meanwhile favourable harvesting of main season crops reached completion in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, southern Ghana, southern Togo, Benin, and central Cameroon, while crops are still developing in Guinea, northern Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, and northern Nigeria under generally favourable conditions. Despite localized floods impacting the Sahel and drier-than-average conditions along the Gulf of Guinea countries, overall conditions are favourable except in conflict-affected northern Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, and northeast Nigeria along with the conflict and floodaffected Far North region of Cameroon.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540757-WFP-0000120139.png?itok=iitFCIc-,"['crops', 'monitor', 'situation', 'seasonal', 'region', '2020', 'west', 'season', 'floods', 'conditions', 'update', 'good', 'mali', 'southern', 'rainfall', 'sahel', 'africa', 'cameroon']", ,flood
51,51,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Investors support Shell's strategy for net-zero emissions despite backlash - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/investors-support-shells-strategy-for-net-zero-emissions-despite-backlash,"Nearly 89% of shareholders at Shell’s annual investor meeting on Tuesday voted in favour of the oil and gas company’s strategy to achieve a net-zero emissions business by 2050, the Financial Times reports. Despite this success, the firm is also “confronted by growing support for activists’ demands to set more ambitious targets”, the newspaper adds. It notes that a separate resolution by Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This calling for Shell to set more “inspirational” targets attracted the support of 30% of shareholders, although such resolutions require 75% to pass. According to the Times, Follow This “insists that Shell’s goals are not consistent with achieving the Paris climate accord, in part because it lacks near-term targets for absolute emissions reductions”. The Guardian notes that this “significant shareholder rebellion” came on the day that the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its net-zero pathway, in which all exploration for new oil and gas fields stops this year to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It quotes Charlie Kronick, a senior climate finance adviser for Greenpeace UK, who notes that Shell’s plans would increase gas production by 20% by 2030, “contravening the advice of the IEA”. Reuters states that, under its current plans, Shell intends to increase its investment in low-carbon energy sources in the coming years, “but at least 75% of its spending will continue to go towards oil and gas”. In Bloomberg’s coverage, it says that the oil giant also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its “spill-prone operations in Nigeria”.

Meanwhile, another Guardian story reports that, in Australia, politicians and companies are being urged by campaigners to abandon plans for new coal power, gas and oil investments in light of the new IEA report. In Europe, Politico reports that the landmark report is “giving Brussels new ammunition in its war on fossil fuels”, as its conclusions support the European Commission’s efforts to discontinue EU funding for oil and gas projects. According to EurActiv, environmentalists have “warned against some of the assumptions in the scenario” developed by the IEA, notably the growing shares of biomass used for energy. The piece adds that IEA modellers have explained that their scenario assumes no overall increase in cropland use for bioenergy production, or new bioenergy crops on forested land. The Guardian reports on comments from the UK climate champion, Nigel Topping, who says he is “stubbornly optimistic” that the world will arrive at an agreement to “forge a transition to a net-zero future” at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year. (For more on the IEA’s latest report, see Carbon Brief‘s coverage.)

52,52,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Conflicting reports emerge in Nigeria over video of downed plane - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/03/conflicting-reports-emerge-in-nigeria-over-video-of-downed-plane/,"National-World

Conflicting reports have emerged in Nigeria over a video of a downed plane, after the country’s air force disputed claims from Boko Haram that its militants shot down a jet.

The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) strongly questioned the authenticity of the Boko Haram clip which purports to show fighters shooting at the military plane, eventually causing it to fall to the ground.

The NAF suggested that the crash was due to an air accident.

The video was published by the SITE Intelligence Group and is circulating across Nigerian media.

“It is evident that most parts of the video were deliberately doctored to give the false impression that the aircraft was shot down” when it was “obviously an air accident,” the NAF said in a statement posted on Facebook Friday.

The NAF rejected the seven-and-a-half-minute edited clip, calling it “false propaganda” and urging Nigerians “to ignore the contents of the videos making the rounds until all investigations as to how the aircraft crashed are completed.”

The NAF reported the plane missing on Wednesday, with two pilots on board.

A spokesperson told CNN Thursday afternoon the fighter jet had been deployed near Borno State in northeastern Nigeria to provide air support to ground troops, who were under fire from Boko Haram fighters before radar contact was lost.

“The cause of the crash as well as the whereabouts of the 2 pilots remain unknown. The pilots are Flight Lieutenant John Abolarinwa and Flight Lieutenant Ebiakpo Chapele,” the NAF said earlier Friday.

In the disputed video Boko Haram claims to have shot down the Alpha Jet.

The footage shows multiple fighters shooting into the air before a blast lights up the sky as a plane ignites into flames and falls to the ground. The video then cuts to fighters standing around what appears to be the wreckage of the jet.

It then cuts to the plane, showing “NAF 475” — the missing aircraft’s ID number. It later shows a charred body.

Separately the video then shows what appears to be a patch laying on the ground, displaying John Abolarinwa’s name.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Boko Haram has increased attacks against the Nigerian military as it tries to regain control of lost territories in pockets of the country’s northeast.

Frequent air raids by the Nigerian military have continued to rattle the insurgents — dislodging them from their hideouts.","Sat, 03 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['air', 'video', 'plane', 'conflicting', 'reports', 'boko', 'haram', 'emerge', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'shot', 'naf', 'fighters', 'downed', 'shows']", ,flood
53,53,FL-2019-000093-NGA,"Nigeria: Dozens Killed, Houses Destroyed As Floods Ravage North-Central Nigeria - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009250681.html,"Torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks wreaked havoc in the North-central sub-region of Nigeria.

State governments in the North-central region of Nigeria are employing measures to halt the perennial flooding ravaging parts of the zone and alleviate the sufferings of the victims.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks claimed many lives, destroyed hundreds of houses and washed away farmlands and domestic animals in the sub-region.

The catastrophe compelled the governments in the zone to take steps to avert further flooding and provide succour to the affected people such as temporary shelters, food and medicines.

In Nasarawa State, Governor Abdullahi Sule ordered the immediate evacuation of persons whose houses had been submerged by flood in Nasarawa, headquarters of Nasarawa Local Government Area.

Mr Sule also directed that foodstuff, mattresses and other relief items be provided to the victims immediately.

His spokesperson, Ibrahim Addra, said the governor had visited the ancient town and sympathised with the people over the incident.

He urged the people to desist from erecting structures on waterways and stop indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the drains.

In response to the governor's directive, the Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) distributed food and non-food relief materials to over 45 communities ravaged by flood in Awe and Nasarawa local government areas of the state.

The Executive Secretary of the agency, Zakari Allumagas, said the governor gave the order during his visit to Nasarawa following the flood in the town.

Mr Allumagas said the relief materials comprised 44 trucks of 600 bags each of assorted grains and three trucks of non-food items such as building materials, children's clothing, cooking utensils and mats.

He warned against diversion of the items.

He also disclosed that over 700 households were displaced by floods in such communities as Ara, Udenyi Magaji, Ugya and Gude, Nasarawa town in Nasarawa Local Government Area, and Ribi and Gidan Soja in Awe Local Government Area.

The executive secretary said the state government was working with traditional and community leaders to come up with a directive banning approval and sale of lands near riverine areas of the state.

In Kogi, the State Commissioner for Environment, Victor Omofaiye, said many communities in some local government areas in the state had been ravaged by floods.

Mr Omofaiye said such communities included places in Kotonkarfe, Lokoja, Ajaokuta and Ibaji local government areas.

He said some victims of the disaster had already been moved to IDPs camps in Kotonkarfe, while the IDPs camps and flood estates in Lokoja were being prepared through clearing of their surroundings and fumigation for resettlement of the flood victims.

He said that the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had predicted that in 2020, about 10 local government areas would be affected by flood in Kogi.

They are Lokoja, Kogi/Kotonkarfe, Ajaokuta, Bassa, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela, Ofu, Adavi and Omala.

""The water level of River Niger is still fluctuating within the range of 10.5 to 10.7, but as at September 21, it was 10.7 compared to the 12.5 as at the same period in 2012 in Kogi.

""Flood is a menace that we experience in Kogi every year. The flood we experienced in Kogi in 2012 was massive and devastating; we do not pray for such in 2020, but we are actually on red alert,"" the commissioner said.

He attributed flooding in the state to human and natural factors.

According to him, the human factor has to do with the people's habit in managing the environment as they dump refuse on waterways and drains, thereby obstructing free flow of water.

Mr Omofaiye said that the confluence of two major rivers in Kogi: River Niger and Benue, which most times overflowed their banks, was affecting communities along the river paths, including those of other small rivers that took their sources from river Niger and Benue.

""Opening of dams, especially along River Niger, such as Lagdo Dam from Cameroon and other dams also cause flooding in Kogi due to high volume of water.

""We have done a lot of sensitisation and awareness creation to educate the general public, especially the people living in the flood prone areas in all the predicted local government areas.

""We are also partnering with the relevant stakeholders including SEMA to ensure that we are ahead of any emerging situation,"" he said.

He said he had led a team on assessment tour of some affected communities in Lokoja to ascertain the level of damage done by flood in the area and begin to tackle them head on.

The commissioner said the Governor Yahaya Bello administration would not relent in its efforts at tackling environmental challenges including flooding across the state.

He, therefore, advised the people living in the flood prone areas to relocate and move to high grounds in order not to endanger their lives as a result of floods.

The situation is similar in Plateau as the acting Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Rose Dakwar, said that floods had affected seven local government areas in the state recently.

Mrs Dakwar listed the affected local government areas as Mangu, Pankshin, Shendam, Quan Pan, Langtang South, Mikang and Wase.

She said that many farmlands, houses bridges and other valuables were destroyed by the floods in the listed areas.

""We as an emergency management agency, have already visited each of the affected local government areas in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).

""We visited and ascertained the level of damage and reported back to government.

""Government has, therefore, included the affected areas in the distribution of palliatives before the major assistance will come their way,"" she said.

Also, the NEMA Zonal Coordinator in Jos, Eugene Nyenlong, said the agency had composed jingles in local languages to educate the people on how to tackle floods if they occurred.

Mr Nyenlong also disclosed that the agency in the zone was making use of Flood Vanguards comprising youth corps members who raised alarms if flood occurred.

""We also have locals that are engaged to act in terms of response and evacuation when flood occurs,"" he said.

In Niger, not less than 500 communities have been flooded since the onset of the 2020 raining season in the state.

The Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Ahmed Inga, who disclosed this also said about 22 local government areas had so far been affected by the floods.

Mr Inga said 29 deaths were recorded during the floods, while 45,000 farmers were directly affected by the disaster.

""Farmlands and houses have been destroyed and assessment is still ongoing, "" he said.

He said Governor Abubakar Bello had directed the agency to look inward and design a better way of mitigating the situation by relocating the affected communities to safe areas.

The Governor of Niger-State, Abubakar Sani Bello [PHOTO CREDIT: Official Twitter handle of Mr Bello || @abusbello]He said that the state government had identified 13 resettlement sites in Muregi, Akere and Ketso, among others, where the affected communities were being resettled.

He said that compensations had been paid and allocation of plots to the affected communities would soon commence.

The director-general blamed the flooding partly on the situation where the state was home to three hydro-electric dams- Shiroro, Kainji and Jebba, and River Niger and River Kaduna flowing across parts of the state.

Similarly, the Benue Government has assured residents of flood prone areas of its plans to tackle the incessant flooding in communities in the state.

The State Director of Environment, Richarge Azaagee, who disclosed this, said plans were underway to address some of the flooding challenges, especially in Makurdi.

Mr Azaagee denied that the government had abandoned communities suffering from flood related challenges.

He said the government had already identified the causes of flooding in some communities/settlements and was working toward fixing them.

""The problem of erosion and flood is not just in Kaamem community alone, it cuts across many communities in Makurdi and the state at large.

54,54,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Floods And Food Shortages Threaten To Push Nigeria Into A Food Crisis - The Organization for World Peace,https://theowp.org/reports/floods-and-food-shortages-threaten-to-push-nigeria-into-a-food-crisis/,"Nigeria is currently dealing with twin crises, record-breaking flooding, and a food shortage. According to Reuters, this is threatening to push Africa’s most populous country into a devastating food crisis. In 2020, Nigeria has dealt with destructive floods that have killed at least 40 and have displaced over 15,000 people. Recently, in September of 2020, intense flooding caused by heavy rainfall in northern Nigeria destroyed thousands of homes and wide areas of crops. As reported by Reuters, the flooding in northern Nigeria has destroyed 90% of the 2 million tons of rice that was expected to be harvested this Autumn. This loss is equivalent to 20% of the rice that Nigeria harvested last year.

Destruction of rice paddies is not the only food-related casualty of these floods. A shortage of maize has made it extremely difficult for chicken farmers to feed their flocks due to the price of chicken feed more than doubling. For Nigeria, rice is the staple grain, and chicken is a core protein. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many movement restrictions and financing difficulties that complicated the spring planting of many crops including maize. The combination of crop-destroying floods and an already existent maize shortage makes it look as if Nigeria is on the brink of a damaging food crisis. Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, told Reuters that “there is a real fear of having food shortages. The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Another effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is on fertilizer. After the virus’s outbreak caused a shutdown of Nigeria’s sole urea plant for two weeks, many farmers opted to skip using fertilizer on their crops, which has limited their crop yields.

Through all of this, the Nigerian government is still doing everything it can to promote domestic food production and local Nigerian farmers, but that may not be enough to sustain a country of nearly 200 million people through a looming food crisis. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that not one cent of the country’s central bank dollars would go towards food or fertilizer imports in an attempt to encourage local farmers and producers over imports. In August 2020, Nigeria took about 4,000 tons of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s strategic stocks (ECOWAS), released 30,000 tons of its own maize, and gave four companies special permission to import maize into the country, according to Reuters. The Nigerian Economic Summit Group has also called for “a complete overhaul” of agricultural policy.

In an interview with Reuters, Nigeria’s Agriculture Minister Muhammad Sabo Nanono said that “there is no question about it that there is an imminent problem with food insecurity, not only in Nigeria, but also in nations all over the world.” He is absolutely correct in that statement. According to a report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) called the Ecological Threat Register (ETR), food security is a major symptom of the ongoing climate crisis that is projected to worsen over the next several decades. By the ETR’s estimates, the global demand for food will increase by 50% by 2050. Approximately two billion people already experience moderate to severe food insecurity currently, and that number is expected to increase to 3.5 billion people by the year 2050. 822 million people currently experience undernutrition globally, leaving them at an extremely high risk of starvation. Additionally, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of food insecurity, at 52% of the population, and 18 of the 20 most food-insecure countries globally are located in the region.

What is happening in Nigeria should sound an alarm for the rest of the world. If the world continues on this trajectory, the climate crisis will only escalate in the coming years and decades. With that will come an increase in natural disasters, with flooding being the most common natural disaster to occur since 1990, according to the ETR. Flooding not only threatens people’s lives and property, but it also threatens the survival and harvestability of important crops, as seen with the current situation in Nigeria. Floods are also not the only natural disasters that will worsen with climate change, but wildfires and storm events like hurricanes will become more frequent and more damaging as well. All of these have the potential to threaten the food security of nations all over the globe. The ETR reports that 22% of countries will face catastrophic food insecurity by the year 2050, which would result in “substantial displacement of people or substantial increase in undernourishment.” That statistic shows that a food crisis like this will not be an event unique to Nigeria but could potentially threaten many other countries across the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst in worsening food security for countries around the globe. The United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) has warned that the number of people facing food insecurity could potentially double by the end of the pandemic. According to the Pullitzer Center, global shutdowns and border closures to curb the virus have caused tightened credit access to farmers, limited access to inputs for farmers, limited food transport services and food imports. Constraints like these have led to surges in food prices and limited many populations’ access to nutritious food. The effects of this can be seen in what is happening in Nigeria, and it has worsened food shortages that the country was already experiencing pre-pandemic.

The other countries of the world who have the means should take this opportunity to send humanitarian aid to Nigeria during this time in order to offset or prevent the looming food crisis. It would also be in the interest of the U.N. and other peacekeeping or human rights focused international organizations to aid Nigeria in any way that is possible so that the situation does not worsen into a debilitating crisis that could threaten millions of lives. The situation in Nigeria is of utmost urgency, so it is important that the international community acts with haste.

Furthermore, in order to take action towards preventing devastating food crises and worsening natural disasters in the future, the most important steps that nations can take is implementing aggressive climate change policies that curb emissions and aim to use cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy. This is especially true for countries who are the world’s biggest emitters and polluters, including but not limited to the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Combatting climate change will require an immense collective effort and continued inaction will only lead to more human suffering in places like Nigeria where people are already seeing the harsh effects of the climate crisis.

The impending food crisis in Nigeria is demonstrative of many issues that the world is facing. Swift action should be taken not only to aid Nigeria in combatting a destructive food crisis, but in the long run, all nations of the world should be putting progressive climate policies into effect. Growing food insecurity is a major symptom of a worsening climate, and the action should be taken now to ensure global food insecurity does not reach frightening levels in the future.","Sat, 19 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,"['farmers', 'climate', 'world', 'food', 'threaten', 'floods', 'push', 'crisis', 'nations', 'nigeria', 'insecurity', 'maize', 'countries', 'shortages']", ,none

In September 2018, heavy rains were experienced in Nigeria which caused severe flooding in 129 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of 12 States which affected 2,321,592 people, based on the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) situation report. An estimated 722,741 people were internally displaced, and 351,236 people had immediate humanitarian needs in food; shelter; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and health.

On 17 September, the NEMA declared a state of emergency in four of the worst-affected states (Niger, Kogi, Anambra and Delta), where thousands of communities had been forced to evacuate from submerged settlements and seek refuge in temporary Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps. As the Niger River continued to flow above danger level, and additional dams were released, a state of emergency also was declared in five more states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Taraba, Kebbi and Adamawa) on 11 October 2018. The flooding situation exceeded thresholds of local capacity to respond to the people in need.

The floods resulted in rapid population displacement, destruction of shelters, extensive losses to livelihoods and the local economy, in addition to high rates of water-borne diseases among the affected population and their host communities. Internally Displaced Persons staying with host communities were particularly susceptible to cholera and other water-borne diseases due to the poor access to potable water, hygiene infrastructure and medical care in those locations. These challenges also impacted displaced people in IDP camps, who similarly lacked access to basic water and sanitation services.

Upon the request of Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), IFRC launched an Emergency Appeal in October 2018 for 5.4 million Swiss francs to support 300,000 flood-affected people in the areas of focus of shelter and non-food items, livelihoods and basic needs; health; WASH; and protection, gender and inclusion (PGI) for 9 months. The objective was to provide lifesaving and recovery interventions in 6 out of the over 18 states in Nigeria affected by flooding. The intervention focused on 6 states identified during the multi-sector needs assessment as those in most need of assistance, namely Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Niger, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The initial plan was to have the affected population supported in an IDP camp setup (schools and health facilities).

However, the flood-affected population moved out of the camps earlier than expected. The government also aimed to vacate the schools that were used to host the IDPs to be vacated to avoid the disruption of the resuming of classes in January 2019. As a result, these changes affected the geographical context of the operation as the flood-affected population dispersed to different Local Government Areas (LGAs) and villages.

The operation had to strategize to ensure planned activities were to be held in their current location. Even though all affected families returned to their communities after the acute phase, the flooding resulted in long-term impacts, including a cholera outbreak in December when IDPs returned to their communities. The devastating loss to livelihoods and trauma of displacement also created psychosocial needs within the affected population.","Mon, 06 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1493663-MDRNG025eafr.png?itok=KHVy4p40,"['states', 'communities', 'n', 'nigeria', 'plan', 'needs', 'report', 'local', 'flood', 'population', 'emergency', 'mdrng025', 'water', 'flooding', 'final', 'displaced', 'response', 'appeal', 'affected']", ,flood

ABUJA, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Death toll has risen to 18 due to the floods caused by persistent rainfall in central Nigeria, said a local official on Wednesday.

Confirming the figure to reporters, Ibrahim Inga, head of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency in Nigeria's central region, said eight more deaths were recorded recently.

On October 16, Inga had earlier confirmed 10 deaths recorded over the past two months as the floods wreaked havoc in the state.

So far, 41,959 people have been displaced due to the disaster, the official said.

The floods, as a result of a localized high-intensity rainfall accompanied by torrential winds since August, also triggered massive run-off activities in streams and rivers in the state.

""The combined effect of the micro-climate trend and severe rainfall regime upstream of rivers Niger and Kaduna increased inflow in the basin, which resulted in the spillage of the water from the three hydropower dams,"" Inga told reporters.

He said 2,714 houses have been destroyed so far by the disaster. The flood swept through 20 local government areas, with 152 communities submerged.

The floods also badly damaged, roads, bridges, culverts and other buildings, the official said.

Inga said the excess waters had inundated several hectares of farmlands and displaced some dwellers in hinterland communities.

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, which is responsible for issuing flood alerts here, had since early August issued an alert over possible flooding due to the high intensity of rainfall across the country.

The hydrological body said the flooding incidents are due to high rainfall intensity of long duration, rainstorms, blockage of drainage systems and poor urban planning resulting from the erection of structures within the floodplains and waterways.

This year, Nigeria's 36 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja, would witness different levels of flooding, the hydrological body predicted.","Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['official', 'death', 'roundup', 'nigerias', 'recorded', 'xinhua', 'rises', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'flood', 'central', 'hydrological', 'disaster', 'inga', 'flooding', '18', 'floods', 'toll', 'rivers']", ,flood

59,59,FL-2019-000093-NGA,The new 'jollof wars' and why Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria for its first Africa base - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/14/the-new-jollof-wars-and-why-twitter-chose-ghana-over-nigeria-for-its-first-africa-base/,"National-World

Twitter’s announcement Monday that it will set up its first Africa base in Ghana, West Africa, has generated fierce debate among Nigerian users of the social media app, and reignited the never-ending rivalry between the two countries, known colloquially as the ‘jollof wars.’

Many Nigerians believe that Twitter’s decision is a snub to the continent’s largest economy, which is seeing rapid growth and investment in its tech scene.

According to NOI polls, 39.6 million Nigerians have a Twitter account, which is more than the entire 32 million population of Ghana.

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey capped a whirlwind tour of Africa in 2019 by pledging to move to the continent for several months in 2020.

Now it seems that his business will make that move first.

In a statement announcing the decision, Twitter described Ghana “as a champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet.”

The social media giant also cited Ghana’s hosting of the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) as another reason for moving there, saying it aligns with “its ambition to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa.”

Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said “the choice of Ghana as headquarters for Twitter’s Africa operations is EXCELLENT news,” and described it as a “beautiful partnership between Ghana and Twitter and which is critical for the dev’t of Ghana’s hugely important tech sector.”

‘No ease of doing business’

Some Nigerians blamed an “inconducive business environment” for Twitter choosing Ghana over Nigeria.

“Under @MBuhari our ease of doing business is so bad that it’s easier for terrorists to get phone lines than law-abiding residents. You can land at Ghana’s Kotoka Airport and get a SIM card at the airport. But a camel has to pass through the eye of a needle to get one in Nigeria,” said Reno Omokri via Twitter, a former presidential aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan.

Omokri was referring to the suspension of new phone lines registration because of a federal government policy to link all active SIM cards in the country to a national identity number (NIN) for security reasons.

The exercise is time consuming and the deadline has been extended multiple times, leaving new arrivals unable to obtain a local number, until at least May.

Another Twitter user, lawyer Moe Odele wrote: “One of our clients wanted to open shop in Nigeria for their West Africa office. Once we sent them a breakdown of the regulatory requirements for their industry (also tech), they hit us with ‘we will get back to you.’ We haven’t heard back since then.”

Another commenter, Onye Ajuju, said Twitter’s decision was justified and that Nigerians had a “bloated sense of entitlement.”

“It’s unbelievable seeing Nigerians throwing a tantrum because Twitter went to Ghana. The lack of awareness of how bad things are in the country, the bloated sense of entitlement, the unhinged expectations that everyone should accept Nigeria’s dysfunction…it’s incredible!” she said.

In 2019, Ghana ranked 13 places higher than Nigeria in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index.

Google,Microsoft and Huawei are among international tech giants that have expanded their operations in Ghana, targeting software developers and young creatives on the continent.

In 2018, Facebook opened its first community hub space in Africa in Nigeria’s commercial city, Lagos, while announcing plans last year to open an operational office also in Lagos, but for tech investors such as Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, there are lessons to be learned if Nigeria will continue to attract much-needed foreign investment.

“We have to think carefully about the reasons why Twitter chose Ghana — not necessarily in the context of whether we want to bring Twitter to Nigeria or not, but in the context of what it will take for us to remain a competitive destination for investors,” Aboyeji told CNN on Tuesday.

“We need to start thinking very carefully about enhancing democracy and the rule of law, freedom of speech, and most importantly, our role in enabling the Africa Free Trade Agreement. It’s not enough for us to just be a big market… We have next door to us, a very competitive neighbor, who’s doing all the right things to make itself the hub of West Africa,” he added.

‘A more productive market’

Another Nigerian tech entrepreneur and investor Bosun Tijani, told CNN that Twitter simply chose a more productive market to run its Africa operations.

“While Nigeria has a huge market that Twitter would love to target, the business environment here is quite demanding… It’s strenuous…the cost of running a business here is high. But with the AfCFTA single market agreement which Africa is signed up to, a company like Twitter can choose to set up shop in a small market like Ghana — that gives the best opportunity for it to operate — and still serve the Nigerian market,” said Tijani, who heads a tech innovation lab, CcHUB.

From tourism to tech, Ghana has been actively courting investors from the diaspora and in particular African-Americans, some of whom were given citizenship and encouraged to return to their roots.

Ghana also ranked as the 43rd most peaceful country in the world, in the 2020 Global Peace Index, placing 104 spots ahead of Nigeria — which grapples with Boko Haram insurgency and periodic outbreaks of violence.","Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['tech', 'market', 'twitter', 'chose', 'nigerians', 'doing', 'west', 'jollof', 'ghana', 'wars', 'nigeria', 'base', 'business', 'africa']", ,flood

Nigeria is approaching the peak of its rainy season, and flooding is expected to hit 15 out of its 36 states this month. The agency has issued a red alert because of above-normal water levels on the country's two largest rivers, the Benue and the Niger.

In August, many communities along the rivers were cut off due to collapsed bridges and impassable roads. Four students were killed when a pedestrian bridge fell at a university in the northern region.

FILE - Houses partially submerged in flood waters are pictured in Lokoja city, Kogi State, Nigeria, Sept. 17, 2018.

With thousands of houses and hectares of farmland and produce destroyed along with schools and shops, the economic impact of this year'sflooding is expected to be high. The country's emergency management agency is stepping in to distribute items like cement bags, blankets and hygiene products.

Peter Odjugo, a professor of geography at Nigeria's University of Benin, works with the Nigerian Meteorological Society. He has been tracking the extreme weather patterns and says the government has repeatedly failed to take preemptive measures to reduce the impact of flooding.

""What they prefer doing or what they are doing now is services after the impact, rather than preventing it from occurring,"" he said.

Odjugo suggests that the silt be removed from the rivers to increase the volume of water they can hold. He also recommends that town planners enforce regulation on where buildings are constructed, saying this is a glaring weak spot across the country.

City regulators look out for buildings being constructed near waterways. Such buildings are often marked with an X, designating an order to stop construction work.

Stella Ojeme, the director for information in the Federal Capital Territory Administration, says that even in the nation's capital ofAbuja, enforcing building codes is a challenge.

""Most of our people will go, buy white paint, paint off the stop work mark,"" she said. ""First of all, you find people [building] where they shouldn't build. You find people build on flood plains. You find some people dump their refuse in the gutter.""

Odjugo says climate change is making a real impact in Nigeria, but the government has not made the issue a priority.

Additional challenges

Additionally, the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency says its weather data collection equipment is being vandalized and stolen.

Clement Eze, the agency's director general, spoke at a workshop last month, asking the public to help stop the illegal activity, as it is hindering the agency's ability to forecast extreme weather.

""We can no longer take readings, maybe accumulated or about a week or two,"" he said. ""Or if there are no resources, it can even take more than six months before we can go back and replenish or repair and this equipment is imported from outside Nigeria.""

During Nigeria's worst flooding in 2012, the Niger River reached a record high level of 12.84 meters. Two million Nigerians were forced from their homes and 363 people were killed, according to the National Emergency Management Agency.","Thu, 05 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-09/RTX6J5VG.jpg,"['floodravaged', 'flooding', 'month', 'stop', 'unprepared', 'buildings', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'nigerian', 'rains', 'communities', 'impact', 'services', 'rivers', 'weather']", ,flood

…Urges residents in coastal areas to relocate, predicts 261 days of rainfall

By Olasunkanmi Akoni

Lagos State Government, yesterday, predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with attendant flooding across the state, even as it directed residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas of the state to move upland to avert needless loss of lives and property.

Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, accompanied by Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, said this at a media briefing on the 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions, and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja.

Bello said: “The forecast for 2021 is based on the informed global consensus that el-Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, is at the cool phase, which will continue till around June and likely give to a dominant el-Nino phase till the end of 2021.

“Generally, the Seasonal Climate Prediction for Lagos State signifies that on-set dates ranged between March 17 in the earliest, and April 6, while the season-ending may range between November 20 and December 5, 2021.

READ ALSO:

“The connotation is that Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while the maximum annual rainfall amount is predicted to be 1,747mm.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Besides, he said the state government is collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NiMET, in downscaling the predictions to all stakeholders.

Also speaking, Mr. Igbokwe, stated that the government planned to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72kilometres spread across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state to checkmate flooding.

“I, therefore, urge residents to support the government to achieve a flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again been littered by residents,” Igbokwe said.

Meteorologist Luke Robinson said there could be significant rain in some areas around west central Montana.

“We are looking at some rain moving into the area starting mid week to the end of the week,” said Robinson. “This week we are looking at some pretty good soaking rains, particularly in southwest Montana and west central Montana. We will see the rivers and streams rising but right now we're not really anticipating any impacts from it.”

Robinson said the cold front will bring accompanying snow to the higher mountain areas.

“This system is moving in, it's going to be relatively cold, so we're actually looking at some accumulating snow in the mountains,” he said. “Those cooler temperatures will cut off all the hot mountain snow melt that we've had the past few days and most of the rise in the rivers and streams will be coming from mid to low level moisture coming into the area.”

Robinson said people who live in areas that usually flood in the spring may be nervous to see the river levels rising.

It could be more of just a nervous thing, right now,” he said. “We're looking at the cresting below flood stage, and that will be sometime Thursday or Friday. But right now we're not expecting any flooding at this at this point.”

By Joseph Erunke

THE Executive Director, Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE, Dr. Ganiyu Agbaje, Tuesday, said Nigeria has improved on its possession of requisite equipment’s to better forecast flood, thereby mitigating the effects.

To this end, he expressed optimism that the negative socioeconomic impacts of flooding in the country would henceforth be mitigated through effective and accurate forecast.

Agbaje, speaking at the opening ceremony of Online Regional Training on Flood Monitoring and Forecasting Modelling, in Abuja, insisted that with the latest technology in the country, it will henceforth be easier to predict flood and locate the people who are really affected, a development he noted, would make the country make informed decision to reduce the disaster associated with the flood.

But he tasked experts on accuracy in their forecast using satellite technology, saying such was necessary in order to monitor flood as well as identify its hotspot areas with a view to making a quick damage assessment.

He spoke as Nigeria joined other West African nations to adopt satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

He explained that the training was held to equip participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-hotspot areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse which is a major cause of flooding in Africa.

Hear him:“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction but more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower in Nigeria and other countries.”

According to him, the training was not to teach participants how to predict but to show them how to use additional satellite data to do their prediction better and support other methods.

He said that the technology has been on for a while around the world, adding that African leaders in collaboration with the EU initiated the training to help Africa better monitor the environment and mitigate disasters.

Agbaje said that with the data, rainfall, rivers and the environment will be better monitored, adding that in the case of Nigeria, more information on the activities of River Niger will be known using the technology.

“We need to support our rural communities on how best use flood when it occurs because at times if it coming far away from this country, you can harness the water overflowing for many other things in agriculture. In raining season, you can channel it for irrigation.

“We are feeling the economic impact of this disaster. We are looking at riverine flooding. You know our people settle along the rivers. And they have their livelihoods there; they are farmers and can’t come to towns,” he added.

The three-day training, which holds simultaneously in four other West African countries, was backed by the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) under its Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) initiative.

It was conducted by the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE.

Also speaking at the event, the GMES & Africa Programme Coordinator at the African Union Commission, Dr. Tidiane Ouattara, who joined via video conferencing, expressed joy that the activities of the CSSTE consortium was able to continue despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Emphasising the need for the constant training of young people and experts on the African continent, he described the training as a major achievement that would help Africa to build infrastructure and reduce the economic damage of flooding.

Participants at the workshop were drawn from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

In their separate goodwill messages, representatives of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said the training is aimed at building the capacity of stakeholders to better utilise satellite technology in providing accurate, timely and easily assessable information to improve the management of the environment.

FLOODS

Heavy rains have been recorded in West and Central Africa in the past weeks, including in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Senegal, leading to devastating floods that have killed dozens and displaced thousands of people. In Niger, 329,958 people had been affected by flooding with 65 deaths. About 31,960 houses have collapsed and 5,768 hectares of farmland destroyed. Maradi, Dosso, Tahoua and Niamey are the most affected regions. In 2019, at the same time, 35,384 people were affected across the country.

In northern Nigeria, thousands of homes and wide areas of crops have been destroyed in recent flooding in the states of Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi and Sokoto. More than 30 people reportedly have died. In Borno State, about 26,000 people, including IDPs, have been affected by heavy flooding across camps and communities. Borno and Adamawa states remain at risk of heavy flooding according to the Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) released by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) in June.

In Chad, some 188,915 people (37,783 households) were affected by flooding in the central and southern provinces, in the Lac and N’Djamena respectively. Large pieces of farmland are inundated with a potential impact on food security and livelihoods.

In Senegal, an emergency aid plan has been activated following exceptional rains in the capital Dakar and large part of the country that caused devastating floods on 5 September. At least four people were killed, the exact number of the people affected is yet to be determined.

Mali has also seen severe flooding that began in July. By early August, more than 13,200 people, including 5,400 internally displaced persons, were affected by floods in the country. The worst affected regions are Gao, Mopti, Ségou and Sikasso. A total of 1,160 homes have been destroyed.

In Cameroon, more than 30,000 people have been affected by floods caused by heavy rains in Far North, West, Coastal, South and South-West regions, destroying homes, washing away livestock and devastating plantations.

Heavy rainfall at the end of July caused rivers to overflow in the Far North, affecting over 5,000 people. More flooding was recently reported in the area, with over 1,500 families displaced around Maroua.

Flooding also affected the city of Douala and surrounding areas of Littoral region in the South-West after a torrential downpour on 21 August 2020.

In Ghana, roads, bridges, homes and farmland were inundated in the Northern and North East Regions due to heavy rainfall and releases from the Bagre Dam in neighbouring Burkina Faso, which began in mid-August 2020. At least eight people have lost their lives. The spillage was necessary due to a sharp increase in the water level. Several areas remain inaccessible, making assessments impossible.

In Burkina Faso, three people died in Kaya, Centre-Nord after heavy rainfall on 4 September. Earlier flooding affected the capital Ouagadougou, reportedly killing one person and damaging houses and property.

The expansion of the epidemic to the Bomongo health zone, bordering the Republic of Congo, is a serious concern. Rapid response actions are needed and point of Entry/Control (PoE/PoC) must be reinforced to mitigate the risk of the epidemic spreading to neighboring Republic of Congo. As of 6 September, there are 112 Ebola cases (106 confirmed cases and six probable cases), including 48 deaths and 50 recoveries.","Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1534863-West%20and%20Central%20Africa%20%E2%80%93%20Weekly%20Regional%20Humanitarian%20Snapshot%20%281%20%E2%80%93%207%20September%202020%29.png?itok=ad73obf8,"['congo', 'homes', 'west', 'democratic', 'republic', 'humanitarian', 'including', 'rains', 'rainfall', 'weekly', 'regional', 'snapshot', 'central', 'heavy', 'africa', 'regions', 'flooding', 'floods', 'affected']", ,flood

Early warning systems, contingency planning and local action can strengthen West Africa’s responses to increasingly frequent severe flooding, but more investment is needed in forecasting, panelists said in a recent webinar organized by the African Development Bank.

“We need to explore new and innovative approaches to better forecast and communicate floods and early warning information,” said Anthony Nyong, the Bank’s Director for Climate Change and Green Growth, in his opening remarks for the webinar Flood Forecasting and Early Warning in West Africa: Gaps, Innovation, and Lessons Learned.

In 2019 alone, extreme flooding caused the displacement of up to 5.1 million people in Africa, including 3.8 million from countries experiencing food insecurity. West Africa is a hotspot for extreme weather due to its long coastline, which is home to densely populated low-lying cities and economic hubs, from Lagos to Abidjan and Dakar.

This year, floods in eight West African countries affected over 750,000 people and claimed at least 100 lives. With rapid urbanization and increasing climate risks, the impact of floods in the region will likely accelerate over the next five decades.

The November 19 webinar, organized by the Bank’s Clim-Dev Africa Special Fund, brought together experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Senegal’s national meteorological agencies to provide an update on flood forecasting and early warning systems (EWS) in West Africa.

A representative for the Niger Basin Authority discussed regional collaboration on flood forecasting among its nine members. The event included a panel discussion with leading experts from the Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.

“We know that flood EWS is a crucial flood management tool, comprising key components of disaster risk knowledge, monitoring, and forecasting-as well as communication and response. Yet, little is being done to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and operationalize flood forecasts and early warning systems,” said James Kinyangi, Coordinator of the Clim-Dev Fund.

Ousmane N’diaye, Director of Senegal’s National Meteorological Agency, said that better preparedness through climate information and multi-disciplinary planning targeting vulnerable populations is crucial to saving lives and property. He emphasized the importance of early forecasting and the use of social media platforms to broadcast alerts and provide real-time weather information in local languages.

Michael Talhami of the Red Cross said acting early and anticipating risk would reduce human exposure to disaster. All too often, he said, local actors and humanitarian organizations have to work with weather and climate data that is dated, of poor quality, or non-existent. One example is the abandonment of hydrometeorological data collection in rural Mali, which has had detrimental consequences for emergency preparedness and response.

The Bank’s Institutional Support to African Climate Centers Project (ISACIP) has invested over $35 million to improve climate information services throughout Africa since 2010. As a follow-up to ISACIP, the Bank, through the Clim-Dev Fund, is investing over $27 million in regional and country operations to modernize Africa’s climate and weather infrastructure and provide high-quality and reliable data.","Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['green', 'improve', 'head', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'flood', 'growth', 'forecasting', 'west', 'early', 'warning', 'million', 'plan', 'preparedness', 'information', 'africa', 'weather']", ,flood

In 2020, flooding has affected 2.7 million people in 18 countries in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact has been particularly severe, and the number of people affected is more than double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, recent flooding have occurred in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This year 197,000 houses were reported destroyed in thirteen countries of the region. 422,000 hectares of farmland were affected by floods, which resulted in the destruction of crops and fields, threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions were already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities have led the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organizations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO has supported the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people and help communities to bounce back faster.","Thu, 24 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1549862-wca_2020_flooding_snapshot_20201218.png?itok=ipFhZmgq,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', '18', 'overview', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'floods', 'vulnerable', 'republic', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

The Lagos State Government said Sunday night that officials are mandated to arrest anyone caught dumping trash in drainage channels and canals, according to the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR).

For years, residents in the region of 16 million people have complained about garbage piled along highways and drainage canals.

""The situation is getting out of hand, passing the refuse dumps is an eyesore,"" resident Halimat Mogaji told The Guardian in December. ""Most times I try to avoid walking past the dumps because of the amount of refuse by the roadside.""

Residents told the news outlet that the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), which is responsible for collecting trash, often won't pick up waste from households that are behind on bills.

The situation led to poor sanitary conditions in the area, as canals fill with trash and standing water, the ICIR has reported.

74,74,FL-2019-000093-NGA,How a hackathon sparked resilience and innovation throughout one of the largest western African cities - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/75652,"Source(s): World Bank, the (WB)



By Robert Reid, Iguniwari Thomas Ekeu-Wei, and Zirra Banu

Ibadan is the third most populous city in Nigeria—Africa’s largest country in terms of population and economy. This city of six million also happens to be the country’s largest in terms of geographic area, but like many other cities, urbanization is largely uncontrolled, and people are exposed to disasters like floods.

We had the opportunity to experience Nigeria’s creativity and innovation in Lagos city, when the World Bank partnered with Co-Creation Hub and other players to organize a hackathon that focused on leveraging data and technology to improve accountability and service delivery in governance. People, including data and software engineers, professional and academic experts, and civil servants, came together to develop solutions for improved policy, governance and development impact.

The Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project (IUFMP) —set up to tackle the city’s urban resilience challenges—submitted datasets for the hackathon, and one of the teams that worked on the data from the project emerged as winner in February, 2020. Teams developed a geospatial visualization platform to overlay and view the datasets from the geodatabases created as part of the Ibadan city, and flood and drainage masterplans preparation, demonstrating how the government and other stakeholders can use insights from geospatial data to accelerate effective decision making in urban planning, flood risk and environmental management. With this open data, the state government can now use up-to-the-minute information to identify, manage, prevent, and prepare for flood risks, and other ensuing impacts from floods.

Building on this with support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and with the collaboration of technical initiatives from experts in Ibadan and around Oyo state, the project scaled up the use of data for flood risk management and developed an advanced geospatial visualization platform that empowers the government to seamlessly apply geospatial data in daily operations.

This innovation strengthens the capacity of the Oyo state government to manage flood risk and inform decision making in other sectors in Ibadan using data, coupled with previous capacity building efforts, gigabytes of geospatial data available and GIS innovation laboratories have been setup under the project. The labs established at the department of Urban Renewal Enforcement Monitoring and Compliance and Office of the Surveyor General under the Oyo State Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. The Project Implementation Unit has been equipped with computers, servers, printers, plotters and software needed to apply these datasets in decision making. These datasets, which are publicly available via an advanced geospatial visualization platform, now strategically inform technical decision making and engagements. This enhances urban resilience and disaster risk management, aligning strongly with the Oyo State Government’s E-governance Program and leveraging internet connectivity infrastructure provided by the government in locations where the labs are present to facilitate data exchange.

From the people to policy—students sparking innovation

In August, the University of Ibadan and the project signed a formal memorandum of understanding, to foster capacity development, knowledge exchange and promote long-term project sustainability through collaborative research, data information exchange, internship programs for students, short courses and training programs for government staff and other professionals, and all-round collaborations that bridge the academic-policy-industry gap through open data and innovation.

With the rising thirst for innovative responses to managing flood risks in Ibadan, the University of Ibadan, in collaboration with the project, GIS Konsult Limited and other partners hosted the second season of the Ibadan Geo-Hackathon completed in November with the theme, “Ibadan Urban Resilience,” leveraging the advanced geospatial visualization platform and geodatabases to deliver solutions focusing on three thematic areas: risk-informed decision making, urban resilient design, and innovative technology solutions for urban resilience. The winning submissions for the respective categories include: Smart Citi, a web-based application for automated flood-risk assessment and waste management,, and Flood Health Risk Mapper an industrial research innovation, and Fire Incidents - A Reoccurring Menace, a story on disaster resilience. The city of Ibadan has now developed two comprehensive masterplans: A Flood Risk Management and Drainage Masterplan and a City Masterplan. Both documents create a vision for resilient and sustainable urban development in the face of climate change, identifying opportunities to boost inclusive economic development, and identify and prioritize the structures most at risk of failing (bridges, culverts, drainages, dam, etc.) to strengthen the government's capacity to detect and respond more effectively to floods, and build resilience long-term. The amount of data, maps and information generated by these master plans is vast. They include spatial datasets, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) topography, high resolution aerial imagery, and outputs of urban analytics, hydrological and hydraulic modelling. By making this information accessible to the public, it becomes useful for many stakeholders, and will inform individuals, private sector, and government decision making to better manage risks and improve urban development.

Open data for innovation and entrepreneurship in development

Entrepreneurship is on the rise—and so is innovation and collaboration for the benefit of all. With data open and publicly accessible, businesses, academia and university students alike can utilize information for research and development. This innovation helps civil servants in their work as they tactically tackle disaster and urban development challenges. In turn, the increased resilience helps everyone from kindergarteners to tailors, and keeps the city’s six million people protected from preventable disaster risks. That’s the impact of open data, open governance, and effective resilience building—all together, they spark cooperation, preparedness and innovation for the benefit of everyone.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['data', 'geospatial', 'sparked', 'urban', 'ibadan', 'hackathon', 'flood', 'innovation', 'making', 'risk', 'resilience', 'cities', 'project', 'largest', 'western', 'african']", ,flood

The floods are also the worst in the state since 1988, residents and state officials told PREMIUM TIMES, amidst fears the floods could worsen Nigeria’s current food insufficiency that has led to an increase in prices of basic food like rice.

The Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) said the deaths occurred in about 19 local government areas of the state

Hadejia Emirate, with eight council areas, is the worst hit, the executive secretary of SEMA, Sani Yusuf, told PREMIUM TIMES.

Mr Yusuf said the deaths were recorded since the commencement of the current rainy season.

“These are the number of deaths so far reported to the agency since the beginning of this rainy season,” he said.

He explained that the agency, with federal government support, is doing the needful to cushion the effects of the disaster by providing emergency needs to the victims of the flood.

He added that the agency has so far distributed 30 canoes to communities affected by the flood, as well as materials to the affected communities to build embankments in order to control the water.

Worst Flood in over 30 years

Hamza Muhammad, special assistant to Governor Muhammad Badaru on community development and social inclusion, said this year’s flood is the worst since 1988 with Hadejia emirate as the worst affected area.

He listed the affected local governments as Buji, Hadejia, Ringim, Taura, Jahun, Miga, Malammadori, Auyo, Kafinhausa and Guri.

Others include Gwaram, Kiyawa, Kaugama, Birninkudu, kirikasamma, Garki and Babura.

Cause of flood

Mr Muhammad attributed the cause of the flood to an overflow of Tiga and Challawa dams in Kano State as well as effects of climate change.

He also said torrential rainfall, as earlier forecast by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, contributed to the disaster.

In an earlier report done by this newspaper, Isa Mustapha, the executive director, Exceptional Leadership and Integrity Promotion, listed the major causes of the flood as insufficient drainage channels, silted dams, weeds, trypa grass overgrowing on river channels and river beds, as well as illegal diversion and encroachment of waterways.

Other causes, according to Mr Mustapha, include lackadaisical attitude towards the desiltation of the Hadeija-Yobe Kwamadugu River basin, as well as poor coordination among stakeholders on the control of the menace of flood.

Government’s intervention

Mr Muhammad said the state government has been doing its best since January 2020 to prevent the flood including directing officials to conduct a survey in flood-prone areas of the state.

He said the government had also deployed water pumping machines to the affected communities to evacuate the flooded water.

“Where we cannot use the machines to evacuate the water, we organized self help groups in such communities and empower them with tools for embarkment,” he said.

Affected communities deny government’s intervention

Contrary to Mr Muhammad’s claims, residents of the affected communities said the government is not doing enough.

They accused the government of not providing any remedial measures to help mitigate the impact of the flood.

Mr Mustapha and some officials of SEMA, while on an assessment visit to some of the flooded areas on Monday, were mobbed by angry residents who decried the government’s negligence of the areas.

One of the vehicles conveying the officials got damaged while journalists trying to take footage of the flooded areas were also chased away by the angry residents.

Impact of Flooding on Food Production

Officials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, are already lamenting the impact of the flood on food production in Jigawa, and Nigeria, especially rice production.

Jigawa is one of the states that has benefitted most from the federal government’s Anchors Borrowers Programme to assist farmers boost rice production in the country.

Mr Muhammad, the governor’s aide, expressed the fear that the state may experience food shortage, saying that “Sixty-five per cent of Fadama farmland were washed away by the flood especially in Hadejia where much anticipated rice is expected.”

He added that grains like millet, maize and sorghum were also lost to the flood.

Officials could not give the exact number of farmlands and houses that were destroyed by the flood but said the damage is unprecedented while assessment is ongoing.

In his reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari described this year’s flood in Jigawa as ”unprecedented and devastating.”

In a statement by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, Mr Buhari, on Tuesday, sympathised with the victims of the flood while assuring them of federal government’s intervention.

He described the flood, which has reportedly destroyed over 100,000 hectares of rice farms in the state, as a setback to agriculture especially rice production which his administration has actively promoted and discouraged its importation.

The price of rice has also doubled in the past few months across Nigeria due to various reasons including the floods affecting rice-producing states like Jigawa and Kebbi.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/09/Jigawa-flood.jpg?fit=718%2C405&ssl=1,"['experiences', 'affected', 'destroyed', 'flood', 'governments', 'food', 'farms', 'dead', 'muhammad', 'communities', 'worst', 'jigawa', '40', 'officials', 'state', 'maize', 'rice']", ,flood

The training, organised by the Centre for Space Science & Technology Education (CSSTE) was part of the Multi-Scale Flood Monitoring and Assessment Services for West Africa (MiFMASS) project under the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) Support Programme which seeks to help Nigeria and other West African nations to adopt a new system of utilising satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

Participants were mainly technical operational staff from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

The training, which holds simultaneously across four other West African countries, aimed at equiping participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-prone areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model, as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

According to the Lead of the CSSTE Consortium, Dr Ganiyu Agbaje, the training was in alignment with one of the major pillars of the GMES & Africa support programme, which was capacity building, and this had led the CSSTE consortium to identify strategic training needs of its collaborating stakeholders on the MIFMASS project with the aim to train and empower them to sustain the product and service outcomes after the lifetime of the programme.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, a major cause of flooding in Africa.

“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here,’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of the Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction and more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower,” he said.

Dr. Agbaje, who also doubles as the Executive Director of the African Regional Centre for Space Science & Technology Education – English (ARCSSTE-E) in Ile-Ife, added that GMES & Africa is a joint initiative of the African Union and the European Union to harness the benefits of earth observation (satellite) data for inherent environmental challenges in Africa and their own MiFMASS project is one of the many ongoing research and development projects under the programme.

He pledged that two more training courses will be held as the consortium prepares for the conclusion of the project and the handover of its products and services to relevant agencies.

As well as the risk of further deaths and injuries, and damage to livelihoods and infrastructure, the Nigerian Red Cross is warning of a steep rise in the number of diarrhoea cases in Kogi, Niger, Anambra and Delta.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has launched an emergency appeal on behalf of the Nigerian Red Cross, seeking 5,425,000 Swiss francs to support 300,000 of the most vulnerable people for nine months. The operation will provide shelter and the distribution of relief items; livelihoods including cash transfers; health; water, sanitation and hygiene, and protection, gender and inclusion.","Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180817_085506021_iOS_edited.jpg,"['14', 'livelihoods', 'floods', 'states', 'cross', 'disaster', 'million', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'risk', 'niger', 'affected', 'kogi', 'red', 'emergency']", ,flood
80,80,FL-2019-000093-NGA,28 states at risk of flood - Agency - Premium Times,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/395058-28-states-at-risk-of-flood-agency.html,"No fewer than 102 local government areas in 28 states are at risk of flooding, according to the 2020 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO), released by the Nigeria Hydrological Survey Agency (NIHSA) on Thursday.

The states include the states of Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, Bayelsa, Sokoto, Kogi, Niger, Kaduna, Gombe, Adamawa, Benue, FCT, Nasarawa, Delta, Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Edo, Abia, Anambra, Imo, Borno, Kano and Kebbi.

At the Official Presentation of the outlook in Abuja, the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, noted that the outlook was a fallout from the devastating effect of the 2012 flood in the country.

He said the purpose of the outlook was to present probable flood scenarios for this year and to disseminate information to all, especially in flood-prone areas and further reduce resultant effects.

He said flood is one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria with devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on flood plains for livelihoods.

He said although the flood outlook had shown that 2020 floods might not be as severe as previous years, it was important for all stakeholders to carry out an aggressive awareness campaign for preparedness.

“It is pertinent to note that the impending flooding season with COVID-19 presents a fight against two threats; on one hand, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and on the other hand, the likelihood of an active 2020 flood season.

“The 2020 flood projections will as expected vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country.

“Overall, the flood level may not be as severe as previous years, but it is a certainty that our rivers will exceed flood level and many will be inundated again this year.”

The minister said as always, flooding was associated with increased risk of infections when the displaced persons were high and polluted water sources, added that it was important for all stakeholders to prepare earnestly.

He added that part of the intervention to promote hygiene was the recently signed Executive Order 009 by the President Muhammadu Buhari aimed at ending Open Defecation by 2025.

“Many state governors have bought into this idea, the ministry declared emergency in the water and sanitation sector to encourage hand washing and put in place the National WASH Response Committee for COVID -19,” he said.

The minister also commended the efforts of NIHSA in the development of a new Flood Mobile App, saying that it would add practical value to water managers and for overall disaster risks management.

The NIHSA’s Director-General, Clement Nze, said the 2020 AFO would go beyond borders and defer all barriers to reach the needy in providing information on early flood warnings required for mitigating risks in the country.

Mr Nze noted that the need to carry out aggressive sensitisation and awareness campaigns on consistent clearing of all waterways and maintenance of dams and reservoirs to ensure free flow of water in drainages.

The D-G said the Flood Mobile App would also be used to give actual daily flood situations to everyone, especially those at the rural areas through the use of SMS services.

The new Flood Mobile App is designed to be of practical value to the Water Managers, Technical Experts, Disaster Risk Managers, Policy Makers and Flood Forecasting Community for flood prevention and for enhancing flood early warning systems in Nigeria.

As of 10 October, flooding has affected around 2.1 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is almost double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains are gradually subsiding in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Ghana, Benin and the DRC and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539455-WCA%202020%20Flooding%20Snapshot_20201013.png?itok=qKkz1Zc_,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'rains', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

83,83,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Lagos flood alert: Heeding the augurs - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/lagos-flood-alert-heeding-the-augurs/,"By Kayode Ojewale

SIR: Flooding does not just suddenly happen; it is usually preceded by some occurrences hinting its imminent arrival. When the flow of rain water on its way to the drainage channels or river is impeded, then flooding occurs. Flooding is having too much water in the wrong place. The cause of flooding is mainly man-made because of our unclean environmental habits. With just few days of rains, some parts of Lagos are flooded. How will residents of these areas, especially flood-prone areas fare when the peak of rainy season which usually comes with attendant flooding eventually arrives? The omens of flooding are here with us coupled with the warnings issued by appropriate authorities; are we heeding the augurs?

What’s the end gain if the rains, meant to bless us and water our plants, turn out to damage our crops, properties and even destroy lives due to our actions and inactions? Does it appear many have forgotten the losses, pains and agony that accompanied the ravaging heavy rains which caused disasters in different parts of the country in 2012, the year of flood fury?

Of recent, it is observed that sometimes the rains no longer pre-inform or send any signal before its arrival through warnings like cloudy sky, windy atmosphere and dark clouds. Rather, it will just begin to rain suddenly without any pre-notification and it will pour heavily. That’s another indication that the rains this year would be in a different dimension.

On April 14, the Lagos State government predicted high intensity high of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello.

“…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm”.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding”, he further added.

As a way of checkmating the looming flood, the state government plans to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72 kilometers spread across all the Local Government Areas of the State.

Flood alerts and warnings are usually issued to sensitize residents and the authorities on the need to prepare. Ignoring these warnings or not heeding the flood alerts may come with deadly consequences. In order to be prepared for the predicted floods, agencies in charge of disaster management and emergencies should be ready to ensure safety of lives during the peak of the rainy season.

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lagos-flood.jpg,"['residents', 'rainy', 'warnings', 'water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'days', 'heeding', 'flow', 'lagos', 'alert', 'rains', 'state', 'areas', 'augurs']", ,flood

A total of 108 deaths and 192 injuries have been reported as of late August. Rainfall is expected to continue for the next week. Rivers and Bayelsa states are estimated to be amongst the worst affected states where water levels continue to rise. Initial assessments indicate that 13,031 homes were damaged or destroyed across all affected states as of late August. Shelter, food, NFIs and medical assistance continue to be key needs for the affected population

Crisis impact

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, widespread flooding due to ongoing rainfall has affected 441,250 people and displaced 141,400 people in Adamawa, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Delta, Edo, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Niger, Rivers, and Taraba states since late August (NEMA 24/09/2018; ERCC; 24/09/2018).

As of 24 September, flooding across 12 states and 50 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in central and southern Nigeria has caused 108 deaths and 192 injuries (NEMA 24/09/2018). Across all affected states, there is an urgent need for shelter, with around 13,000 houses damaged (NEMA 24/09/2018). The affected population has lost household and personal belongings. The floods have caused considerable damage to agricultural land across Nigeria, with 122,653 hectares of agricultural land destroyed. In addition to shelter, there is an urgent need for food, NFIs and medicine (NEMA 24/09/2018). The flooding is widespread and situation is rapidly evolving. As assessments are ongoing, the number of the affected people is expected to further increase.

Initial assessments indicate that Rivers and Bayelsa are amongst the most affected states. Water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa. As of 24 September, water levels in lower Benue state have subsided to 10m, compared to 11m on 21 September.

The Niger River at Lokoja city, Kogi state, has not receded, as it recorded water levels of 11.05m on 24 September (NEMA 24/09/2018). Light to moderate rainfall is expected to continue until early October.

Shelter: Flooding has displaced around 141,400 people across the 12 affected states, of which 80,600 people are estimated to be living with friends and family (NEMA 24/09/2018). Over 13,000 houses have been partially or totally damaged. IDPs have relocated to emergency shelters, such as LGA offices, schools, stadiums and churches.

Some of the affected population is staying in IDP camps that have been recently constructed by the Presidential Committee on Flood Relief and Rehabilitation (NEMA 21/09/2018). As assessments are ongoing, and water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa states, the amount of houses damaged, which are typically built with mud and thatch roods, is likely to increase (IFCR 23/09/2018). The affected population are in urgent need of shelter support and NFIs, such as blankets, mats, hygiene kits and kitchen sets (IFCR 23/09/2018).

Livelihood: New estimates indicate that 122,653 hectares of agricultural land have been flooded across central and southern Nigeria. Crops were destroyed before the harvesting season begins in October (NYTimes 17/08/2018). This makes the affected population more vulnerable to food insecurity, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of farmers. Flooding is also likely to affect other livelihoods, such as fishers and petty traders.

Food: There continues to be an urgent need for food assistance for IDPs across all affected states. Severe flood damage to agricultural crops means there is a risk that some communities will experience increased food insecurity throughout the harvest season. (Daily Trust 20/09/2018). There are still no reports on whether markets that have been flooded and closed. Transportation of food is likely to be severely restricted because main roads have been flooded.

Health: Since the publication of the briefing note on 21 September, 192 injuries have been reported since late August. Flood affected victims are likely to be in urgent medical care, as result of injuries and the risk of outbreaks made worse due to the extensive flooding. Health care support is particularly needed in IDP camps (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The risk that diarrhoea and cholera will spread remains high, as water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa, and have mostly not subsided in other communities.

Particularly in more populated areas, and overcrowded IDP camps where WASH facilities are inadequate, there continues to be a high concern for cholera to spread further. There have been reports of an increase in diarrhoea cases in four of the flood affected states (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of geographical information and data indicating which states are affected by the spike in diarrhoea cases. 27,927 cases of suspected cholera were reported between 1 January and 10 September countrywide (NCDC 10/09/2018). Between 1 January and 10 September, suspected cholera cases were reported in the flood affected states of Adamawa (2,002), Anambra (23), Bayelsa (no data), Benue (no data), Delta (no data), Edo (no data), Kebbi (198), Kogi (102), Kwara (no data), Niger (547), Rivers (no data), and Taraba (no data). (NCDC 10/09/2018). In Adamawa, an increase of 119 suspected cholera cases was observed between 17-23 September, most likely due to flooding facilitating the spread (Adamawa State Ministry of Health 23/09/2018)

As flooding has not receded, the escalation of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and-or West Nile fever remains a concern (WHO 2018). The Government recently confirmed that the malaria cases have increased due to the floods (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The current malaria incidence in Nigeria is 380.8/1,000 (2015) (PMI 2017). A distribution of mosquito nets for the flood affected population has been identified as a key priority (NEMA 24-09-2018 NaijaNews 18/09/2018).

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, there have been additional reports in local media sources that indicate antenatal care for pregnant women remains a key concern. This was reported in Uzanu community, Estako East LGA, Edo state and in Ogbaru, Amambra.

There is a need for psychosocial support, as flood victims have lost or been separated from their loved ones (IFCR 23/09/2018).

WASH: The displaced population is still staying in emergency shelters, such LGA offices, stadiums, schools and churches, which have inadequate sanitation facilities and are in urgent need of safe water. In most of the affected states, water sources have been contaminated by flooding (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of data on the potential amount of damaged water points.

Education: Schools continue to be used as evacuation centres across all affected states. On 18 September, primary and secondary schools were closed in Ogbaru, Southern Anambra state as a safety measure, following floods that displaced more than 1,1000 people (OCHA 24/09/2018). Considering the ongoing flooding, it is likely that many schools have been damaged by flooding (Premium Times 19/09/2018).

Protection: While there is no disaggregated data available on the amount of women and girls affected by the floods, it is likely that this group is disproportionately affected.

Women and girls that are displaced and staying in IDP camps continue to be at increased risk to gender-based violence. Overcrowding at IDP camps, with a lack of privacy and inadequate toilets and washing facilities, increases the risks and vulnerability of women and girls to gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (UNHCR 12/2017; OCHA 2016).

Impact on critical infrastructure

Since the start of the rainy season, in June, main roads have been flooded and bridges collapsed (Vanguard 15/09/2018). As water levels have not subsided and heavy rainfall is expected to continue until the beginning of October, main roads continue to be flooded across all affected states.

Power and telecommunications are affected in some of the flood-affected states. The Okpai Gas Independent Power Plant in Ndokwa East Council, Delta State, with power supply to Aso Villa, Abuja has been flooded (TheGuardian 25/09/2018). Communities in Kdokwa West and Ukwuani councils are also affected by the power cut.

Some LGA offices in affected are also likely to be impacted, as they are being used as emergency shelters for the flood affected population.","Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1171619-20180925_acaps_briefing_note_nigeria_floods_update_i_0.png?itok=EOQvdbLy,"['2018', 'data', 'likely', 'water', '26', 'flooding', 'continue', 'nema', 'flood', 'floods', 'states', 'levels', 'note', 'nigeria', 'briefing', 'affected', 'acaps']", ,flood
85,85,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Nigeria: Food Security Threatened As Floods Destroy Farms - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202009030184.html,"Fear of food crisis is heightening in Nigeria following massive floods that are ravaging crop farms in many parts of the country.

Many farmlands were reportedly destroyed by floods in Kebbi, Zamfara, Niger, Rivers, C/Rivers, Sokoto, Bauchi and some parts of Kwara State.

Rice and maize farmlands were most affected and farmers fear this could further hike the prices of the staple food in the country.

A Daily Trust market survey showed that prices of food items are already going up in the market.

In Kano, a 100kg of maize now costs N20,000, N22,000 in Benue, N24, 000 in Abuja and as high as N25,000 in Lagos State.

The same size of maize sold between N9, 000 and N11, 000 last year across the country.

Also, 100kg of local rice now costs N55,000 in Kano, N58,000 in Abuja, while prices of beans range from N22,000 to N24, 000 per 100kg depending on the market and state.

- The warnings -

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had warned that the current water level in the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin portends some level of concern for Nigeria as there could be a likelihood of river flooding in the states contiguous to River Niger.

The states, according to the Agency, are Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The Director-General of the agency, Engr. Clement Onyeaso Nze said the country through Kebbi State might be flooded beginning from September 6

Reports from Kebbi had shown that several hectares of rice farms were washed away by flood and similar incidence was also reported in some parts of Zamfara, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kwara, Cross Rivers, Rivers and Niger states.

The incident is already a source of concern for stakeholders in the food sector as they are expressing fears that if the ugly trend continues, there might be food crisis in the country.

In Kebbi State, over 500,000 hectares of farmlands were reported to have been destroyed by flood.

The Chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, Sani Dododo, who announced the incident said rice farms accounted for about 450,000 of the hectares while the remaining 50,000 were for other crops.

- Farmers narrate ordeal -

It was reported that farmers in Kebbi State lost over N5 billon to the flood.

A victim and female rice farmer in the state, Lubabatu Bunza, said she lost about 16,000 hectares to the recent flood in the state.

Also, Mallam Isa Ahman, another victim from Patigi LGA of Kwara State, said early last month, flood washed away about six hectares of his rice farm and four hectares of his maize farm.

The farmer said he obtained a loan from a commercial bank and invested on the farm, saying it would be difficult to repay the loan.

Many of the affected farmers in Kebbi and Niger states said they got their inputs from the Anchor Borrowers' Programme of the federal government and wondered how they would be able to repay the loans.

President of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Ibrahim Kabiru, said even though it would be difficult to ascertain the damages done to the farms by the flood across the country, the trend portents a great danger ahead.

He said the flood-affected rice, maize, sorghum and other crops in the affected states.

According to him, the situation was being worsened by the insecurity in the rural areas where the farms are located.

The farmers' leader had earlier warned that bandits were preventing farmers from accessing their farms, which he said was a dangerous pointer to food security.

Mr. Mathew Ajayi, a food security expert told Daily Trust on phone yesterday that already the country was nearing food crisis as this could be seen in the skyrocketing prices of food items across the country.

""It is obvious that we are approaching a serious food crisis considering the rising prices of food items across the country.

""And now look at the flood ravaging the farms' couple with the bandits chasing away farmers from their farms,"" he said.

Alhaji Muktar Umar, a farmer and local rice miller in Sabo-Wuse, Niger State, told Daily Trust on phone Wednesday that the country might experience serious rice crisis this year because of the flood incidence and security challenges threatening the farmers.

""From my experience as a farmer, I know many people go into rice farming this year but the farms are being washed away by the flood.

""Many farmers can no longer go to their farms now, most especially here in Niger State,"" he said.

- Buhari orders release of food items from reserves -

President Muhammadu Buhari said Wednesday that the flood disaster in Kebbi State had exposed the country to a major setback in the efforts to boost local food production.

Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed concerns over the heavy floods that took a number of lives, submerged thousands of hectares of farmlands and houses, destroying farm produce and personal belongings in the affected communities.

The president said: ""I am particularly sad over this incident because it is a setback to our efforts to boost local rice production as part of measures to stop food importation.

""Kebbi State is the focal point of our policy to produce rice locally as part of this administration's commitment to agricultural revival, which suffered relative neglect in favour of food importation.

""With the loss of six lives and still counting; thousands of hectares of land flooded and estimated economic losses of more than one billion naira by rice farmers in Kebbi State, we face a major setback in our efforts to boost local food production.

""This bad news couldn't have come at a worse time for our farmers and other Nigerians who looked forward to a bumper harvest this year in order to reduce the current astronomical rise in the costs of food items in the markets.""

The president, while sympathising with the bereaved families and farmers affected by the devastating floods, assured that ""we are going to work closely with the Kebbi State government in order to bring relief to the victims.""

In another statement yesterday by Shehu, Buhari expressed the concern of his administration about the sudden spiral of food prices at a time when the economy was already mired in a slowdown occasioned by the global coronavirus situation.

Buhari, however, assured Nigerians that the situation was transient.

He said his administration had already begun looking and putting in place measures to ameliorate the situation.

""While Providence has been kind to us with the rains and as such an expectation that a bumper harvest would lead to crashing of food prices and ease the burdens on the population, the government's concern is that the exploitative market behaviour by actors has significantly increased among traders in the past few years and may make any such relief a short-lived one.

""This year has indeed tested us in ways that globalisation has never been tested since the turn of the century.

""These challenges have disrupted lives and supply chains all over the world and Nigeria has not been spared.

""The effect has been deeply felt in the delays encountered in the procurement of raw materials for local production of fertilizer (damaging standing crops before harvest) and the speculative activities by a number of rice processors who are ready to pay for paddy at any price to keep their mills running non-stop.

""But of all these problems, the most worrisome is the activities of ""corrupt"" middlemen (with many of them discovered to be foreigners) and other food traders who serve as the link between farmers and consumers found to be systematically creating an artificial scarcity so that they can sell at higher prices.

""In dealing with these problems, the administration has, in line with its ease of doing business mantra, avoided imposing stockholding restrictions in order not to discourage investments in modern warehousing and cold storage.

""The president has just approved the release of food items from the strategic reserves, including 30,000 tons of maize to animal feeds producers to ease the high cost of poultry production.

""President Buhari's administration has raised some of these issues with the various food producer associations involved, particularly those of rice and other grains.

""With their cooperation, the high food prices should soon be a thing of the past.

""In addition, investments in the agro-allied sector by the private sector will significantly increase domestic production of farming inputs especially fertilizer, further crash prices, create employment and ease the pressure on our foreign reserves.

""One of these major investments is the Dangote Fertilizer plant, which is projected to come on stream by the 4th quarter of 2020,"" the president said.

- Experts suggest ways out -

The National President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Arc. Ibrahim Kabiru noted that to mitigate the effect of these calamities on the food system or food security, farmers should be encouraged to embark on full-scale dry season farming, which could lead to all-year-round farming

He advised that government should expand the nation's irrigable lands by investing more in water resources.

He also advised farmers to quickly plant alternative crops that require little time to mature in order to mitigate the crisis.

He said government at all levels could support such farmers with seeds and other inputs.

""Whereupon the time left for the rainy season cannot be sufficient for any crop, some form of compensation commensurate to the ascertained loss could be given to the affected farmers,"" he advised.

The farmer's leader urged his members to insure their farms, adding that the association is already working with National Agricultural Insurance Company (NAIC) to that all farmers insure their farms.

The women leader of the Kebbi State Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Lubabatu Usman Kamba suggested that the way out for some of the challenges was for the farmers to be provided with good knowledge of forecasting the planting season.

She said flooding has been the farmers' biggest nightmare, adding that they could only be addressed with good forecasting knowledge on when and where to plant the crops, which she said was currently lacking because of the near absence of extension service workers.","Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn05.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00540445:bd25877f5988946c2e238d58cdc5cf6e:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'niger', 'food', 'kebbi', 'security', 'floods', 'farms', 'prices', 'threatened', 'nigeria', 'destroy', 'rice', 'hectares', 'state']", ,flood
86,86,FL-2019-000093-NGA,"April 2021: Ninth-warmest April on record, NOAA and NASA report - Yale Climate Connections",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/05/april-2021-ninth-warmest-april-on-record-noaa-and-nasa-report/,"April 2021 was the ninth-warmest April since global record-keeping began in 1880, 0.79 degrees Celsius (1.42°F) above the 20th-century average, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, NCEI, reported May 13. NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europe’s coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Figure 1. Departure of temperature from average for April 2021, the ninth-warmest April for the globe since record keeping began in 1880. Record-warm April temperatures were limited to parts of southern South America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, as well as small parts of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. No portion of the globe was record-cold. (Image credit: NOAA/NCEI)

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

Francis Ighorurhie, aged 38, reportedly drowned on Thursday night at Kaiama Community in Kolokuma-Opokuma Council of Bayelsa State. Two Primary school pupils also drowned along Goodnews street in Azikoro Town in Yenagoa Council of the state.

It was gathered on Friday that Fr. Francis Ighorurhie, a Missionary of St. Paul (MSP) from Delta State, was until his death the Parish Priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church, Kaiama.

A priest, who spoke anonymously, said, “this is a sad moment for us. Father was on his way back from Bomadi in Delta State when he met his untimely death. But for the flood, he could have driven his car straight to his residence instead of parking same by the road.”

“It was as he was walking on the wooden bridge part of which had been submerged that he slipped and got drowned. Those staying at his residence had to raise alarm when they saw his car by the roadside and he was nowhere to be found.

“They however became suspicious when they saw a bag containing some provision floating on the water not far from the bridge. Divers were contracted and his remains were recovered.”

He added that his remains had been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa.

Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State government, yesterday, in a statement, sympathised with residents of the state over the impact of the rising flood, assuring that efforts are underway to mitigate its devastating effects on the people.

The state government, during its Eight Executive Council Meeting, presided over by the Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stressed that government is aware of the difficulties being experienced as a result of the flood, which has become a perennial problem due to climate change.

Speaking on behalf of the Governor, Ewhrudjakpo appealed to Bayelsans to exercise patience with the state government over the inconveniences being experienced as a result of the ongoing expansion of the Etegwe roundabout.","Sun, 18 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekiti-flood.jpg,"['saw', 'bayelsa', 'flood', 'residence', 'st', 'catholic', 'drowned', 'drown', 'remains', 'pupils', 'council', 'state', 'priest', 'result']", ,flood

90,90,FL-2019-000093-NGA,An Inland Delta Flooded - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147692/an-inland-delta-flooded,"Drought is a perennial problem in the semi-arid Sahel region of Africa. But in 2020, in Mali and other countries in West Africa, excessive rainfall has been the problem at times. Exceptionally heavy summer rains pushed seasonal floods on the Niger River and its inland delta to destructive levels.

After intense rains fell in July and August in the Guinea Highlands and overloaded many streams and rivers, it took several weeks for flood waters to work their way through the vast inland delta in central Mali. When the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured a natural-color image on October 29, 2020, water had spread widely across the nearly flat delta, which was once a lake bottom. Standing water appears black. Many flooded areas appear green because bourgou grass, rice, and other plants grow in the shallow flood waters. For comparison, the other image shows the dry landscape in May 2020, before the rains.

In late October, floodwaters reached their peak height at Mopti, a town at the confluence of the Niger and Bani Rivers. Water levels in the delta were recorded at 670 centimeters (22 feet) on October 26 and remained at that level until November 2, according to Mali’s National Directorate of Water Resources. That tied the peak water levels from 2018, the highest since 1969.

After November 2, waters receded at Mopti even as they continued to rise at points downstream such as Akka and Diré. It typically takes water a full six months from falling in the Guinea Highlands to reach the ocean at the Niger Delta in Nigeria. People watch the timing of flooding closely because it affects when rice can be grown, when fish will be available to catch, and when pastures can be ready for grazing. Water levels were expected to be low enough in mid-December 2020 for the annual cattle crossing on the Niger River at Diafarabé. In the much anticipated event, nomadic herders drive cattle across the river toward rich grazing lands in the inland delta and are reunited with their families after months apart.

While seasonal floods are common in Mali, the severity of the floods this year caused widespread damage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 1,160 homes were destroyed by flooding.

91,91,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Reps to expand fire service operations - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/reps-to-expand-fire-service-operations/,"The House of Representatives is considering an expansion of the scope of operations of the fire service to include accidents and emergency situations in the transport sector and at construction sites in the real estate sector.



When the bill becomes law, officers of the fire service who show gallantry will be specially rewarded.



This proposal is contained in the legislation titled ‘A Bill for an Act to Repeal the Fire Service Act, Cap. F29, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and Enact the Fire and Emergency Service Bill to Provide for Additional Powers for Effective Service Delivery; and for Related Matters.’



The bill passed second reading at the plenary on Tuesday.



Sponsor of the bill, Mr Adejoro Adeogun, while leading the debate for the second reading, said the proposal was to provide for additional powers and expansion of responsibilities of the fire service



He said, “The major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed, would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency. It would also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through engagement of able bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.



“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources.”



Adeogun noted that the Fire Service Act (1963) saddled the Fire Service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies.



“This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and such other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required,” he said.



The lawmaker added, “This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.



“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”



The lawmaker listed the specific goals of the bill, saying it is to “prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters.”



He added that it would “encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by states, local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies.



“Establish the Office of the Fire and Emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the fire and emergency service.



“Empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilise resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies.



“Provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officers.”","Wed, 19 May 2021 08:43:56 GMT",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/19155231/Reps.fw_.png,"['flooding', 'service', 'construction', 'collapse', 'accidents', 'operations', 'scope', 'related', 'bill', 'reps', 'disasters', 'expand', 'emergency']", ,none

This is as the government has warned against heavy rainfall, flooding and possible flood disasters.

While making the disclosure through a signed statement, the Honorable Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said 23 million cubic meters of water will be released in October, which is the peak of the rainfall season.

READ:

Bello explained that the release of more water from the Oyan Dam, which will be the highest so far, is due to intensive rainfall over the past few days, expected to peak in the current month.

He, therefore, enjoined all residents of Agboyi-Ketu, Owode Onirin, Isheri, Ajegunle, Agiliti, Kara, Majidun and all areas bordering the rivers and the sea in Lagos to be wary of the staggered Oyan Dam release, adding that by November, a reduced release of 11million cubic meters will be affected as the intensity of the rainfall declines.

Bello pointed out that data provided by the Nigerian Hydrological Services noted that the months of July, August, September and October would be characterized by heavy rainfall, flooding and flood disasters in most parts of the country.

READ:

Reiterating that the reminder became necessary because the projected heavy rainfall, which had increased in September, would continue with high intensity this month leading to the staggered release of water from the dam, the Commissioner disclosed that Lagos is, however, intensifying measures to minimize the effect of the heavy rainfall on lives and property.

He averred that, in continuation of the preventive efforts against flooding by the State Government, work is almost completed on all the primary and secondary channels, stating that this is in addition to the efforts of the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) that are being deployed around the State to undertake quick fixes of clogged manholes or drains manually.

Bello said, “For a coastal city like Lagos, let me remind everyone that once it rains consistently for a minimum of eight hours, we are bound to have flash floods caused by the increasing inability of effective discharge into the lagoon, which is brought about by a rise in the ocean level. This will automatically lock up all our drainages and would be unable to discharge until the water level goes down.’’

“Flash floods are not peculiar to Lagos. It is the new wave in most coastal cities around the world, including those who have adopted the best of technological advancements to curtail flooding. Lagos is at the receiving end of three types of flooding, namely Coastal, Urban and River flooding because of the peculiarity of its location.”

While urging residents to adopt an attitudinal change by not dumping refuse in drainage channels and erecting structures on drainage alignments, Bello vowed that anyone caught violating the environmental laws of the State would be punished accordingly.

The Commissioner also emphasized that all residents owe the state a duty to support the efforts of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration to ensure that heavy rainfall does not wreak havoc in any part of the metropolis.","Mon, 05 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sanwo-olu.jpg?fit=900%2C618&ssl=1,"['residents', 'release', 'water', 'flooding', 'state', 'cautions', 'flood', 'lagos', 'disaster', 'warns', 'rainfall', 'dam', 'heavy', 'oyan']", ,none

The Director-General of FEMA, Idriss Abbas, made the call in a statement on Sunday.

He said most of the deaths recorded in the past from flood in the FCT were as a result of non-compliance to instructions and early warnings.

Mr Abbas, therefore, emphasised the need for residents to adhere to instructions and early warnings from relevant authorities.

He added that attitudinal change was the key to reducing disasters to the barest minimum in the FCT.

He disclosed that the Search and Rescue team of the agency recently discovered the body of one Garba Joseph, 43-year-old from Akoka-Edo of Edo State, after two days search from a flooded river around TradeMoore Estate, Lugbe, in Abuja

“Narrating the incident, an eye witness account (one of FEMA’s volunteer/vanguard Kenneth Chima) who captured the incident on video explained that they were four men that tried walking through the water.

“And I kept warning them to go back, three of them went back but only this man insisted on crossing, unfortunately the water overpowered him and washed him away,” he said.

He decried the increasing rate of flood in the FCT due to residents’ apathy towards the government’s directives and early warnings.

“This is also despite FEMA’s consistent sensitisations based on The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) predictions of torrential rainfall and dangers of flooding.“

He said NIHSA’s most recent predictions warned of torrential rainfall and flooding from August, adding that FEMA had carried out aggressive sensitisation to educate residents on ways to prevent the impending flood.

He said FEMA was conducting sensitisation programmes in five different indigenous languages in the FCT using different media channels.

“We recently organized a meeting with our Volunteers, Vangards and Divers from all the area Councils within the FCT to educate them on how they can sensitise their people on how to prevent disasters to minimize loss of lives and properties.

“We also embarked on community to community flood sensitisation campaigns in the FCT and mounted billboards at all the flood prone points warning off and cautioning residents from these danger areas.”

The DG, who reiterated the agency’s commitment to reducing disasters to a barest minimum in the FCT, called on residents to complement the efforts of the FCT Administration by doing the needful.

He also advised residents not to underestimate the strength of water when it was flooded.

“What we are experiencing now is flash flood, the water builds up speedily and comes unnoticed hence very dangerous,” he said.

He called on community and religious leaders to take responsibility of sensitising their subjects, especially those who are living close to flood prone areas to move to higher grounds to avoid being washed away by flood.

He said that relevant authorities have been on their toes evacuating refuse around the FCT, distilling drainages and expanding narrow water channels to enable free flow of water for a safer FCT.

94,94,FL-2019-000093-NGA,Agency warns states contiguous to River Niger to brace up for impending flood - Guardian Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/news/agency-warns-states-contiguous-to-river-niger-to-brace-up-for-impending-flood/,"As River Niger reaches red alert

Following warning alert received from the Niger Basin Authority indicating that River Niger has reached Red alert of 6.60m the Nigerian Hydrological Service Agency has warned states contiguous to the Niger River to brace up for impending flood disaster.

The agency warned that It is expected that the flood magnitude sighted in Niamey, Niger Republic on the 23rd August 2020 would arrive Nigeria through Kebbi state on the 6th of September and flood other states contiguous to River Niger including Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa

NHSA Director General Engr Clement Nze in a press statement made available to journalists yesterday explained that he River Niger Basin which covers nine (9) countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, has Nigeria at the lowest portion of the Basin, meaning that that once the upper catchment of the Basin gets flooded, Nigeria should be prepared to experience flooding incident.

He said “As at today, the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin made up of Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso and part of Mali, have been flooded. The flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malanville (Benin Republic) have gotten to the Red Alert Zone”

Nze pointed out that Operators of Kainji and Jebba Dams have long been alerted to take appropriate measures in the operation of the reservoirs and accordingly, Kainji Dam is now spilling water at the rate of 1,000 m3/s that is 86.4 million cubic metres/day, saying this means that communities downstream Kainji and Jebba Dams could be flooded while Shiroro Dam on Kaduna River is still impounding, though there is the possibility of spilling water in the weeks ahead.

On River Benue sub-basin, the DG stated that the agency has maintained close contact with the Cameroonian authorities with regards to flood scenarios in the upper catchment of the sub-basin and Information received by NIHSA from the relevant authority in Cameroon stated that the Lagdo Dam is still impounding water.

He noted that the high intensity of rainfall during the last week of August has already saturated the soil and any rainfall of high intensity with long duration would translate into flooding in most part of the country.

He revealed that So far, Urban/Flash Flood has wrecked havocs in about 70 council areas in 20 states of the federation and the FCTof the Federation, including the FCT.

The NHSA boss recalled that the year 2020 Annual Flood Outlook predicted that some parts of at least 102 LGAs in 28 States fall within the Highly Probable Flood Risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 States of the Federation, including the FCT, fall within the Moderately Probable Flood Risk areas. The remaining 397 LGAs fall within the Low Probable Flood Risks areas.

It also warned The states that are contiguous to rivers Niger and Benue, namely: – Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa are likely to be affected by river flooding, while Coastal flooding is expected in Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, and Bayelsa States.

On account of poor drainage systems, flash and urban floods are expected to occur in major cities across the country, namely Birnin–Kebbi, Sokoto, Lokoja, Kaduna, Suleja, Gombe, Yola, Makurdi, Abuja, Lafia, Asaba, Port Harcourt, Yenagoa, Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Benin City, Oshogbo, Ado-Ekiti, Abakaliki, Awka, Nsukka.

The DG warned that the country still has many days of rainfall in the course of the year and More floods are expected in the months of August, September and October this year, in the event there is release of excess water from the Dams in other countries upstream rivers Niger and Benue this year, this will have more negative impacts on Nigeria which is located downstream other countries in the Niger Basin.

He urged that to prevent flood disaster,

blocked drainages and gutters should be cleared, river channels dredged and structures within the waterways and floodplains and flood paths pulled down.","Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-74.jpeg,"['river', 'world', 'flooding', 'flood', 'impending', 'expected', 'states', 'guardian', 'warned', 'nigeria', 'rivers', 'niger', 'contiguous', 'basin', 'warns']", ,flood
95,95,FL-2019-000093-NGA,"Nearly 80% of Nigerian farmers affected by floods, drought in 2020 — Report - Premium Times",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/agriculture/agric-news/436380-nearly-80-of-nigerian-farmers-affected-by-floods-drought-in-2020-report.html,"About 79 per cent of Nigerian farmers were estimated to have been affected by the ravaging effects of drought and flooding in 2020, a survey conducted in seven states of the country has shown.

The analysis by SBMIntel, an Africa focused research firm, revealed that the harvests of 26.3 per cent of Nigerian farmers were greatly affected by extreme weather conditions.

It said 52.60 per cent ”were somewhat affected and a fifth (21.1 per cent) were not affected by drought and flooding in the year under review.”

The survey, titled: “Nigerians just want to eat” and published this month, chronicled the major challenges bedevilling Nigerian farmers and food transporters which are capable of impeding national food security.

Survey

Data for the survey were sampled from seven Nigerian states, namely; Nasarawa, Osun, Benue, Oyo, Katsina, Ogun and Lagos.

Of the seven states surveyed, the report noted that the majority of the respondents (farmers) had their farms in the South-west States (73.7 per cent)—Lagos (36.8 per cent ), Oyo (21.1 per cent ) and Ogun (15.8 per cent ) .

Meanwhile, 10.5 per cent of the respondents had their farms in Benue and the remaining 15.9 per cent were equally distributed between Nasarawa, Osun and Katsina states respectively.

The farmers surveyed were mostly crop farmers who grew a wide range of staples with fruits, vegetables, cassava and maize farmers in the majority, the report noted.

Scourge

According to the survey, extreme climatic events such as flooding and drought witnessed in some states within the country triggered the negative effects being noticed on the prices of staple foods.

It said flooding in Nigeria was experienced in the north, mostly in states like Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara, and some parts of Kwara.

“In fact, in Kebbi alone, 500,000 hectares of farmland were destroyed by flooding, with the cost being upward of N5 billion,” the report said.

Also, it stated that the problem that faced farmers in the South-western region was the lack of rainfall experienced during the mid-planting season last year.

“Last year, the ‘August break’ actually began in early July and lasted through till the end of August. This prevented the planting of maize, cassava and cash crops like cocoa,” the survey added.

According to the survey, ”more than half of the farmers engaged had no irrigation system, even when they believed that it will help greatly in their farming endeavours.”

It said 57.90 per cent of the respondents said ”they do not own any irrigation system that could help complement the absence of rainfall when asked if they have, only 42.10 per cent had”.

”However, about 94.7 per cent of the respondents agreed to a large extent that an irrigation system would help their farming system while 10.5 per cent said it would only help to a small extent and 5.3 per cent said to no extent,” it added.

The survey said most farmers are getting discouraged over their inability to own irrigation systems or the technology of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) to support crops during adverse weather conditions.

Recommendations

In order to mitigate the challenges being faced by these farmers and food transporters, the report recommends that both state and federal governments adopt ”wider irrigation systems and as well facilitate the provision of early maturing and drought-resistant crop varieties.”

“Switching to climate-smart agriculture is the best way to guard against crop failure and poor yields,” the survey reads in part.

The report said respondents asked the government to fix access roads and provide adequate transportation that is cheap, effective and efficient.

“An efficient rail system will reduce the cost of transporting farm produce to the markets and improve food security. Security remains paramount followed by access to land and irrigation infrastructure,” the report quoted the farmers to have said.","Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/06/IMG-20200628-WA0015-e1593352816374.jpg?fit=970%2C436&ssl=1,"['farmers', 'flooding', 'survey', '2020', 'floods', 'cent', 'states', 'irrigation', 'respondents', 'system', '80', 'nigerian', 'affected', 'nearly', 'report', 'drought']", ,flood

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos by Dallas County Police DepartmentDALLAS—After the kidnapping and killing of 4-year-old Cash Gernon in Dallas last week, neighbor Jose Alvarado checked his security cameras for any footage that might help investigators.What he found sent a chill up his spine.The video is from 10 weeks before little Cash was left dead of stab wounds on the ground. But it shows the teenager charged with abducting him, Darriynn Brown, skulking down the street, opening Alvarado’s backyard gate and peering in before quickly walking away.“It’s really scary,” Alvarado told The Daily Beast. “I have two kids, one girl and one boy, and they play basketball in the backyard.”Alvarado’s house shares a back alley with the home of Monica Sherrod, 35, who was taking care of Cash and his twin, Carter. She has said she was dating the twins’ father, Trevor Gernon, a 31-year-old construction worker, until he reportedly left town in March when a court ordered him to report to rehab.That left Sherrod to care for the boys for the next two months—unbeknownst to their mother, Melinda Seagroves, who lives in Houston.Early on the morning of May 15, a young man crept into the twins’ bedroom, lifted a still-sleeping Cash out of the toddler bed he shared with Carter, and walked out—a chilling scene captured in grainy black and white by a baby monitor.The footage, obtained by the Daily Mail, shows the intruder returning about two hours later, hovering over the bed where Carter remained in slumber, before abruptly leaving as though he was startled by something.By then, Cash was already dead.Antwainese Square, a Dallas teacher who lives in the area, was out for her morning walk around 6:45 a.m. when she saw a clump of hair on the ground she thought belonged to a dog.“I was on the phone with my mom,” Square told The Daily Beast. “As I got closer, I could see an arm and a foot and I just began crying, saying, ‘Mom, I think I'm coming up on a body.’ And I started, ‘Mommy, it’s a child! It’s a child!’ And the baby had blood all over his face. At that point, my mom told me to get off the phone with her and immediately call 911… The baby had ants all over the bottom of his feet. So I pretty much knew that he was gone.”Square said she remembers “being in denial,” and hoped Cash was actually just sleeping even though he was obviously dead. “I was just trying to put together all possible stories; there was no way in my mind that I would think somebody would do that to a kid,” she said, adding that she stayed with Cash’s body until police and paramedics arrived so no one would run over him.“One couple that was leaving out of their garage, I had to stop them to let them know that this baby was on the ground,” Square said.More than three hours later, Sherrod reported Cash missing. “The day that he was missing, I got up late and thought it was weird,” Sherrod would later tell the Daily Mail. “I was like, ‘It's 10 o'clock already, you guys.’ So I figured Cash was still in bed.” Cash Gernon was abducted out of his bed on May 15. Handout Later that day, police arrested Brown, 18, who lives with his parents about a half-mile from where Cash’s body was found, according to court documents. He was charged with kidnapping and burglary, but not murder because police said they are waiting for the result of forensic tests.Held in lieu of $1.5 million bail, Brown could not be reached for comment and does not have a lawyer listed in court records. His mother, Mimi, has told reporters that she believes her son is being framed.A tangled web of relationships, criminal records, and an unknown motive hangs over the case.Sherrod, the mother of several children, has a criminal record that includes assault and DWI. Trevor Gernon, who has an extensive rap sheet, appears to have vanished; a phone number listed under his name was disconnected. Darriynn Brown, meanwhile, is reportedly a friend of one of Sherrod’s children and had been seen playing with children in Sherrod’s care.Sherrod initially characterized any relationship she or her kids had with Brown, who attended the same high school as at least one of the boys living in her house, as minimal. She later told a reporter that Brown had visited her home two days before Cash’s murder, but she was out grocery shopping at the time.According to multiple neighbors, Brown was definitely not an unfamiliar face around the neighborhood. One told The Daily Beast the teen regularly played football and basketball with some of the kids who lived with Sherrod. Others said they had spotted Brown on their Ring security cameras hanging out in the area.Little information has emerged about Seagroves, who now has custody of Carter. Seagroves did not respond to multiple interview requests, but her mother, Connie Ward, told The Daily Beast this week: “We are not ready to give any kind of statement. My family is broken. It has been a nightmare listening and watching the news about our baby and stories being reported that are false.”Seagroves does not appear to have had any brushes with the law, but court records show both Sherrod and Gernon have records that include arrests for assaulting their own parents.In 2013, Sherrod pleaded guilty to attacking her mother, Lezlee Pinkerton. According to a criminal affidavit signed by Officer Glenn Burkheimer-Lubeck of the Harris County Constable’s Office, Sherrod “intentionally struck” Pinkerton in the head and chest with her hand and pulled her to the ground, then “cause[d] bodily injury” to Pinkerton “by stomping on [Pinkerton’s] toes with her feet.”“Complainant reports that she believes her toes are broken,” the affidavit says. Sherrod was sentenced to two years of community supervision, participation in a domestic violence treatment program, a $100 donation to a family violence center, and a $200 fine.In 2018, Gernon was arrested by deputies from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office for assaulting his father, Roger Gernon, during a dispute over a credit card bill, Texas court records show. When Roger Gernon told his son that he was going to call the police, Trevor grabbed the phone away, bloodied his dad’s arm with his fingernails, and elbowed him in the chest. Charged with misdemeanor assault and interference with an emergency telephone call, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 68 days in county jail.In addition to the assault of family members, both Sherrod and Gernon have a history of theft, fraud, and drug possession.Sherrod’s most recent arrest was for DWI; she has also pleaded guilty to identity fraud charges, meth possession, driving without a license, and misdemeanor theft.Gernon’s most recent arrest was for the possession of narcotics in 2020. He was previously charged for possession of methamphetamine in 2016. His rap sheet includes a range of other crimes.Neal Flanagan, who co-owns a corrosion-proofing business, told The Daily Beast he met Gernon in high school, then reconnected in 2016. He gave Gernon a bit of work because he was struggling. Then things went sideways.“My ex-wife and I were married at the time,” said Flanagan. “We had started having issues. She separated from me in January 2017. That’s when Trevor and her started seeing each other.”“I never did see him after,” said Flanagan. “A couple years later, he messaged me on Facebook. Like, ‘Hey buddy. How you been?’ Like nothing ever happened.""When he was sober, Gernon “was as good as you could ask for,” Neal’s father, Johnny Flanagan, said. But he added that he wasn’t surprised Gernon took off without his boys.“He's one of these guys that kind of goes whichever way the wind blows, you know, and he'll do good for several months and then do bad for several months and you know, just up and disappear,” Flanagan said.Gernon’s whereabouts are unknown. Following his indictment on felony drug possession charges last November, he failed to appear for a March 29, 2021, hearing and thus forfeited a $10,000 bond payment. There is now an open warrant out for his arrest.None of the various defense lawyers who represented Sherrod or Gernon in court agreed to speak, citing attorney-client privilege.Cash’s death has raised many questions about those responsible for him. But in the neighborhood where he spent his last months, the overriding mystery is why would someone kill a defenseless child and leave him on the street like trash. Steven Monacelli The solidly working-class Mountain Creek section of Dallas is a quiet place, bordered on one side by the 600-acre Cedar Ridge nature preserve. Houses are in decent shape, and yards are clean. On the street where Cash’s body was found, locals have been stopping at a shrine to leave toys, flowers, and other mementos.The woman who found Cash’s body, meanwhile, has been struggling with her emotions since that morning.“It's been difficult. It really has been difficult,” Square told The Daily Beast.“I have a 3-year-old and as we're dealing with this and processing this, I'm learning that I have little triggers. If I see a little boy, 4, 3, 5, I will burst out crying. It’s just a trigger for me. My own daughter is like a trigger. Sometimes she'll say something and I'll cry.“Because even though I didn't know that baby, he was just robbed of his life. So, it's been really hard. It's been really hard to just process this. And no matter how much you try to move on, you can't unsee what you saw.”Rohrlich reported from New York and Monacelli from DallasRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

97,97,FL-2019-000093-NGA,"Climate Change in Nigeria: Floods in Lagos, Abuja, Niger Delta are going to get a lot worse - Quartz Africa",https://qz.com/africa/1054825/climate-change-in-nigeria-floods-in-lagos-abuja-niger-delta-are-going-to-get-a-lot-worse/,"Earlier this year heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos, Nigeria’s economic nerve centre and one of Africa’s most populous cities. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

Pictures and videos later posted online showed dramatic and even bizarre scenes of flooding in the city, including the capture of a crocodile in the floodwater. Another video, which went viral, was one of a man kayaking in floodwater on one of the streets.

Lagos has not been alone. Suleija, a town near the capital city Abuja hundreds of kilometres away, suffered its own flooding challenge in early July. Heavy rains washed houses away and caused others to collapse, trapping occupants. Thirteen people were reported to have died.

The two primary factors of flooding in Nigeria are climate change and poor urban planning.

Some of the worst flooding in recent memory happened five years ago in March 2012 when 32 of Nigeria’s 36 states were affected, 24 severely. More than 360 people were killed and almost two million people were displaced.

The seriousness of the flooding was attributed to a combination of two events: very heavy local rainfall and the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in nearby Cameroon.

Although the degree and seriousness of flooding in Nigeria fluctuates, flooding remains a recurring phenomenon in most parts of the country. The first factor aggravating flooding is climate change, which has been shown to contribute to more extreme storms and rainfall. Another factor contributing to flooding in cities is that Nigeria has experienced rapid urban growth and planning is poor.

The problem of flooding is not peculiar to Nigeria alone. In 2007, floods affected 1.5 million people across several countries in Africa, including Uganda, Sudan, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and Niger. Alluvial flooding is common for major rivers—such as Nile, Niger, Benue, Orange, Zambezi—in Africa. Major cities in Africa are also susceptible to fluvial flooding which occurs when excessive rainfall, over an extended period of time, causes rivers to overflow.

Why Nigeria suffers

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria (1978 to 2007) suggests that rainstorms are getting more intense. The data show that there are fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed much from previous decades. This means that more rain is falling on the days that there is rain, which in turn means that rain storms in the city are getting more intense, increasing the threat of flooding.

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria suggests rainstorms are getting more intense with fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed.

In addition to more intense rain storms, the other possible cause of flooding in coastal regions is rising sea levels. Although up-to-date data on the rising sea levels in Nigeria are scarce, it’s believed that if nothing is done, this is likely to aggravate flooding in the future, particularly in coastal cities.

Areas at risk include Lagos, which is on the coast, as well as the Niger Delta region which has many low-lying towns and villages. Being on the coast also makes these places more susceptible to storm surges. While these areas are no stranger to floods, evidence suggests that floods have become increasingly common and intense in recent times.

In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the adjoining states. The changes in rainfall patterns, particularly in frequency and intensity, have meant that these events have begun to happen more frequently.

In Nigeria’s cities, the most common cause of flooding after excessive rains is poor drainage systems that can’t cope. This is called pluvial flooding. Lagos provides a good case study.

Lagos as a case study

Lagos has been urbanizing rapidly. By some estimates there will be 19 million in the city by 2050, making it the 11th most populous city in the world. It is also home to most of the country’s industrial, commercial and non-oil operations.

Urbanisation and industrialisation increase the number of roads and buildings. This in turn increases the proportion of surface area where water cannot be absorbed into the ground, leading to rapid runoff which then causes flooding during storms. And in cities that manage their infrastructure well, storm water drainage systems are built so that water can be directed to rivers efficiently and quickly.

Lagos has not kept up with its infrastructure needs. The growth and expansion of the city has been largely unregulated. The has resulted in inadequate and poor housing, the development of slum areas and inadequate water supply and waste disposal, among other problems.

What’s complicated the situation for Lagos is that many parts of the city were originally low-lying mangrove swamps and wetlands, which have been reclaimed and settled, mostly by poorer communities and more recently through concerted efforts by the government.

These low-lying areas are particularly at risk of flooding, and the situation is complicated by buildings being constructed on water ways, and bad waste dumping habits which block the drains.

Up to 70% of the population of Lagos live in slums.

What must be done

It’s clear Nigeria needs to take measures to cope with flooding. This will require both local and international interventions, and could include early warning and rapid response systems, flood data gathering and modelling, proper urban and spatial planning, flood emergency preparedness and political will.

The country can learn from others. For example, in Mumbai, India various measures have been implemented to reduce the impact of flooding. These have included an emergency control centre, automated weather stations, removal of solid waste from stormwater drains and the development of emergency response mechanisms. Nigeria must invest in these measures, and sustain them.

DAVID TILLMAN: Hello, I'm meteorologist David Tillman with your one-minute weather forecast. The threat for heavy rain is not over, and it's going to come from moisture in the Gulf of Mexico that the National Hurricane Center is now giving a 20% chance of developing. So that's an 80% chance that it will not develop.

But all of this moisture is going to be lifting in our general direction. And that means for the next couple of days, it's going to be pretty wet around here. Things are quiet out there overnight, but this moisture is going to be moving in our direction.

We think the deep moisture will start to move in as we get into Friday afternoon. That's when scattered heavy downpours are going to be likely around southeast Texas. And there could be some instances of some street flooding as well with this activity. It'll last overnight on Friday into Saturday morning.

And off and on, on Saturday, we'll see these downpours around. That as we get into Sunday, we'll begin to see some of this rain hit off to the west of us, but not before producing a good one to two, maybe three inches of rain around southeast Texas.

There could be some isolated places that get up to four inches of rain. Here's the extended forecast. We're calling for an 80% chance for rain Friday afternoon, evening and night, 70% on Saturday, 40% on Sunday, and then we'll be back to 20% as we head into next week.","Fri, 21 May 2021 01:13:14 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/21/60a7071460b4aa6168ac7cfb/60a7071460b4aa6168ac7cfc_o_U_v2.jpg,"['southeast', 'rain', 'moisture', 'tillman', 'going', 'downpours', '20', 'system', 'chance', 'gulf', 'thats', 'tropical', 'heavy', 'development']", ,flood
0,0,FL-2018-000120-NGA,MATTERS ARISING: 28 states at risk of flooding -- how prepared is Nigeria? - TheCable,https://www.thecable.ng/states-risk-flooding-nigeria-2021,"Uche Igwe will not forget August 26, 2020 in a hurry. It had rained heavily that day in the capital city, Abuja. Trademore Estate in Lugbe, where Igwe runs a cybercafe business, was overrun by rainwater. The force of the flood pulled down the fence of Igwe’s office complex and destroyed a part of the building. In no time, the property was floating on water.

Igwe’s business was greatly affected as he lost machines and computers. It took his entire savings and the support of friends and family for him to be able to recover from the event of that day, he tells TheCable.

“I lost over two million naira worth of [electronics], my machines were all gone, my computers, everything. We didn’t expect such here,” he says.

Like Igwe, Victor Essang, a resident of Calabar, Cross River state capital, has also recorded losses to flooding.

First, his family lost a block of flats inherited from their grandparents, and later, his poultry business took a hit in 2016.

Igwe and Essang are just two of the many Nigerians who suffer the consequences of flooding that occurs yearly in different parts of the country during the rainy season.

SEVERE FLOOD PREDICTIONS

During the 2021 flood outlook presentation, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) announced that 28 states, including the FCT, will most likely experience flooding this year.

Similarly, the Nigeria Meteorological Agency, in its 2021 seasonal climate forecast, said the signals monitored by the agency in the last seven years show that things are changing on the climate front and that this year, Nigeria is expected to experience unprecedented heavy downpours.

The information is intended to alert Nigerians, government, relevant agencies and stakeholders of what is to come in order for them to prepare — prevent, mitigate and respond — for severe flooding.

Going by the alert, Igwe says he intends to raise his compound level to prevent rainwater from entering in the event of a flood.

On his part, Essang says he was already apprehensive about the severity of this year’s rainfall, even before the alert. He tells TheCable that he has relocated his belongings to a safer place.

“I have packed out my things to a safe place, I will bring them back when the rain stops. My only prayer is God will not let it bring our house down,” he says.

CLIMATE CHANGE A DRIVING FACTOR IN FLOODING

A report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) states that extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global climate change increase the likelihood of floods.

Chukwudi Njoku, a doctoral researcher on climate change at the University of Calabar, says flooding in Nigeria can be linked to both natural and human activities that influence changes in the climate.

“When there is high temperature, then there is increased possibility for evaporation – the process where water vapour is taken from the earth surface into the atmosphere — which can trigger much more rainfall,” he tells TheCable.

“The rising temperature here is a climate change feedback and when evaporation is increased, there is the possibility of more rainfall and when rainfall increases, simultaneously it could trigger flooding.”

Research by MOJ Ecology & Environmental Sciences (MOJES) has shown that human activities such as urbanisation, felling of forest trees and burning of fossil fuels, among others, lead to the emission of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.

According to the study, these activities distort the carbon cycle – the process in which carbon atoms move from the atmosphere to the earth and then back into the atmosphere. The activities also initiate climate change processes which involve a variety of changes including higher surface temperatures and changes to the hydrological cycle – the process in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and then back in form of rain.

Njoku believes that these human activities are what increases and make worse the impacts of climate change on humans and their environment.

“Such activities like urbanisation which is not properly done in a sustainable manner, for example, people building in floodplains and swampy areas which are supposed to serve as banks for water, thus reducing the ability of the environment to collect and keep excess water,” the researcher explains.

“Also, the clearing of forest areas for agriculture increases the extent of bare surfaces that would have hitherto collected runoff water and reduced the flow of water.

“These human activities are not sustainable and where they are not checked, they only go to increase the susceptibility of the people to flooding which appears to be inevitable at this time considering the increasing temperature and rainfall events.”

He advises that people living in flood-prone areas should be relocated and government should put laws in place to deter chaotic urbanisation, create more awareness about the potential increase in flooding events and their dangers, and also ensure that roads and drainages are constructed to accommodate the volume of water from the rain.

HOW IS GOVERNMENT PREPARING?

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), whose responsibility is to manage disasters, tells TheCable that the agency had information about imminent flooding since February through the seasonal climate predictions document made available by NIMET.

“Before that presentation by NIHSA, NEMA already had some information about the outlook of the rains and the consequences of the flood. So having the information, the agency had called together experts to analyse the predictions of NIMET and come out with a disaster risk management of the prediction,” says Manzo Ezekiel, public relations officer of NEMA.

“The secretary will soon convene a meeting of all the state emergency management agencies and relevant organisations that their activities or mandate have something to do with the management of floods.

“During that meeting, NEMA is going to communicate to them that this is the information we have and this information is going to cover your area of operation, what and what can you do about it. That is the next line of action that we have. That meeting will take hold very soon.”

The PRO said the zonal offices of the agency “are already on standby to take the information down to the specific communities that are at risk of flooding”.

He said the agency will ensure continuous engagement with Nigerians and create awareness at the federal, state, and local government levels to ensure that flooding does not take Nigerians by surprise.

“We are going to tell them that, this year there is a forecast of increased rainfall and this will likely interrupt your stay here,” he says.

SPEEDY MITIGATION EFFORTS NEEDED

While government agencies are still at the preparation stage, Igwe wishes they can speed up the process since the country is already in the rainy season.

He believes the annual flood events in his locality is a result of the lack of an adequate drainage system which the government had earlier promised to expand.

“I think the major cause is the drainage system. I wish the government could even rush down and do it for us today today today,” he says.

Igwe desires the speedy process because, according to him, the relief materials government agencies offer in the aftermath of flooding do not equate to the losses.

“When they were sharing their palliatives, I just refused; how can somebody lose about two point something million and you are giving him a pack of Indomie and small 5kg camping gas cylinder?” Igwe adds.","Thu, 20 May 2021 07:27:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FLOOD-PRONE-AREAS-IN-FCT1-1.png,"['information', 'water', 'process', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'arising', 'states', 'igwe', '28', 'nigeria', 'prepared', 'risk', 'agency', 'rainfall', 'matters', 'activities']", ,flood

He spoke at the public presentation of 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) tagged “Managing Flood for Sustainable Development in COVID-19 Era” organised by NIHSA, yesterday, in Abuja.

Adamu said that 302 local government areas in 36 states, including Federal Capital Territory ( FCT), would fall within moderate flood risk areas while 121 councils in 28 states would be within the highly probable risk areas.

“This year, like 2020, we will be grappling with the two threats of the COVID-19 pandemic and related hygiene challenges as well as the impending floods as predicted in the AFO. The 2021 floods levels will be higher than in the previous years but will not attain the levels of the 2012 that was devastating,” he said.

The minister also warned that states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue, including Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nassarawa and Kogi, are likely to experience river flooding.

Others are Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa states. Coastal flooding is expected to affect Rivers, Cross River, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states.

“Flash and urban floods from heavy inundation are predicted to occur in some major cities. The severity would depend on availability and adequacy of drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.”

Adamu, therefore, called on all stakeholders, including policy makers and agencies, to rise up to the challenge of impending floods and threats of COVID-19.

Director General of NIHSA, Clement Nzeh, said: “States and relevant authorities as well as farmers must take the flood outlook serious by putting in place measures to mitigated its impact.

“There is a greater awareness for this year’s outlook in terms of the level of participation and political will, looking at representation, including governors, senators and key agencies. I believe they are going to cascade this to the grassroots.”

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has identified 10 local government areas in Cross River State that fall under the probable flood risk areas in view of the Annual Flood Outlook for 2021.

The agency also identified two local government areas in the state that falls under the highly probable risk areas for 2021.

The Director-General of NEMA, Muhammadu Muhammed, said this in Ikom Local Government Area while distributing relief materials to victims of windstorm in the area.

Mr Muhammed, who was represented by Godwin Tepikor, the zonal coordinator of NEMA, South-south, urged the state government to immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities to mitigate the impact.

He mentioned the 10 local government areas to include Yakurr, Calabar Municipal, Akpabuyo, Obubra, Bakassi, Ogoja, Biase, Etung, Odukpani and Ikom.

He said the two local government areas in the state that fall under highly probable risks areas were Calabar South and Abi.

“The state should immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities so as to mitigate the impact of the predicted flood on the vulnerable local government areas,” he said.

The agency distributed relief materials to over 1,000 households affected by windstorm in four communities in Ikom local government area of Cross River.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the distribution followed the windstorm disaster that occurred on May, last year, in Ogomogom, Akorofono, Nkarasi and Abinti communities, all in Ikom Local Government Area.

The director general said the items were approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, following the recommendation from the agency as humanitarian assistance to the affected persons.

The items distributed were bags of rice, beans and garri, tomato paste, kegs of palm oil, wrappers, blankets, bundles of roofing sheets, cement, bags of nails, zinc and ceiling boards.

He urged the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the items.

In his remark, the Director General, Cross River State Emergency Management Agency, Princewill Ayim, thanked NEMA for its intervention.

The Chairman of Ikom Local Government Area, Kingsley Egumi, thanked President Buhari and NEMA for the timely response to the concerns of their people, pledging that the items would be judiciously utilised.

Mfam Akong, who responded on behalf of the beneficiaries, thanked NEMA for its assistance.

3,3,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Why Lagosians should heed flood alert | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World NewsOpinion — The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/opinion/why-lagosians-should-heed-flood-alert/,"Sir: On April 14, 2021, the Lagos State Government predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state, therefore, directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic Implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello, “…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm. It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

In downscaling the predictions of the flood alerts, the state government is therefore collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET). In addition to what the Environment and Water Resources commissioner said, the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe declared, “I…urge residents to support the government to achieve flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again being littered by residents.”

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.

4,4,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Rainy season: Fears over impending flood in the land - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/rainy-season-fears-over-impending-flood-in-the-land/,"In fact, the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, who released the prediction, warned: “…the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Jolted by the report, many residents told The Guardian that they fear for the worst, noting that they had not recovered from the devastating effects of last year’s flood.

A resident in Bello Street in Ilasamaja area of the state, Tomiwa Sulaimon, said while she would love to move to another area before the rains start, it was not financially possible for her at this time.

She recalled: “Last year when it was raining almost everyday, our street and house got flooded every other day. This street is a bit low and erosion has eaten a good part of the road and despite our little efforts to keep the flood at bay, the water always finds a way to get in. The worst part is that those refuse disposal trucks hardly come around, claiming that we owe them for several months but if they hardly come around, how do they expect to get paid? They come around only once in a blue moon and in the meantime, we have to find a way to help ourselves. I want to plead with the government to tell them to improve on their services so that people are not forced to dump refuse indiscriminately.”

x

A shop owner, who identified herself as Blessing Ogbe, lamented that residents in the area were responsible for the constant flooding in the area whenever it rains.

Ogbe said: “The landlords and agents are very greedy. Once they see one small space, they will construct shops on it, most times blocking the water channels in the process. At Taiwo Junction and Transformer bus stop, that place is a major water channel but go and see for yourself. They have built a row of shops there now, blocking the gutter. So, anytime rain falls, the water has nowhere to go.

“The residents themselves are always so eager to throw refuse into the gutter when it is raining or by the roadside, some of which also end up in the gutter. The roads are bad and gutters are very narrow; so the water has nowhere to go as such. This has been a recurring problem for many years now and we have been making private efforts but we need the government to step in for us now.”

An estate agent whose office is located along Okota road, Yusuf Isa, expressed fears that his office might not survive another rainy season, lamenting that floodwater finds its way into the office with the smallest rainfall.

He said: “No matter how shortly it rains, this side of Okota road leading to Jakande Gate always gets flooded. We have carried out several interventions by ourselves and would appreciate if the government can step in now. We tried to channel the flood through Akiti to connect it to the canal at Oke-Afa but there is a limit to what we can do on our own. Because of this, Okota and Akiti are usually flooded but what can we do?”

Many residents in Oke-Afa, Okota, Ibeju Lekki and Ikorodu areas of the state, who spoke with The Guardian, also recounted similar tales of woe. Lagosians who reside along flood plains of major rivers and drainage channels such as Owode, Iwaya, Makoko, Badia, Ijora, Isaalu, Pota and Shibiri, among others, could not be reached. But Bello had advised them to always be on the alert and ready to move to higher grounds when the need arises, adding that they would be duly notified at the appropriate time.

He stated that the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) of the ministry had been consistently de-silting and working on various linkages to the secondary and primary channels to enable them discharge efficiently and act as retention basins.

Bello also disclosed that the government was maintaining the long-established synergy with Ogun-Oshun River Basin Authority, which had ensured control and monitoring of the steady and systemic release of water from Oyan Dam to prevent flooding the downstream reaches.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, an engineer, also stated that the state government would dredge about 221 collector drains and 32 primary channels measuring about 72 km spread across the 20 local councils of the state to checkmate flooding.

He reiterated that EFAG would continue to de-silt various tertiary channels and manholes measuring about 100 kilometres across the state.

While restating the present administration’s resolve to find a lasting solution to flooding in the state, he called on residents to desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on the rights of way of canals, adding that it was regrettable that several of the canals recently cleaned up were being littered with refuse.

Lagos might appear on top of the situation. But the problem of flooding at the peak of the rainy season is not limited to the state alone; it is a national problem. Since 2012 when floods killed 363 people and displaced over 2.1 million others from their homes between early July and November 5, no year has passed without the natural disaster claiming lives and property worth billions of naira in the country. From Lagos to Delta, Anambra, Imo, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Osun, Taraba and Kebbi states, among others, flood wreaks havoc on homes and farms yearly with adverse effects on the economy of the country and health of citizens.

The most recent report on the natural disaster, which was released by the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Muhammadu Muhammed, in early December 2020, stated that, “the devastating impact of the 2020 flooding killed 68 people, affected 35 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 320 local councils and over 129,000 people.”

Now, the question is: With another rainy season at hand and with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) predicting that “the country is expected to have rainfall amounts from 400mm in the North to over 3000mm in the South,” what are communities and the state governments doing to avert a reoccurrence? The Guardian spoke with relevant stakeholders in Akwa Ibom, Osun, Imo, Delta and Cross River states on the issue. The stories are as follows:

Solution To Your Flood Problem Underway, A’Ibom Govt Re-assures Apprehensive Residents

From Inemesit Akpan-Nsoh, Uyo

AS the rains begin to set in, residents of flood prone areas in Akwa Ibom State have sent a Save Our Souls (SOS) message to the state government to come to their aid so as to avert the perennial flooding they have been experiencing year in year out.

In Uyo, the state capital, residents in areas like Abak Road, Atiku Abubakar, IBB Avenue, Esuene Street, Ukana Offot/adjourning streets, Atan, Use and Effiat Offot communities have appealed to the government to replicate the ‘magic’ it used to control flooding and erosion along Oron road by Nsikak Eduok and Edet Akpan Avenue in their areas.

x

The residents noted that controlling the flood in their areas would enable them to access their homes, have their properties secured and ensure that they would no longer live in fear whenever rain is about to fall.

Mr. Okon Etim of Ukana Offot street told The Guardian that the flooding on his street had for several years rendered many persons homeless.

According to him, the government had always given affected residents relief materials when their household properties were destroyed, with a pledge to find a permanent solution to the menace.

He, however, lamented that successive governments had tried to remedy the situation to no avail. Offot said the situation appears to have worsened as houses along Calabar, Port Harcourt and Esuene streets and parts of the Federal Housing Estate are no-go-area once the rains set in.

Other residents, including Mrs. Nkoyo Akpan and Augustine Effiong, among others, also called on the government to come to their aid, adding that they could not afford the money to relocate or construct another apartment at the moment.

Findings by The Guardian, which the residents acknowledged, indicated that structures in the areas were built on the right of way, thereby blocking free flow of floodwater.



Responding to the cries of residents, the state Commissioner for Environment and Petroleum Resources, Mr. Charles Udoh, said government was aware of the problem, noting that it has, in conjunction with the World Bank, awarded the contract that would address it to China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) at an estimated cost of N12 billion.

Udoh stated that the 7.2-kilomtre flood control project covers 17 communities in three local councils; namely Uyo, Nsit Ibom and Ibesikpo Asutan.

His words: “The reality is that the government cannot go everywhere to de-silt gutters. So, while the government is doing the common areas, the government is calling on residents and citizens to also embark on de-silting of gutters. Flooding sometimes comes from bad habits like dumping refuse into gutters. We are also calling on our people to desist from dumping refuse into gutters. The waste management agency of the state is embarking on massive de-silting of drains all over the state.



“This is in addition to the three major flagship projects of the ministry that talks about water collection and harvesting, erosion control project, one in Etim Umana, one in Anua and then the IBB erosion control. IBB will not be completed this rainy season, but this is the last rainy season that everybody affected on the IBB corridor will face flooding. Once that is done, the entire Atiku Abubakar, Abak road axis, Mechanic village, State Secretariat, Atan, Effiat and Use Offot communities will be evacuated.

“We will also evacuate water from Area ‘C’ Police Command. All the water will be taken to the outfall drain and also taking water at some point of Ring Road Two. But we cannot complete the entire process within this rainy season. The IBB project is 8.4 kilometres, the biggest flood control project ongoing in Nigeria now.”



We Don’t Want To Abandon Our Homes Again, Osun Residents Cry Out

From Timothy Agbor, Osogbo

Some residents in flood-prone areas in Osun State have cried out to the state government to assist them in mitigating the problem this year.

Speaking with The Guardian, residents in flood-prone areas like Rasco, Gbonmi and Gbodofon appealed to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to save them from losing their houses to flood this year.

A landlord at Gbonmi, Mr. Suraju Kamaruden, said many house owners and residents in the community always relocate to safe areas when the rainy season is at its peak, adding: “We don’t want to abandon our houses again. That is why we are begging our government to come to our aid and help us.”

x

A trader at Rasco area in Osogbo, Mr. Jude Okpara, said traders in the area face difficult times during rainy season as flood always submerges their shops.

“We don’t have any other place to go. If not, we would have left this area. Although the government expanded the waterways about three years ago, the water still overflows its boundaries and submerges our shops. We are tired,” he lamented.

Chairman of Olorunwa Sawmill in Oke-Baale community, Osogbo, Mr. Sunday Ajewole, said there was an urgent need for government to construct a bigger drainage channel that would accommodate much floodwater when the rain is at its peak.

He said: “For the past seven years, we have been battling with flood. Every time we are in the rainy season, we always lose our planks to flood. Our government would always clear and expand the waterways every year but we are still battling flood. Most times when government fails to do something and we are approaching rainy season, we hire some labourers to help us clear the waterways. Sometimes we contribute between N80,000 to N100,000 and give to the dredgers. Still, we are not safe.

“We have discovered that the problem is that we have only one ring that forms the bridge of the waterways. And the ring is very small. The water that gushes from Ona-Baba-Ona area and Arogunmosa community would divert at our area and the ring doesn’t have the capacity to make it flow, as it should. It usually bounces back to where we stay, sweep our goods away and even sack residents out of their homes.

“This year, to lessen the severity of the flood, the government has cleared the waterways for us but once it rains heavily, there will be flood. Until the bridge is re-constructed and a bigger ring is fixed, we may not be out of this flood problem. We don’t have the financial strength to construct a bigger bridge and that’s why we are appealing to government to come to our aid.

“We have lost millions of naira worth of goods and property to flood in this area. We are afraid that if nothing is done again this year, property or even lives may be lost to flood because we have started seeing signs that it will rain heavily this year.”

To prevent a reoccurrence of flood in the state this year, the Osun State Waste Management Agency said it has been sensitising members of the public on the need to desist from dumping refuse on floodwater channels.

T

he General Manager of the agency, Mr. Fatai Oyewole, told The Guardian in Osogbo that efforts were ongoing to rid major gutters of refuse.

“We have been mobilising people not to dump refuse on waterways and major gutters,” he said. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment has disclosed that it opened up some streams across the state during the dry season for easy flow of water. This, according to the coordinator of the ministry’s Department of Flood Control, Samorudeen Odesanmi, an engineer, was part of the state government’s efforts at preventing another incident of flooding in the state.

“This government is proactive. Before the advent of this rainy season, we optimised the opportunity of the dry season to open up series of streams across the state for easy flow of water. If at all we are going to do anything on flood control, it would be minimal.

“We have already marked off some areas we want to work on this year and they are waiting for governor’s approval. Much had been done before now and we are on top of the situation,” he said.

Imo Commences De-silting Of Drainages, Vows To Demolish Houses Built On Waterways

From Charles Ogugbuaja, Owerri

AS this year’s rainy season gradually sets in, residents in Imo State and the state government have commenced preparations to mitigate the likely effect of flooding.

x

The flood-prone local councils in the state are the riverine areas of Oguta, Ohaji/Egbema and Orsu, among others. The locals in these communities began to experience massive flooding since 2012, which has resulted in loss of lives and destruction of their property. The flood, which occurs at the peak of every rainy season, had forced many residents to abandon their homes and relocate to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), where both the state and national emergency management agencies lent them helping hands.

A resident in Oguta, Jude Igwe, who called for quick intervention by the government, told The Guardian that he would not want a repeat of his past experiences this year, likewise other members of his family. He said: “Since 2012, almost on a yearly basis, we living in riverine areas have been witnessing flooding. It is not something to behold. Now that the rains are setting in, we appeal to the state government to prepare and assist us in time. Some of us are poor. We shall be relocated to camps as usual. So, we are calling for early preparation in case such occurs.”

Also, an indigene of Orsu, who identified himself simply as Okechukwu, recounted how his family lost valuable property in previous years and called for help.

“I am not ready to allow flood engulf us again. We are preparing ahead of time. But government and good spirited individuals should please come to our assistance ahead of time. We also want government to build gutters that will channel water to the rivers,” he said.

A community leader in Ohaji, Saturday Ochia, however, urged residents to desist from blocking waterways with refuse. He said: “We want our people to adhere to the simple environment-friendly rule of clearing the waterways. We do not want to witness flooding this year in our community. We are educating our people.”

Speaking with The Guardian, the Commissioner for Environment, Dr. Ikechukwu Njoku, said the state government was not leaving anything to chances, adding that it has commenced public enlightenment on appropriate waste disposal and clearing of drainages by holding town hall meetings with the monarchs, local government officials, community leaders and residents. He also disclosed that the ministry has commenced de-silting of drainages in Owerri, the state capital.

According to Njoku, the government has marked structures built on waterways for demolition, stressing that they were constructed in contravention of the state’s master plan.

He also gave assurance that the government has put a robust plan in place to ensure flood-free environment in the state capital and other communities, stressing that the Governor, Hope Uzodimma, would ensure the construction of standard drainage systems in the state.

Delta Is Already Prepared To Tackle Flooding, Commissioner Says

From Monday Osayande, Asaba

DELTA State government has declared that it was fully prepared to mitigate the impact of flood in coastal areas of the state this year.

The Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Christ Onogba, made the declaration in an interview with The Guardian in Asaba. Onogba noted that the state did not have to wait for NIMET or other agencies’ prediction on the effect of flood before putting things right.

“Firstly, we keep on saying to everyone that we are in the era of climate change, so those communities living in the coastal line should find alternative homes before the rains set in,” he noted.

According to the commissioner, it was necessary for flood victims to have alternative abode because government was no longer ready to build camps for those that might be displaced by flood due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We cannot set up camps as it used to be, but that doesn’t mean we are sleeping. In fact, we have done a lot. We are resetting the drains, and very shortly, we will open one of the channels that is flowing into the River Niger, and good enough, the road side drain in Asaba is clean and working fine.

“The government is prepared and we will never be taken unaware in the issue of flood. And because we understand that because of climate change, flooding is something that must happen, we will not wait for any prediction before we start making our preparations,” he emphasised.

A resident in Ndokwa East council, Mr. Emma Agboma, lamented that several homes had collapsed in the area in the past as a result of flooding.

“I think now that we are approaching rainy season, government should exercise its power early so that we are not taken unaware. They should be alert so that they can relocate some of us to upland. Many are willing to leave their houses but it is not easy to relocate from where you are used to over the years.

“Government should do as much as possible to mitigate our suffering in riverine areas – Burutu, Bomadi and Patani. So, government should do the needful by building camps early enough for us to relocate,” he said.

For Dave Ogochukwu, while government should try to evacuate people in flood-prone areas to avoid loss of lives, residents should also not dispose refuse indiscriminately, thereby blocking waterways.

“The property that has been lost since 2012 till date is enormous and it is not good for the growth of the society. In recent times, several farmlands have been overrun by flood putting farmers in a difficult situation.

“Over the years, government has made efforts to relocate people from the flood-prone areas but some people have been adamant. However, government should continue to sensitise the people on the need to relocate before the flooding begins,” Ogochukwu added.

‘We Have Been Crying Out To Government For Help’

From Agosi Todo, Calabar

LAST year during the peak of the rainy season, many communities in Cross River State experienced heavy flooding that destroyed farms and homes. Over 300 residents in the state were left homeless and properties worth millions of naira destroyed due to heavy rainfalls.

The rains destroyed farmlands specifically in Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Biase and Boki local councils of the state.

Some of the residents at Ikot Eka Edem in Calabar Municipal local council identified building of houses on waterways as the cause of flooding in the area.

A resident, Mr. Gab Otei, said he was apprehensive ahead of this year’s rainy season, lamenting that he lost his valuables to flood last year.

Otei said: “Last year, the heavy rains wreaked havoc in the whole of this street. I lost my valuables because I was trying to save my little children from being taken away by the flooding.

“I cannot leave this place because this is my father’s house and I stay here with my family. For years now, we have been crying to government at all levels to come to our aid and open the canals for free flow of water, but no response.”

A resident in Kakwagom community in Boki local council, Mr. Augustine Ita, said: “Last year, most of the yam and cassava farms were basically destroyed. We lost everything and you know that hunger was the effect of it. What those of us who farm in the riverine areas are trying to do now is to either cultivate earlier or make your mounds to be bigger than what it used to be, because if the mounds are very big, and the crop are up there, if the flood comes, it starts from the bottom of the mound. If God is on our side, we will still have something to hold on to. It depends on the strength of your mounds and how heavy the flood will be.”

Speaking with The Guardian on measures the state government was taking to safeguard lives and properties against flood this year, the Director General of Cross River State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr. Princewill Ayim, disclosed that last year, over 510 persons were displaced by flood across the state.

Ayim stated that although the state had not received the yearly prediction from concerned government agencies on what to expect this year, the agency has started sensitisation campaign in communities in Calabar South, Calabar Municipality, Boki, Biase, Odukpani and Etung local councils that are prone to flood.

He lamented that people living in flood-prone areas refuse to relocate to safe areas because they insist on remaining in their ancestral homes.

Ayim explained: “The way we do it every year is that we get informed from the national bodies. They tell us when there will be heavy flood and what to expect. For now we have not gotten any prediction but we cannot keep on waiting. We need to be proactive by engaging ourselves in activities that can mitigate heavy flood.

“We have our local emergency committees spread across all the 18 local councils. They interface with the locals to inform them more about flooding and how to prepare for it. And at the same time, we are also collaborating with the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC). Luckily, we are among the states that installed emergency outfit; so if you are in distress and do not have airtime in your phone, you can dial the 122 free toll number through which help can come to you. That is in place already.

“Apart from that, we use the media houses to educate the public to clear their drainage channels and to cut the entire weeds on the waterways. If you go to Calabar South for example, you see some stagnant water that if you don’t look very well you won’t know there is an artificial pool there.”","Sat, 24 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rainy-season.jpg,"['rainy', 'residents', 'water', 'world', 'flooding', 'waterways', 'flood', 'impending', 'season', 'area', 'guardian', 'nigeria', 'land', 'state', 'areas', 'fears']", ,flood

Speaking at the public presentation of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency’s (NIHSA) 2021 annual flood outlook (AFO) in Abuja on Thursday, Adamu said the flood projection in different states are of varying severity.

He said states surrounding River Niger and Benue will experience “severe flooding”, adding that it will aggravate the problems created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This year, we will be grappling with the two threats of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the impending floods as predicted in the AFO,” NAN quoted him as saying.

“The flood projections show varying severity across parts of the country.

“In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 local government areas (LGAs) in 36 states including the FCT will fall within the moderate probable flood risk areas.

“It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the highly probable risk areas.

“The states surrounding Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience severe flooding.

“Floods come with attendant health risks through the contamination of potable water sources. The 2021 flooding will be exacerbated by the continuing ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The minister noted that the 2012 flood which brought massive destruction of lives and property across the country necessitated the creation of a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront a reoccurrence.

According to him, the NIHSA forecasts have increased citizens’ awareness and led them to take measures to prevent severe flood damage.

He urged stakeholders, including policy makers and tiers of government, to take appropriate measures such as clearing of waterways and flood paths to contain it.","Thu, 06 May 2021 17:12:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Flood-Gwagwalada.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'varying', 'states', 'minister', '28', '2021', 'covid19', 'afo', 'risk', 'severe']", ,none
6,6,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Flooding as a disaster waiting to happen - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/flooding-as-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen/,"The rains are here again. Rather than being a blessing, the rains have become a curse to many Nigerians, especially to coastal states and communities living along the bank of Rivers Niger and Benue. The federal government has issued a flood alert. Will the 2021 predictions go the way of others? TONY AKOWE reports

Since the devastating flood in Nigeria in 2012, it has become important for the government and its agency to make an annual forecast of possible flood and its impact in the country annually. Since the first forecast was made in 2013, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, working with other government agencies, has consistently warned the nation of impending flood across the country and in most cases, the intensity of such flood. Unfortunately, warnings by the agencies have often been ignored by both the people and state governments and their agencies. This year, the government has said not less than 121 local government areas across 28 states are at highly probable risk of heavy flooding, while another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will experience some level of flooding.

Flooding is categorised into river flooding, coastal flooding as well as flash and urban flooding occasioned by poor drainages, blocked drainages and poor adherence to town planning regulations.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) said flooding accounts for 15% of all natural disaster related deaths across the globe.

Floods have since become annual phenomena not only in flood plains, but also in urban and semi-urban areas. Experts link urban flooding to inadequacies of drainage channels that have become too small to contain excess runoff, the use of river channels as waste repositories thus clogging the channels, poor compliance with or non-existence of land use zoning/building codes, poor waste management practices, and removal of vegetation that create resistance and minimise flood impact. Coastal areas of Nigeria are not spared from flooding as they may be worst hit by flood this year. Interestingly, more states in Nigeria are increasingly suffering from annual flooding due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Unfortunately, Nigeria is located downstream of Rivers Niger and Benue, and therefore abounds with water resources that become a menace by causing flooding and flood disasters, the worst of which was experience in 2012 when hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property loss running into billions of naira including massive farm lands and crops when water was released from the a dam in Cameroon.

A close study of the predictions revealed that all the 20 local government areas in Lagos State (as against 18 in 2020) are likely to be affected with eight of them being at higher risk of heavy flooding. Apart from urban and river flooding, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Delta and Ondo states stand the risk of heavy coastal flooding. In 2020, similar predictions by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency and advice to states and local government areas to take precautionary measure to mitigate the flood fell on deaf ears in most parts of the country. The consequence was the displacement of over 2.3 million people and the death of 69 others. The outcome was also the washing away of farm lands in Kebbi and Jigawa as well as livestock and other valuables. The agency has continuously expressed concern over disregard for town planning regulations leading to people building on flood plains.

Minister for Water Resources Suleiman Adamu, who announced the 2021 prediction on behalf of the agency, said 121 local government areas in 28 states and the FCT as well as another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will likely experience high and moderate flooding in 2021. Acting on information from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, the minister also said there would be heavy coastal flooding in Rivers, Cross Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states. He stressed the need for concerted efforts to mitigate the impact of the expected flood.

He said: “So far, the flood levels will be higher than in previous years, but will not attain the levels of the 2012 devastating floods. In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 LGAs in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will fall within the moderate probable Flood Risk Areas. It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the Highly Probable Risk Areas. The states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience river flooding. These states and the number of local government likely to be affected include Abia (9), Akwa Ibom (2), Anambra (5), Bauchi (2), Bayelsa (5), Benue (3), Cross River (2), Delta (8), Ebonyi (4), Edo (1), FCT (2), Gombe (7), Imo (3), Jigawa (9), Kaduna (2), Kano (2), Kebbi (4), Kogi (9), Kwara (2), Lagos (8), Nasarawa (2), Niger (5), Ogun (3), Oyo (7), Rivers (12), Sokoto (7), Taraba (7) and Zamfara (1).”

The list of states to be affected by one form of flood or the other in 2021 show that northern and coastal states are at a greater risk of flooding this year, with some states along the River Niger and Benue are also likely to be affected. Adamu said flash and urban floods from heavy inundation were predicted to occur in some major cities, the severity of which would depend on the availability and adequacy of the drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.

He said: “The information contained in the AFO 2021 is a Clarion call to all stakeholders, policy makers, Federal, States and Local Governments, Departments and Agencies to rise and set up appropriate mechanism such as clearing the waterways and flood paths as well as maintaining proper water disposal management practices to curtail the ravages of the impending flood and threats of COVID-19. The year 2012 is a landmark in the annals of flood occurrence in Nigeria. It brought with it massive destruction of lives, property and critical national infrastructure. The need arose therefore, to put in place a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront the menace of this disaster of flooding, hence the coming into being of APO in the year 2013. The 2021 Annual Flood Outlook built on the successes of the previous eight (8) years forecasts by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency. The outcomes of these forecasts have been the increased awareness by the citizenry with respect to measures that need to be taken before, during and after floods. This has culminated in the progressive reduction in the severity of flood and its harmful effects on lives and property. The timeliness in the release of these forecasts is quite commendable and deserving of every possible support by all of us.”

He believed that man’s interaction with natural process has been both helpful and harmful to some degree, adding that the negative impact of man’s activities can be observed in the heightened climate change being experienced globally by way of rising temperatures, intensified rainfall, more destructive storms and floods. He maintained that the annual prediction by the agency is designed to create awareness of the inherent dangers of flooding and to inform people about locations that are prone to Flood risk at a particular time and encourage them to take appropriate actions.

Drawing attention to the 2020 experience, the minister said: “The year 2020 saw the devastating impact of extreme flood across the country with practically every state of the federation affected in one way or the other. The flood affected 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 349 Local Government Areas (LGAs) within the 36 States were affected and over 2,353,647 people were displaced with a record of 69 deaths. Kebbi and Jigawa States were worst hit with regards to agricultural lands and houses destroyed. Apart from the physical damages, other indirect losses are often overlooked. These indirect and intangible impacts are generally associated with disruption to normal life as well as long term health issues and stress-related illnesses. We must recognise that extreme weather and flooding extents do happen and that we need to be well equipped to respond to them. I am confident that our communities, infrastructure and businesses will be better protected if due attention is given to the information contained in this 9th edition of the Annual Flood Outlook.”

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs. Didi Walson-Jack, said: “The overall objective of this event is to sensitise the nation (i.e planners, decision and policy makers, farmers, stakeholders) and the general public towards embarking on preventive measures to improve on safety and reduce potential damages to lives and property from predicted flood events.”

She said the event was expected to provide ample opportunity for enlightenment campaigns in the media for better Preparedness on flood mitigation, control and management in flood risks locations across the country. She maintained that the accuracy of the predictions over the years have been fairly high and reliable, stressing however that “the focus is rather on prevention and mitigation of possible flood disasters by increasing the awareness of the populace and prompting them to take appropriate preventive, adaptive and mitigative measures”.

The Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd), stressed the need to strengthen multi-agency approach to disaster risk reduction in the country.

Mohammed said: “To enhance flood forecasting and management in Nigeria, NEMA is currently supporting NIHSA in establishing three Automatic Weather Observation Stations which are at various stages of installation located in Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti and Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. These stations will be used not only for hydrological predictions but also to train students in the field of Geography, Engineering, Agriculture, meteorology, climate change and other sciences”. He said further that “one of the lessons learnt during the 2020 flood after action review meeting is the need for proper utilization of our dams in the country. When dams meant for irrigation purpose are used for dry season agriculture, they acquire more capacities to hold more water in the rainy season. In addition, a timely controlled release of water from dams will reduce panic release of water during rainy season that can lead to further flooding.”

The Director-General of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze said government at all levels in the country must take necessary steps to avert a possible disastrous effect of flood in 2021. Nze said as the rains begin to set in, the country was gradually inching towards the peak of rainy season with its attendant flood incidents. He said Nigeria’s geographical location downstream of all the countries in the Niger Basin places it at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollution from all countries upstream, adding that this explain why persistent flooding has become an annual event since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster.

He argued that the annual flood forecast was to enable states and local government as well as individuals take concrete steps now to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past few years including clearing of blocked drainages and canals, removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinth and floats on water channels. People living along water ways as well as those having socio-economic activities in such areas should be encouraged to relocate o safer areas before the peak of rains, while there should also be an improved system for flood monitoring, flood forecasting and early warnings. He stressed that states must intensify soil conservation measuring techniques on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and encourage ecosystem protection, while also enhancing the enforcement of town planning code to allow for the construction of houses and drainage structures.

He said further that while it was not possible to eradicate flooding, efforts should be made to either reduce or minimise it, adding that state governments must educate their people, insisting that states must make efforts to avoid a repeat of the incidences of 2020 which saw over 450,000 hectare of rice plantation being washed away in Kebbi state alone as a result of flooding. Nzeh lamented that while the agency has continued to give early warning signs, many states in the country have failed to listen to the recommendations of the agency, adding that at the moment, Jigawa state has set up a committee that is working to reduce incidences of flooding in the state in line with recommendations from the agency.

The NIHSA’s Director of Hydrogeophysics, Stephen Margima Jabo, said flooding has become a global phenomenon that has increased in frequency over the years. According to him, the effective management of flood risk should be a collective responsibility of all stakeholders from the federal, state, and local to individual levels, adding that the existing synergy between Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, stakeholders and other collaborative agencies involved in flood management and disaster issues should be further strengthened. He said government at all level should also put in place measures for better town planning and effective land use zoning, effective flood disaster management in the changing environment, improved biodiversity and ecosystem management for the enhancement of rapid and sustainable development in the country. States, he said should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers particularly, where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood waters will not be lost to the sea.

The agency said among others that “stakeholders in the water sector should carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas by the removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers to improve their conveyance capacities and from dams, lakes and reservoirs to increase their storage capacities for the containment of the incoming floodwaters; there is need for construction of weirs, small reservoirs on tributary, streams and rivers for conservation of flood water to be used during the dry season thereby preventing desert encroachment, increasing irrigation food crop production, improvement of grassland areas, nomadic settlement, peace and sustainable development by relevant government agencies; intensification of soil conservation measuring technics on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and increase ecosystem protection among others; enforcement of Town Planning Codes in the country to allow for the appropriate construction of houses, and drainage structures and constantly freeing the waterways from obstructions and provision of adequate refuse dumping facilities by relevant authorities.”","Tue, 11 May 2021 00:15:10 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Flood-1.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'happen', 'local', 'flood', 'waiting', 'states', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'country', 'state', 'areas']", ,flood

September 12, 2020, around 8:00pm, residents of Alapere area of Lagos State, raised alarm as another flooding tragedy struck. Two yet-to-be-identified children were swept away as people battled flood after a heavy rainfall that lasted for hours and led to destruction of properties.

This is just one of the horrific, heart-wrenching experiences Nigerians go through, following havoc wreaked by floods every year. Yet nothing is done by stakeholders to ameliorate the disaster.

Nigeria with a population of over 200 million people, faces numerous natural disasters, with flooding being the most common. Most states in the country are increasingly suffering from annual flooding during the rainy seasons. However unlike some natural disasters, rainfall flooding can be controlled with proper planning and the provision of necessary infrastructure.

Flooding in Nigeria is usually caused by climate change, river overflowing, dam opening, current poor urban planning practices, poor drainage systems that can’t cope and so on. In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the neighboring states.

Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals. The immediate impact of it include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases. These were seen recurring this year, in various states of the federation.

Havoc in Some States

In a report on October last year, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods since September have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across 22 states in Nigeria. Furthermore, around 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people were reported to be displaced.

According to the Red Cross, the overflowing Benue and Niger rivers caused severe floods in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara States from October 6, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. At least 57 people died, 473 were injured and 22,357 displaced. Flooding was also reported in southern parts of the country, Bayelsa, Anambra, Rivers and Delta States, were affected and fatalities reported.

One of the most devastating impact of floods was seen in Kebbi State. The flood swept away villages and peoples, displacing families and destroyed about 90 per cent of crops, putting the country’s food security at risk. Over 30 lives were lost, hundreds of houses destroyed and thousands of residents displaced by the devastating flood that sacked communities in the state.

The losses incurred by the farmers, particularly rice farmers in Kebbi State were colossal and immeasurable , they run into billions of naira . Thousands of hectares of fadama rice farms in the state were affected by the flood. Rice farms , other agricultural crops, livestock and even communities were not spared by the raging floods.

Chairman of the State Emergency Management Authority (KSEMA), Alhaji Sani Dododo, revealed that five different bridges had been washed away across the state.

The Birnin-Kebbi-Makera-Kangiwa road, an international highway, which runs from the state capital to Niger Republic, is at the risk of caving in at Duku. Some of the minor bridges and culverts along the highway are already caving in, following erosion caused by rising water overflowing the nearby River Rima.

Also, the Bagudo-Tuga-Kaoje route, which leads to Benin Republic border, including the Tuga Bridge, is also submerged, cutting border communities. Dododo, who confirmed the number of deaths recorded so far, said 10 people died in a boat that capsized at Ihiru in Jega Local Government.

“Only eight bodies have so far been recovered; a family of six – father, mother and children were wiped away in Arewa council area. We recorded one death in Yauri, among others. The numbers may increase, since we are experiencing rainfall daily. In Bagudo council area is the worst hit by the flooding, as it was learnt that 98 per cent of the villages were affected.

In Iwaro Oka community of Akoko South West Local Government area, Ondo State

a middle-aged man was swept away by flood. Sources said the motorcycle of the farmer, identified as Akede, was seen inside the river very close to a popular filling station, which made people aware that the farmer was missing. Family members were thrown into mourning when all efforts to find him proved abortive. His body was later recovered in a river very close to St Patrick’s College, Iwaro Oka.

In Lokoja, Kogi State, the road linking Kogi East and Eastern Nigeria to the state capital was flooded for days as canoe and boats were employed to navigate the roads which is meant for cars and other road users.

In Niger State, officials of the state government visited communities submerged by flood to ascertain the extent of damage and to enable government render assistance to victims.

In Kano State, the Kano Emergency Management Agency confirmed four persons killed and over 5,200 houses destroyed due to flooding in Rogo and Danbatta Local Government Areas of the state. He disclosed that two persons lost their lives and 200 houses destroyed in Rogo, while two other persons and over 5,000 houses were destroyed by flood in Danbatta.

Also the South-south and South-east were wreaked by flood havoc. South-south states like Delta had over 150 houses submerged by flood. In South-east, Anambra for instance, over 5,000 persons have been displaced by flood that submerged houses, schools and churches in the Ogbaru Local Government Area. The Chairman of the council, Arinze Awaogu, said about 1,000 of the displaced persons were being catered for at Internally Displaced Persons’ camps in the area, while many others trapped in their communities needed evacuation.

He said, ”Over 5,000 families have been displaced, while churches, schools and many residential houses have been submerged by flood, with farm crops destroyed and displaced persons seeking refuge in Onitsha and surrounding communities. At the moment, we are housing over 1,000 IDPs; we have over 5,000 persons who have been displaced; some are taking refuge in the residences of their relatives, who live upland, including Onitsha. We need the Federal Government’s assistance in the areas of donation of food items, non-food items, medical supplies, establishment of sick bays and sending enough medical personnel to help in handling the situation; our fear now is that of a possible outbreak of epidemic.”

Earlier in the year, heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

In Abuja, four Area Councils, Bwari, Gwagwalada, Abaji and Kwali which are prone to flood were affected by the disaster with Gwagwala being the worst hit in July as eight lives were lost, over 100 houses submerged and properties destroyed. On July 25, after a heavy downpour which lasted for hours, five residents were swept away and several houses and cars destroyed in Gwagwalada, Dawaki, Giri and Zuba where the flood cut the bridge linking Ikwa, Yimi and other villages.

The incidence was confirmed by the Director General of FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Idris Abbas who had said there was a building collapse in Dawaki as a result of the flood. Gwagwalada is flooded from Giri. A family of five were flooded at Giri.

“We got one body and still searching for four. We rescued six people and are in the hospital. The flood has damaged a lot of houses and property, especially at Gwagwalada. The residents are still saying some are missing but they cannot give us the identities of such persons who they claim to be missing. People should be careful when it is raining. They should not drive on water. They should not build on flood plain. They must respect the master plan of FCT and ensure that all drainages are clean. What happened in Giri-Gota was because people built on flood plain”, he said

Federal Lawmakers Laments

Back in September, the Kebbi State Caucus in the House of Representatives while commiserating with the government and people of the state on the recent flood disaster that ravaged the entire state, said the disaster is a major setback to the federal government effort to boost local rice production as part of measures to end rice importation.

The Chairman, Hon. Muhammad Jega, representing Gwandu/Aliero/Jega federal constituency, lamented that the disaster could not have come at a worse time for the farmers who were looking forward to a bumper harvest this year to reduce the rising cost of food items.

The lawmaker, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari and the state Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, for the prompt response to reduce the hardship caused by the flood, also urged them to as a matter of urgency send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state.

Jega further urged the federal government to commission a study with the aim of providing a lasting solution to the perennial flood disaster in the state.

According to him, “The flood is a serious setback towards addressing food security in the country; the government, therefore, needs to address the shortfall of the food supply chain to reduce the hardship and cost of food items in the market, and also address the severe environmental degradation caused by the flood. This may include adequate and early preparation for dry-season farming and reconstruction of major infrastructures affected in the state.

‘’The estimated cost of the disaster is over N10 billion across the state. We call on the federal government as a matter of urgency to send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state, as early preparation for dry season farming should commence in earnest with provision of seedlings, fertilizer and other inputs to be made available to the farmers in good time.’’

Also, a member of the House of Representatives, representing Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency of Delta State, Hon. Ossai Nicholas Ossai, decried the submerging of over 150 houses in Delta State, by devastating floods.

He said that since past two weeks, the Ndokwa East Communities of Delta State have been bedeviled by constant and frightening heavy downpour, being accompanied by excessive flooding and erosion, that is seriously and presently wreaking havoc in the Communities.

According to him, the affected communities are; Ossissa, Onyah, Ase, Ushie, Ibedeni; Asagba, Aballa-Uno, Agballa-Obodo, AgballaOshimili, Uchi, Okpai, Onuaboh, Inyi, Benekuku, Aboh, Onyah, Asaba-Ase, Ibrede, Ashaka, Afor, Abalagáda, Umuolu, Igbuku, Obettim, Obodo-Okolafa, Iyadama,0nuogboko, UtagbaOgbe, Utagba-Uno, Ogume, Onitsha-Ukwuani, Akarri, Umuolu, just to mention a few”.

He said he was disturbed that “schools, farmlands, health centres, places of worship have seriously been affected and over 150 households has been rendered homeless particularly children and women and more is still being affected daily. About 90per cent of the ommunities in the entire Ndokwa East Local Government Area has been submerged,and worse still is the deplorable economic conditions of the peasant farmers in these agrarian communities”.

He observed that these communities are often prone to serious environmental disaster as a result of vulnerability of constant coastal flooding and erosion from the River Niger”.

The legislator, pleaded with the Federal Governnment, to Direct the Ecological Fund office to conduct an environmental survey with a view to addressing the excessive flooding in these Ndokwa Communities and urge the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to urgently provide relief materials for the Hood victims in accordance with section 6 of NEMA Act.

NIHSA Flood Alerts

In February, the Director General of Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze, alerted the government, stakeholders and all citizens to use this period of dry season to prepare ahead for 2021 flooding.

Nze lamented that Nigeria currently doesn’t have enough dams, saying more dams would help to mitigate floods.

He explained that with the increasing global population and the expanding activities of man, flooding would continue to persist, hence the need to control human activities, environmental adjustment and purposefully adopting actions in certain areas that would make adjustment possible.

According to him, “Flooding problem is a global environmental issue which is faced by many countries worldwide, particularly in areas close to low lying terrains and river valleys. Over the past years, there have been increasing concerns that human actions and natural catastrophes have been adversely impacting the environment, posing serious ecological and environmental hazards.

“Though flood is a natural environmental phenomenon, it can be greatly accelerated by human-induced activities as it is the case worldwide. Some floods may result in major disasters involving structural and erosion damages, disruption of socio-economic activities, loss of lives and properties, displacement of people, destruction of agricultural land and contamination of water and environment in general.”

The director general said this is the appropriate time to construct drainages where they are necessary (but not provided), dredge river channels, clear blocked gutters and drainages, and pull down structures that are within the floodplains and flood paths.

“There is a reasonable time to do that before the rains set in. According to the 2020 Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public recently by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), February 24 and June 22 are the predicted onset of rainfall in the South-south and Northern states respectively, while the respective predicted cessation dates are December 28th and September 26th. This implies that Nigeria is likely to experience longer period of rainy season in 2020 compared to year 2019,” he added.

Again, in September, the agency warned members of the public to expect more floods in the months of September and October.

Nze, gave the warning at a press briefing in Abuja, saying that the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country.

Nze explained that any release of excess water from the dams in countries upstream Rivers Niger and Benue this year would have more negative impacts on Nigeria, which is located downstream of countries in the Niger Basin.

He identified the highly vulnerable states as Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa.

He said that the flood that ravaged Kebbi State just about a week ago left so many damages and noted that the current flooding situation called for vigilance on the part of all the stakeholders.

The director general called the states and local governments as well as multi-national companies and public-spirited individuals to join hands to save the country from the consequences of “twin pandemic” (COVID-19 and flood) in the year 2020.

Nze warned: ‘’The rains are finally here. The volume of river flows on our river is surging and river channels could no longer accommodate significant runoff as floodplains, which traditionally serve the alluvial plains and are rich in agricultural productivity, lost its retention capacity to give way to flooding of adjacent lands.

“Farmlands and crop yields are being lost to furry of floodwaters, livestock and ecosystem species are diminishing while hope for livelihood hang in the balance due to monumental economic losses.

‘’As a matter of fact, all the states of the federation have suffered several degrees of flooding since June 2020. The danger is not yet over. Information received from the regional Niger Basin Authority (NBA) by NIHSA, has it that as at 7.30am today September 10, 2020, the River Niger flood level in Niamey, Niger Republic, attained an unprecedented level of 7.02m (702cm). This is a far cry from the value of 6.60m which I reported in my last press briefing of August 25, 2020.

“Noting that the Red Alert Warning Zone in Niamey is 6.20m and above, the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country, Nigeria, which is at the Lower portion of Niger Basin within this month of September and October.’

‘’Based on the report of the expected flood coming down from Niamey and the projected contributions by the inland rivers, both Kainji and Jebbo Dams built on River Niger have continued to spill water downstream. The Shiroro Dam on River Koduno, with reservoir level at 381.48m as at 9.00am today, has been maintaining a regulated spilling into the River Niger. The effect of all these is that the communities in the states adjoining River Niger will continue to be highly inundated by River Flooding as is being witnessed in the recent time.”

Recently, The DG of NIHSA, briefing the press on March 24, 2021, again advised the three tiers of government and citizens across the country to prepare against impending devastating floods in 2021.

Nze, who gave the advice at a press conference in Abuja, said this was because Nigeria was at the receiving end of disastrous floods among the nine countries of the River Niger Basin.

He said, “There is still time for states/LGAs (Local Government Areas) and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

“As the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin which covers nine countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season with its attendant flood incidents.

He also advised Nigerians residing at waterways to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains, just as warned that Nigerians have about three months to prepare against the disastrous effects of flood.

He explained that the country’s geographical location is downstream of all the countries in the Basin, making it to be at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollutions from all the countries upstream.

The DG lamented that relevant authorities are frustrating the effort of the Federal Government by neglecting the predictions, as could be seen in the results of last year’s damages.

Nze while urging the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past years, noted that there is still time for stakeholders to take steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

Expectations from Stakeholders

In the last few months, President Muhammadu Buhari has been sending solidarity messages to some states affected by flood disasters with promises of federal aid. The president authorised needed assistance to 12 states worst affected by the seasonal rains. The states are: Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Edo, Anambra, Delta, Kano, Jigawa, Rivers, Bayelsa and Adamawa.

However, flooding in various state has become a recurring decimal for decades, all tiers of government are expected to put all hands on deck and come up with a permanent solution. Flood is a natural disaster, but lack of preparedness is a man-made disaster.

As Nigeria is months away till the next rainy season, stakeholders have ample time to do the needful and heed to flood warnings by various monitoring agencies in order to avert another impending tragedy.

One of the main strategies as stated by NIHSA is that, the 36 States and the FCT authority should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using the flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood water will not be lost to the sea to become saline water.

The agency is also urging state governments to pull down structures built on flood plains and expand the drainages for easy flow of water as one of the strategies mapped out.

According to them, the foodstuff, meant for distribution to the vulnerable, is to cushion the ravaging hardship in the region. Flagging off the exercise in Yola, Adamawa State, one of the associates, Dahiru Hammadikko, said the gesture was courtesy of Tinubu’s associates in the 19 northern states.

He said over 10,000 households in the 21 local councils of Adamawa were targeted to benefit. He lamented that Nigerians were facing hardship, which informed the group’s move to ameliorate the suffering of Nigerians, irrespective of religious and political affiliations.

The national coordinator of the Tinubu support group said: “The gesture is to honour the national leader of APC, due to his philanthropic disposition, which is why the rice was branded with his image.”

He described Tinubu as “a detribalised Nigerian, in whom the Northern region relies” as the unifying factor.

“Today, we are flagging off the distribution of 5kg of rice to Nigerians from the northern region. We are targeting one million beneficiaries in the 19 northern states and the FCT.

“But here in Adamawa we are giving over 10,000 people,” he said.

10,10,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Many states not taking precautions against floods –NIHSA boss - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/many-states-not-taking-precautions-against-floods-nihsa-boss/,"The Director-General, Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, Mr Clement Nze, tells OKECHUKWU NNODIM that the devastation caused by floods in many states is as a result of the failure of the governments to adhere to warnings

What are the types of flooding being experienced in Nigeria?

There are three major types of flooding that we experience in Nigeria. The first one is river flooding, which is not just from rivers that are within Nigeria but from River Niger and River Benue, and these are trans-boundary waters. There is also urban/flash flooding, and these are caused by poor drainage systems or even non-existing drainage systems in many major cities in Nigeria. Lastly is coastal or tidal flooding for states that are within coastal areas such as Ondo, Lagos, Bayelsa and Rivers.

Now, it is important to state that our Annual Flood Outlook is a scientific prediction done using historical data physically collected in the field, some of them over 40 to 50 years ago. So, we use it to project and see what is going to happen tomorrow. And from what we have seen using international standards to predict, we have said that not less than 121 Local Government Areas in Nigeria, in 27 states actually, will be affected by flooding in the course of the year. Also, about 302 LGAs will experience different magnitudes of flooding. And about 351 LGAs may have a lesser severity of flooding. But like I said, it is a prediction, which we monitor closely by weekly publications. We are talking about the issue of climate change and so what you see today may not be what will happen tomorrow. So, as a result of that, we will be updating the media, states and others on what they are likely to observe in the course of the year.

How are you interfacing with the states with respect to predictions in the AFOs?

We will be doing sensitisation programmes and will downscale it to the states. We will tell the governors that these are the locations in your state that are likely to be affected in the course of the year 2021. We informed the public through the press some months ago, as preparatory to the unveiling of the 2021 AFO. And by protocol, it is the Minister of Water Resources who interfaces with the governors on behalf of the agency. Last year, for instance, the minister sent letters to each of the state governors in Nigeria and detailed the states that would be affected by flooding in that year. But what they did with it is another cup of tea.

Also, we go through other systems in the states such as their emergency management agencies, water resources and environment ministries. We interface with them directly, but what they do with our information is another issue.

Are you satisfied with what states are doing about the recommendations in the AFOs?

Frankly speaking, they are not doing as much as we expect from them, otherwise, the level of devastation that happens year in year out could have been avoided or eliminated. We’ve been telling the state governors that the tempo of political activities they embark upon during election periods should be deployed against activities that encourage flooding. Go to the grassroots, you have councillors in LGAs. They should be able to cascade this information and domesticate it in their own locations. But often time, it doesn’t happen. However, when a disaster occurs, they are quick to complain and cry out to high heavens and maybe get some support from the humanitarian ministry. But in terms of ameliorating the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.

I recall in 2016/2017, I engaged some state emergency management agencies one-on-one and we were told not to come to tell them what will happen in the course of the year except we are coming with relief materials. But we told them that that was not our jurisdiction. Ours is to inform you about what is likely to happen in your own state. If it happens, you have the National Emergency Management Agency that can support you, not NIHSA.

What are states likely going to face by failing to abide by the recommendations in the AFO?

Going by the law establishing the agency, the agency’s powers begin and stop at predicting and releasing the message. We don’t enforce anything. Each state has its own regulatory body, such as the urban planning department and emergency management agencies. They also have environmental laws and ministries that are supposed to be the regulators to ensure that the dictates of our prediction are followed. I may then say that NEMA could now insist by saying, ‘Since you failed to do the needful, don’t run to us for relief materials.’ This is because, if you recall, when the flood was very severe in 2012, the Federal Government gave out a lot of money. Some states got about N4bn to N5bn, depending on the degree of devastation.

Maybe such decisions could be taken by NEMA so as to encourage states that are doing well in terms of adhering to the predictions to ensure that lives and property are not lost. We, as an agency, can’t enforce anything; we can’t force any governor to do the needful. But the governors on their own should in the spirit of humanity protect and help those who voted them into power.

Are you collaborating with sister agencies on climate issues?

In fact, our relationship with one of them, NiMet (Nigeria Meteorological Services Agency) is very superb and cordial. First of all, at the international level, the meteorological agency is Nigeria’s permanent representative with the World Meteorological Organisation, and that falls on whoever is the Director-General. Also, whosoever heads the hydrological agency in any nation is an adviser to that permanent representative. So, in that wise, there is a very good collaboration between NIHSA and NiMet; for instance, we requested rainfall data from NiMet. And this was one of the major inputs in the model to use for predictions. They provide us those data at no cost. And once they are releasing their own predictions, such as the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction, which is now called Seasonal Climate Prediction, they inform NIHSA.

So, we collaborate a lot; they provide us with data that help us to do our prediction alongside other river measurements that we do by ourselves. We use so much data – about 12 of them, but the rainfall data are among the major data.

What are some of the recommendations in the 2021 AFO, and what advice do you have for farmers?

Farmers should heed our predictions. They should also abide by our warnings. Those who farm within the river banks should ensure that their crops have early maturity. This is to ensure that before the onset of the rainy season or flooding, the crops would have matured and be harvested. Flooding doesn’t come with the rains immediately, rather it is when the soil is saturated and its moisture content becomes high that flooding will begin to take place. So, if there is a way they can be helped to plant crops that can mature easily, it should be done, so that before the flooding starts they can harvest. And after the flooding, heavy nutrients are now brought within the flood plain, which can lead to enhanced yields when the farming starts again.

The Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, for instance, once mentioned that because of the heavy nutrients that the floods brought, they were able to regain what they lost in one of the farming seasons. That governor is very active, he works with us and comes from time to time to ask what could be done to improve farming activities in his state.

What are some of the things states should be doing now, considering the looming flood?

Like I said in our press briefing in March, there is still time for states, LGAs and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021. We made it clear at the briefing that as the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin, which covers nine countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season, with its attendant flood incidents. Nigeria’s geographical location, downstream of all the countries in this basin, places it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollution from all the countries upstream.

We know that the persistent flooding and flood disasters have become an annual event in Nigeria since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster in recent history. In 2012, hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property losses running into trillions of naira.

It is in the light of the above that NIHSA wishes to urge the states and the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly menace of flooding in the past years. We recommend that the three tiers of government should consider clearing drainage systems and canals and also embark on projects for improving hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows. They should carry out the removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinths and floats on water channels and on all avenues for river runoffs. We also encourage people living along the waterways and those having socio-economic activities on flood plains to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains.

Description of the disaster

On 6 October 2020, flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of the torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto, and Zamfara state (amongst other states) affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin, which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas. Table 1 illustrates the flood impacts of the worst flood affected states.

The situation in Kebbi – the country's biggest rice-producing state – is especially dire, as vast farmlands are completely submerged due to the most recent rains. Meanwhile in Jigawa state, a total of 18 out of 27 Local Government Areas (LGA)s have been affected, with Gwaram, Birnin Kudu, Kirikasamma, and Gumel as the worst hit. Wide swaths of farmlands have been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of Naira. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), with the support from the Federal Government, is scaling efforts to assist flood victims by providing emergency needs. So far, the agency has distributed 30 canoes to inundated communities, as well as materials to build embankments to control the floods.

Kwara State is also concerning as more than 5,000 households have been affected. The government estimates damage worth N10bn have been incurred. At least three lives in Ilorin are believed to have been lost. Scores of houses also had their roofs blown off by the raging storm that accompanied the heavy rains in the Ilorin metropolis while electricity poles were destroyed in Taiwo and Odota areas of the state capital. Telecommunication masts and building walls were also damaged in Olonkonla, Bobonkiri, Egba-Akota, Aberi, Akuji and Idiope, all in Ita-Ogunbo area, Alanamu Ward in Ilorin West Local Government Area, the worst hit.

Since September to date, torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across Nigeria. Some 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people are reported to be displaced. Most of the those affected are children. Wide swaths of farmlands have also been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of naira. These floods have so far impacted 22 states in the country’s six geo-political zones: North West (4 state), North Central (4 states), North East (4 state), South East (4 states), South-South (3 states) and South West (3 state). This earlier flooding had weakened Nigeria’s water supply and road infrastructure, killing dozens and leading to disease outbreaks.

A government team began the delivery of food palliatives to the Kwara North Senatorial District, beginning with Jebba town in Moro Local Government Area and Lafiagi in Edu Local Government Area. Over 15,000 households across 357 communities of the state are estimated to have been affected by the ugly incidents that also destroyed farmlands and human dwellings worth billions of naira. In the wake of the floods, over 100,000 hectares of rice, maize and millet farms in Kpata-Gbaradogi, fishing and agrarian settlement in Pategi LGA were destroyed. About 100 residential buildings were also submerged while 1,500 people were rendered homeless.

The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, warned flood-prone states to prepare for flood emergency, rescue and rehabilitation. According to the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rainy season is expected to continue until December 28th in the southern parts of the country. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), predicted that at least 102 LGAs in 28 states fall within the highly probable flood risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 states of the Federation, including FCT, fall within the moderately probable flood risks areas.","Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540152-Nigeria%20Floods%20-%20Emergency%20Plan%20of%20Action%20%28EPoA%29%20DREF%20n%C2%B0%20MDRNG030.png?itok=T4e01g_v,"['n', 'dref', 'affected', 'north', 'epoa', 'flood', 'local', 'floods', 'states', 'action', 'area', 'farmlands', 'plan', 'nigeria', 'state', 'mdrng030', 'areas', 'emergency']", ,none
14,14,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Nigeria Loses a Quarter of Rice Production to Floods - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/nigeria-loses-quarter-rice-production-floods,"ARGUNGU - Farmers in northern Nigeria have lost more than two million tons of rice, a quarter of the country's projected harvest, due to flooding. Despite the loss, Nigeria is so far upholding a year-long ban on land-based imports of rice to crack down on smuggling and boost local production.

Ibrahim Adullahi is looking at what remains of his 350-hectare rice farm in Nigeria’s Kebbi state.

Abdullahi was expecting a harvest of 600 tons of rice, but weeks of severe flooding means he will be lucky to get 100.

“Since when I started farming, I have never experienced intensive cultivation of rice like now, because a lot of people are into the rice farming. But unfortunately, we experienced this intensive flooding that we are still experiencing now, and farmers are now counting losses because 90 percent of our farmers have lost what they have cultivated,” he said.

Nigeria’s biggest rice producing state, Kebbi, had projected 2.5 million tons this year.

But heavy September rains washed away two million tons. Local rice miller Mohammad Anuana said this could cause a further jump in the price of the grain.

“If rain has already washed away all the farm product, you know the goods will be rising up (in price) because the little one they have on ground - they will make sure they recover (the value of) the one that the water moves away. And, so they’ll double the price,” he said.

With Africa’s largest population, Nigeria annually imports billions of dollars of rice and wheat. But the country hopes to become self-sufficient.

Last year, the government banned land-based rice imports to crack down on smuggling and boost local rice production.

Despite the lost rice, the Nigerian officials say the ban will remain in place.

Chairman of the All Farmers Association in Nigeria John Wuyep said affected farmers will be compensated.

""The government and even the financial institutions have a machinery in force. So many who have lost now are already preparing for the dry season farming,” he said.

Nigeria’s farmers association says better groundwork is needed to prevent flooding and have a steady water supply during the dry season.

Flood reduction would also help save homes and the displacement of thousands of Nigerians from overflowing rivers.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2020-09/vlcsnap-2020-09-30-12h41m36s655.png,"['farmers', 'production', 'lost', 'flooding', 'local', 'quarter', 'price', 'tons', 'floods', 'million', 'nigeria', 'imports', 'loses', 'rice']", ,flood

Heavy rains have caused extensive flooding in Chad, Niger and Nigeria since the onset of rainy seasons in June. Chad’s rainy season, expected to last until October, is the heaviest in the past 30 years (OCHA 25/08/2020). Flooding in Niger has affected almost twice the estimated population. Flooding in Nigeria is less widespread than in 2019, but is still significant (NIHSA 06/2020; OCHA 21/07/2020).

Almost 60% of all affected people and over half of reported deaths from the three countries are in Niger, the country most affected by floods (UNHCR 15/09/2020). Flooding has affected more than 516,000 people across all eight regions, and resulted in at least 71 deaths (UNHCR 17/09/2020; OCHA 24/09/2020). Nigeria is at risk of crossborder flooding, given it is downstream from other flood-affected countries along the Niger River basin, including Niger (HNO 12/2019).

In all three countries, heavy rainfall and flash floods have resulted in the widespread destruction of shelters, driving displacement. Emergency shelters are overcrowded and unsanitary, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection and the spread of water-borne diseases (IOM 1/09/2020; OCHA 07/09/2020).

The Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region complicates flood relief efforts and increases protection concerns for highly vulnerable displaced populations in all three countries. The situation is most severe in northeast Nigeria, where over 2.7 million people are displaced and 10.6 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, especially food, shelter and WASH (OCHA 14/09/2020; UNHCR 31/07/2020). Additionally, cross-border violence from Mali affects northwest Niger and insecurity caused by banditry poses further risks to flood-affected populations in northwest Nigeria.","Wed, 07 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1538484-20201006_acaps_briefing_note_flooding_in_chad_niger_nigeria_.png?itok=WwqCv9xM,"['ocha', 'affected', 'chad', 'flooding', 'briefing', 'unhcr', 'shelters', '2020', 'countries', 'note', 'nigeria', 'widespread', 'risk', 'niger', '30', 'acaps']", ,flood

But during the rainy seasons, the city's streets can become almost impassable. Home to more than 24 million, Lagos is Nigeria's economic powerhouse, making it a destination for people seeking new opportunities. But that rapid growth creates pressure on the streets, and the environment.

The streets are often flooded, in part due to the dysfunctional disposal of the 6,000-10,000 tonnes of rubbish generated daily in the city. After a downpour, rubbish piles up in open gutters and makes moving around the streets difficult. “I worry when it rains, especially when it is heavy,” says Lagos resident Stephanie Erigha. ""It makes me anxious."" On one occasion when taking a taxi through a waterlogging-prone part of the city, she recalls the water gushing right into the back seat next to her.

While the overall climate in Lagos is expected to see less rainfall overall with climate change, the intensity of rain is expected to increase, bringing with it greater risk of flooding. Meanwhile, the low-lying city is also particularly vulnerable to water from another source: rising seas. If global warming exceeds 2C, the city is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100, according to research led by marine physicist Svetlana Jevrejeva, of the UK's National Oceanography Centre.

How, in the face of flooding, blocked streets and rising waters, is Africa's most populous city adapting?

Floating architecture

There is one part of Lagos that has extensive experience of dealing with high water. Much of the Makoko neighbourhood is not built on land, but rather sits on stilts above the waterline. Makoko, known as the ""Venice of Africa"", is a labyrinthine slum built on stilts and navigated by canoe. The slum has little access to electricity or clean sanitation, but it has also been home to innovations like the Makoko Floating School, a structure resting on recycled empty plastic barrels for buoyancy. The school's pyramid shape helped lower its centre of gravity and so increase its stability, while also being an ideal roof shape for shedding heavy rains.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/live/624x351/p094q1j4.jpg,"['afloat', 'water', 'rubbish', 'streets', 'slum', 'africas', 'staying', 'rising', 'lagos', 'stilts', 'shape', 'largest', 'city', 'makoko']", ,flood

The Edo State government said it has appointed a contractor for the flood control project at Ughoha community in Esan South Local Government Area of the state, signalling the commencement of the project.

The project coordinator, Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP), Tom Obaseki, made this known on Wednesday at Ugboha, while introducing the project contractor to the community.

Mr Obaseki assured the people that the best contractor was selected to handle the project because of the importance of the community to the state.

“Ugboha is very important to us and we thank the community for producing great men that have made so many positive contributions to the development of Edo State.

“We made sure that in the process of recruiting a contractor for the job, we went for the best of the best,” he stated.

Mr Obaseki solicited the support of the traditional head of Ugboha and members of the community for the smooth implementation of the project.

“We want to solicit the support of your highness and the entire people of the kingdom so that there will not be hitches down the line.

“Every time we waste or lose cannot be recovered. So, we want to seek your support in providing the enabling environment and security for the contractor,” he said.

The traditional head of Ugboha, Ukato Steven II, assured that the community would provide a conducive environment for the successful and timely delivery of the project.

Outrage as IDPs camps overflows with displaced residence



Governor raises the alarm as terrorists hoist flag in Kaore community

Affected communities speak out: “We don’t want Govt food or money but adequate security to enable us to return home

CAN goes spiritual; declares 3-day fast

By Wole Mosadomi

Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

“I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

“We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.”

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists’ presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. “Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don’t need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,” he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: “The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.”

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God’s intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

Speaking when the 2021 flood outlook was presented in Abuja, Nze said states have maintained a carefree attitude towards flood warnings over the years.

“Last year, the minister sent a letter to all the state governors in Nigeria and informed them in detail of what to expect, yet not too many states are doing something about it,” he said.

Nze urged state governors to use the same energy for political activities when tackling environmental challenges such as flooding.

He said: “It could be avoided or eliminated. The tempo of political activities they exhibited during the elections should be replicated in tackling this disturbing issue of flooding in the states.

“LGA councillors should be able to domesticate this information in their own locations but this doesn’t happen.

“Once the disaster occurs, they are quick to cry to high heavens, but in terms of reducing the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.”

There Is No End

BLUE NOTE

8/10

Though I’d witnessed the hypnotic magic of Tony Allen while he was drumming for his Afrobeat contemporary Fela Kuti, and had long been a fan of the rhythmatist’s work with King Sunny Ade and Ginger Baker, it wasn’t until the drummer played with Damon Albarn’s Gorillaz, then his The Good, the Bad & the Queen project, where I could speak to Allen. A casually cool drum god stuffed into a regal kingseat, Allen treated Albarn’s compositions and the rhythm section he had formed with Paul Simonon (of The Clash fame) in 2006 as but one more piece of his puzzle, a West African–styled Lego set layered with the ragged, angled tiles of R&B, funk, and jazz. He talked of taking the eccentric English music touched by dub and Afrobeat in stride, and made all that he laid his hands on a simple life pleasure—like sipping fine wine. Combine that cool complexity with an innate in-the-pocket oomph more finely regulated and metronomic than Clyde Stubblefield’s steady, burrowing groove, and Allen was magnificent—the rhythm divine personified.

Allen passed in April 2020 with a handful of compositions and demos in the planning stages for a new solo album—a soulful, personal catalog which merits greater examination—and to commemorate that passing, Blue Note drops There Is No End. Completed by its co-producers Vincent Taeger and Vincent Taurelle, with vocalists and rappers such as Sampa the Great and Danny Brown, the End’s game isn’t some grand finale or explanatory note summing up a career. Like everything else Allen was about, it’s but another piece of a greater puzzle.

That metronome’s meter, with a dub-house break and a hi-hat’s ride, turns “Stumbling Down” into something eerily atmospheric, yet sharply angled, a woozy track made whole by Sampa’s giddy rap. The same floppy dub break with tuneful jazzy brass applied doesn’t so much punctuate “Deer in Headlights” as it does stir up a smoldering psychedelic stew made weirder by Allen’s phase-shifting snare sounds and Brown’s leering voice. The Afro-pop of “Cosmosis” has the feel of being everywhere and nowhere at once, and aggressively yet.

Such aggression can easily be connected to years of warring strife, racism, insurgency, and pleas for justice in Allen’s homeland of Nigeria, and throughout a cut such as “Hurt Your Soul,” you can sense the pains of Allen’s drums, even when he’s rat-tat-tatting a snare to emulate the ring of gunshots. For every dramatic snare sound of Allen’s, there’s another tom-tom romp waiting to be beheld, even quietly and rumbling during “Très Magnifique” and its warm-winded rap courtesy Tsunami.

Though hardly or specifically hip-hop, it’s fascinating that Allen’s last full album is dedicated to the drummer’s relationship with rap, sweet or sour, and young collaborators. But, as its title signals, Tony Allen was a restless soul to go with his position as the rhythm divine personified. Savor this.","Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://floodmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tony-Allen-There-Is-No-End-600x315.jpg,"['allen', 'snare', 'rhythm', 'end', 'rap', 'note', 'tony', 'piece', 'vincent', 'soul', 'allens']", ,none

By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja

A bill seeking to amend the fire service act of 1963 and include other natural disasters as emergencies to be given urgent attention has passed for second reading in the House of Representatives.

The bill is titled “An Act to repeal the Fire Service Act Cap. F29 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and enact the Fire and Emergency Service Act 2021 to provide for additional powers for effective service delivery; and for related matters”.

The non-fire occurrences listed by the bill needing emergency rescue included flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters.

The sponsor of the bill is Rep. Adejoro Adeogun Akoko South East: South West Federal Constituency of Ondo State.

Leading the debate on the general principle of the bill at Tuesday plenary, Adeogun said that the bill when passed into law would provide stricter penalties for violation of building codes and fire regulations.

He said: “The fire service act (1963) saddled the Fire service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies. This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required.

Also read:

“This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.

“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”

According to the lawmaker, the goals of the bill are essential to prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters; encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by States, Local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies; establish the office of the Fire and emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the Fire and emergency service; empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilize resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies; and provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officer.

“Mr Speaker, Hon. colleagues, the major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency.

“It will also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through the engagement of able-bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.

“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating of future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources. I am therefore seeking the support of all distinguished Honorable members of this house for the second reading of this bill and eventual passage”, Adeogun submitted.

The bill eventually received the overwhelming support of the House majority when subjected to a voice vote by the presiding officer, Ahmed Idris Wase and passed for second reading.

This was disclosed by the NHSA Director-General, Mr Clement Nze, in a press briefing on Wednesday in Abuja. He urged that strict town planning codes be enforced, calling for constructions of flood walls, buffer dams, dykes and other infrastructure that can hold water and prevent flooding.

What the NHSA is saying

“Federal, states and local governments should clear drainage systems and canals, and embark on projects that will improve hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows… carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas through removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers, to increase storage capacities,” Nze said.

READ:

The NHSA boss revealed that Nigeria is stepping into the 2021/2022 hydrological year in the River Niger Basin, which includes a total of 9 countries, citing the yearly occurrence of flooding in the country since 2012.

“It then means that Nigeria is gradually inching closer to its peak rainy season with subsequent flood incidents,” he said.

“Nigeria’s geographical location downstream, of all the countries in the Basin, puts it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollutions from all the countries upstream,” Nze added.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beat/University of North Carolina PressWho doesn’t love a book with more than one index entry for possum? Two hundred of them were cooked at an Oklahoma City bash in 1923, along with 5,000 chickens, 10 bears, 500 beef cattle, 5 tons of coffee, etc. These are but some of the many fascinating facts in Adrian Miller’s new book Black Smoke: African Americans and the United States of Barbecue.Meet One of the First Barbecue Kings: Henry ‘Poppa’ MillerThe Lost African-American Bartenders who Created the CocktailThe book has 22 recipes (bison skewers, banana pudding, alligator ribs), 16 mini-profiles (such as barbecue king Henry “Poppa” Miller), and a big mission.In the 1990s, Miller worked as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton in the One America Initiative, which had the goal of fostering dialogue and helping communities reconcile racial divisions. Miller’s books could be seen as an extension of that experience. His James Beard Award-winning Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time expounded upon the social history of key soul dishes—fried chicken, chitlins, yams. In The President’s Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas, Miller researched the contributions of African Americans who worked in the White House kitchen.So faced with a whitewashed and one-sided representation of barbecue, Miller got to work. While most people agree that barbecue is a result of European influences dovetailing with Native American techniques in Southern kitchens where the cooks were African Americans—that barbecue, in other words, is Black—evidence, by which I mean scholarly evidence, well-researched and reliably sourced, has been vanishingly scant.To find that essential information, Miller turned mostly to newspaper archives.“For all my books, the biggest boon has been newspapers,” he told me. “They were about capturing the daily life of the community, and so you got a lot more flourish and details about what was happening at a particular event.”He sifted through the records of the speakers and the attendees at big community barbecues—which was tough work, since the food was often barely mentioned.Eventually, “writers started paying more attention to the details and at a time when African Americans went unnoticed more and more of them started talking to these Black barbecuers.”“Now, let’s just be straight up,” Miller said. “Part of this was to mock them. So you’d have them speaking in plantation dialect. But you saw other writers treating this person as an expert, as an artist and showing some love.”“I’ve struggled on how to tell people this,” Miller told me. “During the racist times you actually got more details.”And by the 1830s, in order to have legit barbecue, it was thought, an African American cook and his crew were necessary and barbecue was understood to be a Black experience. Miller explained a complicated twist in the narrative in words far more polite than I might have chosen: “In the 1850s, as there’s more and more tension about slavery, you actually find pro-slavery advocates using the plantation barbecue as evidence of their generosity.”After the Civil War, a group of African Americans “emerged from slavery with a highly specialized and marketable skill.” Barbecue culture flourished because African Americans were barbecuing on their own terms. “And that shows up with political barbecue, church barbecue and also emancipation barbecues.”Barbecue, after all, is perfectly suited to big crowds. You can feed thousands of people, as many as show up, as long as you’ve got the wood, the space and the meat.But the meat, says Miller, is not as cut-and-dried, so to speak, as one might think.In words sure to bring upon him (if not me, by association) a plague of wonky BBQ commentary, Miller reports that: “The regional barbecue styles that we fight about so fiercely today, they’re only about a hundred years old. Before that, barbecue was pretty standardized. It was hardwood coals in a trench, butterflied whole carcasses, flip it and sauce it, cut it up and serve it.” Pork was common, of course, but so was lamb and mutton, and the first emancipation barbecue, which took place in Port Royal, South Carolina, was a beef barbecue.Equally fascinating are the unsung regions of barbecue that Miller has championed such as St. Louis, Chicago, and the east side of Texas, where the meat comes with sauce and the sides aren’t the Germanic salads you find in Central Texas but soul food greens and creole dirty rice.So what happened over the last century? How did we get to a place where white people are thought to own barbecue?“At the very time that people are getting interested in barbecue, the non-diverse food media basically said ‘OK, these are the people we think should tell you what barbecue is, and where to get the good stuff.’ And they just kept putting white dude after white dude out in front.”And as he says it, and we talk about the trends that get pushed in barbecue, it becomes obvious, almost to the point of hilarity: the reason the mantra of barbecue became minimal seasoning was because we kept asking white people how to make barbecue. I suggest that I hear an echo of the old joke about how white people don’t season their food, and he laughs and agrees.“We’ll just flip that to our advantage,” Miller said, “and say you don’t need to season.”This trend is a big part of what brought Miller to write this book. “Chronically, there’s been so little coverage of African American barbecue culture.” Everywhere in the food media, the lack of African American representation “just hit me over and over.”He wasn’t sure, upon setting out on the project, how much he would find, and he feared, in the beginning, that he might be embarking on a record of faded glory. “I really thought I was going to be writing an elegy about Black barbecue,” he said. But “it’s thriving. It’s resilient.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

27,27,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Man who ‘lost everything’ in flood wins $2m jackpot - Vanguard,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/04/man-who-lost-everything-in-flood-wins-2m-jackpot/,"Kindly Share This Story:

A Michigan man who “lost everything” in a flood a year ago just won $2 million from a scratch-off lottery ticket.

The lucky 29-year-old, who chose to remain anonymous, said he “couldn’t stop shaking” when he found out about his sudden change in fortune.

“Last year, I lost everything in a flood, so to win this prize is so overwhelming to me,” he said in a statement released by state lottery officials.

He was on his way to pick up his kids from school when he stopped at a grocery store in Midland — and a ticket for the lottery’s Lucky 7s instant game caught his eye.

“Seven is a lucky number for me, so I decided to take a chance and bought the ticket,” said the man, who also won $10,000 playing the lottery a few years ago.

“I scratched it off when I got back to my car. When I saw I had a match, I thought: ‘Great, I won my money back!’ When I saw I had actually won $2 million, I couldn’t stop shaking.”

He went to the lottery headquarters to claim his big prize, opting for the lump sum of about $1.3 million instead of receiving annuity payments for the full $2 million.

He said he plans to pay off bills and save what’s left of his winnings.

“Knowing my kids will be taken care of is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

28,28,FL-2018-000120-NGA,"Nigeria: Aftermath of Boko Haram Invasion - Niger State Communities in Panic Mode As Victims, Others Flood IDPs Camps - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/202104300443.html,"Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: ""I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

""I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

""We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.""

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists' presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. ""Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don't need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,"" he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: ""The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.""

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God's intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 28 Nigerian states are at risk of heavy flooding this year, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said Thursday.

This year's flood projections will, as expected, vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country, and rivers are likely to exceed flood level with some low-lying areas to be inundated, said the NIHSA in a statement following an earlier survey.

Out of the 774 local government areas in the country, it said, some 102 local government areas across 28 states are at risk of flooding -- one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria, which has a devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on floodplains for livelihood.

Although the projections showed that the floods this year might not be as severe as in previous years, it was important to begin to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns for preparedness, the agency said.

In March 2012, 32 of Nigeria's 36 states were affected by flooding, in which more than 360 people were killed and almost 2 million displaced.

The phenomenon is repeated across numerous communities in West Africa, where traffic and business come to a standstill for hours or days, waiting for the streets to drain. Sometimes the flooding becomes deadly.

Last year, hundreds of people were killed in a mudslide in Freetown, Sierra Leone, along a hillside where residents of the booming city had cleared forests to build homes. Victims were buried alive in their houses and vehicles. Environmental groups and local organizations had been warning for years that the development was risky.

In Nigeria, local television stations reported that more than 100 communities had flooded and broadcast images of muddy waters reaching the rooftops of clusters of homes. Some people died when flooding caused their homes to collapse, according to Agence France-Presse.

Local leaders in some areas were advising residents to evacuate. Officials in Anambra State set up 28 camps for fleeing residents. Thousands of people fled their homes in Cross River State, officials there said, noting that many of them lived in swampy areas or along waterways.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Nigerien student Hachimou Abdou has had to catch a boat to classes since river water swamped his route to university in the capital Niamey - one of about 760,000 people hit by severe flooding in recent weeks in parts of West and Central Africa.

Floods are common during the rainy season, but in recent years climate change, land degradation and poor urban planning have led to more frequent disasters as rapidly-growing cities struggle with heavier-than-normal rainfall.

Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Congo Republic and Senegal are among those worst-hit this year, with at least 111 people killed, according to latest figures from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Waters have yet to recede in parts of Niamey since torrential rains in August caused rivers to burst their banks, destroying nearly 32,000 houses and 5,768 hectares of farmland across Niger.

“I have to get to university - either I take a boat or I walk in the water,” Abdou said, before settling into a traditional wooden pirogue to travel up the flooded highway.

Flooding across landlocked Niger alone has so far impacted nearly 333,000 people. Over 188,000 people have been affected in neighbouring Chad, with OCHA warning of potential food shortages due to inundated land.

With further rain expected, particularly in Central Africa, the situation is expected to worsen, said OCHA’s director for West and Central Africa, Julie Belanger.

Communities’ ability to cope with natural disasters has been eroded by instability, food shortages and mass displacement in some areas. Over 25 million people are in need of humanitarian aid in the violence-plagued Sahel area, which includes Niger, Chad and Mali.

“Many of those populations live in flood-prone areas. It’s just a matter of time for them to be at risk of epidemics,” Belanger said, describing how quickly diseases can spread once floods wipe out access to clean water and sanitation.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200910&t=2&i=1532955151&r=LYNXMPEG891XR&w=800,"['recent', '760000', 'water', 'chad', 'university', 'central', 'floods', 'west', 'hit', 'parts', 'niger', 'severe', 'niamey', 'africa', 'shortages']", ,flood

An image of trucks and cars on a flooded road has been shared in multiple social media posts claiming to show a submerged highway in Nigeria’s southern Ogun state following a recent heavy downpour. This is partly false; while the location is correct, the photo has been circulating since at least 2019.

The image appears in numerous Facebook posts, including this one published on March 24, 2021, with more than 500 shares.

“Sango Ota bridge, I understand this was yesterday o (sic),” reads the Facebook post published on a page called “Lady K ifeoluwa show”. It has a history of calling for the secession of the Yoruba nation from Nigeria.

Screenshot taken on March 29, 2021, showing the misleading Facebook post

Sango Ota is a town in Nigeria’s southwestern Ogun state and is home to the country’s former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. The majority of inhabitants in the region are Yorubas, a large ethnic group in the west African country.

The rest of the post, translated from Yoruba into English, pleads for the “intervention” of state officials and then declares “end Nigeria now”.

The photo it refers to shows submerged vehicles on a flooded road, and features alongside an almost identical claim in this Facebook post with more than 800 shares, as well as on Twitter.

However, the image has been circulating online for more than a year.

Old photo

Using the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check traced earlier versions of the claim to Facebook accounts here and here on March 22, 2021.

It was reposted on Facebook the next day by Joe Igbokwe, the special adviser to the Lagos state governor for drainage and water resources.

“Sango Bridge after yesterday's rain, this is sign of what the people of that area should be expecting this year except the drainages are cleared. Please tell Ogun State to consult me (sic),” reads Igbokwe’s Facebook post.

Screenshot taken on March 29, 2021, showing the misleading claim on Joe Igbokwe’s page

AFP Fact Check has previously debunked misleading information shared on Igbokwe’s account.

In this case, AFP Fact Check confirmed that it actually rained in Sango Ota on March 22, 2021, according to the World Weather Online site.

Furthermore, an AFP journalist in Nigeria confirmed that the photo was indeed taken in the town.

However, the viral image is not evidence of any recent rainfall or flooding.

A Google reverse image search led to this Facebook post and the same picture from September 7, 2019, captioned ""Yesterday Rain @ Sango"". Five days later, global humanitarian organisation ReliefWeb reported that heavy rainfall in the preceding weeks had caused flooding in some parts of the country.

Flooding has long been an issue in the town. In 2011, residents called on the government to construct drainage to prevent an environmental disaster.

Now, like thousands of hectares of rice in Nigeria’s Kebbi state, it is under water.

“Almost all my farm has been flooded. I didn’t harvest any rice,” Ladan told Reuters News Agency. “It’s going to be devastating.”

Floods early this month across northwest Nigeria destroyed 90 percent of the two million tonnes that Kebbi state officials expected to harvest this autumn, the head of the state branch of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. The loss amounts to some 20 percent of the rice Nigeria grew last year, and the waters are still rising.

Further south, outside Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, chicken farmer Hippolite Adigwe is also worried. A shortage of maize forced him to sell most of his flock of more than 1,000 birds, and the 300 he has left are hungry. Chicken feed prices have more than doubled, and he is not sure how long he can cope.

Twin crises, floods and maize shortages, come just after movement restrictions and financing difficulties caused by COVID-19 containment measures complicated spring planting.

Some farmers and economists said it could push Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, into a food crisis. Rice is the country’s staple grain, and chicken is a core protein.

“There is a real fear of having food shortages,” Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. “The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Nigeria took roughly 4,000 tonnes of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s (ECOWAS) strategic stocks last month and released 30,000 tonnes of its own maize. It also gave four companies special permission to import maize.

The prominent Nigerian Economic Summit Group has called for “a complete overhaul” of agriculture policy.

Problems accessing foreign exchange to import food are adding to shortages. In July, the central bank added maize to a list of items for which importers are banned from using its dollars. Rice and fertiliser were already on the list, along with other items that Nigeria wants to be made locally.

Last week, even as food prices spiked, President Muhammadu Buhari promised that not one cent of central bank dollars would go to food or fertiliser imports, as Nigeria would continue encouraging local farmers over imports.

Importers can use dollars from pricier parallel markets. But these are tough to find due to an oil price crash that has cut Nigeria’s core source of foreign exchange.

Switching grains

Rice prices had already risen substantially due to a land border closure last year that aimed to stamp out smuggling and boost local production.

The worst is yet to happen. Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex

Peter Clubb of the International Grains Council said the spike drove consumers to eat maize instead. This, along with a disappointing crop late last year and the foreign exchange issues, boosted maize prices to 180,000 naira ($470) per tonne from approximately 70,000 naira ($183) in March.

Farmers sid that consumers grappling with inflation, as well as the first rise in fuel prices since 2016 and a power price spike, can only pay so much more for food.

Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex, said the central bank’s lending scheme for farmers has significantly expanded output, and can work long term.

But the coming months will be tough. Fertiliser prices hit a record after a COVID-19 outbreak shut down country’s sole urea plant for two weeks, meaning more farmers will skip fertilisers, limiting crop yields.

“The worst is yet to happen,” Balogun said. “It is a problem across grains.”

Buhari has pledged more support, and Agriculture Minister Muhammed Sabo Nanono visited the northwest area this weekend and promised to provide farmers with high-quality seeds and to set up a special committee to ensure they have all they need to plant new crops as soon as possible.

Is the government doing enough?

Over the last few years in Nigeria, seasonal flooding has killed hundreds, destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, and displaced millions of people.

This year, since the rainy season began in June, twelve states have been badly affected. In four of them – Anambra, Delta, Kogi and Niger – the government declared a state of emergency. The National Emergency management agency (NEMA), which coordinate disaster management in Nigeria, estimates that two hundred people have died so far and over 600,000 people have had to flee their homes.

The havoc wrought by heavy rains this year has been devastating. But this level of destruction is not new to Nigeria. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and scores have died in floods. In 2012, particularly severe flooding led to two million displacements and 363 deaths.

Why Nigeria floods

Nigeria’s flooding problem derives from a combination of factors, natural and man-made alike.

On the one hand, rainfall has become significantly heavier in recent years due to climate change. This year, the Niger River reached 11.06m above sea level and could rise further, approaching the record 12.84m of 2012. Water levels have also risen in upstream Cameroon, Mali and Niger. These countries feed the Niger and Benue rivers, which flow through Nigeria. The towns along these two main rivers are particularly vulnerable.

Man-made issues have also contributed to the problem.

For example, Nigeria has several dams along its rivers, ranging from huge hydroelectric stations to smaller constructions for irrigation and fishing. These structures can, in theory, help manage water levels. But in reality, many have been poorly maintained and run, contributing to the build-up of water levels, endangering nearby towns and villages.

“Dams are not necessary facilitators of flood,” says James Akanmu, a water resource and environmental engineering expert. “But we often mismanage dams and they lead us into problems.”

Another contributing factor is a lack of town planning. As Nigeria rapidly urbanises, towns and cities have sprawled with little regard for environmental concerns. Waterways and canals that are crucial for flows are often filled in as part of building developments, while informal settlements in some areas vulnerable to flooding have doubled in population.

“People are building on water ways. People build houses without drainages. The government builds roads without drainages,” says Alabi Soneye, Professor of Geography at the University of Lagos.

“There is pressure in Nigeria cities. Too many people squeezed into small space and everything overstretched,” adds urban planner, Ugochukwu Donald.

The response

In response to this year’s floods, the government pledged $8.2 million for relief efforts as well as declaring a state of emergency in four states. NEMA set up five emergency operation centres to facilitate search and rescue operations and humanitarian support. These efforts have faced huge practical barriers in reaching flood victims, however, while they have also reportedly been undermined by poor management, bad governance and corruption.

Many also argue that such a reactive approach is insufficient in anything but the short-term. Experts say that Nigeria must proactively predict and prepare if it is to reduce the huge damage caused by floods.

Geography professor Soneye argues that the main problem is not planning but implementation. “Master plans are not Nigeria’s problem,” he says. “We have master plan documents, [but] nobody is acting on it. The disaster continues to grow.”

One area in which Nigeria has attempted to establish forward-thinking is through early warning systems. But this has not been straightforward. Nigerian meteorological agencies make predictions about potential flooding and warnings are meant to be sent to locations at risk, but the system is not always effective.

Furthermore, even when information is passed on, there are challenges associated with getting people to act accordingly. Around half of Nigeria’s population lives below the poverty line and moving households to safe areas can be complex and costly.

“It is not enough to tell people to move that the rains are coming. The early warning system needs to provide that support for such response to take place,” says Peter Nwilo, professor of surveying and geo-informatics at the University of Lagos.

Soneye suggests that many citizens are distrustful of state orders and that warning systems should work through local intelligence and community collaboration to be effective. “The people are not in the mood to believe anything that comes from the government,” he says.

Nwilo concurs. “Our warning system needs to be domesticated and localised before it works,” he says. “People are reluctant to comply with the early warning system until disaster catches up with them. Ignorance is huge and we must improve.”

Indeed, as floods continue to devastate areas of Nigeria year on year, the environmental, economic and – most importantly – the human toll is huge. The necessary actions in many cases are known, but as climate changes leads to more unpredictable and heavy rainfall, Nigeria’s flooding problems will only increase unless there is reliable forward planning, sound management and careful implementation.

“The situation is straight forward,” says urban planner Donald. “Flooding is a natural disaster. We cannot entirely rule it out. But somehow, Nigeria has failed to do the right thing: to make corrections from the past.”","Thu, 15 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://africanarguments.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nigeria-flood.jpg,"['problem', 'pours', 'water', 'seasonal', 'flooding', 'huge', 'emergency', 'management', 'floods', 'warning', 'system', 'nigeria', 'rains', 'growing', 'niger', 'nigerias']", ,flood

IT was past noon – lunch time – but there was only one customer at the bukka. Loretta Eze, the proprietor, surveyed the busy street as she stood by the entrance of her restaurant located by the corner of a street in the Wuse 2 area of Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. A number of girls in yellow shirts, who worked as attendants in the restaurant, were hanging around waiting for the solitary customer to finish his meal.

“It was not always like this,” Loretta told The ICIR‘s correspondent, who visited the restaurant while investigating the impact of rising prices of foodstuffs on the preparation and consumption of food, especially jollof rice.

“Food items are very expensive these days and the situation is very hard for those of us that are into catering and food business. Things are hard and as a result, we are not getting as many customers as in the past when things were cheaper,” Loretta added.

Higher cost of foodstuffs has forced restaurants, including roadside bukkas and ‘Mama put‘ joints, to increase the prices of different dishes on their menu and Loretta observed that the development had, in turn, forced some customers to stay away because they could not afford meals as in the past.

Loretta’s observations and concerns mirrored the findings in the SBM Jollof Index report for the first quarter of 2021.

The SBM Jollof Index, developed by SBM Intel, an Africa-focused research firm, simplified the appreciation of food inflationary trends using a common delicacy that most Nigerian households enjoy – jollof rice.

Across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, SBM collects data on the most common ingredients that go into cooking jollof rice in 13 markets on a monthly basis except for December, due to the seasonal spikes caused by Yuletide celebrations. From the prices collated, the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for a family of five or six is averaged and used as a proxy for measuring food inflation across the country.

The commodities that make up the Jollof Index include rice, curry, thyme, seasoning, groundnut oil, chicken/turkey (poultry), beef, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions.

The SBM Index is published three times a year – at the end of the first three quarters. Data from October and November are reflected in the Quarter 1 Jollof Index of the following year.

Cost of making pot of jollof rice rose between March 2020 and March 2021

According to the latest SBM Jollof Index report, the average cost of making a pot of jollof rice rose by 7.8 per cent between March 2020 and March 2021.

The sharp spike in the cost of preparing the delicacy was attributed to a number of events which impacted on food prices. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020, the border closure and foreign exchange restrictions in August 2020 were worsened by a sharp hike in energy tariffs by September of that year.

The situation was further compounded by the the #EndSARS protests, as well as the food blockade imposed by northern traders on the southern part of the country, which disrupted agricultural supply chain and the movement of people and goods.

The reopening of land borders in December 2020 did not result in a significant drop in the cost of food items – the price of a bag of rice only dropped slightly by a margin of N1000 to N3000 depending on the market but that did not translate into a drop in the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for the majority of Nigerians who buy from retailers.

The SBM Jollof Index noted that food prices remained high due to factors such as reduced local production, exchange rate fluctuations, poor harvest due to adverse weather, and high cost of energy and transportation.

Insecurity was also a major factor for the increasing cost of preparing a pot of jollof rice, translating into rising food inflation in Nigeria.

“Some of the jollof rice ingredients such as rice, onions and tomatoes have witnessed reduced local production because of protracted conflicts and terrorist attacks on farmers. Out of the 11 main rice producing states in the country, Benue, Borno, Ebonyi and Kaduna have witnessed attacks on farmers with the most gruesome being the execution of about 110 rice farmers in Borno in November 2020,” the report said.

Faced with deaths from terror attacks in insecure agrarian communities, several farmers are leaving the countryside and moving to the cities to take up menial jobs.

Despite recent drop in inflation rate, Nigerians are still groaning over increasing cost of food items

According to latest figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria’s inflation rate dropped from 18.17 per cent in March 2021 to 18.12 per cent in April 2021.

The 0.05 percentage points decline was the first recorded in headline inflation in about 20 months.

Food inflation also recorded a decline – from 22.95 per cent in March 2021 to 22.72 per cent in April, 2021.

However, while the NBS suggested that inflation might have peaked and could continue to drop, Nigerians are yet to get any reprieve while purchasing foodstuffs.

For Loretta, a food vendor who deals in foodstuffs, the price of food items has continued to spike in the market.

Making a comparison of what was obtainable in the past and the present, she told The ICIR, “Before now, I used to buy a small basket of tomatoes between N300 and N500, but now, it is N1500. Some tomatoes even go for N2500 per basket. Also, a basket of fresh pepper is N1500 now. Before now, you could get a pint of groundnut oil for N300, but it is now N650.”

She added, “Before now, with N2500 or N3000, I could prepare a normal pot of soup or stew but now, if you don’t have at least N7000 you will not get the taste you want due to the high cost of food items.”

Further lamenting the daily hike in the price of staple food items, she observed that, not too long ago, a mudu, or regular measure of beans, was between N250 and N300. But a mudu of beans is N800 now.

“It is the same case as meat. Before now, with N6000 or N8000, you could get the quantity of goat meat that would be enough for you, but now, you will have up to N15000 or more for that same quantity.”

According to her, the increase in the price of onions was ‘manageable’. “The quantity we were getting for N100 before is about N400 or N500 at the moment.”

Loretta also pointed to the sharp increase in the price of rice.

“Before now, a mudu of rice was N300, but now, a mudu of local rice is about N800,” a development which she admitted had increased the cost of preparing a pot of regular jollof rice.

Speaking further, Loretta said, “crayfish and stockfish are totally out of the question” due to recent hike in the prices of the food items.

Nkechi Emmanuel, a housewife, had a frown on her face as she walked out of Dutse Market, in the Bwari area of Abuja. She was clutching a handful of food items.

In a brief encounter with The ICIR‘s correspondent, Nkechi explained that the feeding allowance her husband gave her each month, which was never enough in the best of times, was now barely able to provide a pot of stew and soup.

“It has never been this bad and it is getting worse by the day,” the woman said in a frustrated tone.

All types of foodstuffs are becoming out of reach for the poor and the lower middle-class by the day.

Mary Okon-Essien operates a restaurant in the FCT. She took a break from serving a customer to respond to questions by The ICIR‘s correspondent on May 20.

Okon-Essien stressed that the increase in the prices of basic food items, which had driven up the cost of food, had resulted in reduced patronage for food vendors.

“Before now, the highest amount you could get egusi is N250 or N300 for a mudu, but now, a mudu of egusi is N700 or N800.

“The situation is very difficult for those of us that are into food business. Due to the high cost of foodstuff, it is not easy to sell and make profit anymore because customers are having problems with the higher prices,” she said.

Garri is generally regarded as ‘poor man’s food,’ but Okon-Essien said that was in the past.

“Garri is longer a poor man’s food. A mudu of garri is now N500,” she told The ICIR.

Okon-Essien also noted that another staple foudstuff – red oil – had become more expensive.

“Before now, you could get a tin of red oil for N200, but now, it is not less than N500,” she said, while observing that the situation was more worrisome because the food items were locally produced and not imported.

Besides becoming more expensive, some food items which Nigerians took for granted, due to their availability, are becoming scarce.

The increase in the price of fufu, a cassava meal, goes with the increasing scarcity of the food item, according to Okon-Essien.

“Fufu is a food item that is loved by Nigerians but right now, fufu is scarce and that has made it very expensive. I don’t know if Nigerians are not planting cassava again. Fish has also become very expensive. People now find it very difficult to afford fish for their meals.”

Okon-Essien corroborated the findings of the SBM Jollof Index for the first quarter of 2021.

“Not too long ago, with as little as N1000, you could prepare a pot of jollof rice for your family because with that amount, you would get rice and some amount of crayfish, onion, maggi and other foodstuff you needed. But now, that N1000 will only be enough for a mudu of foreign rice and if you want to cook local rice, then you will need N700 or N800 to buy a mudu of rice and as a result, you will not have much left for the ingredients needed for the jollof rice.”

Highlighting the dismal impact of high food inflation on the food industry, she observed, “Before now, when it was lunch time, you would see many people coming to eat, but now, lunch time seems like morning time, you hardly see anybody. You only see a few people coming to eat and this is because there is no money and everybody is ‘checking his pocket.’ Before now, they could get a plate of food for N250 or N300, but the least you can get a plate of now is N400 or N500,” the woman said.

The number of customers in restaurants has dropped, Okon-Essien noted.

Inflation rate still very high despite recorded decline

Nigeria’s inflation rate might have recorded a marginal decline in April but it remains very high and this is especially so for food inflation.

This was stated by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) which decried the current inflation rate of 18.12 per cent.

Director General of LCCI Muda Yusuf noted that despite the recently recorded decline in the inflation rate, “food inflation at over 22 per cent is still very high in spite of the marginal moderation in food prices in April 2021.”

Yusuf said the situation had continued to exert a negative impact on the activities of every economic agents, including households, businesses and investors, with profound impact on the citizenry, particularly the low and middle-income households.

“The high level of inflation continues to dampen consumer purchasing power at a time households incomes are not increasing in proportion to cost,” he said, adding that the development had resulted in rising production costs and depressed margins for businesses.

Nigeria at risk of famine

Meanwhile, the latest SBM Jollof Index report, which said Nigeria was currently on a slippery slope, noted that Nigeria might experience famine in the nearest future if production, consumption and political-economic dynamics remained unchanged from what was currently obtainable.

Noting that decline in food availability, exponential population growth and decline in entitlements were the main contributors to famine, the report observed that “history shows that the famines with the highest mortality rates resulted from poor harvests, natural disasters (droughts, flood), war/conflict, poor governance and policy failures – conditions which Nigeria fulfills easily.”

The SBM Jollof Index noted that over the last 10 years, food production in Nigeria had been dismally affected by continuous conflicts between farmers and herders in the Middle Belt, where more than 62,000 farmers were displaced from their homeland between 2010 and 2015, including terrorist attacks on farmers in the North-East and bandits’ onslaught in the North-West.

Added to these are adverse weather conditions and decreasing agricultural land due to urbanisation, and the effects of governance failure and some government policies, such as border closer, foreign exchange restriction, hike in electricity tariff and petrol pump price.

The SBM Jollof Index stated that the different factors had combined to continuously drive up food prices in Nigeria.

Poverty rising

The 2020 report by World Poverty Clock showed that over 105 million Nigerians lived in extreme poverty – as against 98 million in October 2019. The figure represented more than 51 per cent of the population.

This placed Nigeria as world poverty capital for two years running. Unemployment in Nigeria reached 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020. Nigeria is among most miserable countries in Africa, scoring 50.6 points in March 2021, as against 14.8 points in Ghana, 6.9 in Ethiopia, 13 in Kenya and 12.1 points in Egypt, among others.","Fri, 21 May 2021 17:07:41 GMT",https://www.icirnigeria.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Goat-meat-jollof-rice.jpg,"['sbm', 'inflation', 'food', 'mudu', 'cost', 'worsening', 'jollof', 'signals', 'rising', 'prices', 'index', 'pot', 'insecurity', 'preparing', 'rice', 'nigerias']", ,flood

As of 23 October, flooding has affected 2.2 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Nigeria, Togo and the Central African Republic, and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

In West Coast, Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Ghana have also experienced flooding throughout August-September 2020.","Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539716-Africa%20-%20Floods%20and%20multiple%20disasters%20-%20Information%20bulletin%2C%2006%20September%202020.png?itok=7OMwtMBe,"['affected', 'chad', 'sudan', 'flooding', '06', 'bulletin', '2020', 'floods', 'states', 'displaced', 'multiple', 'rains', 'information', 'niger', 'disasters', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

Lagos State plans to stop being a receiver of processed rice and start processing its own Lake Rice, starting with the Kebbi State government.

Continuous heavy rainfall since July reached its peak in late September, causing severe and extensive flooding in 34 out of 36 states in Nigeria. Two major rivers, the Niger River and Benue River overflowed into the surrounding communities resulting in widespread destruction. The Nigerian government has declared a state of emergencies in nine states. The floods have affected 1.9 million people, destroyed 82,000 houses, displaced 210,000 people and devastated crops and livestock. Though flood water has receded in some communities, many people still do not have homes, businesses and farms to return to. They continue to seek refuge in schools and other public buildings where conditions are extremely poor. Fear of health outbreaks including malaria, cholera and typhoid remain high, as sanitary conditions have deteriorated especially in the temporary shelters.

Red Cross Actions

The International Red Cross has mobilized HKD 2 million from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to support the Nigerian Red Cross Society’s immediate relief activities. An emergency appeal was launched on 21 September 2018 seeking HKD 43.7 million globally targeting to assist 300,000 people for nine months in 10 states.

Since the onset of the floods the Nigerian Red Cross Society has mobilized over 2,000 volunteers and supported affected communities with evacuations, search and rescue, distribution of food and essential household items, provided first aid, psychosocial support and sensitized communities on good hygiene practices.

Hong Kong Red Cross Actions

Hong Kong Red Cross has mobilized HK$200,000 to support the relief efforts in Nigeria via the International Red Cross, and will continue to monitor the humanitarian situation to define further support.","Wed, 24 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['2018', 'work', 'relief', 'situation', 'support', 'floods', 'mobilized', 'states', 'cross', 'million', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'communities', 'report', 'red']", ,flood
47,47,FL-2018-000120-NGA,"Nigeria: Flood of Tears, As Homes, Farmlands Get Washed Away - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009050051.html,"Floods have again hit several parts of the country, severely affecting farmlands and displacing thousands of people, especially in Kebbi State where our correspondent reports that it ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5billion, while also rendering people homeless in other states, heightening threats to food security.

Besides other factors threatening food security in Nigeria, including the seemingly intractable terrorism, banditry and killer herdsmen's onslaught which are steadily spreading across the country, harvest of farm produce might be imperiled this year and even the next as a result of flooding.

In Kebbi State for instance, 500,000 hectares was recently devastated by flood, 450,000 hectares of it being for rice farms.

This has heightened fears that by next year, majority of farmers in the state, particularly rice farmers, would be out of business.

Many farmlands visited by our correspondent were overrun by floods, just as rice farms were submerged.

A farmer, Libabatu Usman Kamba, expressed fears over imminent food scarcity, particularly as most of the farmers would not be able to mobilize for the next farming season due to the zero harvest this year.

Kamba said she cultivated over 20 hectares of rice this year at Cida Kai village in Dandi Local Government Area but lost over 16 hectares of the rice farm to flood.

She said her crop was ready for harvest and was hoping to get 40 bags of rice per hectare and 700 bags of paddy rice.

Though she could not say what she spent on the hectares submerged in the flood, she added that most farmers would not be able to go for dry season farming this year, hence the need for urgent government intervention.

""The losses recorded this year are so enormous that majority of small holder farmers would not go back for this year's dry season farming.

""The usual practice by most farmers is to re-invest what they realized from rainy season farming for dry season farming,"" she said.

Zuwaira Abubakar, another rice farmer in Argungu, said barely all rice farms in the area were submerged and that would affect farmers' capital for dry season farming. Zuwaira, who cultivated over 25 hectares of rice, said she lost all to flood, adding that she had spent over N300,000 in the farm before the flood came.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid. Many of us will be out of business if no intervention comes our way.

""Farmers don't keep money, the more we make in the business the more we open more farmlands, that is the secret of the farming business otherwise you won't last long in it,"" she said.

In Danko Wasagu Local Government Area, a farmer, Usman Umar, told Daily Trust that they did not experience massive destruction as was the case in most parts of the state, noting that only about a hectare of seven hectares of his rice farm was washed away by the flood.

Another farmer, Suleiman Bashir, who stood helplessly by his rice farm which was submerged along Dukku/Makera road in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area, appealed to the state and federal governments to come to their aid.

""I don't know what to do, I have two large rice farms and they have been completely submerged.

""We are appealing to the state and federal governments to assist us,"" he said.

The chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Sani Dododo, said farm produce worth over N5 billion was destroyed by flood.

He added that the loss recorded in rice farming could be put at 90 percent of the total value of farm produce in the state.

""Over 500,000 hectares of farmlands have been destroyed by flood, the destruction translates to over N5billion worth of farm produce.

""Rice farms constitute to about 90 percent of the farm produce destroyed,"" he said.

The National President of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Aminu Goronyo, who toured some of the affected places while in the entourage of the Kebbi State governor, described the incident as devastating.

Goronyo assured the farmers of federal government intervention because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had sent its officials to the state to assess the situation for immediate intervention.

""The CBN governor has directed RIFAN to mobilise one million farmers that can produce five million metric tonnes of rice during the dry season commencing in November for support,"" he said.

Also speaking with newsmen at Bakin Gada in Argungu Local Government Area after inspecting rice farms destroyed in some local government areas, Governor Abubakar Bagudu expressed shock over the incident, describing it as regrettable.

Thousands rendered homeless in Bauchi

Thousands of displaced people including women and children and the aged have moved into public schools, primary healthcare centres and shops while hundreds of others have relocated to neighboring Jama'are, Azare and Giade local government areas of Bauchi State for shelter.

When our correspondent visited some of the affected areas on Wednesday, dozens of families had taken refuge at various public schools including the Adamami Primary School which was still occupied by the flood.

A victim and father of 11 children, Hamisu Magaji, said three families were sharing two classes.

""One class is accommodating 42 children sleeping on school desks while the male heads of families are sleeping on tables because water has taken over the environment.

""We are staying here due to the flood which destroyed our houses, properties, food and farmlands but we leave everything to God.

""We are yet to receive support or assistance from anybody four days after the incident, life has been difficult, especially taking care of the families but we are struggling to feed them, that notwithstanding, we are appealing to the government and organizations to come to our aid,"" he said.

His daughter, 18-year-old Halima Hamisu, who cooked food for children in the camp, told Daily Trust how they managed to sleep on school desks.

""We arrange the desks laying mats on top and putting long sticks on four angles to hang mosquito nets.

""We line up between 8 and 12 children inside the net and that is how we have managed in this class for the past four days as our mothers have relocated to a nearby village because they are nursing babies,"" she said.

A woman with four children at the Government Day Secondary School camp in Adamami, Barakana Mohammed, said her six months old daughter had been infected with cold.

""I have been sleeping on the floor with my children for four days due to the flood that destroyed our house and property and the bad condition coupled with the weather affecting the children.

""Life has become difficult living in a classroom but we pray for God's intervention.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid.""

A 60-year-old woman, Aishatu Abdullahi, now taking refuge at the camp, decried the absence of essential commodities and the sanitary situation in the camp, saying, ""We don't have food in the camp because water has destroyed everything and the little our caregivers are struggling to bring to the camp is not enough as we have small children.

""I am appealing to the government and privileged individuals in the name of God to support us with food and other relief materials so as to rescue us from additional hardship.""

The village head of Adamami, Malam Isa Nalaraba, said the flood had caused a lot of destruction but, ""We thank God for saving our lives and our children because almost more than half of Adamami is destroyed by the flood which displaced many people to neighboring communities while others have become refugees in their locality while many other residents have relocated to neighboring towns and villages.

""We are appealing to the government and individuals to assist the victims with relief materials to support them and continue their lives.""

Habiba Sani who was to wed in three months and three others including a 14-year-old girl and a 60-year-old woman drowned in flood waters in Bakatma, Shira Local Government Area of the state.

Habiba's father, Malam Sani Biidis, told Daily Trust that he was away when his neighbor invited her and his daughter to accompany him to remove weeds in a rice farm beside a river that was flooded following heavy downpour.

He described the deceased as a kind hearted and obedient girl who hardly argued or disagreed with people within and outside the family.

""They met their sad end when they tried to cross the river at a point where everybody including children used to pass from the village because the area is not deep or wide but as a result of the flood the volume and speed of the water had increased, unfortunately the moment they entered the river the flow dragged them down and they could not swim out of the water.

""It was some children who witnessed the incident that rushed to inform the family that they tried to cross the river but drowned in the process.

""When they launched the search operation their corpses were found in a nearby area some meters from the point of passage.

""I was away from home when I received a phone call that my daughter and one other girl had drowned.

""Habiba's death is painful but I leave everything to God and pray for their souls,"" Bidis said.

Badamasi Shittu, the father of the 14-year-old Ziyada Badamasi, said he asked them to go to his rice farm to assist him remove weeds and apply fertilizer.

""My daughter, Ziyada, told me that they would go before I arrived to apply the fertilizer.

""When they reached the point where people cross the river, they met some children but decided to cross and when they reached the center of the river, Ziyada shouted for help as the flow pulled them down and there was no mature person around to rescue them.

""It was one of the children who rushed home and notified us that Habiba and Ziyada had drowned,"" he said.

The Acting Permanent Secretary in the State Emergency Management Agency, Habu Ningi, said the flood affected 11 villages including Adamami, Bakatma, Alkaleri, Sawi, Dirmi, dago, Shira, Yana , Bege, Bukul, Fago , Tsafi and Disina all, in Shira LGA.

Bakatma village, Adamami, Alkaleri, and Disina town and other villages in Shira Local Government Area were flooded following heavy downpour between Sunday and Monday morning, destroying over 2,600 houses and many hectares of farmlands.

A resident of Adamami, Adamu Oni Adamami, said the heavy rain started on Sunday and around 11 pm people in the town were confused because water had taken over everywhere, gushing into houses at a high speed.

""The rain continued unabated and people started running for safety, especially women and children, to higher areas.

""The rain did not stop until 6am on Monday thousands of houses collapsed and many hectares of farmlands were destroyed.""

Oni added; ""Another devastation the flood caused is destruction of food.

""Apart from losing houses majority of the victims have no food and the farmlands have been destroyed, leaving us in a big calamity now and in future because the time to cultivate new crops has passed.

""We are calling on the government, individuals and corporate organizations to come to our aid before the situation goes out of hand.""

Niger farmers count losses

Many farmlands have been wiped out in Niger State where there is wide lamentation among farmers who are appealing to the government to come to their aid.

Our correspondent gathered that entire farmlands were washed away by floods, leaving farmers with nothing to harvest.

An affected farmer, Tukura Saidu from Kuyi village, said over 40 farmers were affected in his village as yams, maize and rice planted were all wiped out, adding that it was the first time of experiencing such a huge loss to flood.

Also, fish worth over N100 million were washed away by flood at Lapai Gwari in Bosso Local Government Area of the state, it was gathered.

A fish farm according to Daily Trust findings, the major place where fish sellers get fresh fish, was greatly affected, causing a rise in the price of fish in the area as residents now have to travel elsewhere to get fish.

A fish farmer, Malam Mohammad Tukur, lamented that the devastation caused by ravaging floods in Lapai Gwari was the first of its kind and appealed to the state government to urgently assist them.

He said about 2000 fish farms had been washed away.

Another farmer, Malam Abdullahi Saidu, said customers from across Nigeria were trooping to the farm before the incident but many farmers had lost millions of naira worth of investments to floods.

The Vice Chairman of Bosso Local Government Area, Malam Saidu Zegi, said in April this year, rainstorms affected over 200 people, just as many farmers lost their farmlands.

The Director General, Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, described the incident as not only pathetic and tragic but also devastating.

Inga said they had sent a team of experts from the agency to investigate the extent of damage caused.

This according to him is to enable the state government come up with modalities of assisting victims.

He said though the state government was battling with insufficient funds occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, it would not fold its arms to allow the people suffer without any aid.

Floods hit Enugu farms

Enugu State is not left out of the massive flooding and destruction of crops. Mr. Austin Obiora has a rice farm of about 235 hectares at Ihuokpara community in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

Speaking with Daily Trust, he recalled how a heavy rainfall on August 26 caused a massive flood which affected his farm. About 16 hectares of the rice field was adversely affected.

According to him, the rice had started flowering when the flood came.

""I had to start afresh because the rice planting season was almost over.

""I started doing another ""broadcasting"" (spreading) of rice seeds in a systematic and orderly way to enable them germinate very well,"" he said.

""It costs about N250,000 to cultivate one hectare of rice field and when multiplied by 16 hectares, it will be over N4m because I have to add the cost of labour,"" Obiora said, adding: ""Therefore, I lost over N4m due to the massive and devastating flood.""

He, however, didn't feel discouraged by the huge loss because he said upon realizing that some large hectares were still there for him, the unaffected hectares represent compensation for his loss.

""We pray that it doesn't happen again in the next planting season, nobody wants to incur losses,"" he said.

Asked whether any government agency came to his aide, he said he considered it would be a waste of time and energy to approach any government body, just as he did not insure his farm in the first place.

However, Obiora said he had learnt his lesson as he has started making arrangements for insuring his farms in future.

Another farmer, an elderly Rev Dr Lambert Echetu who is into maize and cassava farming, told our correspondent that the combined misfortune of flooding and activities of herdsmen had caused a lot of havoc to his maize farm of two hectares at Amagunze in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

He said: ""The cattle and flood messed up my maize farm.

""I planted maize covering two hectares.

""I spent about N240,000 on clearing the bush, seeds and fertilizer.

""We went to the Government House, Enugu to complain about the Fulani herdsmen and their cows destroying our farms.

""The first tragedy was done to the farm by the cows.

""The second tragedy was caused by the huge flooding, even though the place is swampy.

""When I got to the Government House, they would refer me from one office to the other and it was like a wild goose chase and I left,"" he said.

Echetu further said: ""As a servant of God, when I tried to get help from people and I didn't succeed, I handed everything over to God.

""I love farming because I have passion for it.

""I prayed over the farm project before I decided to farm.

""I have a lot of people who need my help in the village.

""My intention is after harvesting the maize, and bringing it to the church, I will distribute the maize to the congregation.""

He said despite the setback, he won't give up farming and had acquired over 100 hectares of land at Ihu-Okpara community, specifically for planting cassava in the next planting season.

Kano, Jigawa farmers cry out

Last month, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) revealed that 20 of the 44 local government areas in Kano State were at high risk of flooding during this year's rainy season.

Tarauni, Garum Malam, Rimin Gado, Gaya, Gezawa, Gwale, Shanono, Gabasawa, Gwarzo, Ungoggo, Warawa, Dawakin Kudu, Dambatta, Bebeji, Kabo, Wudil, Kura, Nassarawa, Kano Municipal and Kumbotso were the local government areas identified in the report.

With the recent wave of rainfall in the state, some of the identified local governments have already begun to experience heavy flooding which resulted in the destruction of several hectares of farmlands by flood, causing loss of millions of naira worth of farm products.

According to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) in Kano, so far, hundreds of rice farmers in five local governments have reported to have been affected by the flood.

The state chapter chairman of RIFAN, Alhaji Haruna Abubakar Aliyu, said farmers in Dambatta, Makoda, Ajingi, Gaya and Rinim Gado have been seriously affected by the flooding.

""Based on the directives received from the RIFAN head office after we had sent our report on the damages caused to our various members, the head office asked us to compile a detailed report on the flood which currently we are working on.

""We have so far identified five local governments, though we are aware there are more than that but we are still working on it,"" he said.

The state chapter chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Alhaji Zubairu Ibrahim, said the association was still assessing the areas affected and number of farmers and farm lands affected.

He added that the outcome of the ongoing assessment would be made public and the association was working on measures to be adopted in assisting the affected farmers.

Attempts to contact the state commissioner for agriculture and who is also the deputy governor proved abortive but sources close to the ministry said a committee had been inaugurated by the state government to look into the issue and present its report for further action.

In Jigawa State, following a two-day heavy downpour in Birninkudu Local Government Area, several houses and farmlands were said to have been destroyed.

Alhaji Wada Faka, the chairman of the local government, said a yet-to-be ascertained number of houses and farmlands were destroyed in Malamawar Gangaran, Babaldu, Wurno, Kiyako and Samamiya villages.

NEMA had also stated that the Nigerian Hydrological Agency (NIHSA) 2020 Annual Flood Outlook already listed 12 local government areas in the state as flood-prone areas.

The NIHSA report listed Kaugama, Taura, Guri, Gwaram, Dutse, Auyo, Miga, Malam Madori, Ringim, Birniwa, Jahun and Kafin Hausa as probable flood risk areas.

Nasarawa farmers groan under flood

Many farms and farming communities were recently submerged in flood waters in Nasarawa, a state with many small, medium and large scale farms.

A farmer in Doma Local Government Area, Abu Doma, said his farm and many others were washed away in a few days.

Same goes with people residing on the bank of the River Benue along the state's boundary with Benue State.

This is the second year in a row that River Kilema in Lafia has flooded and submerged farms, houses and cemeteries among others.

An official of the State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) who prefers anonymity said it was taking measures to mitigate a possible humanitarian crisis in the state.

The agency has been urging those living in flood-prone areas to leave such places.

He said last month, heavy floods occurred in three local government areas including Awe, Nasarawa and Toto.

The Director of flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr. Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umasha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.","Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn03.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00521229:97559b81f1c74f189f2c92809408b0aa:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'washed', 'children', 'homes', 'flood', 'local', 'farm', 'area', 'farmlands', 'nigeria', 'tears', 'state', 'away', 'rice', 'hectares']", ,none
48,48,FL-2018-000120-NGA,A Flood of Polluting Air Conditioners Hampers Africa's Climate Efforts - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-flood-of-polluting-air-conditioners-hampers-africas-climate-efforts,"As air conditioning sales in Africa soar, many of the units imported there are old and inefficient, driving up electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. But some countries are taking action, banning the import of used air conditioners and adopting tough energy standards.

It’s early August and a dozen air conditioners are keeping Joy Obehi’s clients cool on another hot steamy day in Lagos, Nigeria. But invariably the electricity flickers off and her expensive diesel generator rumbles to life. “The power goes out pretty much every day, usually for one hour or two hours,” said Obehi, who rents out short-term meeting space and spends as much as $300 a month on diesel fuel. “[Air conditioners] use a lot of power, but our clients expect our locations to be cooler.” As African incomes rise and the number of hotter days from climate change increases, demand is exploding for air conditioners around the continent. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, more than 500,000 air conditioning units are bought each year and the number is increasing by 4 to 5 percent annually, according to a recent report. But that demand comes at a price: the plethora of energy-sapping — but inexpensive — air conditioners that are stressing already overburdened electricity grids, saddling consumers with high energy bills, contributing to more frequent outages that damage local economies, and making a significant contribution to the continent’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of used and new inefficient AC appliances are being sold in Africa every year, many of them illegally. Many are obsolete secondhand appliances imported mostly from Europe, despite international laws forbidding such activity. The appliances also contain banned ozone-depleting refrigerants that are potent contributors to climate change.

Electricity demand for air conditioners is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040.

And with cooling demand proliferating due to urbanization and hotter temperatures, Africa’s air conditioning market is poised to get bigger. Electricity demand for air conditioners and other cooling appliances is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040, from 11 terawatt-hours (TWh) to 112 terawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency. If African countries adopt stricter air conditioning efficiency standards, energy demand could be cut in half, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 million tons by 2040, according to the United Nations. Africa’s cooling challenge is part of a much larger trend. Worldwide demand for air conditioners is expected to more than triple in the next 30 years, from 1.6 billion units in 2018 to 5.6 billion units by 2050. That amounts to 10 new air conditioners being sold every second for the next three decades. Without government policies to make air conditioners cleaner and more efficient, greenhouse gas emissions from ACs and other cooling equipment will jump by a projected 90 percent by 2050 — a huge step backward in international efforts to limit global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, says a new UN report. Now, some African countries are trying to tamp down on energy-guzzling cooling. Ghana is successfully enforcing a ban on imports of used cooling appliances, including air conditioners. Rwanda approved a similar ban, along with Africa’s toughest-ever energy performance standards for new cooling appliances, both of which are set to come into effect next year. A half-dozen other countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, have minimum performance standards for new air conditioners and refrigerators. But success is still largely elusive due to weak policies and minimal enforcement. “There are not many harmonized efficiency policies at the moment in Africa, and many of them are out of date, not enforced, and not stringent,” said Patrick Blake, a policy expert at the UN’s United for Efficiency Program (U4E).

Among the countries struggling with the issue is Nigeria, Africa’s second-largest AC market behind Egypt. “Compliance with our energy standards is very, very slow,” said Etiosa Uyigue, executive director of a Nigerian environmental group, the Community Research and Development Center (CREDC), which has been pushing for more stringent mandatory energy standards and environmentally friendly refrigerants for all cooling appliances sold in the country. The stakes are enormous. Air conditioner sales are rising steadily across the continent, especially in hotter, more prosperous countries in West Africa. Morocco, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast have all seen a doubling in air conditioner imports since 2010, whether used or new units, according to government data. The United Nations projects that air conditioner stocks will hit 1.5 billion units in Africa by 2030, up from 660 million in 2015. The strains are already being felt. Nigeria’s limited power supplies, which are half the size of North Carolina’s despite having nearly 20 times more people, turn on and off every day and occasionally cause national blackouts, as happened 11 times in 2019. Hot sticky days when air conditioners are humming full throttle are the worst. “We just had two outages today,” said Uyigue, speaking in July from his home in the capital Abuja, where he uses three generators and a small solar energy system to keep the lights on. A Nigeria Energy Commission study in 2014 estimated that air conditioners account for 25 percent of total energy consumption in Abuja and 17 percent nationally. Nigeria’s annual CO2 emissions have tripled since 1990. The country’s widespread reliance on noisy, polluting diesel generators costs the economy nearly $14 billion a year, primarily in added fuel expenses. Meanwhile, Africa is tethered to an AC market dominated by high-polluting inefficient appliances.

Many air conditioners sold in Africa are low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made.

For years, many African countries have been flooded with millions of antiquated secondhand air conditioners and refrigerators imported primarily from Europe. Nigeria and other West African countries with high summer temperatures and close proximity to European shipping ports are especially popular destinations for used cooling appliances, which arrive stuffed into containers, cargo vehicles, and even used cars. The appliances are often broken and those that still work often consume two to three times more electricity than new models. “They come in branded as new, but when they’re off-loaded it’s mostly near-end-of-life e-waste,” said Leslie Adogame, executive director of SRADev, a Nigerian nonprofit environmental health research group. “They’re certainly cheaper to buy, but they use a lot more energy and don’t meet environmental standards.” A half-dozen African countries have joined a United Nations working group, launched in April, that is trying to stop these flows, many of which are unlawful. Shipping non-working electronic equipment is illegal under both the Basel Convention, an international treaty governing hazardous waste, and the European Union’s Waste Shipment Directive. New cooling appliances being sold in Africa are not much better. Recent research by the energy efficiency nonprofit CLASP and the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development (IGSD) showed that 35 percent of new room air conditioners sold in Africa’s 10 largest countries in 2018 were low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China. A quarter of the 650,000 low-efficiency units — none of which meet common efficiency standards used in developed countries — were imported from non-African countries, primarily China. The remaining three-quarters were largely imported and then assembled in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Egypt.

“Environmentally harmful dumping is occurring in Africa,” said Gabrielle Dreyfus, senior scientist at IGSD. “These kinds of markets deprive consumers of a smarter choice by flooding markets with lower-price products that cost consumers more over time.” The report also showed that 790,000 air conditioning units sold in Africa contained obsolete ozone-depleting, greenhouse gas refrigerants known as R-22, which are being phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol. Another 820,000 units contained R-410A refrigerants, a highly potent greenhouse gas with 2,000 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide. They are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol’s Kigali Amendment, beginning in 2019 in developed countries and later this decade in developing countries. Efforts to halt these damaging trade flows have been going on for years, but most have been unsuccessful, in large part simply because more and more African consumers want affordable devices to stay cool. Ghana is a noteworthy exception. Alarmed by the millions of obsolete cooling appliances that were entering the country and the widening gap between energy demand and power production, the country banned all used air conditioner and refrigerator imports in 2008. In 2013, when the government began enforcing the ban, illegal imports plummeted. Last year, new appliances, mostly from China, made up 95 percent of the market. “We succeeded in reversing the market in favor of new appliances,” said Kofi Agyarko, director of energy efficiency and climate change at the Ghana Energy Commission, who credits tough enforcement for catalyzing the shift. While new, more efficient appliances cost two to three times as much as used ones, they consume a third as much electricity, with Ghanaians saving on average $140 a year on energy bills, Agyarko said. But even if countries can effectively ban used imports, how can they limit the flood of inefficient new appliances into Africa? Rwanda thinks it has the answer. Last year, as part of a comprehensive national cooling strategy, Rwanda enacted Africa’s toughest energy standards and energy labeling for new air conditioners and other cooling appliances. The mandatory standards, which take effect next year, are modeled after guidelines developed by the UN’s United for Efficiency program. Brian Holuj, who leads the program’s work on cooling appliances, says Rwanda’s efforts are an important breakthrough. “For the first time in Africa, Rwanda will demonstrate the impact of mandatory policies, coupled with strong energy efficiency requirements and limits on global warming-damaging coolants in new products,” he said.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, AC energy demand would be cut in half from current projections.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, air conditioning energy demand would be cut in half from current projections, according to the UN. “More than two-dozen full-sized power plants could be avoided through more efficient air conditioners and refrigerators in Africa,” Holuj said. A critical step, Holuj said, is for countries to come together regionally on consistent policies, backed by enforcement, that send a strong market signal to the industry. “The key is regional alignment,” he said, citing the EU’s success in developing common requirements and energy labeling. Dreyfus, the scientist at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, echoed this point: As long as markets for cheap products are able to flourish, high-efficiency appliances will have a hard time competing. “If a manufacturer feels they have to compete for market share by selling low-efficiency obsolete equipment, we have to close the loopholes to bring the market up so that they have the right marketplace in which to sell better products,” she said. Nigeria has tried some of the approaches Ghana and Rwanda are using, but they are not working, according to CREDC’s Uyigue. Nigeria imposed an import ban on obsolete used cooling appliances in 2010, but it is not being enforced. It adopted voluntary energy performance standards and energy labels for air conditioners in 2017, but compliance is broadly lacking. Numerous obstacles are impeding progress. The first is price — a low-performing air conditioner costs only $100 to $200. The second is trade barriers such as a 20 percent duty on imported assembled air conditioners, an important source of government revenue. The third — perhaps the biggest — is the government’s unwillingness to take the tough steps necessary to force a market shift.","Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/site/GP01QLI_High_res_Nigeria_web.jpg,"['africa', 'air', 'demand', 'climate', 'hampers', 'flood', 'conditioners', 'africas', 'efforts', 'cooling', 'used', 'units', 'appliances', 'countries', 'energy', 'polluting']", ,flood
49,49,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Nigeria: 10 Things Nigerians Should Expect in 2021 - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/202101030130.html,"The year 2020 has come and gone with its challenges which include the coronavirus pandemic, banditry, kidnapping, terrorism and several other depressing episodes, and of course some spirit-lifting events. Here, Daily Trust on Sunday gives a list of what to expect this New Year.

Increased agitation for 2023

There is likely going to be increased agitation ahead of the 2023 general elections this year, and among other issues, whether or not zoning will determine who political parties decide to make their flagbearer, for the presidency.

The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) is likely to entrench its position on the subject, as its president, Alhaji Yerima Shetima, has rejected the agitation for the zoning of the number one position. Holding the same position is Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari's nephew, who said competency and not zoning should be the consideration in electing Buhari's successor.

However, people like Alhaji Shuaib Mustapha Kano, political adviser to a former governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, are likely to remain adamant on zoning the presidency to Eastern Nigeria.

Both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have debated whether or not their parties' tickets should be zoned to the North or to the South. This debate will most likely deepen this year.

Floods still in sight

Flooding has become one of the disasters that never seems to go away, and 2020 is a typical example. It happened again despite forecasts by the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and the Hydrological Services Agency (HAS) that revealed there would be massive flooding across many states from the beginning of the year. Also, donor agencies and even private firms repeatedly warned of the impending and imminent floods. The floods came and agricultural output and property worth billions were lost. It happened in Akwa Ibom State where 100 houses were destroyed and 300 persons displaced in Eket Local Government Area (LGA) in 2020, and in Borno where hundreds of shelters in Internally Displaced People's (IDP) camps were destroyed. Thousands of people were displaced and property destroyed in several parts of the country.

A report by Relief Web posted on October 19, 2020, indicated that flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara states, among others, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas.

In Kebbi State were a massive flood ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5bn and rendered people homeless, the Director of Flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umaisha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.

This is an example of promises Nigerians continue to get and there is no certainty that this will not happen again.

COVID-19 vaccine for 20m people

The Federal Government is making efforts to procure 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 to check the spread of the virus. Everything being equal, this means less than a quarter of Nigeria's over 200 million population may be vaccinated. Nigeria's Health Minister, Osagie Ehanire, who said this at a press conference in December, 2020, pointed out that health sector employees would be vaccinated first, then the vulnerable and those with chronic illnesses.

So far, Nigeria has recorded not less than 70,500 COVID-19 cases with 1,184 fatalities, and more than 65,000 patients have recovered from the disease. As of January 1, 2021, 1074 new confirmed cases and deaths were recorded. Therefore, there is a high possibility of another lockdown in 2021 to curtail the spread of the virus across states, but whether this would have a positive impact is left to be seen because there are arguably more Nigerians in slums and ghettos where families share toilet facilities and other basic amenities, and then there is the danger of a rise in criminality and rape as was the case in 2020.

Budget increase impact

President Muhammadu Buhari recently signed into law the 2021 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly. The National Assembly had on December 21, 2020, passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill with an aggregate expenditure of N13,588,027,886,175 trillion.

It comprises total Capital Supplementation of N1,060,751,051,650 and total Capital Expenditure of N4,125,149,354,222. Statutory Transfer stands at N496,528,471,273; Rrecurrent Expenditure of N5,641,970,060,680 with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 3.00 per cent.

The National Assembly also provided N3,324,380,000tn for debt servicing which would obviously serve as a drain on the country's finances.

The legislators had increased the budget estimate by N505,607,317,942 from the estimate of N13,082,420,568,233 presented to the joint sitting of the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 8, 2020. This means Nigeria would have more money to pump into vital sectors of the economy like healthcare, education and security.

Insecurity still looms

The abduction of over 300 schoolboys by gunmen in an all-boys Government Science School in Kankara, Katsina State, is probably one of the biggest highlights of insecurity in 2020. Even though the boys have been released, the incident still raises questions about Nigeria's dwindling security. Kidnappings continue to happen on the Kaduna-Abuja road, Lokoja-Abuja Expressway, the Obajana-Okene axis in Kogi State, among others. In the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, Kuje Area Council has recorded several cases of people being abducted, particularly in their homes. Terrorism in the North East and banditry in Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna states, among others, is yet to stop and there is no clear sign that 2021 is going to be different. Nigeria still has the same security chiefs from 2020 and the cost of goods and services are still on the rise.

Stiffer laws against rape, gender-based violence

In June, 2020, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, said Nigeria recorded 717 rape incidents between January and May of the same year. This was before the lockdown due to COVID-19 which saw a spike in rape cases and gender-based violence. Some states have since taken steps to tackle the issue. One of such is Kaduna, where Governor Nasir el-Rufai signed into law the amended Penal Code Law 2020 that provides for stiff penalties for rape of a child, including death, surgical castration for male convicts, and bilateral salpingectomy for female rapists.

Also, in 2019 Nigeria launched a sex offenders' register as a vital step towards tackling reported cases of sexual abuse. With these steps, there is hope for the fight against rape and gender-based violence this year as many Nigerians, especially Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), continue to call for stiffer laws.

Possible food shortage

As the activities of the terrorist group Boko Haram continue, including that of bandits and kidnappers who have been reported to have whisked or attacked people from their farms, there is a possible food shortage in sight, especially in Northern Nigeria. In addition is the effect of the 2020 flood that destroyed many farms across the country.

The year 2021 promises to be eventful with the release of movies like the musical drama 'Dreamers' written by Michael Castiel and scheduled for release on January 31; 'Mamba's Diamond' directed by Seyi Babatope, written by Darlington Abuda and starring actors like Osas Ighodaro, Uchembe Williams and Nse Ikpe-Etim set for March 19; 'Retribution' which is still in development; 'Willie-Willie' also in the development stage, among others.

Music

Meanwhile, nominations for the 63rd annual Grammy Awards were recently announced with Nigeria's Burna Boy (for his recent album 'Twice as Tall') and Wizkid on the list for the 2021 awards by the Recording Academy. Burna Boy was nominated under the World Music Album while Wizkid for his feature in Beyonce's Brownskin Girl song.

Books! Books!! Books!!!

This year TJ Benson's debut novel 'Madhouse' is set for release. Also, 'The Days of Silence' by Angel Patricks Amegbe; 'What Happened to Janet Uzor' by Miracle Emeka-Nkwor and Onyeka Nwelue's 'The Strangers of Braamfontein', to mention a few.

Festivals

As always there are a number of festivals to look forward to this year. There is the Lagos Carnival held during the Lagos Black Heritage Festival, Afan National Festival, Argungu Fishing Festival, Atyap Annual Cultural Festival and several more.

Most book and art festivals come towards year-end such as the Ake Arts and Book Festival, Lagos Book and Art Festival (LABAF), Benue Books and Art Festival and the Abuja Literary and Arts Festival (ALITFEST).

• Short - range forecasts up to 31 th October, marking the end of the season shows continued favorable seasonal conditions in most of the region except some localized pockets of moderate dryness. It is thus likely that the rainy season will be abnormally late particularly in the Sahel region.

• Early October, the end of the rainy season in the Sahel, West Africa has been characterized by mostly adequate and well-distributed rains: this results in average to above-average seasonal rainfall The Sahel region benefited the most from very good conditions with well above-average seasonal rains, while belowaverage rainfall spread over the southernmost part of the region across the Gulf of Guinea. The cumulative heavy rainfall recorded from mid-August to September resulted in flooding, that have affected about 760,000 people in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal with at least 111 fatalities.

• As a result of increase in rainfall since late July and wetter conditions in August and September: a pattern of strongly above-average vegetation emerged during September and October in all of the Sahel. Agricultural areas benefitted from very good seasonal conditions. Good production prospects are certain this year in the region (in biomass and crops production). As a result of good seasonal performance in mid-October water resources remain at a good level. Overall they have reached their highest level throughout the West African region.

• Across the Sahel, harvest has started for main season millet and sorghum crops in southern Mali, Burkina Faso, southern Niger, and eastern Senegal. Meanwhile favourable harvesting of main season crops reached completion in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, southern Ghana, southern Togo, Benin, and central Cameroon, while crops are still developing in Guinea, northern Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, and northern Nigeria under generally favourable conditions. Despite localized floods impacting the Sahel and drier-than-average conditions along the Gulf of Guinea countries, overall conditions are favourable except in conflict-affected northern Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, and northeast Nigeria along with the conflict and floodaffected Far North region of Cameroon.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540757-WFP-0000120139.png?itok=iitFCIc-,"['crops', 'monitor', 'situation', 'seasonal', 'region', '2020', 'west', 'season', 'floods', 'conditions', 'update', 'good', 'mali', 'southern', 'rainfall', 'sahel', 'africa', 'cameroon']", ,flood

Despite this success, the firm is also “confronted by growing support for activists’ demands to set more ambitious targets”, the newspaper adds. It notes that a separate resolution by Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This calling for Shell to set more “inspirational” targets attracted the support of 30% of shareholders, although such resolutions require 75% to pass. According to the Times, Follow This “insists that Shell’s goals are not consistent with achieving the Paris climate accord, in part because it lacks near-term targets for absolute emissions reductions”. The Guardian notes that this “significant shareholder rebellion” came on the day that the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its net-zero pathway, in which all exploration for new oil and gas fields stops this year to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It quotes Charlie Kronick, a senior climate finance adviser for Greenpeace UK, who notes that Shell’s plans would increase gas production by 20% by 2030, “contravening the advice of the IEA”. Reuters states that, under its current plans, Shell intends to increase its investment in low-carbon energy sources in the coming years, “but at least 75% of its spending will continue to go towards oil and gas”. In Bloomberg’s coverage, it says that the oil giant also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its “spill-prone operations in Nigeria”.

Meanwhile, another Guardian story reports that, in Australia, politicians and companies are being urged by campaigners to abandon plans for new coal power, gas and oil investments in light of the new IEA report. In Europe, Politico reports that the landmark report is “giving Brussels new ammunition in its war on fossil fuels”, as its conclusions support the European Commission’s efforts to discontinue EU funding for oil and gas projects. According to EurActiv, environmentalists have “warned against some of the assumptions in the scenario” developed by the IEA, notably the growing shares of biomass used for energy. The piece adds that IEA modellers have explained that their scenario assumes no overall increase in cropland use for bioenergy production, or new bioenergy crops on forested land. The Guardian reports on comments from the UK climate champion, Nigel Topping, who says he is “stubbornly optimistic” that the world will arrive at an agreement to “forge a transition to a net-zero future” at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year. (For more on the IEA’s latest report, see Carbon Brief‘s coverage.)

52,52,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Conflicting reports emerge in Nigeria over video of downed plane - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/03/conflicting-reports-emerge-in-nigeria-over-video-of-downed-plane/,"National-World

Conflicting reports have emerged in Nigeria over a video of a downed plane, after the country’s air force disputed claims from Boko Haram that its militants shot down a jet.

The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) strongly questioned the authenticity of the Boko Haram clip which purports to show fighters shooting at the military plane, eventually causing it to fall to the ground.

The NAF suggested that the crash was due to an air accident.

The video was published by the SITE Intelligence Group and is circulating across Nigerian media.

“It is evident that most parts of the video were deliberately doctored to give the false impression that the aircraft was shot down” when it was “obviously an air accident,” the NAF said in a statement posted on Facebook Friday.

The NAF rejected the seven-and-a-half-minute edited clip, calling it “false propaganda” and urging Nigerians “to ignore the contents of the videos making the rounds until all investigations as to how the aircraft crashed are completed.”

The NAF reported the plane missing on Wednesday, with two pilots on board.

A spokesperson told CNN Thursday afternoon the fighter jet had been deployed near Borno State in northeastern Nigeria to provide air support to ground troops, who were under fire from Boko Haram fighters before radar contact was lost.

“The cause of the crash as well as the whereabouts of the 2 pilots remain unknown. The pilots are Flight Lieutenant John Abolarinwa and Flight Lieutenant Ebiakpo Chapele,” the NAF said earlier Friday.

In the disputed video Boko Haram claims to have shot down the Alpha Jet.

The footage shows multiple fighters shooting into the air before a blast lights up the sky as a plane ignites into flames and falls to the ground. The video then cuts to fighters standing around what appears to be the wreckage of the jet.

It then cuts to the plane, showing “NAF 475” — the missing aircraft’s ID number. It later shows a charred body.

Separately the video then shows what appears to be a patch laying on the ground, displaying John Abolarinwa’s name.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Boko Haram has increased attacks against the Nigerian military as it tries to regain control of lost territories in pockets of the country’s northeast.

Frequent air raids by the Nigerian military have continued to rattle the insurgents — dislodging them from their hideouts.","Sat, 03 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['air', 'video', 'plane', 'conflicting', 'reports', 'boko', 'haram', 'emerge', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'shot', 'naf', 'fighters', 'downed', 'shows']", ,flood
53,53,FL-2018-000120-NGA,"Nigeria: Dozens Killed, Houses Destroyed As Floods Ravage North-Central Nigeria - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009250681.html,"Torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks wreaked havoc in the North-central sub-region of Nigeria.

State governments in the North-central region of Nigeria are employing measures to halt the perennial flooding ravaging parts of the zone and alleviate the sufferings of the victims.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks claimed many lives, destroyed hundreds of houses and washed away farmlands and domestic animals in the sub-region.

The catastrophe compelled the governments in the zone to take steps to avert further flooding and provide succour to the affected people such as temporary shelters, food and medicines.

In Nasarawa State, Governor Abdullahi Sule ordered the immediate evacuation of persons whose houses had been submerged by flood in Nasarawa, headquarters of Nasarawa Local Government Area.

Mr Sule also directed that foodstuff, mattresses and other relief items be provided to the victims immediately.

His spokesperson, Ibrahim Addra, said the governor had visited the ancient town and sympathised with the people over the incident.

He urged the people to desist from erecting structures on waterways and stop indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the drains.

In response to the governor's directive, the Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) distributed food and non-food relief materials to over 45 communities ravaged by flood in Awe and Nasarawa local government areas of the state.

The Executive Secretary of the agency, Zakari Allumagas, said the governor gave the order during his visit to Nasarawa following the flood in the town.

Mr Allumagas said the relief materials comprised 44 trucks of 600 bags each of assorted grains and three trucks of non-food items such as building materials, children's clothing, cooking utensils and mats.

He warned against diversion of the items.

He also disclosed that over 700 households were displaced by floods in such communities as Ara, Udenyi Magaji, Ugya and Gude, Nasarawa town in Nasarawa Local Government Area, and Ribi and Gidan Soja in Awe Local Government Area.

The executive secretary said the state government was working with traditional and community leaders to come up with a directive banning approval and sale of lands near riverine areas of the state.

In Kogi, the State Commissioner for Environment, Victor Omofaiye, said many communities in some local government areas in the state had been ravaged by floods.

Mr Omofaiye said such communities included places in Kotonkarfe, Lokoja, Ajaokuta and Ibaji local government areas.

He said some victims of the disaster had already been moved to IDPs camps in Kotonkarfe, while the IDPs camps and flood estates in Lokoja were being prepared through clearing of their surroundings and fumigation for resettlement of the flood victims.

He said that the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had predicted that in 2020, about 10 local government areas would be affected by flood in Kogi.

They are Lokoja, Kogi/Kotonkarfe, Ajaokuta, Bassa, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela, Ofu, Adavi and Omala.

""The water level of River Niger is still fluctuating within the range of 10.5 to 10.7, but as at September 21, it was 10.7 compared to the 12.5 as at the same period in 2012 in Kogi.

""Flood is a menace that we experience in Kogi every year. The flood we experienced in Kogi in 2012 was massive and devastating; we do not pray for such in 2020, but we are actually on red alert,"" the commissioner said.

He attributed flooding in the state to human and natural factors.

According to him, the human factor has to do with the people's habit in managing the environment as they dump refuse on waterways and drains, thereby obstructing free flow of water.

Mr Omofaiye said that the confluence of two major rivers in Kogi: River Niger and Benue, which most times overflowed their banks, was affecting communities along the river paths, including those of other small rivers that took their sources from river Niger and Benue.

""Opening of dams, especially along River Niger, such as Lagdo Dam from Cameroon and other dams also cause flooding in Kogi due to high volume of water.

""We have done a lot of sensitisation and awareness creation to educate the general public, especially the people living in the flood prone areas in all the predicted local government areas.

""We are also partnering with the relevant stakeholders including SEMA to ensure that we are ahead of any emerging situation,"" he said.

He said he had led a team on assessment tour of some affected communities in Lokoja to ascertain the level of damage done by flood in the area and begin to tackle them head on.

The commissioner said the Governor Yahaya Bello administration would not relent in its efforts at tackling environmental challenges including flooding across the state.

He, therefore, advised the people living in the flood prone areas to relocate and move to high grounds in order not to endanger their lives as a result of floods.

The situation is similar in Plateau as the acting Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Rose Dakwar, said that floods had affected seven local government areas in the state recently.

Mrs Dakwar listed the affected local government areas as Mangu, Pankshin, Shendam, Quan Pan, Langtang South, Mikang and Wase.

She said that many farmlands, houses bridges and other valuables were destroyed by the floods in the listed areas.

""We as an emergency management agency, have already visited each of the affected local government areas in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).

""We visited and ascertained the level of damage and reported back to government.

""Government has, therefore, included the affected areas in the distribution of palliatives before the major assistance will come their way,"" she said.

Also, the NEMA Zonal Coordinator in Jos, Eugene Nyenlong, said the agency had composed jingles in local languages to educate the people on how to tackle floods if they occurred.

Mr Nyenlong also disclosed that the agency in the zone was making use of Flood Vanguards comprising youth corps members who raised alarms if flood occurred.

""We also have locals that are engaged to act in terms of response and evacuation when flood occurs,"" he said.

In Niger, not less than 500 communities have been flooded since the onset of the 2020 raining season in the state.

The Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Ahmed Inga, who disclosed this also said about 22 local government areas had so far been affected by the floods.

Mr Inga said 29 deaths were recorded during the floods, while 45,000 farmers were directly affected by the disaster.

""Farmlands and houses have been destroyed and assessment is still ongoing, "" he said.

He said Governor Abubakar Bello had directed the agency to look inward and design a better way of mitigating the situation by relocating the affected communities to safe areas.

The Governor of Niger-State, Abubakar Sani Bello [PHOTO CREDIT: Official Twitter handle of Mr Bello || @abusbello]He said that the state government had identified 13 resettlement sites in Muregi, Akere and Ketso, among others, where the affected communities were being resettled.

He said that compensations had been paid and allocation of plots to the affected communities would soon commence.

The director-general blamed the flooding partly on the situation where the state was home to three hydro-electric dams- Shiroro, Kainji and Jebba, and River Niger and River Kaduna flowing across parts of the state.

Similarly, the Benue Government has assured residents of flood prone areas of its plans to tackle the incessant flooding in communities in the state.

The State Director of Environment, Richarge Azaagee, who disclosed this, said plans were underway to address some of the flooding challenges, especially in Makurdi.

Mr Azaagee denied that the government had abandoned communities suffering from flood related challenges.

He said the government had already identified the causes of flooding in some communities/settlements and was working toward fixing them.

""The problem of erosion and flood is not just in Kaamem community alone, it cuts across many communities in Makurdi and the state at large.

In 2020, Nigeria has dealt with destructive floods that have killed at least 40 and have displaced over 15,000 people. Recently, in September of 2020, intense flooding caused by heavy rainfall in northern Nigeria destroyed thousands of homes and wide areas of crops. As reported by Reuters, the flooding in northern Nigeria has destroyed 90% of the 2 million tons of rice that was expected to be harvested this Autumn. This loss is equivalent to 20% of the rice that Nigeria harvested last year.

Destruction of rice paddies is not the only food-related casualty of these floods. A shortage of maize has made it extremely difficult for chicken farmers to feed their flocks due to the price of chicken feed more than doubling. For Nigeria, rice is the staple grain, and chicken is a core protein. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many movement restrictions and financing difficulties that complicated the spring planting of many crops including maize. The combination of crop-destroying floods and an already existent maize shortage makes it look as if Nigeria is on the brink of a damaging food crisis. Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, told Reuters that “there is a real fear of having food shortages. The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Another effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is on fertilizer. After the virus’s outbreak caused a shutdown of Nigeria’s sole urea plant for two weeks, many farmers opted to skip using fertilizer on their crops, which has limited their crop yields.

Through all of this, the Nigerian government is still doing everything it can to promote domestic food production and local Nigerian farmers, but that may not be enough to sustain a country of nearly 200 million people through a looming food crisis. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that not one cent of the country’s central bank dollars would go towards food or fertilizer imports in an attempt to encourage local farmers and producers over imports. In August 2020, Nigeria took about 4,000 tons of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s strategic stocks (ECOWAS), released 30,000 tons of its own maize, and gave four companies special permission to import maize into the country, according to Reuters. The Nigerian Economic Summit Group has also called for “a complete overhaul” of agricultural policy.

In an interview with Reuters, Nigeria’s Agriculture Minister Muhammad Sabo Nanono said that “there is no question about it that there is an imminent problem with food insecurity, not only in Nigeria, but also in nations all over the world.” He is absolutely correct in that statement. According to a report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) called the Ecological Threat Register (ETR), food security is a major symptom of the ongoing climate crisis that is projected to worsen over the next several decades. By the ETR’s estimates, the global demand for food will increase by 50% by 2050. Approximately two billion people already experience moderate to severe food insecurity currently, and that number is expected to increase to 3.5 billion people by the year 2050. 822 million people currently experience undernutrition globally, leaving them at an extremely high risk of starvation. Additionally, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of food insecurity, at 52% of the population, and 18 of the 20 most food-insecure countries globally are located in the region.

What is happening in Nigeria should sound an alarm for the rest of the world. If the world continues on this trajectory, the climate crisis will only escalate in the coming years and decades. With that will come an increase in natural disasters, with flooding being the most common natural disaster to occur since 1990, according to the ETR. Flooding not only threatens people’s lives and property, but it also threatens the survival and harvestability of important crops, as seen with the current situation in Nigeria. Floods are also not the only natural disasters that will worsen with climate change, but wildfires and storm events like hurricanes will become more frequent and more damaging as well. All of these have the potential to threaten the food security of nations all over the globe. The ETR reports that 22% of countries will face catastrophic food insecurity by the year 2050, which would result in “substantial displacement of people or substantial increase in undernourishment.” That statistic shows that a food crisis like this will not be an event unique to Nigeria but could potentially threaten many other countries across the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst in worsening food security for countries around the globe. The United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) has warned that the number of people facing food insecurity could potentially double by the end of the pandemic. According to the Pullitzer Center, global shutdowns and border closures to curb the virus have caused tightened credit access to farmers, limited access to inputs for farmers, limited food transport services and food imports. Constraints like these have led to surges in food prices and limited many populations’ access to nutritious food. The effects of this can be seen in what is happening in Nigeria, and it has worsened food shortages that the country was already experiencing pre-pandemic.

The other countries of the world who have the means should take this opportunity to send humanitarian aid to Nigeria during this time in order to offset or prevent the looming food crisis. It would also be in the interest of the U.N. and other peacekeeping or human rights focused international organizations to aid Nigeria in any way that is possible so that the situation does not worsen into a debilitating crisis that could threaten millions of lives. The situation in Nigeria is of utmost urgency, so it is important that the international community acts with haste.

Furthermore, in order to take action towards preventing devastating food crises and worsening natural disasters in the future, the most important steps that nations can take is implementing aggressive climate change policies that curb emissions and aim to use cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy. This is especially true for countries who are the world’s biggest emitters and polluters, including but not limited to the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Combatting climate change will require an immense collective effort and continued inaction will only lead to more human suffering in places like Nigeria where people are already seeing the harsh effects of the climate crisis.

The impending food crisis in Nigeria is demonstrative of many issues that the world is facing. Swift action should be taken not only to aid Nigeria in combatting a destructive food crisis, but in the long run, all nations of the world should be putting progressive climate policies into effect. Growing food insecurity is a major symptom of a worsening climate, and the action should be taken now to ensure global food insecurity does not reach frightening levels in the future.","Sat, 19 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,"['farmers', 'climate', 'world', 'food', 'threaten', 'floods', 'push', 'crisis', 'nations', 'nigeria', 'insecurity', 'maize', 'countries', 'shortages']", ,none

In September 2018, heavy rains were experienced in Nigeria which caused severe flooding in 129 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of 12 States which affected 2,321,592 people, based on the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) situation report. An estimated 722,741 people were internally displaced, and 351,236 people had immediate humanitarian needs in food; shelter; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and health.

On 17 September, the NEMA declared a state of emergency in four of the worst-affected states (Niger, Kogi, Anambra and Delta), where thousands of communities had been forced to evacuate from submerged settlements and seek refuge in temporary Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps. As the Niger River continued to flow above danger level, and additional dams were released, a state of emergency also was declared in five more states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Taraba, Kebbi and Adamawa) on 11 October 2018. The flooding situation exceeded thresholds of local capacity to respond to the people in need.

The floods resulted in rapid population displacement, destruction of shelters, extensive losses to livelihoods and the local economy, in addition to high rates of water-borne diseases among the affected population and their host communities. Internally Displaced Persons staying with host communities were particularly susceptible to cholera and other water-borne diseases due to the poor access to potable water, hygiene infrastructure and medical care in those locations. These challenges also impacted displaced people in IDP camps, who similarly lacked access to basic water and sanitation services.

Upon the request of Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), IFRC launched an Emergency Appeal in October 2018 for 5.4 million Swiss francs to support 300,000 flood-affected people in the areas of focus of shelter and non-food items, livelihoods and basic needs; health; WASH; and protection, gender and inclusion (PGI) for 9 months. The objective was to provide lifesaving and recovery interventions in 6 out of the over 18 states in Nigeria affected by flooding. The intervention focused on 6 states identified during the multi-sector needs assessment as those in most need of assistance, namely Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Niger, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The initial plan was to have the affected population supported in an IDP camp setup (schools and health facilities).

However, the flood-affected population moved out of the camps earlier than expected. The government also aimed to vacate the schools that were used to host the IDPs to be vacated to avoid the disruption of the resuming of classes in January 2019. As a result, these changes affected the geographical context of the operation as the flood-affected population dispersed to different Local Government Areas (LGAs) and villages.

The operation had to strategize to ensure planned activities were to be held in their current location. Even though all affected families returned to their communities after the acute phase, the flooding resulted in long-term impacts, including a cholera outbreak in December when IDPs returned to their communities. The devastating loss to livelihoods and trauma of displacement also created psychosocial needs within the affected population.","Mon, 06 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1493663-MDRNG025eafr.png?itok=KHVy4p40,"['states', 'communities', 'n', 'nigeria', 'plan', 'needs', 'report', 'local', 'flood', 'population', 'emergency', 'mdrng025', 'water', 'flooding', 'final', 'displaced', 'response', 'appeal', 'affected']", ,flood

ABUJA, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Death toll has risen to 18 due to the floods caused by persistent rainfall in central Nigeria, said a local official on Wednesday.

Confirming the figure to reporters, Ibrahim Inga, head of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency in Nigeria's central region, said eight more deaths were recorded recently.

On October 16, Inga had earlier confirmed 10 deaths recorded over the past two months as the floods wreaked havoc in the state.

So far, 41,959 people have been displaced due to the disaster, the official said.

The floods, as a result of a localized high-intensity rainfall accompanied by torrential winds since August, also triggered massive run-off activities in streams and rivers in the state.

""The combined effect of the micro-climate trend and severe rainfall regime upstream of rivers Niger and Kaduna increased inflow in the basin, which resulted in the spillage of the water from the three hydropower dams,"" Inga told reporters.

He said 2,714 houses have been destroyed so far by the disaster. The flood swept through 20 local government areas, with 152 communities submerged.

The floods also badly damaged, roads, bridges, culverts and other buildings, the official said.

Inga said the excess waters had inundated several hectares of farmlands and displaced some dwellers in hinterland communities.

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, which is responsible for issuing flood alerts here, had since early August issued an alert over possible flooding due to the high intensity of rainfall across the country.

The hydrological body said the flooding incidents are due to high rainfall intensity of long duration, rainstorms, blockage of drainage systems and poor urban planning resulting from the erection of structures within the floodplains and waterways.

This year, Nigeria's 36 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja, would witness different levels of flooding, the hydrological body predicted.","Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['official', 'death', 'roundup', 'nigerias', 'recorded', 'xinhua', 'rises', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'flood', 'central', 'hydrological', 'disaster', 'inga', 'flooding', '18', 'floods', 'toll', 'rivers']", ,flood

59,59,FL-2018-000120-NGA,The new 'jollof wars' and why Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria for its first Africa base - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/14/the-new-jollof-wars-and-why-twitter-chose-ghana-over-nigeria-for-its-first-africa-base/,"National-World

Twitter’s announcement Monday that it will set up its first Africa base in Ghana, West Africa, has generated fierce debate among Nigerian users of the social media app, and reignited the never-ending rivalry between the two countries, known colloquially as the ‘jollof wars.’

Many Nigerians believe that Twitter’s decision is a snub to the continent’s largest economy, which is seeing rapid growth and investment in its tech scene.

According to NOI polls, 39.6 million Nigerians have a Twitter account, which is more than the entire 32 million population of Ghana.

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey capped a whirlwind tour of Africa in 2019 by pledging to move to the continent for several months in 2020.

Now it seems that his business will make that move first.

In a statement announcing the decision, Twitter described Ghana “as a champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet.”

The social media giant also cited Ghana’s hosting of the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) as another reason for moving there, saying it aligns with “its ambition to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa.”

Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said “the choice of Ghana as headquarters for Twitter’s Africa operations is EXCELLENT news,” and described it as a “beautiful partnership between Ghana and Twitter and which is critical for the dev’t of Ghana’s hugely important tech sector.”

‘No ease of doing business’

Some Nigerians blamed an “inconducive business environment” for Twitter choosing Ghana over Nigeria.

“Under @MBuhari our ease of doing business is so bad that it’s easier for terrorists to get phone lines than law-abiding residents. You can land at Ghana’s Kotoka Airport and get a SIM card at the airport. But a camel has to pass through the eye of a needle to get one in Nigeria,” said Reno Omokri via Twitter, a former presidential aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan.

Omokri was referring to the suspension of new phone lines registration because of a federal government policy to link all active SIM cards in the country to a national identity number (NIN) for security reasons.

The exercise is time consuming and the deadline has been extended multiple times, leaving new arrivals unable to obtain a local number, until at least May.

Another Twitter user, lawyer Moe Odele wrote: “One of our clients wanted to open shop in Nigeria for their West Africa office. Once we sent them a breakdown of the regulatory requirements for their industry (also tech), they hit us with ‘we will get back to you.’ We haven’t heard back since then.”

Another commenter, Onye Ajuju, said Twitter’s decision was justified and that Nigerians had a “bloated sense of entitlement.”

“It’s unbelievable seeing Nigerians throwing a tantrum because Twitter went to Ghana. The lack of awareness of how bad things are in the country, the bloated sense of entitlement, the unhinged expectations that everyone should accept Nigeria’s dysfunction…it’s incredible!” she said.

In 2019, Ghana ranked 13 places higher than Nigeria in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index.

Google,Microsoft and Huawei are among international tech giants that have expanded their operations in Ghana, targeting software developers and young creatives on the continent.

In 2018, Facebook opened its first community hub space in Africa in Nigeria’s commercial city, Lagos, while announcing plans last year to open an operational office also in Lagos, but for tech investors such as Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, there are lessons to be learned if Nigeria will continue to attract much-needed foreign investment.

“We have to think carefully about the reasons why Twitter chose Ghana — not necessarily in the context of whether we want to bring Twitter to Nigeria or not, but in the context of what it will take for us to remain a competitive destination for investors,” Aboyeji told CNN on Tuesday.

“We need to start thinking very carefully about enhancing democracy and the rule of law, freedom of speech, and most importantly, our role in enabling the Africa Free Trade Agreement. It’s not enough for us to just be a big market… We have next door to us, a very competitive neighbor, who’s doing all the right things to make itself the hub of West Africa,” he added.

‘A more productive market’

Another Nigerian tech entrepreneur and investor Bosun Tijani, told CNN that Twitter simply chose a more productive market to run its Africa operations.

“While Nigeria has a huge market that Twitter would love to target, the business environment here is quite demanding… It’s strenuous…the cost of running a business here is high. But with the AfCFTA single market agreement which Africa is signed up to, a company like Twitter can choose to set up shop in a small market like Ghana — that gives the best opportunity for it to operate — and still serve the Nigerian market,” said Tijani, who heads a tech innovation lab, CcHUB.

From tourism to tech, Ghana has been actively courting investors from the diaspora and in particular African-Americans, some of whom were given citizenship and encouraged to return to their roots.

Ghana also ranked as the 43rd most peaceful country in the world, in the 2020 Global Peace Index, placing 104 spots ahead of Nigeria — which grapples with Boko Haram insurgency and periodic outbreaks of violence.","Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['tech', 'market', 'twitter', 'chose', 'nigerians', 'doing', 'west', 'jollof', 'ghana', 'wars', 'nigeria', 'base', 'business', 'africa']", ,flood

Nigeria is approaching the peak of its rainy season, and flooding is expected to hit 15 out of its 36 states this month. The agency has issued a red alert because of above-normal water levels on the country's two largest rivers, the Benue and the Niger.

In August, many communities along the rivers were cut off due to collapsed bridges and impassable roads. Four students were killed when a pedestrian bridge fell at a university in the northern region.

FILE - Houses partially submerged in flood waters are pictured in Lokoja city, Kogi State, Nigeria, Sept. 17, 2018.

With thousands of houses and hectares of farmland and produce destroyed along with schools and shops, the economic impact of this year'sflooding is expected to be high. The country's emergency management agency is stepping in to distribute items like cement bags, blankets and hygiene products.

Peter Odjugo, a professor of geography at Nigeria's University of Benin, works with the Nigerian Meteorological Society. He has been tracking the extreme weather patterns and says the government has repeatedly failed to take preemptive measures to reduce the impact of flooding.

""What they prefer doing or what they are doing now is services after the impact, rather than preventing it from occurring,"" he said.

Odjugo suggests that the silt be removed from the rivers to increase the volume of water they can hold. He also recommends that town planners enforce regulation on where buildings are constructed, saying this is a glaring weak spot across the country.

City regulators look out for buildings being constructed near waterways. Such buildings are often marked with an X, designating an order to stop construction work.

Stella Ojeme, the director for information in the Federal Capital Territory Administration, says that even in the nation's capital ofAbuja, enforcing building codes is a challenge.

""Most of our people will go, buy white paint, paint off the stop work mark,"" she said. ""First of all, you find people [building] where they shouldn't build. You find people build on flood plains. You find some people dump their refuse in the gutter.""

Odjugo says climate change is making a real impact in Nigeria, but the government has not made the issue a priority.

Additional challenges

Additionally, the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency says its weather data collection equipment is being vandalized and stolen.

Clement Eze, the agency's director general, spoke at a workshop last month, asking the public to help stop the illegal activity, as it is hindering the agency's ability to forecast extreme weather.

""We can no longer take readings, maybe accumulated or about a week or two,"" he said. ""Or if there are no resources, it can even take more than six months before we can go back and replenish or repair and this equipment is imported from outside Nigeria.""

During Nigeria's worst flooding in 2012, the Niger River reached a record high level of 12.84 meters. Two million Nigerians were forced from their homes and 363 people were killed, according to the National Emergency Management Agency.","Thu, 05 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-09/RTX6J5VG.jpg,"['floodravaged', 'flooding', 'month', 'stop', 'unprepared', 'buildings', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'nigerian', 'rains', 'communities', 'impact', 'services', 'rivers', 'weather']", ,flood

…Urges residents in coastal areas to relocate, predicts 261 days of rainfall

By Olasunkanmi Akoni

Lagos State Government, yesterday, predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with attendant flooding across the state, even as it directed residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas of the state to move upland to avert needless loss of lives and property.

Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, accompanied by Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, said this at a media briefing on the 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions, and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja.

Bello said: “The forecast for 2021 is based on the informed global consensus that el-Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, is at the cool phase, which will continue till around June and likely give to a dominant el-Nino phase till the end of 2021.

“Generally, the Seasonal Climate Prediction for Lagos State signifies that on-set dates ranged between March 17 in the earliest, and April 6, while the season-ending may range between November 20 and December 5, 2021.

READ ALSO:

“The connotation is that Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while the maximum annual rainfall amount is predicted to be 1,747mm.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Besides, he said the state government is collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NiMET, in downscaling the predictions to all stakeholders.

Also speaking, Mr. Igbokwe, stated that the government planned to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72kilometres spread across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state to checkmate flooding.

“I, therefore, urge residents to support the government to achieve a flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again been littered by residents,” Igbokwe said.

Meteorologist Luke Robinson said there could be significant rain in some areas around west central Montana.

“We are looking at some rain moving into the area starting mid week to the end of the week,” said Robinson. “This week we are looking at some pretty good soaking rains, particularly in southwest Montana and west central Montana. We will see the rivers and streams rising but right now we're not really anticipating any impacts from it.”

Robinson said the cold front will bring accompanying snow to the higher mountain areas.

“This system is moving in, it's going to be relatively cold, so we're actually looking at some accumulating snow in the mountains,” he said. “Those cooler temperatures will cut off all the hot mountain snow melt that we've had the past few days and most of the rise in the rivers and streams will be coming from mid to low level moisture coming into the area.”

Robinson said people who live in areas that usually flood in the spring may be nervous to see the river levels rising.

It could be more of just a nervous thing, right now,” he said. “We're looking at the cresting below flood stage, and that will be sometime Thursday or Friday. But right now we're not expecting any flooding at this at this point.”

By Joseph Erunke

THE Executive Director, Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE, Dr. Ganiyu Agbaje, Tuesday, said Nigeria has improved on its possession of requisite equipment’s to better forecast flood, thereby mitigating the effects.

To this end, he expressed optimism that the negative socioeconomic impacts of flooding in the country would henceforth be mitigated through effective and accurate forecast.

Agbaje, speaking at the opening ceremony of Online Regional Training on Flood Monitoring and Forecasting Modelling, in Abuja, insisted that with the latest technology in the country, it will henceforth be easier to predict flood and locate the people who are really affected, a development he noted, would make the country make informed decision to reduce the disaster associated with the flood.

But he tasked experts on accuracy in their forecast using satellite technology, saying such was necessary in order to monitor flood as well as identify its hotspot areas with a view to making a quick damage assessment.

He spoke as Nigeria joined other West African nations to adopt satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

He explained that the training was held to equip participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-hotspot areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse which is a major cause of flooding in Africa.

Hear him:“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction but more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower in Nigeria and other countries.”

According to him, the training was not to teach participants how to predict but to show them how to use additional satellite data to do their prediction better and support other methods.

He said that the technology has been on for a while around the world, adding that African leaders in collaboration with the EU initiated the training to help Africa better monitor the environment and mitigate disasters.

Agbaje said that with the data, rainfall, rivers and the environment will be better monitored, adding that in the case of Nigeria, more information on the activities of River Niger will be known using the technology.

“We need to support our rural communities on how best use flood when it occurs because at times if it coming far away from this country, you can harness the water overflowing for many other things in agriculture. In raining season, you can channel it for irrigation.

“We are feeling the economic impact of this disaster. We are looking at riverine flooding. You know our people settle along the rivers. And they have their livelihoods there; they are farmers and can’t come to towns,” he added.

The three-day training, which holds simultaneously in four other West African countries, was backed by the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) under its Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) initiative.

It was conducted by the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE.

Also speaking at the event, the GMES & Africa Programme Coordinator at the African Union Commission, Dr. Tidiane Ouattara, who joined via video conferencing, expressed joy that the activities of the CSSTE consortium was able to continue despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Emphasising the need for the constant training of young people and experts on the African continent, he described the training as a major achievement that would help Africa to build infrastructure and reduce the economic damage of flooding.

Participants at the workshop were drawn from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

In their separate goodwill messages, representatives of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said the training is aimed at building the capacity of stakeholders to better utilise satellite technology in providing accurate, timely and easily assessable information to improve the management of the environment.

FLOODS

Heavy rains have been recorded in West and Central Africa in the past weeks, including in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Senegal, leading to devastating floods that have killed dozens and displaced thousands of people. In Niger, 329,958 people had been affected by flooding with 65 deaths. About 31,960 houses have collapsed and 5,768 hectares of farmland destroyed. Maradi, Dosso, Tahoua and Niamey are the most affected regions. In 2019, at the same time, 35,384 people were affected across the country.

In northern Nigeria, thousands of homes and wide areas of crops have been destroyed in recent flooding in the states of Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi and Sokoto. More than 30 people reportedly have died. In Borno State, about 26,000 people, including IDPs, have been affected by heavy flooding across camps and communities. Borno and Adamawa states remain at risk of heavy flooding according to the Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) released by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) in June.

In Chad, some 188,915 people (37,783 households) were affected by flooding in the central and southern provinces, in the Lac and N’Djamena respectively. Large pieces of farmland are inundated with a potential impact on food security and livelihoods.

In Senegal, an emergency aid plan has been activated following exceptional rains in the capital Dakar and large part of the country that caused devastating floods on 5 September. At least four people were killed, the exact number of the people affected is yet to be determined.

Mali has also seen severe flooding that began in July. By early August, more than 13,200 people, including 5,400 internally displaced persons, were affected by floods in the country. The worst affected regions are Gao, Mopti, Ségou and Sikasso. A total of 1,160 homes have been destroyed.

In Cameroon, more than 30,000 people have been affected by floods caused by heavy rains in Far North, West, Coastal, South and South-West regions, destroying homes, washing away livestock and devastating plantations.

Heavy rainfall at the end of July caused rivers to overflow in the Far North, affecting over 5,000 people. More flooding was recently reported in the area, with over 1,500 families displaced around Maroua.

Flooding also affected the city of Douala and surrounding areas of Littoral region in the South-West after a torrential downpour on 21 August 2020.

In Ghana, roads, bridges, homes and farmland were inundated in the Northern and North East Regions due to heavy rainfall and releases from the Bagre Dam in neighbouring Burkina Faso, which began in mid-August 2020. At least eight people have lost their lives. The spillage was necessary due to a sharp increase in the water level. Several areas remain inaccessible, making assessments impossible.

In Burkina Faso, three people died in Kaya, Centre-Nord after heavy rainfall on 4 September. Earlier flooding affected the capital Ouagadougou, reportedly killing one person and damaging houses and property.

Early warning systems, contingency planning and local action can strengthen West Africa’s responses to increasingly frequent severe flooding, but more investment is needed in forecasting, panelists said in a recent webinar organized by the African Development Bank.

“We need to explore new and innovative approaches to better forecast and communicate floods and early warning information,” said Anthony Nyong, the Bank’s Director for Climate Change and Green Growth, in his opening remarks for the webinar Flood Forecasting and Early Warning in West Africa: Gaps, Innovation, and Lessons Learned.

In 2019 alone, extreme flooding caused the displacement of up to 5.1 million people in Africa, including 3.8 million from countries experiencing food insecurity. West Africa is a hotspot for extreme weather due to its long coastline, which is home to densely populated low-lying cities and economic hubs, from Lagos to Abidjan and Dakar.

This year, floods in eight West African countries affected over 750,000 people and claimed at least 100 lives. With rapid urbanization and increasing climate risks, the impact of floods in the region will likely accelerate over the next five decades.

The November 19 webinar, organized by the Bank’s Clim-Dev Africa Special Fund, brought together experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Senegal’s national meteorological agencies to provide an update on flood forecasting and early warning systems (EWS) in West Africa.

A representative for the Niger Basin Authority discussed regional collaboration on flood forecasting among its nine members. The event included a panel discussion with leading experts from the Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.

“We know that flood EWS is a crucial flood management tool, comprising key components of disaster risk knowledge, monitoring, and forecasting-as well as communication and response. Yet, little is being done to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and operationalize flood forecasts and early warning systems,” said James Kinyangi, Coordinator of the Clim-Dev Fund.

Ousmane N’diaye, Director of Senegal’s National Meteorological Agency, said that better preparedness through climate information and multi-disciplinary planning targeting vulnerable populations is crucial to saving lives and property. He emphasized the importance of early forecasting and the use of social media platforms to broadcast alerts and provide real-time weather information in local languages.

Michael Talhami of the Red Cross said acting early and anticipating risk would reduce human exposure to disaster. All too often, he said, local actors and humanitarian organizations have to work with weather and climate data that is dated, of poor quality, or non-existent. One example is the abandonment of hydrometeorological data collection in rural Mali, which has had detrimental consequences for emergency preparedness and response.

The Bank’s Institutional Support to African Climate Centers Project (ISACIP) has invested over $35 million to improve climate information services throughout Africa since 2010. As a follow-up to ISACIP, the Bank, through the Clim-Dev Fund, is investing over $27 million in regional and country operations to modernize Africa’s climate and weather infrastructure and provide high-quality and reliable data.","Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['green', 'improve', 'head', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'flood', 'growth', 'forecasting', 'west', 'early', 'warning', 'million', 'plan', 'preparedness', 'information', 'africa', 'weather']", ,flood

In 2020, flooding has affected 2.7 million people in 18 countries in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact has been particularly severe, and the number of people affected is more than double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, recent flooding have occurred in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This year 197,000 houses were reported destroyed in thirteen countries of the region. 422,000 hectares of farmland were affected by floods, which resulted in the destruction of crops and fields, threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions were already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities have led the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organizations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO has supported the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million.

By Robert Reid, Iguniwari Thomas Ekeu-Wei, and Zirra Banu

Ibadan is the third most populous city in Nigeria—Africa’s largest country in terms of population and economy. This city of six million also happens to be the country’s largest in terms of geographic area, but like many other cities, urbanization is largely uncontrolled, and people are exposed to disasters like floods.

We had the opportunity to experience Nigeria’s creativity and innovation in Lagos city, when the World Bank partnered with Co-Creation Hub and other players to organize a hackathon that focused on leveraging data and technology to improve accountability and service delivery in governance. People, including data and software engineers, professional and academic experts, and civil servants, came together to develop solutions for improved policy, governance and development impact.

The Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project (IUFMP) —set up to tackle the city’s urban resilience challenges—submitted datasets for the hackathon, and one of the teams that worked on the data from the project emerged as winner in February, 2020. Teams developed a geospatial visualization platform to overlay and view the datasets from the geodatabases created as part of the Ibadan city, and flood and drainage masterplans preparation, demonstrating how the government and other stakeholders can use insights from geospatial data to accelerate effective decision making in urban planning, flood risk and environmental management. With this open data, the state government can now use up-to-the-minute information to identify, manage, prevent, and prepare for flood risks, and other ensuing impacts from floods.

Building on this with support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and with the collaboration of technical initiatives from experts in Ibadan and around Oyo state, the project scaled up the use of data for flood risk management and developed an advanced geospatial visualization platform that empowers the government to seamlessly apply geospatial data in daily operations.

This innovation strengthens the capacity of the Oyo state government to manage flood risk and inform decision making in other sectors in Ibadan using data, coupled with previous capacity building efforts, gigabytes of geospatial data available and GIS innovation laboratories have been setup under the project. The labs established at the department of Urban Renewal Enforcement Monitoring and Compliance and Office of the Surveyor General under the Oyo State Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. The Project Implementation Unit has been equipped with computers, servers, printers, plotters and software needed to apply these datasets in decision making. These datasets, which are publicly available via an advanced geospatial visualization platform, now strategically inform technical decision making and engagements. This enhances urban resilience and disaster risk management, aligning strongly with the Oyo State Government’s E-governance Program and leveraging internet connectivity infrastructure provided by the government in locations where the labs are present to facilitate data exchange.

From the people to policy—students sparking innovation

In August, the University of Ibadan and the project signed a formal memorandum of understanding, to foster capacity development, knowledge exchange and promote long-term project sustainability through collaborative research, data information exchange, internship programs for students, short courses and training programs for government staff and other professionals, and all-round collaborations that bridge the academic-policy-industry gap through open data and innovation.

With the rising thirst for innovative responses to managing flood risks in Ibadan, the University of Ibadan, in collaboration with the project, GIS Konsult Limited and other partners hosted the second season of the Ibadan Geo-Hackathon completed in November with the theme, “Ibadan Urban Resilience,” leveraging the advanced geospatial visualization platform and geodatabases to deliver solutions focusing on three thematic areas: risk-informed decision making, urban resilient design, and innovative technology solutions for urban resilience. The winning submissions for the respective categories include: Smart Citi, a web-based application for automated flood-risk assessment and waste management,, and Flood Health Risk Mapper an industrial research innovation, and Fire Incidents - A Reoccurring Menace, a story on disaster resilience. The city of Ibadan has now developed two comprehensive masterplans: A Flood Risk Management and Drainage Masterplan and a City Masterplan. Both documents create a vision for resilient and sustainable urban development in the face of climate change, identifying opportunities to boost inclusive economic development, and identify and prioritize the structures most at risk of failing (bridges, culverts, drainages, dam, etc.) to strengthen the government's capacity to detect and respond more effectively to floods, and build resilience long-term. The amount of data, maps and information generated by these master plans is vast. They include spatial datasets, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) topography, high resolution aerial imagery, and outputs of urban analytics, hydrological and hydraulic modelling. By making this information accessible to the public, it becomes useful for many stakeholders, and will inform individuals, private sector, and government decision making to better manage risks and improve urban development.

Open data for innovation and entrepreneurship in development

Entrepreneurship is on the rise—and so is innovation and collaboration for the benefit of all. With data open and publicly accessible, businesses, academia and university students alike can utilize information for research and development. This innovation helps civil servants in their work as they tactically tackle disaster and urban development challenges. In turn, the increased resilience helps everyone from kindergarteners to tailors, and keeps the city’s six million people protected from preventable disaster risks. That’s the impact of open data, open governance, and effective resilience building—all together, they spark cooperation, preparedness and innovation for the benefit of everyone.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['data', 'geospatial', 'sparked', 'urban', 'ibadan', 'hackathon', 'flood', 'innovation', 'making', 'risk', 'resilience', 'cities', 'project', 'largest', 'western', 'african']", ,flood

The floods are also the worst in the state since 1988, residents and state officials told PREMIUM TIMES, amidst fears the floods could worsen Nigeria’s current food insufficiency that has led to an increase in prices of basic food like rice.

The Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) said the deaths occurred in about 19 local government areas of the state

Hadejia Emirate, with eight council areas, is the worst hit, the executive secretary of SEMA, Sani Yusuf, told PREMIUM TIMES.

Mr Yusuf said the deaths were recorded since the commencement of the current rainy season.

“These are the number of deaths so far reported to the agency since the beginning of this rainy season,” he said.

He explained that the agency, with federal government support, is doing the needful to cushion the effects of the disaster by providing emergency needs to the victims of the flood.

He added that the agency has so far distributed 30 canoes to communities affected by the flood, as well as materials to the affected communities to build embankments in order to control the water.

Worst Flood in over 30 years

Hamza Muhammad, special assistant to Governor Muhammad Badaru on community development and social inclusion, said this year’s flood is the worst since 1988 with Hadejia emirate as the worst affected area.

He listed the affected local governments as Buji, Hadejia, Ringim, Taura, Jahun, Miga, Malammadori, Auyo, Kafinhausa and Guri.

Others include Gwaram, Kiyawa, Kaugama, Birninkudu, kirikasamma, Garki and Babura.

Cause of flood

Mr Muhammad attributed the cause of the flood to an overflow of Tiga and Challawa dams in Kano State as well as effects of climate change.

He also said torrential rainfall, as earlier forecast by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, contributed to the disaster.

In an earlier report done by this newspaper, Isa Mustapha, the executive director, Exceptional Leadership and Integrity Promotion, listed the major causes of the flood as insufficient drainage channels, silted dams, weeds, trypa grass overgrowing on river channels and river beds, as well as illegal diversion and encroachment of waterways.

Other causes, according to Mr Mustapha, include lackadaisical attitude towards the desiltation of the Hadeija-Yobe Kwamadugu River basin, as well as poor coordination among stakeholders on the control of the menace of flood.

Government’s intervention

Mr Muhammad said the state government has been doing its best since January 2020 to prevent the flood including directing officials to conduct a survey in flood-prone areas of the state.

He said the government had also deployed water pumping machines to the affected communities to evacuate the flooded water.

“Where we cannot use the machines to evacuate the water, we organized self help groups in such communities and empower them with tools for embarkment,” he said.

Affected communities deny government’s intervention

Contrary to Mr Muhammad’s claims, residents of the affected communities said the government is not doing enough.

They accused the government of not providing any remedial measures to help mitigate the impact of the flood.

Mr Mustapha and some officials of SEMA, while on an assessment visit to some of the flooded areas on Monday, were mobbed by angry residents who decried the government’s negligence of the areas.

One of the vehicles conveying the officials got damaged while journalists trying to take footage of the flooded areas were also chased away by the angry residents.

Impact of Flooding on Food Production

Officials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, are already lamenting the impact of the flood on food production in Jigawa, and Nigeria, especially rice production.

Jigawa is one of the states that has benefitted most from the federal government’s Anchors Borrowers Programme to assist farmers boost rice production in the country.

Mr Muhammad, the governor’s aide, expressed the fear that the state may experience food shortage, saying that “Sixty-five per cent of Fadama farmland were washed away by the flood especially in Hadejia where much anticipated rice is expected.”

He added that grains like millet, maize and sorghum were also lost to the flood.

Officials could not give the exact number of farmlands and houses that were destroyed by the flood but said the damage is unprecedented while assessment is ongoing.

In his reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari described this year’s flood in Jigawa as ”unprecedented and devastating.”

In a statement by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, Mr Buhari, on Tuesday, sympathised with the victims of the flood while assuring them of federal government’s intervention.

He described the flood, which has reportedly destroyed over 100,000 hectares of rice farms in the state, as a setback to agriculture especially rice production which his administration has actively promoted and discouraged its importation.

The price of rice has also doubled in the past few months across Nigeria due to various reasons including the floods affecting rice-producing states like Jigawa and Kebbi.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/09/Jigawa-flood.jpg?fit=718%2C405&ssl=1,"['experiences', 'affected', 'destroyed', 'flood', 'governments', 'food', 'farms', 'dead', 'muhammad', 'communities', 'worst', 'jigawa', '40', 'officials', 'state', 'maize', 'rice']", ,flood

As of 25 September, flooding has affected around 1.7 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected exceeding last year’s totals, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains are expected to subside in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, they will affect more areas in Central Africa. Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. Due to the frequency and scale of the incidents, additional support is often required. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.","Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1537011-WCA%202020%20Flooding%20Snapshot_20020925.png?itok=IBDn7ASh,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', '25', 'floods', 'communities', 'impact', 'million', 'insecurity', 'niger', 'affected', 'africa']", ,flood

The training, organised by the Centre for Space Science & Technology Education (CSSTE) was part of the Multi-Scale Flood Monitoring and Assessment Services for West Africa (MiFMASS) project under the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) Support Programme which seeks to help Nigeria and other West African nations to adopt a new system of utilising satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

Participants were mainly technical operational staff from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

The training, which holds simultaneously across four other West African countries, aimed at equiping participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-prone areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model, as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

According to the Lead of the CSSTE Consortium, Dr Ganiyu Agbaje, the training was in alignment with one of the major pillars of the GMES & Africa support programme, which was capacity building, and this had led the CSSTE consortium to identify strategic training needs of its collaborating stakeholders on the MIFMASS project with the aim to train and empower them to sustain the product and service outcomes after the lifetime of the programme.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, a major cause of flooding in Africa.

“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here,’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of the Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction and more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower,” he said.

Dr. Agbaje, who also doubles as the Executive Director of the African Regional Centre for Space Science & Technology Education – English (ARCSSTE-E) in Ile-Ife, added that GMES & Africa is a joint initiative of the African Union and the European Union to harness the benefits of earth observation (satellite) data for inherent environmental challenges in Africa and their own MiFMASS project is one of the many ongoing research and development projects under the programme.

He pledged that two more training courses will be held as the consortium prepares for the conclusion of the project and the handover of its products and services to relevant agencies.

“This is the third in the series of our training and we have two more to go,” he said.","Thu, 11 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/flood.jpg,"['world', 'flood', 'african', 'management', 'west', 'technology', 'mifmass', 'guardian', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'services', 'monitoring', 'agencies', 'training', 'project', 'africa', 'satellite']", ,flood

At the Official Presentation of the outlook in Abuja, the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, noted that the outlook was a fallout from the devastating effect of the 2012 flood in the country.

He said the purpose of the outlook was to present probable flood scenarios for this year and to disseminate information to all, especially in flood-prone areas and further reduce resultant effects.

He said flood is one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria with devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on flood plains for livelihoods.

He said although the flood outlook had shown that 2020 floods might not be as severe as previous years, it was important for all stakeholders to carry out an aggressive awareness campaign for preparedness.

“It is pertinent to note that the impending flooding season with COVID-19 presents a fight against two threats; on one hand, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and on the other hand, the likelihood of an active 2020 flood season.

“The 2020 flood projections will as expected vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country.

“Overall, the flood level may not be as severe as previous years, but it is a certainty that our rivers will exceed flood level and many will be inundated again this year.”

The minister said as always, flooding was associated with increased risk of infections when the displaced persons were high and polluted water sources, added that it was important for all stakeholders to prepare earnestly.

He added that part of the intervention to promote hygiene was the recently signed Executive Order 009 by the President Muhammadu Buhari aimed at ending Open Defecation by 2025.

“Many state governors have bought into this idea, the ministry declared emergency in the water and sanitation sector to encourage hand washing and put in place the National WASH Response Committee for COVID -19,” he said.

The minister also commended the efforts of NIHSA in the development of a new Flood Mobile App, saying that it would add practical value to water managers and for overall disaster risks management.

The NIHSA’s Director-General, Clement Nze, said the 2020 AFO would go beyond borders and defer all barriers to reach the needy in providing information on early flood warnings required for mitigating risks in the country.

Mr Nze noted that the need to carry out aggressive sensitisation and awareness campaigns on consistent clearing of all waterways and maintenance of dams and reservoirs to ensure free flow of water in drainages.

The D-G said the Flood Mobile App would also be used to give actual daily flood situations to everyone, especially those at the rural areas through the use of SMS services.

The new Flood Mobile App is designed to be of practical value to the Water Managers, Technical Experts, Disaster Risk Managers, Policy Makers and Flood Forecasting Community for flood prevention and for enhancing flood early warning systems in Nigeria.

83,83,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Lagos flood alert: Heeding the augurs - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/lagos-flood-alert-heeding-the-augurs/,"By Kayode Ojewale

SIR: Flooding does not just suddenly happen; it is usually preceded by some occurrences hinting its imminent arrival. When the flow of rain water on its way to the drainage channels or river is impeded, then flooding occurs. Flooding is having too much water in the wrong place. The cause of flooding is mainly man-made because of our unclean environmental habits. With just few days of rains, some parts of Lagos are flooded. How will residents of these areas, especially flood-prone areas fare when the peak of rainy season which usually comes with attendant flooding eventually arrives? The omens of flooding are here with us coupled with the warnings issued by appropriate authorities; are we heeding the augurs?

What’s the end gain if the rains, meant to bless us and water our plants, turn out to damage our crops, properties and even destroy lives due to our actions and inactions? Does it appear many have forgotten the losses, pains and agony that accompanied the ravaging heavy rains which caused disasters in different parts of the country in 2012, the year of flood fury?

Of recent, it is observed that sometimes the rains no longer pre-inform or send any signal before its arrival through warnings like cloudy sky, windy atmosphere and dark clouds. Rather, it will just begin to rain suddenly without any pre-notification and it will pour heavily. That’s another indication that the rains this year would be in a different dimension.

On April 14, the Lagos State government predicted high intensity high of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello.

“…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm”.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding”, he further added.

As a way of checkmating the looming flood, the state government plans to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72 kilometers spread across all the Local Government Areas of the State.

Flood alerts and warnings are usually issued to sensitize residents and the authorities on the need to prepare. Ignoring these warnings or not heeding the flood alerts may come with deadly consequences. In order to be prepared for the predicted floods, agencies in charge of disaster management and emergencies should be ready to ensure safety of lives during the peak of the rainy season.

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lagos-flood.jpg,"['residents', 'rainy', 'warnings', 'water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'days', 'heeding', 'flow', 'lagos', 'alert', 'rains', 'state', 'areas', 'augurs']", ,flood
84,84,FL-2018-000120-NGA,ACAPS Briefing Note: Nigeria - Floods (26 September 2018) - Nigeria - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/acaps-briefing-note-nigeria-floods-26-september-2018,"Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, river levels in most of the 12 affected states remain high due to flooding, which has affected 441,251 people, and displaced 141,369 people between late August and 24 September. A total of 108 deaths and 192 injuries have been reported as of late August. Rainfall is expected to continue for the next week. Rivers and Bayelsa states are estimated to be amongst the worst affected states where water levels continue to rise. Initial assessments indicate that 13,031 homes were damaged or destroyed across all affected states as of late August. Shelter, food, NFIs and medical assistance continue to be key needs for the affected population

Crisis impact

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, widespread flooding due to ongoing rainfall has affected 441,250 people and displaced 141,400 people in Adamawa, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Delta, Edo, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Niger, Rivers, and Taraba states since late August (NEMA 24/09/2018; ERCC; 24/09/2018).

As of 24 September, flooding across 12 states and 50 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in central and southern Nigeria has caused 108 deaths and 192 injuries (NEMA 24/09/2018). Across all affected states, there is an urgent need for shelter, with around 13,000 houses damaged (NEMA 24/09/2018). The affected population has lost household and personal belongings. The floods have caused considerable damage to agricultural land across Nigeria, with 122,653 hectares of agricultural land destroyed. In addition to shelter, there is an urgent need for food, NFIs and medicine (NEMA 24/09/2018). The flooding is widespread and situation is rapidly evolving. As assessments are ongoing, the number of the affected people is expected to further increase.

Initial assessments indicate that Rivers and Bayelsa are amongst the most affected states. Water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa. As of 24 September, water levels in lower Benue state have subsided to 10m, compared to 11m on 21 September.

The Niger River at Lokoja city, Kogi state, has not receded, as it recorded water levels of 11.05m on 24 September (NEMA 24/09/2018). Light to moderate rainfall is expected to continue until early October.

Shelter: Flooding has displaced around 141,400 people across the 12 affected states, of which 80,600 people are estimated to be living with friends and family (NEMA 24/09/2018). Over 13,000 houses have been partially or totally damaged. IDPs have relocated to emergency shelters, such as LGA offices, schools, stadiums and churches.

Some of the affected population is staying in IDP camps that have been recently constructed by the Presidential Committee on Flood Relief and Rehabilitation (NEMA 21/09/2018). As assessments are ongoing, and water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa states, the amount of houses damaged, which are typically built with mud and thatch roods, is likely to increase (IFCR 23/09/2018). The affected population are in urgent need of shelter support and NFIs, such as blankets, mats, hygiene kits and kitchen sets (IFCR 23/09/2018).

Livelihood: New estimates indicate that 122,653 hectares of agricultural land have been flooded across central and southern Nigeria. Crops were destroyed before the harvesting season begins in October (NYTimes 17/08/2018). This makes the affected population more vulnerable to food insecurity, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of farmers. Flooding is also likely to affect other livelihoods, such as fishers and petty traders.

Food: There continues to be an urgent need for food assistance for IDPs across all affected states. Severe flood damage to agricultural crops means there is a risk that some communities will experience increased food insecurity throughout the harvest season. (Daily Trust 20/09/2018). There are still no reports on whether markets that have been flooded and closed. Transportation of food is likely to be severely restricted because main roads have been flooded.

Health: Since the publication of the briefing note on 21 September, 192 injuries have been reported since late August. Flood affected victims are likely to be in urgent medical care, as result of injuries and the risk of outbreaks made worse due to the extensive flooding. Health care support is particularly needed in IDP camps (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The risk that diarrhoea and cholera will spread remains high, as water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa, and have mostly not subsided in other communities.

Particularly in more populated areas, and overcrowded IDP camps where WASH facilities are inadequate, there continues to be a high concern for cholera to spread further. There have been reports of an increase in diarrhoea cases in four of the flood affected states (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of geographical information and data indicating which states are affected by the spike in diarrhoea cases. 27,927 cases of suspected cholera were reported between 1 January and 10 September countrywide (NCDC 10/09/2018). Between 1 January and 10 September, suspected cholera cases were reported in the flood affected states of Adamawa (2,002), Anambra (23), Bayelsa (no data), Benue (no data), Delta (no data), Edo (no data), Kebbi (198), Kogi (102), Kwara (no data), Niger (547), Rivers (no data), and Taraba (no data). (NCDC 10/09/2018). In Adamawa, an increase of 119 suspected cholera cases was observed between 17-23 September, most likely due to flooding facilitating the spread (Adamawa State Ministry of Health 23/09/2018)

As flooding has not receded, the escalation of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and-or West Nile fever remains a concern (WHO 2018). The Government recently confirmed that the malaria cases have increased due to the floods (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The current malaria incidence in Nigeria is 380.8/1,000 (2015) (PMI 2017). A distribution of mosquito nets for the flood affected population has been identified as a key priority (NEMA 24-09-2018 NaijaNews 18/09/2018).

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, there have been additional reports in local media sources that indicate antenatal care for pregnant women remains a key concern. This was reported in Uzanu community, Estako East LGA, Edo state and in Ogbaru, Amambra.

There is a need for psychosocial support, as flood victims have lost or been separated from their loved ones (IFCR 23/09/2018).

WASH: The displaced population is still staying in emergency shelters, such LGA offices, stadiums, schools and churches, which have inadequate sanitation facilities and are in urgent need of safe water. In most of the affected states, water sources have been contaminated by flooding (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of data on the potential amount of damaged water points.

Education: Schools continue to be used as evacuation centres across all affected states. On 18 September, primary and secondary schools were closed in Ogbaru, Southern Anambra state as a safety measure, following floods that displaced more than 1,1000 people (OCHA 24/09/2018). Considering the ongoing flooding, it is likely that many schools have been damaged by flooding (Premium Times 19/09/2018).

Protection: While there is no disaggregated data available on the amount of women and girls affected by the floods, it is likely that this group is disproportionately affected.

Women and girls that are displaced and staying in IDP camps continue to be at increased risk to gender-based violence. Overcrowding at IDP camps, with a lack of privacy and inadequate toilets and washing facilities, increases the risks and vulnerability of women and girls to gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (UNHCR 12/2017; OCHA 2016).

Impact on critical infrastructure

Since the start of the rainy season, in June, main roads have been flooded and bridges collapsed (Vanguard 15/09/2018). As water levels have not subsided and heavy rainfall is expected to continue until the beginning of October, main roads continue to be flooded across all affected states.

Power and telecommunications are affected in some of the flood-affected states. The Okpai Gas Independent Power Plant in Ndokwa East Council, Delta State, with power supply to Aso Villa, Abuja has been flooded (TheGuardian 25/09/2018). Communities in Kdokwa West and Ukwuani councils are also affected by the power cut.

Some LGA offices in affected are also likely to be impacted, as they are being used as emergency shelters for the flood affected population.","Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1171619-20180925_acaps_briefing_note_nigeria_floods_update_i_0.png?itok=EOQvdbLy,"['2018', 'data', 'likely', 'water', '26', 'flooding', 'continue', 'nema', 'flood', 'floods', 'states', 'levels', 'note', 'nigeria', 'briefing', 'affected', 'acaps']", ,flood
85,85,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Nigeria: Food Security Threatened As Floods Destroy Farms - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202009030184.html,"Fear of food crisis is heightening in Nigeria following massive floods that are ravaging crop farms in many parts of the country.

Many farmlands were reportedly destroyed by floods in Kebbi, Zamfara, Niger, Rivers, C/Rivers, Sokoto, Bauchi and some parts of Kwara State.

Rice and maize farmlands were most affected and farmers fear this could further hike the prices of the staple food in the country.

A Daily Trust market survey showed that prices of food items are already going up in the market.

In Kano, a 100kg of maize now costs N20,000, N22,000 in Benue, N24, 000 in Abuja and as high as N25,000 in Lagos State.

The same size of maize sold between N9, 000 and N11, 000 last year across the country.

Also, 100kg of local rice now costs N55,000 in Kano, N58,000 in Abuja, while prices of beans range from N22,000 to N24, 000 per 100kg depending on the market and state.

- The warnings -

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had warned that the current water level in the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin portends some level of concern for Nigeria as there could be a likelihood of river flooding in the states contiguous to River Niger.

The states, according to the Agency, are Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The Director-General of the agency, Engr. Clement Onyeaso Nze said the country through Kebbi State might be flooded beginning from September 6

Reports from Kebbi had shown that several hectares of rice farms were washed away by flood and similar incidence was also reported in some parts of Zamfara, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kwara, Cross Rivers, Rivers and Niger states.

The incident is already a source of concern for stakeholders in the food sector as they are expressing fears that if the ugly trend continues, there might be food crisis in the country.

In Kebbi State, over 500,000 hectares of farmlands were reported to have been destroyed by flood.

The Chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, Sani Dododo, who announced the incident said rice farms accounted for about 450,000 of the hectares while the remaining 50,000 were for other crops.

- Farmers narrate ordeal -

It was reported that farmers in Kebbi State lost over N5 billon to the flood.

A victim and female rice farmer in the state, Lubabatu Bunza, said she lost about 16,000 hectares to the recent flood in the state.

Also, Mallam Isa Ahman, another victim from Patigi LGA of Kwara State, said early last month, flood washed away about six hectares of his rice farm and four hectares of his maize farm.

The farmer said he obtained a loan from a commercial bank and invested on the farm, saying it would be difficult to repay the loan.

Many of the affected farmers in Kebbi and Niger states said they got their inputs from the Anchor Borrowers' Programme of the federal government and wondered how they would be able to repay the loans.

President of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Ibrahim Kabiru, said even though it would be difficult to ascertain the damages done to the farms by the flood across the country, the trend portents a great danger ahead.

He said the flood-affected rice, maize, sorghum and other crops in the affected states.

According to him, the situation was being worsened by the insecurity in the rural areas where the farms are located.

The farmers' leader had earlier warned that bandits were preventing farmers from accessing their farms, which he said was a dangerous pointer to food security.

Mr. Mathew Ajayi, a food security expert told Daily Trust on phone yesterday that already the country was nearing food crisis as this could be seen in the skyrocketing prices of food items across the country.

""It is obvious that we are approaching a serious food crisis considering the rising prices of food items across the country.

""And now look at the flood ravaging the farms' couple with the bandits chasing away farmers from their farms,"" he said.

Alhaji Muktar Umar, a farmer and local rice miller in Sabo-Wuse, Niger State, told Daily Trust on phone Wednesday that the country might experience serious rice crisis this year because of the flood incidence and security challenges threatening the farmers.

""From my experience as a farmer, I know many people go into rice farming this year but the farms are being washed away by the flood.

""Many farmers can no longer go to their farms now, most especially here in Niger State,"" he said.

- Buhari orders release of food items from reserves -

President Muhammadu Buhari said Wednesday that the flood disaster in Kebbi State had exposed the country to a major setback in the efforts to boost local food production.

Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed concerns over the heavy floods that took a number of lives, submerged thousands of hectares of farmlands and houses, destroying farm produce and personal belongings in the affected communities.

The president said: ""I am particularly sad over this incident because it is a setback to our efforts to boost local rice production as part of measures to stop food importation.

""Kebbi State is the focal point of our policy to produce rice locally as part of this administration's commitment to agricultural revival, which suffered relative neglect in favour of food importation.

""With the loss of six lives and still counting; thousands of hectares of land flooded and estimated economic losses of more than one billion naira by rice farmers in Kebbi State, we face a major setback in our efforts to boost local food production.

""This bad news couldn't have come at a worse time for our farmers and other Nigerians who looked forward to a bumper harvest this year in order to reduce the current astronomical rise in the costs of food items in the markets.""

The president, while sympathising with the bereaved families and farmers affected by the devastating floods, assured that ""we are going to work closely with the Kebbi State government in order to bring relief to the victims.""

In another statement yesterday by Shehu, Buhari expressed the concern of his administration about the sudden spiral of food prices at a time when the economy was already mired in a slowdown occasioned by the global coronavirus situation.

Buhari, however, assured Nigerians that the situation was transient.

He said his administration had already begun looking and putting in place measures to ameliorate the situation.

""While Providence has been kind to us with the rains and as such an expectation that a bumper harvest would lead to crashing of food prices and ease the burdens on the population, the government's concern is that the exploitative market behaviour by actors has significantly increased among traders in the past few years and may make any such relief a short-lived one.

""This year has indeed tested us in ways that globalisation has never been tested since the turn of the century.

""These challenges have disrupted lives and supply chains all over the world and Nigeria has not been spared.

""The effect has been deeply felt in the delays encountered in the procurement of raw materials for local production of fertilizer (damaging standing crops before harvest) and the speculative activities by a number of rice processors who are ready to pay for paddy at any price to keep their mills running non-stop.

""But of all these problems, the most worrisome is the activities of ""corrupt"" middlemen (with many of them discovered to be foreigners) and other food traders who serve as the link between farmers and consumers found to be systematically creating an artificial scarcity so that they can sell at higher prices.

""In dealing with these problems, the administration has, in line with its ease of doing business mantra, avoided imposing stockholding restrictions in order not to discourage investments in modern warehousing and cold storage.

""The president has just approved the release of food items from the strategic reserves, including 30,000 tons of maize to animal feeds producers to ease the high cost of poultry production.

""President Buhari's administration has raised some of these issues with the various food producer associations involved, particularly those of rice and other grains.

""With their cooperation, the high food prices should soon be a thing of the past.

""In addition, investments in the agro-allied sector by the private sector will significantly increase domestic production of farming inputs especially fertilizer, further crash prices, create employment and ease the pressure on our foreign reserves.

""One of these major investments is the Dangote Fertilizer plant, which is projected to come on stream by the 4th quarter of 2020,"" the president said.

- Experts suggest ways out -

The National President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Arc. Ibrahim Kabiru noted that to mitigate the effect of these calamities on the food system or food security, farmers should be encouraged to embark on full-scale dry season farming, which could lead to all-year-round farming

He advised that government should expand the nation's irrigable lands by investing more in water resources.

He also advised farmers to quickly plant alternative crops that require little time to mature in order to mitigate the crisis.

He said government at all levels could support such farmers with seeds and other inputs.

""Whereupon the time left for the rainy season cannot be sufficient for any crop, some form of compensation commensurate to the ascertained loss could be given to the affected farmers,"" he advised.

The farmer's leader urged his members to insure their farms, adding that the association is already working with National Agricultural Insurance Company (NAIC) to that all farmers insure their farms.

The women leader of the Kebbi State Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Lubabatu Usman Kamba suggested that the way out for some of the challenges was for the farmers to be provided with good knowledge of forecasting the planting season.

She said flooding has been the farmers' biggest nightmare, adding that they could only be addressed with good forecasting knowledge on when and where to plant the crops, which she said was currently lacking because of the near absence of extension service workers.","Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn05.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00540445:bd25877f5988946c2e238d58cdc5cf6e:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'niger', 'food', 'kebbi', 'security', 'floods', 'farms', 'prices', 'threatened', 'nigeria', 'destroy', 'rice', 'hectares', 'state']", ,flood
86,86,FL-2018-000120-NGA,"April 2021: Ninth-warmest April on record, NOAA and NASA report - Yale Climate Connections",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/05/april-2021-ninth-warmest-april-on-record-noaa-and-nasa-report/,"April 2021 was the ninth-warmest April since global record-keeping began in 1880, 0.79 degrees Celsius (1.42°F) above the 20th-century average, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, NCEI, reported May 13. NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europe’s coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Figure 1. Departure of temperature from average for April 2021, the ninth-warmest April for the globe since record keeping began in 1880. Record-warm April temperatures were limited to parts of southern South America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, as well as small parts of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. No portion of the globe was record-cold. (Image credit: NOAA/NCEI)

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy. Above: Smoke rises from fires lit to prevent freeze damage in a French vineyard on April 8, 2021. (Image credit: Christiane Lambert, FNSEA)

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK. Above: Infrared satellite image of supercell thunderstorms over Texas and Oklahoma near sunset on April 28. (Image credit: NOAA)

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated. Above: California’s largest reservoir, Lake Oroville, as seen on April 26, 2021. (Image credit: California DWR)

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

Francis Ighorurhie, aged 38, reportedly drowned on Thursday night at Kaiama Community in Kolokuma-Opokuma Council of Bayelsa State. Two Primary school pupils also drowned along Goodnews street in Azikoro Town in Yenagoa Council of the state.

It was gathered on Friday that Fr. Francis Ighorurhie, a Missionary of St. Paul (MSP) from Delta State, was until his death the Parish Priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church, Kaiama.

A priest, who spoke anonymously, said, “this is a sad moment for us. Father was on his way back from Bomadi in Delta State when he met his untimely death. But for the flood, he could have driven his car straight to his residence instead of parking same by the road.”

“It was as he was walking on the wooden bridge part of which had been submerged that he slipped and got drowned. Those staying at his residence had to raise alarm when they saw his car by the roadside and he was nowhere to be found.

“They however became suspicious when they saw a bag containing some provision floating on the water not far from the bridge. Divers were contracted and his remains were recovered.”

He added that his remains had been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa.

Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State government, yesterday, in a statement, sympathised with residents of the state over the impact of the rising flood, assuring that efforts are underway to mitigate its devastating effects on the people.

The state government, during its Eight Executive Council Meeting, presided over by the Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stressed that government is aware of the difficulties being experienced as a result of the flood, which has become a perennial problem due to climate change.

Speaking on behalf of the Governor, Ewhrudjakpo appealed to Bayelsans to exercise patience with the state government over the inconveniences being experienced as a result of the ongoing expansion of the Etegwe roundabout.","Sun, 18 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekiti-flood.jpg,"['saw', 'bayelsa', 'flood', 'residence', 'st', 'catholic', 'drowned', 'drown', 'remains', 'pupils', 'council', 'state', 'priest', 'result']", ,flood

90,90,FL-2018-000120-NGA,An Inland Delta Flooded - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147692/an-inland-delta-flooded,"Drought is a perennial problem in the semi-arid Sahel region of Africa. But in 2020, in Mali and other countries in West Africa, excessive rainfall has been the problem at times. Exceptionally heavy summer rains pushed seasonal floods on the Niger River and its inland delta to destructive levels.

After intense rains fell in July and August in the Guinea Highlands and overloaded many streams and rivers, it took several weeks for flood waters to work their way through the vast inland delta in central Mali. When the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured a natural-color image on October 29, 2020, water had spread widely across the nearly flat delta, which was once a lake bottom. Standing water appears black. Many flooded areas appear green because bourgou grass, rice, and other plants grow in the shallow flood waters. For comparison, the other image shows the dry landscape in May 2020, before the rains.

In late October, floodwaters reached their peak height at Mopti, a town at the confluence of the Niger and Bani Rivers. Water levels in the delta were recorded at 670 centimeters (22 feet) on October 26 and remained at that level until November 2, according to Mali’s National Directorate of Water Resources. That tied the peak water levels from 2018, the highest since 1969.

After November 2, waters receded at Mopti even as they continued to rise at points downstream such as Akka and Diré. It typically takes water a full six months from falling in the Guinea Highlands to reach the ocean at the Niger Delta in Nigeria. People watch the timing of flooding closely because it affects when rice can be grown, when fish will be available to catch, and when pastures can be ready for grazing. Water levels were expected to be low enough in mid-December 2020 for the annual cattle crossing on the Niger River at Diafarabé. In the much anticipated event, nomadic herders drive cattle across the river toward rich grazing lands in the inland delta and are reunited with their families after months apart.

While seasonal floods are common in Mali, the severity of the floods this year caused widespread damage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 1,160 homes were destroyed by flooding.

This is as the government has warned against heavy rainfall, flooding and possible flood disasters.

While making the disclosure through a signed statement, the Honorable Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said 23 million cubic meters of water will be released in October, which is the peak of the rainfall season.

READ:

Bello explained that the release of more water from the Oyan Dam, which will be the highest so far, is due to intensive rainfall over the past few days, expected to peak in the current month.

He, therefore, enjoined all residents of Agboyi-Ketu, Owode Onirin, Isheri, Ajegunle, Agiliti, Kara, Majidun and all areas bordering the rivers and the sea in Lagos to be wary of the staggered Oyan Dam release, adding that by November, a reduced release of 11million cubic meters will be affected as the intensity of the rainfall declines.

Bello pointed out that data provided by the Nigerian Hydrological Services noted that the months of July, August, September and October would be characterized by heavy rainfall, flooding and flood disasters in most parts of the country.

READ:

Reiterating that the reminder became necessary because the projected heavy rainfall, which had increased in September, would continue with high intensity this month leading to the staggered release of water from the dam, the Commissioner disclosed that Lagos is, however, intensifying measures to minimize the effect of the heavy rainfall on lives and property.

He averred that, in continuation of the preventive efforts against flooding by the State Government, work is almost completed on all the primary and secondary channels, stating that this is in addition to the efforts of the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) that are being deployed around the State to undertake quick fixes of clogged manholes or drains manually.

Bello said, “For a coastal city like Lagos, let me remind everyone that once it rains consistently for a minimum of eight hours, we are bound to have flash floods caused by the increasing inability of effective discharge into the lagoon, which is brought about by a rise in the ocean level. This will automatically lock up all our drainages and would be unable to discharge until the water level goes down.’’

“Flash floods are not peculiar to Lagos. It is the new wave in most coastal cities around the world, including those who have adopted the best of technological advancements to curtail flooding. Lagos is at the receiving end of three types of flooding, namely Coastal, Urban and River flooding because of the peculiarity of its location.”

While urging residents to adopt an attitudinal change by not dumping refuse in drainage channels and erecting structures on drainage alignments, Bello vowed that anyone caught violating the environmental laws of the State would be punished accordingly.

The Commissioner also emphasized that all residents owe the state a duty to support the efforts of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration to ensure that heavy rainfall does not wreak havoc in any part of the metropolis.","Mon, 05 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sanwo-olu.jpg?fit=900%2C618&ssl=1,"['residents', 'release', 'water', 'flooding', 'state', 'cautions', 'flood', 'lagos', 'disaster', 'warns', 'rainfall', 'dam', 'heavy', 'oyan']", ,none
92,92,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Reps to expand fire service operations - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/reps-to-expand-fire-service-operations/,"The House of Representatives is considering an expansion of the scope of operations of the fire service to include accidents and emergency situations in the transport sector and at construction sites in the real estate sector.



When the bill becomes law, officers of the fire service who show gallantry will be specially rewarded.



This proposal is contained in the legislation titled ‘A Bill for an Act to Repeal the Fire Service Act, Cap. F29, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and Enact the Fire and Emergency Service Bill to Provide for Additional Powers for Effective Service Delivery; and for Related Matters.’



The bill passed second reading at the plenary on Tuesday.



Sponsor of the bill, Mr Adejoro Adeogun, while leading the debate for the second reading, said the proposal was to provide for additional powers and expansion of responsibilities of the fire service



He said, “The major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed, would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency. It would also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through engagement of able bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.



“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources.”



Adeogun noted that the Fire Service Act (1963) saddled the Fire Service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies.



“This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and such other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required,” he said.



The lawmaker added, “This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.



“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”



The lawmaker listed the specific goals of the bill, saying it is to “prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters.”



He added that it would “encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by states, local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies.



“Establish the Office of the Fire and Emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the fire and emergency service.



“Empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilise resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies.



“Provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officers.”","Wed, 19 May 2021 08:43:56 GMT",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/19155231/Reps.fw_.png,"['flooding', 'service', 'construction', 'collapse', 'accidents', 'operations', 'scope', 'related', 'bill', 'reps', 'disasters', 'expand', 'emergency']", ,none

The Director-General of FEMA, Idriss Abbas, made the call in a statement on Sunday.

He said most of the deaths recorded in the past from flood in the FCT were as a result of non-compliance to instructions and early warnings.

Mr Abbas, therefore, emphasised the need for residents to adhere to instructions and early warnings from relevant authorities.

He added that attitudinal change was the key to reducing disasters to the barest minimum in the FCT.

He disclosed that the Search and Rescue team of the agency recently discovered the body of one Garba Joseph, 43-year-old from Akoka-Edo of Edo State, after two days search from a flooded river around TradeMoore Estate, Lugbe, in Abuja

“Narrating the incident, an eye witness account (one of FEMA’s volunteer/vanguard Kenneth Chima) who captured the incident on video explained that they were four men that tried walking through the water.

“And I kept warning them to go back, three of them went back but only this man insisted on crossing, unfortunately the water overpowered him and washed him away,” he said.

He decried the increasing rate of flood in the FCT due to residents’ apathy towards the government’s directives and early warnings.

“This is also despite FEMA’s consistent sensitisations based on The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) predictions of torrential rainfall and dangers of flooding.“

He said NIHSA’s most recent predictions warned of torrential rainfall and flooding from August, adding that FEMA had carried out aggressive sensitisation to educate residents on ways to prevent the impending flood.

He said FEMA was conducting sensitisation programmes in five different indigenous languages in the FCT using different media channels.

“We recently organized a meeting with our Volunteers, Vangards and Divers from all the area Councils within the FCT to educate them on how they can sensitise their people on how to prevent disasters to minimize loss of lives and properties.

“We also embarked on community to community flood sensitisation campaigns in the FCT and mounted billboards at all the flood prone points warning off and cautioning residents from these danger areas.”

The DG, who reiterated the agency’s commitment to reducing disasters to a barest minimum in the FCT, called on residents to complement the efforts of the FCT Administration by doing the needful.

He also advised residents not to underestimate the strength of water when it was flooded.

“What we are experiencing now is flash flood, the water builds up speedily and comes unnoticed hence very dangerous,” he said.

He called on community and religious leaders to take responsibility of sensitising their subjects, especially those who are living close to flood prone areas to move to higher grounds to avoid being washed away by flood.

He said that relevant authorities have been on their toes evacuating refuse around the FCT, distilling drainages and expanding narrow water channels to enable free flow of water for a safer FCT.

94,94,FL-2018-000120-NGA,Agency warns states contiguous to River Niger to brace up for impending flood - Guardian Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/news/agency-warns-states-contiguous-to-river-niger-to-brace-up-for-impending-flood/,"As River Niger reaches red alert

Following warning alert received from the Niger Basin Authority indicating that River Niger has reached Red alert of 6.60m the Nigerian Hydrological Service Agency has warned states contiguous to the Niger River to brace up for impending flood disaster.

The agency warned that It is expected that the flood magnitude sighted in Niamey, Niger Republic on the 23rd August 2020 would arrive Nigeria through Kebbi state on the 6th of September and flood other states contiguous to River Niger including Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa

NHSA Director General Engr Clement Nze in a press statement made available to journalists yesterday explained that he River Niger Basin which covers nine (9) countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, has Nigeria at the lowest portion of the Basin, meaning that that once the upper catchment of the Basin gets flooded, Nigeria should be prepared to experience flooding incident.

He said “As at today, the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin made up of Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso and part of Mali, have been flooded. The flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malanville (Benin Republic) have gotten to the Red Alert Zone”

Nze pointed out that Operators of Kainji and Jebba Dams have long been alerted to take appropriate measures in the operation of the reservoirs and accordingly, Kainji Dam is now spilling water at the rate of 1,000 m3/s that is 86.4 million cubic metres/day, saying this means that communities downstream Kainji and Jebba Dams could be flooded while Shiroro Dam on Kaduna River is still impounding, though there is the possibility of spilling water in the weeks ahead.

On River Benue sub-basin, the DG stated that the agency has maintained close contact with the Cameroonian authorities with regards to flood scenarios in the upper catchment of the sub-basin and Information received by NIHSA from the relevant authority in Cameroon stated that the Lagdo Dam is still impounding water.

He noted that the high intensity of rainfall during the last week of August has already saturated the soil and any rainfall of high intensity with long duration would translate into flooding in most part of the country.

He revealed that So far, Urban/Flash Flood has wrecked havocs in about 70 council areas in 20 states of the federation and the FCTof the Federation, including the FCT.

The NHSA boss recalled that the year 2020 Annual Flood Outlook predicted that some parts of at least 102 LGAs in 28 States fall within the Highly Probable Flood Risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 States of the Federation, including the FCT, fall within the Moderately Probable Flood Risk areas. The remaining 397 LGAs fall within the Low Probable Flood Risks areas.

It also warned The states that are contiguous to rivers Niger and Benue, namely: – Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa are likely to be affected by river flooding, while Coastal flooding is expected in Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, and Bayelsa States.

On account of poor drainage systems, flash and urban floods are expected to occur in major cities across the country, namely Birnin–Kebbi, Sokoto, Lokoja, Kaduna, Suleja, Gombe, Yola, Makurdi, Abuja, Lafia, Asaba, Port Harcourt, Yenagoa, Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Benin City, Oshogbo, Ado-Ekiti, Abakaliki, Awka, Nsukka.

The DG warned that the country still has many days of rainfall in the course of the year and More floods are expected in the months of August, September and October this year, in the event there is release of excess water from the Dams in other countries upstream rivers Niger and Benue this year, this will have more negative impacts on Nigeria which is located downstream other countries in the Niger Basin.

He urged that to prevent flood disaster,

blocked drainages and gutters should be cleared, river channels dredged and structures within the waterways and floodplains and flood paths pulled down.","Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-74.jpeg,"['river', 'world', 'flooding', 'flood', 'impending', 'expected', 'states', 'guardian', 'warned', 'nigeria', 'rivers', 'niger', 'contiguous', 'basin', 'warns']", ,flood

The analysis by SBMIntel, an Africa focused research firm, revealed that the harvests of 26.3 per cent of Nigerian farmers were greatly affected by extreme weather conditions.

It said 52.60 per cent ”were somewhat affected and a fifth (21.1 per cent) were not affected by drought and flooding in the year under review.”

The survey, titled: “Nigerians just want to eat” and published this month, chronicled the major challenges bedevilling Nigerian farmers and food transporters which are capable of impeding national food security.

Survey

Data for the survey were sampled from seven Nigerian states, namely; Nasarawa, Osun, Benue, Oyo, Katsina, Ogun and Lagos.

Of the seven states surveyed, the report noted that the majority of the respondents (farmers) had their farms in the South-west States (73.7 per cent)—Lagos (36.8 per cent ), Oyo (21.1 per cent ) and Ogun (15.8 per cent ) .

Meanwhile, 10.5 per cent of the respondents had their farms in Benue and the remaining 15.9 per cent were equally distributed between Nasarawa, Osun and Katsina states respectively.

The farmers surveyed were mostly crop farmers who grew a wide range of staples with fruits, vegetables, cassava and maize farmers in the majority, the report noted.

Scourge

According to the survey, extreme climatic events such as flooding and drought witnessed in some states within the country triggered the negative effects being noticed on the prices of staple foods.

It said flooding in Nigeria was experienced in the north, mostly in states like Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara, and some parts of Kwara.

“In fact, in Kebbi alone, 500,000 hectares of farmland were destroyed by flooding, with the cost being upward of N5 billion,” the report said.

Also, it stated that the problem that faced farmers in the South-western region was the lack of rainfall experienced during the mid-planting season last year.

“Last year, the ‘August break’ actually began in early July and lasted through till the end of August. This prevented the planting of maize, cassava and cash crops like cocoa,” the survey added.

According to the survey, ”more than half of the farmers engaged had no irrigation system, even when they believed that it will help greatly in their farming endeavours.”

It said 57.90 per cent of the respondents said ”they do not own any irrigation system that could help complement the absence of rainfall when asked if they have, only 42.10 per cent had”.

”However, about 94.7 per cent of the respondents agreed to a large extent that an irrigation system would help their farming system while 10.5 per cent said it would only help to a small extent and 5.3 per cent said to no extent,” it added.

The survey said most farmers are getting discouraged over their inability to own irrigation systems or the technology of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) to support crops during adverse weather conditions.

Recommendations

In order to mitigate the challenges being faced by these farmers and food transporters, the report recommends that both state and federal governments adopt ”wider irrigation systems and as well facilitate the provision of early maturing and drought-resistant crop varieties.”

“Switching to climate-smart agriculture is the best way to guard against crop failure and poor yields,” the survey reads in part.

The report said respondents asked the government to fix access roads and provide adequate transportation that is cheap, effective and efficient.

“An efficient rail system will reduce the cost of transporting farm produce to the markets and improve food security. Security remains paramount followed by access to land and irrigation infrastructure,” the report quoted the farmers to have said.","Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/06/IMG-20200628-WA0015-e1593352816374.jpg?fit=970%2C436&ssl=1,"['farmers', 'flooding', 'survey', '2020', 'floods', 'cent', 'states', 'irrigation', 'respondents', 'system', '80', 'nigerian', 'affected', 'nearly', 'report', 'drought']", ,flood

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos by Dallas County Police DepartmentDALLAS—After the kidnapping and killing of 4-year-old Cash Gernon in Dallas last week, neighbor Jose Alvarado checked his security cameras for any footage that might help investigators.What he found sent a chill up his spine.The video is from 10 weeks before little Cash was left dead of stab wounds on the ground. But it shows the teenager charged with abducting him, Darriynn Brown, skulking down the street, opening Alvarado’s backyard gate and peering in before quickly walking away.“It’s really scary,” Alvarado told The Daily Beast. “I have two kids, one girl and one boy, and they play basketball in the backyard.”Alvarado’s house shares a back alley with the home of Monica Sherrod, 35, who was taking care of Cash and his twin, Carter. She has said she was dating the twins’ father, Trevor Gernon, a 31-year-old construction worker, until he reportedly left town in March when a court ordered him to report to rehab.That left Sherrod to care for the boys for the next two months—unbeknownst to their mother, Melinda Seagroves, who lives in Houston.Early on the morning of May 15, a young man crept into the twins’ bedroom, lifted a still-sleeping Cash out of the toddler bed he shared with Carter, and walked out—a chilling scene captured in grainy black and white by a baby monitor.The footage, obtained by the Daily Mail, shows the intruder returning about two hours later, hovering over the bed where Carter remained in slumber, before abruptly leaving as though he was startled by something.By then, Cash was already dead.Antwainese Square, a Dallas teacher who lives in the area, was out for her morning walk around 6:45 a.m. when she saw a clump of hair on the ground she thought belonged to a dog.“I was on the phone with my mom,” Square told The Daily Beast. “As I got closer, I could see an arm and a foot and I just began crying, saying, ‘Mom, I think I'm coming up on a body.’ And I started, ‘Mommy, it’s a child! It’s a child!’ And the baby had blood all over his face. At that point, my mom told me to get off the phone with her and immediately call 911… The baby had ants all over the bottom of his feet. So I pretty much knew that he was gone.”Square said she remembers “being in denial,” and hoped Cash was actually just sleeping even though he was obviously dead. “I was just trying to put together all possible stories; there was no way in my mind that I would think somebody would do that to a kid,” she said, adding that she stayed with Cash’s body until police and paramedics arrived so no one would run over him.“One couple that was leaving out of their garage, I had to stop them to let them know that this baby was on the ground,” Square said.More than three hours later, Sherrod reported Cash missing. “The day that he was missing, I got up late and thought it was weird,” Sherrod would later tell the Daily Mail. “I was like, ‘It's 10 o'clock already, you guys.’ So I figured Cash was still in bed.” Cash Gernon was abducted out of his bed on May 15. Handout Later that day, police arrested Brown, 18, who lives with his parents about a half-mile from where Cash’s body was found, according to court documents. He was charged with kidnapping and burglary, but not murder because police said they are waiting for the result of forensic tests.Held in lieu of $1.5 million bail, Brown could not be reached for comment and does not have a lawyer listed in court records. His mother, Mimi, has told reporters that she believes her son is being framed.A tangled web of relationships, criminal records, and an unknown motive hangs over the case.Sherrod, the mother of several children, has a criminal record that includes assault and DWI. Trevor Gernon, who has an extensive rap sheet, appears to have vanished; a phone number listed under his name was disconnected. Darriynn Brown, meanwhile, is reportedly a friend of one of Sherrod’s children and had been seen playing with children in Sherrod’s care.Sherrod initially characterized any relationship she or her kids had with Brown, who attended the same high school as at least one of the boys living in her house, as minimal. She later told a reporter that Brown had visited her home two days before Cash’s murder, but she was out grocery shopping at the time.According to multiple neighbors, Brown was definitely not an unfamiliar face around the neighborhood. One told The Daily Beast the teen regularly played football and basketball with some of the kids who lived with Sherrod. Others said they had spotted Brown on their Ring security cameras hanging out in the area.Little information has emerged about Seagroves, who now has custody of Carter. Seagroves did not respond to multiple interview requests, but her mother, Connie Ward, told The Daily Beast this week: “We are not ready to give any kind of statement. My family is broken. It has been a nightmare listening and watching the news about our baby and stories being reported that are false.”Seagroves does not appear to have had any brushes with the law, but court records show both Sherrod and Gernon have records that include arrests for assaulting their own parents.In 2013, Sherrod pleaded guilty to attacking her mother, Lezlee Pinkerton. According to a criminal affidavit signed by Officer Glenn Burkheimer-Lubeck of the Harris County Constable’s Office, Sherrod “intentionally struck” Pinkerton in the head and chest with her hand and pulled her to the ground, then “cause[d] bodily injury” to Pinkerton “by stomping on [Pinkerton’s] toes with her feet.”“Complainant reports that she believes her toes are broken,” the affidavit says. Sherrod was sentenced to two years of community supervision, participation in a domestic violence treatment program, a $100 donation to a family violence center, and a $200 fine.In 2018, Gernon was arrested by deputies from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office for assaulting his father, Roger Gernon, during a dispute over a credit card bill, Texas court records show. When Roger Gernon told his son that he was going to call the police, Trevor grabbed the phone away, bloodied his dad’s arm with his fingernails, and elbowed him in the chest. Charged with misdemeanor assault and interference with an emergency telephone call, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 68 days in county jail.In addition to the assault of family members, both Sherrod and Gernon have a history of theft, fraud, and drug possession.Sherrod’s most recent arrest was for DWI; she has also pleaded guilty to identity fraud charges, meth possession, driving without a license, and misdemeanor theft.Gernon’s most recent arrest was for the possession of narcotics in 2020. He was previously charged for possession of methamphetamine in 2016. His rap sheet includes a range of other crimes.Neal Flanagan, who co-owns a corrosion-proofing business, told The Daily Beast he met Gernon in high school, then reconnected in 2016. He gave Gernon a bit of work because he was struggling. Then things went sideways.“My ex-wife and I were married at the time,” said Flanagan. “We had started having issues. She separated from me in January 2017. That’s when Trevor and her started seeing each other.”“I never did see him after,” said Flanagan. “A couple years later, he messaged me on Facebook. Like, ‘Hey buddy. How you been?’ Like nothing ever happened.""When he was sober, Gernon “was as good as you could ask for,” Neal’s father, Johnny Flanagan, said. But he added that he wasn’t surprised Gernon took off without his boys.“He's one of these guys that kind of goes whichever way the wind blows, you know, and he'll do good for several months and then do bad for several months and you know, just up and disappear,” Flanagan said.Gernon’s whereabouts are unknown. Following his indictment on felony drug possession charges last November, he failed to appear for a March 29, 2021, hearing and thus forfeited a $10,000 bond payment. There is now an open warrant out for his arrest.None of the various defense lawyers who represented Sherrod or Gernon in court agreed to speak, citing attorney-client privilege.Cash’s death has raised many questions about those responsible for him. But in the neighborhood where he spent his last months, the overriding mystery is why would someone kill a defenseless child and leave him on the street like trash. Steven Monacelli The solidly working-class Mountain Creek section of Dallas is a quiet place, bordered on one side by the 600-acre Cedar Ridge nature preserve. Houses are in decent shape, and yards are clean. On the street where Cash’s body was found, locals have been stopping at a shrine to leave toys, flowers, and other mementos.The woman who found Cash’s body, meanwhile, has been struggling with her emotions since that morning.“It's been difficult. It really has been difficult,” Square told The Daily Beast.“I have a 3-year-old and as we're dealing with this and processing this, I'm learning that I have little triggers. If I see a little boy, 4, 3, 5, I will burst out crying. It’s just a trigger for me. My own daughter is like a trigger. Sometimes she'll say something and I'll cry.“Because even though I didn't know that baby, he was just robbed of his life. So, it's been really hard. It's been really hard to just process this. And no matter how much you try to move on, you can't unsee what you saw.”Rohrlich reported from New York and Monacelli from DallasRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

97,97,FL-2018-000120-NGA,"Climate Change in Nigeria: Floods in Lagos, Abuja, Niger Delta are going to get a lot worse - Quartz Africa",https://qz.com/africa/1054825/climate-change-in-nigeria-floods-in-lagos-abuja-niger-delta-are-going-to-get-a-lot-worse/,"Earlier this year heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos, Nigeria’s economic nerve centre and one of Africa’s most populous cities. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

Pictures and videos later posted online showed dramatic and even bizarre scenes of flooding in the city, including the capture of a crocodile in the floodwater. Another video, which went viral, was one of a man kayaking in floodwater on one of the streets.

Lagos has not been alone. Suleija, a town near the capital city Abuja hundreds of kilometres away, suffered its own flooding challenge in early July. Heavy rains washed houses away and caused others to collapse, trapping occupants. Thirteen people were reported to have died.

The two primary factors of flooding in Nigeria are climate change and poor urban planning.

Some of the worst flooding in recent memory happened five years ago in March 2012 when 32 of Nigeria’s 36 states were affected, 24 severely. More than 360 people were killed and almost two million people were displaced.

The seriousness of the flooding was attributed to a combination of two events: very heavy local rainfall and the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in nearby Cameroon.

Although the degree and seriousness of flooding in Nigeria fluctuates, flooding remains a recurring phenomenon in most parts of the country. The first factor aggravating flooding is climate change, which has been shown to contribute to more extreme storms and rainfall. Another factor contributing to flooding in cities is that Nigeria has experienced rapid urban growth and planning is poor.

The problem of flooding is not peculiar to Nigeria alone. In 2007, floods affected 1.5 million people across several countries in Africa, including Uganda, Sudan, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and Niger. Alluvial flooding is common for major rivers—such as Nile, Niger, Benue, Orange, Zambezi—in Africa. Major cities in Africa are also susceptible to fluvial flooding which occurs when excessive rainfall, over an extended period of time, causes rivers to overflow.

Why Nigeria suffers

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria (1978 to 2007) suggests that rainstorms are getting more intense. The data show that there are fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed much from previous decades. This means that more rain is falling on the days that there is rain, which in turn means that rain storms in the city are getting more intense, increasing the threat of flooding.

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria suggests rainstorms are getting more intense with fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed.

In addition to more intense rain storms, the other possible cause of flooding in coastal regions is rising sea levels. Although up-to-date data on the rising sea levels in Nigeria are scarce, it’s believed that if nothing is done, this is likely to aggravate flooding in the future, particularly in coastal cities.

Areas at risk include Lagos, which is on the coast, as well as the Niger Delta region which has many low-lying towns and villages. Being on the coast also makes these places more susceptible to storm surges. While these areas are no stranger to floods, evidence suggests that floods have become increasingly common and intense in recent times.

In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the adjoining states. The changes in rainfall patterns, particularly in frequency and intensity, have meant that these events have begun to happen more frequently.

In Nigeria’s cities, the most common cause of flooding after excessive rains is poor drainage systems that can’t cope. This is called pluvial flooding. Lagos provides a good case study.

Lagos as a case study

Lagos has been urbanizing rapidly. By some estimates there will be 19 million in the city by 2050, making it the 11th most populous city in the world. It is also home to most of the country’s industrial, commercial and non-oil operations.

Urbanisation and industrialisation increase the number of roads and buildings. This in turn increases the proportion of surface area where water cannot be absorbed into the ground, leading to rapid runoff which then causes flooding during storms. And in cities that manage their infrastructure well, storm water drainage systems are built so that water can be directed to rivers efficiently and quickly.

Lagos has not kept up with its infrastructure needs. The growth and expansion of the city has been largely unregulated. The has resulted in inadequate and poor housing, the development of slum areas and inadequate water supply and waste disposal, among other problems.

What’s complicated the situation for Lagos is that many parts of the city were originally low-lying mangrove swamps and wetlands, which have been reclaimed and settled, mostly by poorer communities and more recently through concerted efforts by the government.

These low-lying areas are particularly at risk of flooding, and the situation is complicated by buildings being constructed on water ways, and bad waste dumping habits which block the drains.

Up to 70% of the population of Lagos live in slums.

What must be done

It’s clear Nigeria needs to take measures to cope with flooding. This will require both local and international interventions, and could include early warning and rapid response systems, flood data gathering and modelling, proper urban and spatial planning, flood emergency preparedness and political will.

The country can learn from others. For example, in Mumbai, India various measures have been implemented to reduce the impact of flooding. These have included an emergency control centre, automated weather stations, removal of solid waste from stormwater drains and the development of emergency response mechanisms. Nigeria must invest in these measures, and sustain them.

DAVID TILLMAN: Hello, I'm meteorologist David Tillman with your one-minute weather forecast. The threat for heavy rain is not over, and it's going to come from moisture in the Gulf of Mexico that the National Hurricane Center is now giving a 20% chance of developing. So that's an 80% chance that it will not develop.

But all of this moisture is going to be lifting in our general direction. And that means for the next couple of days, it's going to be pretty wet around here. Things are quiet out there overnight, but this moisture is going to be moving in our direction.

We think the deep moisture will start to move in as we get into Friday afternoon. That's when scattered heavy downpours are going to be likely around southeast Texas. And there could be some instances of some street flooding as well with this activity. It'll last overnight on Friday into Saturday morning.

And off and on, on Saturday, we'll see these downpours around. That as we get into Sunday, we'll begin to see some of this rain hit off to the west of us, but not before producing a good one to two, maybe three inches of rain around southeast Texas.

There could be some isolated places that get up to four inches of rain. Here's the extended forecast. We're calling for an 80% chance for rain Friday afternoon, evening and night, 70% on Saturday, 40% on Sunday, and then we'll be back to 20% as we head into next week.","Fri, 21 May 2021 01:13:14 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/21/60a7071460b4aa6168ac7cfb/60a7071460b4aa6168ac7cfc_o_U_v2.jpg,"['southeast', 'rain', 'moisture', 'tillman', 'going', 'downpours', '20', 'system', 'chance', 'gulf', 'thats', 'tropical', 'heavy', 'development']", ,flood
0,0,FL-2017-000126-NGA,MATTERS ARISING: 28 states at risk of flooding -- how prepared is Nigeria? - TheCable,https://www.thecable.ng/states-risk-flooding-nigeria-2021,"Uche Igwe will not forget August 26, 2020 in a hurry. It had rained heavily that day in the capital city, Abuja. Trademore Estate in Lugbe, where Igwe runs a cybercafe business, was overrun by rainwater. The force of the flood pulled down the fence of Igwe’s office complex and destroyed a part of the building. In no time, the property was floating on water.

Igwe’s business was greatly affected as he lost machines and computers. It took his entire savings and the support of friends and family for him to be able to recover from the event of that day, he tells TheCable.

“I lost over two million naira worth of [electronics], my machines were all gone, my computers, everything. We didn’t expect such here,” he says.

Like Igwe, Victor Essang, a resident of Calabar, Cross River state capital, has also recorded losses to flooding.

First, his family lost a block of flats inherited from their grandparents, and later, his poultry business took a hit in 2016.

Igwe and Essang are just two of the many Nigerians who suffer the consequences of flooding that occurs yearly in different parts of the country during the rainy season.

SEVERE FLOOD PREDICTIONS

During the 2021 flood outlook presentation, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) announced that 28 states, including the FCT, will most likely experience flooding this year.

Similarly, the Nigeria Meteorological Agency, in its 2021 seasonal climate forecast, said the signals monitored by the agency in the last seven years show that things are changing on the climate front and that this year, Nigeria is expected to experience unprecedented heavy downpours.

The information is intended to alert Nigerians, government, relevant agencies and stakeholders of what is to come in order for them to prepare — prevent, mitigate and respond — for severe flooding.

Going by the alert, Igwe says he intends to raise his compound level to prevent rainwater from entering in the event of a flood.

On his part, Essang says he was already apprehensive about the severity of this year’s rainfall, even before the alert. He tells TheCable that he has relocated his belongings to a safer place.

“I have packed out my things to a safe place, I will bring them back when the rain stops. My only prayer is God will not let it bring our house down,” he says.

CLIMATE CHANGE A DRIVING FACTOR IN FLOODING

A report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) states that extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global climate change increase the likelihood of floods.

Chukwudi Njoku, a doctoral researcher on climate change at the University of Calabar, says flooding in Nigeria can be linked to both natural and human activities that influence changes in the climate.

“When there is high temperature, then there is increased possibility for evaporation – the process where water vapour is taken from the earth surface into the atmosphere — which can trigger much more rainfall,” he tells TheCable.

“The rising temperature here is a climate change feedback and when evaporation is increased, there is the possibility of more rainfall and when rainfall increases, simultaneously it could trigger flooding.”

Research by MOJ Ecology & Environmental Sciences (MOJES) has shown that human activities such as urbanisation, felling of forest trees and burning of fossil fuels, among others, lead to the emission of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.

According to the study, these activities distort the carbon cycle – the process in which carbon atoms move from the atmosphere to the earth and then back into the atmosphere. The activities also initiate climate change processes which involve a variety of changes including higher surface temperatures and changes to the hydrological cycle – the process in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and then back in form of rain.

Njoku believes that these human activities are what increases and make worse the impacts of climate change on humans and their environment.

“Such activities like urbanisation which is not properly done in a sustainable manner, for example, people building in floodplains and swampy areas which are supposed to serve as banks for water, thus reducing the ability of the environment to collect and keep excess water,” the researcher explains.

“Also, the clearing of forest areas for agriculture increases the extent of bare surfaces that would have hitherto collected runoff water and reduced the flow of water.

“These human activities are not sustainable and where they are not checked, they only go to increase the susceptibility of the people to flooding which appears to be inevitable at this time considering the increasing temperature and rainfall events.”

He advises that people living in flood-prone areas should be relocated and government should put laws in place to deter chaotic urbanisation, create more awareness about the potential increase in flooding events and their dangers, and also ensure that roads and drainages are constructed to accommodate the volume of water from the rain.

HOW IS GOVERNMENT PREPARING?

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), whose responsibility is to manage disasters, tells TheCable that the agency had information about imminent flooding since February through the seasonal climate predictions document made available by NIMET.

“Before that presentation by NIHSA, NEMA already had some information about the outlook of the rains and the consequences of the flood. So having the information, the agency had called together experts to analyse the predictions of NIMET and come out with a disaster risk management of the prediction,” says Manzo Ezekiel, public relations officer of NEMA.

“The secretary will soon convene a meeting of all the state emergency management agencies and relevant organisations that their activities or mandate have something to do with the management of floods.

“During that meeting, NEMA is going to communicate to them that this is the information we have and this information is going to cover your area of operation, what and what can you do about it. That is the next line of action that we have. That meeting will take hold very soon.”

The PRO said the zonal offices of the agency “are already on standby to take the information down to the specific communities that are at risk of flooding”.

He said the agency will ensure continuous engagement with Nigerians and create awareness at the federal, state, and local government levels to ensure that flooding does not take Nigerians by surprise.

“We are going to tell them that, this year there is a forecast of increased rainfall and this will likely interrupt your stay here,” he says.

SPEEDY MITIGATION EFFORTS NEEDED

While government agencies are still at the preparation stage, Igwe wishes they can speed up the process since the country is already in the rainy season.

He believes the annual flood events in his locality is a result of the lack of an adequate drainage system which the government had earlier promised to expand.

“I think the major cause is the drainage system. I wish the government could even rush down and do it for us today today today,” he says.

Igwe desires the speedy process because, according to him, the relief materials government agencies offer in the aftermath of flooding do not equate to the losses.

“When they were sharing their palliatives, I just refused; how can somebody lose about two point something million and you are giving him a pack of Indomie and small 5kg camping gas cylinder?” Igwe adds.","Thu, 20 May 2021 07:27:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FLOOD-PRONE-AREAS-IN-FCT1-1.png,"['information', 'water', 'process', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'arising', 'states', 'igwe', '28', 'nigeria', 'prepared', 'risk', 'agency', 'rainfall', 'matters', 'activities']", ,flood
1,1,FL-2017-000126-NGA,"Expect greater floods this year, FG tells Nigerians - Guardian",https://guardian.ng/news/expect-greater-floods-this-year-fg-tells-nigerians/,"Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, has said that Nigerians should expect more floods this year based on reports by Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA).

He spoke at the public presentation of 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) tagged “Managing Flood for Sustainable Development in COVID-19 Era” organised by NIHSA, yesterday, in Abuja.

Adamu said that 302 local government areas in 36 states, including Federal Capital Territory ( FCT), would fall within moderate flood risk areas while 121 councils in 28 states would be within the highly probable risk areas.

“This year, like 2020, we will be grappling with the two threats of the COVID-19 pandemic and related hygiene challenges as well as the impending floods as predicted in the AFO. The 2021 floods levels will be higher than in the previous years but will not attain the levels of the 2012 that was devastating,” he said.

The minister also warned that states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue, including Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nassarawa and Kogi, are likely to experience river flooding.

Others are Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa states. Coastal flooding is expected to affect Rivers, Cross River, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states.

“Flash and urban floods from heavy inundation are predicted to occur in some major cities. The severity would depend on availability and adequacy of drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.”

Adamu, therefore, called on all stakeholders, including policy makers and agencies, to rise up to the challenge of impending floods and threats of COVID-19.

Director General of NIHSA, Clement Nzeh, said: “States and relevant authorities as well as farmers must take the flood outlook serious by putting in place measures to mitigated its impact.

“There is a greater awareness for this year’s outlook in terms of the level of participation and political will, looking at representation, including governors, senators and key agencies. I believe they are going to cascade this to the grassroots.”

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has identified 10 local government areas in Cross River State that fall under the probable flood risk areas in view of the Annual Flood Outlook for 2021.

The agency also identified two local government areas in the state that falls under the highly probable risk areas for 2021.

The Director-General of NEMA, Muhammadu Muhammed, said this in Ikom Local Government Area while distributing relief materials to victims of windstorm in the area.

Mr Muhammed, who was represented by Godwin Tepikor, the zonal coordinator of NEMA, South-south, urged the state government to immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities to mitigate the impact.

He mentioned the 10 local government areas to include Yakurr, Calabar Municipal, Akpabuyo, Obubra, Bakassi, Ogoja, Biase, Etung, Odukpani and Ikom.

He said the two local government areas in the state that fall under highly probable risks areas were Calabar South and Abi.

“The state should immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities so as to mitigate the impact of the predicted flood on the vulnerable local government areas,” he said.

The agency distributed relief materials to over 1,000 households affected by windstorm in four communities in Ikom local government area of Cross River.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the distribution followed the windstorm disaster that occurred on May, last year, in Ogomogom, Akorofono, Nkarasi and Abinti communities, all in Ikom Local Government Area.

The director general said the items were approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, following the recommendation from the agency as humanitarian assistance to the affected persons.

The items distributed were bags of rice, beans and garri, tomato paste, kegs of palm oil, wrappers, blankets, bundles of roofing sheets, cement, bags of nails, zinc and ceiling boards.

He urged the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the items.

In his remark, the Director General, Cross River State Emergency Management Agency, Princewill Ayim, thanked NEMA for its intervention.

The Chairman of Ikom Local Government Area, Kingsley Egumi, thanked President Buhari and NEMA for the timely response to the concerns of their people, pledging that the items would be judiciously utilised.

Mfam Akong, who responded on behalf of the beneficiaries, thanked NEMA for its assistance.

3,3,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Why Lagosians should heed flood alert | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World NewsOpinion — The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/opinion/why-lagosians-should-heed-flood-alert/,"Sir: On April 14, 2021, the Lagos State Government predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state, therefore, directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic Implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello, “…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm. It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

In downscaling the predictions of the flood alerts, the state government is therefore collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET). In addition to what the Environment and Water Resources commissioner said, the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe declared, “I…urge residents to support the government to achieve flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again being littered by residents.”

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.

4,4,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Rainy season: Fears over impending flood in the land - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/rainy-season-fears-over-impending-flood-in-the-land/,"In fact, the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, who released the prediction, warned: “…the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Jolted by the report, many residents told The Guardian that they fear for the worst, noting that they had not recovered from the devastating effects of last year’s flood.

A resident in Bello Street in Ilasamaja area of the state, Tomiwa Sulaimon, said while she would love to move to another area before the rains start, it was not financially possible for her at this time.

She recalled: “Last year when it was raining almost everyday, our street and house got flooded every other day. This street is a bit low and erosion has eaten a good part of the road and despite our little efforts to keep the flood at bay, the water always finds a way to get in. The worst part is that those refuse disposal trucks hardly come around, claiming that we owe them for several months but if they hardly come around, how do they expect to get paid? They come around only once in a blue moon and in the meantime, we have to find a way to help ourselves. I want to plead with the government to tell them to improve on their services so that people are not forced to dump refuse indiscriminately.”

A shop owner, who identified herself as Blessing Ogbe, lamented that residents in the area were responsible for the constant flooding in the area whenever it rains.

Ogbe said: “The landlords and agents are very greedy. Once they see one small space, they will construct shops on it, most times blocking the water channels in the process. At Taiwo Junction and Transformer bus stop, that place is a major water channel but go and see for yourself. They have built a row of shops there now, blocking the gutter. So, anytime rain falls, the water has nowhere to go.

“The residents themselves are always so eager to throw refuse into the gutter when it is raining or by the roadside, some of which also end up in the gutter. The roads are bad and gutters are very narrow; so the water has nowhere to go as such. This has been a recurring problem for many years now and we have been making private efforts but we need the government to step in for us now.”

An estate agent whose office is located along Okota road, Yusuf Isa, expressed fears that his office might not survive another rainy season, lamenting that floodwater finds its way into the office with the smallest rainfall.

He said: “No matter how shortly it rains, this side of Okota road leading to Jakande Gate always gets flooded. We have carried out several interventions by ourselves and would appreciate if the government can step in now. We tried to channel the flood through Akiti to connect it to the canal at Oke-Afa but there is a limit to what we can do on our own. Because of this, Okota and Akiti are usually flooded but what can we do?”

Many residents in Oke-Afa, Okota, Ibeju Lekki and Ikorodu areas of the state, who spoke with The Guardian, also recounted similar tales of woe. Lagosians who reside along flood plains of major rivers and drainage channels such as Owode, Iwaya, Makoko, Badia, Ijora, Isaalu, Pota and Shibiri, among others, could not be reached. But Bello had advised them to always be on the alert and ready to move to higher grounds when the need arises, adding that they would be duly notified at the appropriate time.

He stated that the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) of the ministry had been consistently de-silting and working on various linkages to the secondary and primary channels to enable them discharge efficiently and act as retention basins.

Bello also disclosed that the government was maintaining the long-established synergy with Ogun-Oshun River Basin Authority, which had ensured control and monitoring of the steady and systemic release of water from Oyan Dam to prevent flooding the downstream reaches.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, an engineer, also stated that the state government would dredge about 221 collector drains and 32 primary channels measuring about 72 km spread across the 20 local councils of the state to checkmate flooding.

He reiterated that EFAG would continue to de-silt various tertiary channels and manholes measuring about 100 kilometres across the state.

While restating the present administration’s resolve to find a lasting solution to flooding in the state, he called on residents to desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on the rights of way of canals, adding that it was regrettable that several of the canals recently cleaned up were being littered with refuse.

Lagos might appear on top of the situation. But the problem of flooding at the peak of the rainy season is not limited to the state alone; it is a national problem. Since 2012 when floods killed 363 people and displaced over 2.1 million others from their homes between early July and November 5, no year has passed without the natural disaster claiming lives and property worth billions of naira in the country. From Lagos to Delta, Anambra, Imo, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Osun, Taraba and Kebbi states, among others, flood wreaks havoc on homes and farms yearly with adverse effects on the economy of the country and health of citizens.

The most recent report on the natural disaster, which was released by the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Muhammadu Muhammed, in early December 2020, stated that, “the devastating impact of the 2020 flooding killed 68 people, affected 35 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 320 local councils and over 129,000 people.”

Now, the question is: With another rainy season at hand and with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) predicting that “the country is expected to have rainfall amounts from 400mm in the North to over 3000mm in the South,” what are communities and the state governments doing to avert a reoccurrence? The Guardian spoke with relevant stakeholders in Akwa Ibom, Osun, Imo, Delta and Cross River states on the issue. The stories are as follows:

Solution To Your Flood Problem Underway, A’Ibom Govt Re-assures Apprehensive Residents

From Inemesit Akpan-Nsoh, Uyo

AS the rains begin to set in, residents of flood prone areas in Akwa Ibom State have sent a Save Our Souls (SOS) message to the state government to come to their aid so as to avert the perennial flooding they have been experiencing year in year out.

In Uyo, the state capital, residents in areas like Abak Road, Atiku Abubakar, IBB Avenue, Esuene Street, Ukana Offot/adjourning streets, Atan, Use and Effiat Offot communities have appealed to the government to replicate the ‘magic’ it used to control flooding and erosion along Oron road by Nsikak Eduok and Edet Akpan Avenue in their areas.

x

The residents noted that controlling the flood in their areas would enable them to access their homes, have their properties secured and ensure that they would no longer live in fear whenever rain is about to fall.

Mr. Okon Etim of Ukana Offot street told The Guardian that the flooding on his street had for several years rendered many persons homeless.

According to him, the government had always given affected residents relief materials when their household properties were destroyed, with a pledge to find a permanent solution to the menace.

He, however, lamented that successive governments had tried to remedy the situation to no avail. Offot said the situation appears to have worsened as houses along Calabar, Port Harcourt and Esuene streets and parts of the Federal Housing Estate are no-go-area once the rains set in.

Other residents, including Mrs. Nkoyo Akpan and Augustine Effiong, among others, also called on the government to come to their aid, adding that they could not afford the money to relocate or construct another apartment at the moment.

Findings by The Guardian, which the residents acknowledged, indicated that structures in the areas were built on the right of way, thereby blocking free flow of floodwater.



Responding to the cries of residents, the state Commissioner for Environment and Petroleum Resources, Mr. Charles Udoh, said government was aware of the problem, noting that it has, in conjunction with the World Bank, awarded the contract that would address it to China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) at an estimated cost of N12 billion.

Udoh stated that the 7.2-kilomtre flood control project covers 17 communities in three local councils; namely Uyo, Nsit Ibom and Ibesikpo Asutan.

His words: “The reality is that the government cannot go everywhere to de-silt gutters. So, while the government is doing the common areas, the government is calling on residents and citizens to also embark on de-silting of gutters. Flooding sometimes comes from bad habits like dumping refuse into gutters. We are also calling on our people to desist from dumping refuse into gutters. The waste management agency of the state is embarking on massive de-silting of drains all over the state.



“This is in addition to the three major flagship projects of the ministry that talks about water collection and harvesting, erosion control project, one in Etim Umana, one in Anua and then the IBB erosion control. IBB will not be completed this rainy season, but this is the last rainy season that everybody affected on the IBB corridor will face flooding. Once that is done, the entire Atiku Abubakar, Abak road axis, Mechanic village, State Secretariat, Atan, Effiat and Use Offot communities will be evacuated.

“We will also evacuate water from Area ‘C’ Police Command. All the water will be taken to the outfall drain and also taking water at some point of Ring Road Two. But we cannot complete the entire process within this rainy season. The IBB project is 8.4 kilometres, the biggest flood control project ongoing in Nigeria now.”



We Don’t Want To Abandon Our Homes Again, Osun Residents Cry Out

From Timothy Agbor, Osogbo

Some residents in flood-prone areas in Osun State have cried out to the state government to assist them in mitigating the problem this year.

Speaking with The Guardian, residents in flood-prone areas like Rasco, Gbonmi and Gbodofon appealed to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to save them from losing their houses to flood this year.

A landlord at Gbonmi, Mr. Suraju Kamaruden, said many house owners and residents in the community always relocate to safe areas when the rainy season is at its peak, adding: “We don’t want to abandon our houses again. That is why we are begging our government to come to our aid and help us.”

x

A trader at Rasco area in Osogbo, Mr. Jude Okpara, said traders in the area face difficult times during rainy season as flood always submerges their shops.

“We don’t have any other place to go. If not, we would have left this area. Although the government expanded the waterways about three years ago, the water still overflows its boundaries and submerges our shops. We are tired,” he lamented.

Chairman of Olorunwa Sawmill in Oke-Baale community, Osogbo, Mr. Sunday Ajewole, said there was an urgent need for government to construct a bigger drainage channel that would accommodate much floodwater when the rain is at its peak.

He said: “For the past seven years, we have been battling with flood. Every time we are in the rainy season, we always lose our planks to flood. Our government would always clear and expand the waterways every year but we are still battling flood. Most times when government fails to do something and we are approaching rainy season, we hire some labourers to help us clear the waterways. Sometimes we contribute between N80,000 to N100,000 and give to the dredgers. Still, we are not safe.

“We have discovered that the problem is that we have only one ring that forms the bridge of the waterways. And the ring is very small. The water that gushes from Ona-Baba-Ona area and Arogunmosa community would divert at our area and the ring doesn’t have the capacity to make it flow, as it should. It usually bounces back to where we stay, sweep our goods away and even sack residents out of their homes.

“This year, to lessen the severity of the flood, the government has cleared the waterways for us but once it rains heavily, there will be flood. Until the bridge is re-constructed and a bigger ring is fixed, we may not be out of this flood problem. We don’t have the financial strength to construct a bigger bridge and that’s why we are appealing to government to come to our aid.

“We have lost millions of naira worth of goods and property to flood in this area. We are afraid that if nothing is done again this year, property or even lives may be lost to flood because we have started seeing signs that it will rain heavily this year.”

To prevent a reoccurrence of flood in the state this year, the Osun State Waste Management Agency said it has been sensitising members of the public on the need to desist from dumping refuse on floodwater channels.

T

he General Manager of the agency, Mr. Fatai Oyewole, told The Guardian in Osogbo that efforts were ongoing to rid major gutters of refuse.

“We have been mobilising people not to dump refuse on waterways and major gutters,” he said. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment has disclosed that it opened up some streams across the state during the dry season for easy flow of water. This, according to the coordinator of the ministry’s Department of Flood Control, Samorudeen Odesanmi, an engineer, was part of the state government’s efforts at preventing another incident of flooding in the state.

“This government is proactive. Before the advent of this rainy season, we optimised the opportunity of the dry season to open up series of streams across the state for easy flow of water. If at all we are going to do anything on flood control, it would be minimal.

“We have already marked off some areas we want to work on this year and they are waiting for governor’s approval. Much had been done before now and we are on top of the situation,” he said.

Imo Commences De-silting Of Drainages, Vows To Demolish Houses Built On Waterways

From Charles Ogugbuaja, Owerri

AS this year’s rainy season gradually sets in, residents in Imo State and the state government have commenced preparations to mitigate the likely effect of flooding.

x

The flood-prone local councils in the state are the riverine areas of Oguta, Ohaji/Egbema and Orsu, among others. The locals in these communities began to experience massive flooding since 2012, which has resulted in loss of lives and destruction of their property. The flood, which occurs at the peak of every rainy season, had forced many residents to abandon their homes and relocate to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), where both the state and national emergency management agencies lent them helping hands.

A resident in Oguta, Jude Igwe, who called for quick intervention by the government, told The Guardian that he would not want a repeat of his past experiences this year, likewise other members of his family. He said: “Since 2012, almost on a yearly basis, we living in riverine areas have been witnessing flooding. It is not something to behold. Now that the rains are setting in, we appeal to the state government to prepare and assist us in time. Some of us are poor. We shall be relocated to camps as usual. So, we are calling for early preparation in case such occurs.”

Also, an indigene of Orsu, who identified himself simply as Okechukwu, recounted how his family lost valuable property in previous years and called for help.

“I am not ready to allow flood engulf us again. We are preparing ahead of time. But government and good spirited individuals should please come to our assistance ahead of time. We also want government to build gutters that will channel water to the rivers,” he said.

A community leader in Ohaji, Saturday Ochia, however, urged residents to desist from blocking waterways with refuse. He said: “We want our people to adhere to the simple environment-friendly rule of clearing the waterways. We do not want to witness flooding this year in our community. We are educating our people.”

Speaking with The Guardian, the Commissioner for Environment, Dr. Ikechukwu Njoku, said the state government was not leaving anything to chances, adding that it has commenced public enlightenment on appropriate waste disposal and clearing of drainages by holding town hall meetings with the monarchs, local government officials, community leaders and residents. He also disclosed that the ministry has commenced de-silting of drainages in Owerri, the state capital.

According to Njoku, the government has marked structures built on waterways for demolition, stressing that they were constructed in contravention of the state’s master plan.

He also gave assurance that the government has put a robust plan in place to ensure flood-free environment in the state capital and other communities, stressing that the Governor, Hope Uzodimma, would ensure the construction of standard drainage systems in the state.

Delta Is Already Prepared To Tackle Flooding, Commissioner Says

From Monday Osayande, Asaba

DELTA State government has declared that it was fully prepared to mitigate the impact of flood in coastal areas of the state this year.

The Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Christ Onogba, made the declaration in an interview with The Guardian in Asaba. Onogba noted that the state did not have to wait for NIMET or other agencies’ prediction on the effect of flood before putting things right.

“Firstly, we keep on saying to everyone that we are in the era of climate change, so those communities living in the coastal line should find alternative homes before the rains set in,” he noted.

According to the commissioner, it was necessary for flood victims to have alternative abode because government was no longer ready to build camps for those that might be displaced by flood due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We cannot set up camps as it used to be, but that doesn’t mean we are sleeping. In fact, we have done a lot. We are resetting the drains, and very shortly, we will open one of the channels that is flowing into the River Niger, and good enough, the road side drain in Asaba is clean and working fine.

“The government is prepared and we will never be taken unaware in the issue of flood. And because we understand that because of climate change, flooding is something that must happen, we will not wait for any prediction before we start making our preparations,” he emphasised.

A resident in Ndokwa East council, Mr. Emma Agboma, lamented that several homes had collapsed in the area in the past as a result of flooding.

“I think now that we are approaching rainy season, government should exercise its power early so that we are not taken unaware. They should be alert so that they can relocate some of us to upland. Many are willing to leave their houses but it is not easy to relocate from where you are used to over the years.

“Government should do as much as possible to mitigate our suffering in riverine areas – Burutu, Bomadi and Patani. So, government should do the needful by building camps early enough for us to relocate,” he said.

For Dave Ogochukwu, while government should try to evacuate people in flood-prone areas to avoid loss of lives, residents should also not dispose refuse indiscriminately, thereby blocking waterways.

“The property that has been lost since 2012 till date is enormous and it is not good for the growth of the society. In recent times, several farmlands have been overrun by flood putting farmers in a difficult situation.

“Over the years, government has made efforts to relocate people from the flood-prone areas but some people have been adamant. However, government should continue to sensitise the people on the need to relocate before the flooding begins,” Ogochukwu added.

‘We Have Been Crying Out To Government For Help’

From Agosi Todo, Calabar

LAST year during the peak of the rainy season, many communities in Cross River State experienced heavy flooding that destroyed farms and homes. Over 300 residents in the state were left homeless and properties worth millions of naira destroyed due to heavy rainfalls.

The rains destroyed farmlands specifically in Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Biase and Boki local councils of the state.

Some of the residents at Ikot Eka Edem in Calabar Municipal local council identified building of houses on waterways as the cause of flooding in the area.

A resident, Mr. Gab Otei, said he was apprehensive ahead of this year’s rainy season, lamenting that he lost his valuables to flood last year.

Otei said: “Last year, the heavy rains wreaked havoc in the whole of this street. I lost my valuables because I was trying to save my little children from being taken away by the flooding.

“I cannot leave this place because this is my father’s house and I stay here with my family. For years now, we have been crying to government at all levels to come to our aid and open the canals for free flow of water, but no response.”

A resident in Kakwagom community in Boki local council, Mr. Augustine Ita, said: “Last year, most of the yam and cassava farms were basically destroyed. We lost everything and you know that hunger was the effect of it. What those of us who farm in the riverine areas are trying to do now is to either cultivate earlier or make your mounds to be bigger than what it used to be, because if the mounds are very big, and the crop are up there, if the flood comes, it starts from the bottom of the mound. If God is on our side, we will still have something to hold on to. It depends on the strength of your mounds and how heavy the flood will be.”

Speaking with The Guardian on measures the state government was taking to safeguard lives and properties against flood this year, the Director General of Cross River State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr. Princewill Ayim, disclosed that last year, over 510 persons were displaced by flood across the state.

Ayim stated that although the state had not received the yearly prediction from concerned government agencies on what to expect this year, the agency has started sensitisation campaign in communities in Calabar South, Calabar Municipality, Boki, Biase, Odukpani and Etung local councils that are prone to flood.

He lamented that people living in flood-prone areas refuse to relocate to safe areas because they insist on remaining in their ancestral homes.

Ayim explained: “The way we do it every year is that we get informed from the national bodies. They tell us when there will be heavy flood and what to expect. For now we have not gotten any prediction but we cannot keep on waiting. We need to be proactive by engaging ourselves in activities that can mitigate heavy flood.

“We have our local emergency committees spread across all the 18 local councils. They interface with the locals to inform them more about flooding and how to prepare for it. And at the same time, we are also collaborating with the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC). Luckily, we are among the states that installed emergency outfit; so if you are in distress and do not have airtime in your phone, you can dial the 122 free toll number through which help can come to you. That is in place already.

“Apart from that, we use the media houses to educate the public to clear their drainage channels and to cut the entire weeds on the waterways. If you go to Calabar South for example, you see some stagnant water that if you don’t look very well you won’t know there is an artificial pool there.”","Sat, 24 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rainy-season.jpg,"['rainy', 'residents', 'water', 'world', 'flooding', 'waterways', 'flood', 'impending', 'season', 'area', 'guardian', 'nigeria', 'land', 'state', 'areas', 'fears']", ,flood

Speaking at the public presentation of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency’s (NIHSA) 2021 annual flood outlook (AFO) in Abuja on Thursday, Adamu said the flood projection in different states are of varying severity.

He said states surrounding River Niger and Benue will experience “severe flooding”, adding that it will aggravate the problems created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This year, we will be grappling with the two threats of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the impending floods as predicted in the AFO,” NAN quoted him as saying.

“The flood projections show varying severity across parts of the country.

“In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 local government areas (LGAs) in 36 states including the FCT will fall within the moderate probable flood risk areas.

“It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the highly probable risk areas.

“The states surrounding Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience severe flooding.

“Floods come with attendant health risks through the contamination of potable water sources. The 2021 flooding will be exacerbated by the continuing ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The minister noted that the 2012 flood which brought massive destruction of lives and property across the country necessitated the creation of a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront a reoccurrence.

According to him, the NIHSA forecasts have increased citizens’ awareness and led them to take measures to prevent severe flood damage.

He urged stakeholders, including policy makers and tiers of government, to take appropriate measures such as clearing of waterways and flood paths to contain it.","Thu, 06 May 2021 17:12:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Flood-Gwagwalada.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'varying', 'states', 'minister', '28', '2021', 'covid19', 'afo', 'risk', 'severe']", ,none

Rather than being a blessing, the rains have become a curse to many Nigerians, especially to coastal states and communities living along the bank of Rivers Niger and Benue. The federal government has issued a flood alert. Will the 2021 predictions go the way of others? TONY AKOWE reports

Since the devastating flood in Nigeria in 2012, it has become important for the government and its agency to make an annual forecast of possible flood and its impact in the country annually. Since the first forecast was made in 2013, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, working with other government agencies, has consistently warned the nation of impending flood across the country and in most cases, the intensity of such flood. Unfortunately, warnings by the agencies have often been ignored by both the people and state governments and their agencies. This year, the government has said not less than 121 local government areas across 28 states are at highly probable risk of heavy flooding, while another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will experience some level of flooding.

Flooding is categorised into river flooding, coastal flooding as well as flash and urban flooding occasioned by poor drainages, blocked drainages and poor adherence to town planning regulations.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) said flooding accounts for 15% of all natural disaster related deaths across the globe.

Floods have since become annual phenomena not only in flood plains, but also in urban and semi-urban areas. Experts link urban flooding to inadequacies of drainage channels that have become too small to contain excess runoff, the use of river channels as waste repositories thus clogging the channels, poor compliance with or non-existence of land use zoning/building codes, poor waste management practices, and removal of vegetation that create resistance and minimise flood impact. Coastal areas of Nigeria are not spared from flooding as they may be worst hit by flood this year. Interestingly, more states in Nigeria are increasingly suffering from annual flooding due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Unfortunately, Nigeria is located downstream of Rivers Niger and Benue, and therefore abounds with water resources that become a menace by causing flooding and flood disasters, the worst of which was experience in 2012 when hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property loss running into billions of naira including massive farm lands and crops when water was released from the a dam in Cameroon.

A close study of the predictions revealed that all the 20 local government areas in Lagos State (as against 18 in 2020) are likely to be affected with eight of them being at higher risk of heavy flooding. Apart from urban and river flooding, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Delta and Ondo states stand the risk of heavy coastal flooding. In 2020, similar predictions by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency and advice to states and local government areas to take precautionary measure to mitigate the flood fell on deaf ears in most parts of the country. The consequence was the displacement of over 2.3 million people and the death of 69 others. The outcome was also the washing away of farm lands in Kebbi and Jigawa as well as livestock and other valuables. The agency has continuously expressed concern over disregard for town planning regulations leading to people building on flood plains.

Minister for Water Resources Suleiman Adamu, who announced the 2021 prediction on behalf of the agency, said 121 local government areas in 28 states and the FCT as well as another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will likely experience high and moderate flooding in 2021. Acting on information from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, the minister also said there would be heavy coastal flooding in Rivers, Cross Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states. He stressed the need for concerted efforts to mitigate the impact of the expected flood.

He said: “So far, the flood levels will be higher than in previous years, but will not attain the levels of the 2012 devastating floods. In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 LGAs in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will fall within the moderate probable Flood Risk Areas. It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the Highly Probable Risk Areas. The states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience river flooding. These states and the number of local government likely to be affected include Abia (9), Akwa Ibom (2), Anambra (5), Bauchi (2), Bayelsa (5), Benue (3), Cross River (2), Delta (8), Ebonyi (4), Edo (1), FCT (2), Gombe (7), Imo (3), Jigawa (9), Kaduna (2), Kano (2), Kebbi (4), Kogi (9), Kwara (2), Lagos (8), Nasarawa (2), Niger (5), Ogun (3), Oyo (7), Rivers (12), Sokoto (7), Taraba (7) and Zamfara (1).”

The list of states to be affected by one form of flood or the other in 2021 show that northern and coastal states are at a greater risk of flooding this year, with some states along the River Niger and Benue are also likely to be affected. Adamu said flash and urban floods from heavy inundation were predicted to occur in some major cities, the severity of which would depend on the availability and adequacy of the drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.

He said: “The information contained in the AFO 2021 is a Clarion call to all stakeholders, policy makers, Federal, States and Local Governments, Departments and Agencies to rise and set up appropriate mechanism such as clearing the waterways and flood paths as well as maintaining proper water disposal management practices to curtail the ravages of the impending flood and threats of COVID-19. The year 2012 is a landmark in the annals of flood occurrence in Nigeria. It brought with it massive destruction of lives, property and critical national infrastructure. The need arose therefore, to put in place a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront the menace of this disaster of flooding, hence the coming into being of APO in the year 2013. The 2021 Annual Flood Outlook built on the successes of the previous eight (8) years forecasts by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency. The outcomes of these forecasts have been the increased awareness by the citizenry with respect to measures that need to be taken before, during and after floods. This has culminated in the progressive reduction in the severity of flood and its harmful effects on lives and property. The timeliness in the release of these forecasts is quite commendable and deserving of every possible support by all of us.”

He believed that man’s interaction with natural process has been both helpful and harmful to some degree, adding that the negative impact of man’s activities can be observed in the heightened climate change being experienced globally by way of rising temperatures, intensified rainfall, more destructive storms and floods. He maintained that the annual prediction by the agency is designed to create awareness of the inherent dangers of flooding and to inform people about locations that are prone to Flood risk at a particular time and encourage them to take appropriate actions.

Drawing attention to the 2020 experience, the minister said: “The year 2020 saw the devastating impact of extreme flood across the country with practically every state of the federation affected in one way or the other. The flood affected 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 349 Local Government Areas (LGAs) within the 36 States were affected and over 2,353,647 people were displaced with a record of 69 deaths. Kebbi and Jigawa States were worst hit with regards to agricultural lands and houses destroyed. Apart from the physical damages, other indirect losses are often overlooked. These indirect and intangible impacts are generally associated with disruption to normal life as well as long term health issues and stress-related illnesses. We must recognise that extreme weather and flooding extents do happen and that we need to be well equipped to respond to them. I am confident that our communities, infrastructure and businesses will be better protected if due attention is given to the information contained in this 9th edition of the Annual Flood Outlook.”

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs. Didi Walson-Jack, said: “The overall objective of this event is to sensitise the nation (i.e planners, decision and policy makers, farmers, stakeholders) and the general public towards embarking on preventive measures to improve on safety and reduce potential damages to lives and property from predicted flood events.”

She said the event was expected to provide ample opportunity for enlightenment campaigns in the media for better Preparedness on flood mitigation, control and management in flood risks locations across the country. She maintained that the accuracy of the predictions over the years have been fairly high and reliable, stressing however that “the focus is rather on prevention and mitigation of possible flood disasters by increasing the awareness of the populace and prompting them to take appropriate preventive, adaptive and mitigative measures”.

The Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd), stressed the need to strengthen multi-agency approach to disaster risk reduction in the country.

Mohammed said: “To enhance flood forecasting and management in Nigeria, NEMA is currently supporting NIHSA in establishing three Automatic Weather Observation Stations which are at various stages of installation located in Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti and Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. These stations will be used not only for hydrological predictions but also to train students in the field of Geography, Engineering, Agriculture, meteorology, climate change and other sciences”. He said further that “one of the lessons learnt during the 2020 flood after action review meeting is the need for proper utilization of our dams in the country. When dams meant for irrigation purpose are used for dry season agriculture, they acquire more capacities to hold more water in the rainy season. In addition, a timely controlled release of water from dams will reduce panic release of water during rainy season that can lead to further flooding.”

The Director-General of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze said government at all levels in the country must take necessary steps to avert a possible disastrous effect of flood in 2021. Nze said as the rains begin to set in, the country was gradually inching towards the peak of rainy season with its attendant flood incidents. He said Nigeria’s geographical location downstream of all the countries in the Niger Basin places it at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollution from all countries upstream, adding that this explain why persistent flooding has become an annual event since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster.

He argued that the annual flood forecast was to enable states and local government as well as individuals take concrete steps now to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past few years including clearing of blocked drainages and canals, removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinth and floats on water channels. People living along water ways as well as those having socio-economic activities in such areas should be encouraged to relocate o safer areas before the peak of rains, while there should also be an improved system for flood monitoring, flood forecasting and early warnings. He stressed that states must intensify soil conservation measuring techniques on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and encourage ecosystem protection, while also enhancing the enforcement of town planning code to allow for the construction of houses and drainage structures.

He said further that while it was not possible to eradicate flooding, efforts should be made to either reduce or minimise it, adding that state governments must educate their people, insisting that states must make efforts to avoid a repeat of the incidences of 2020 which saw over 450,000 hectare of rice plantation being washed away in Kebbi state alone as a result of flooding. Nzeh lamented that while the agency has continued to give early warning signs, many states in the country have failed to listen to the recommendations of the agency, adding that at the moment, Jigawa state has set up a committee that is working to reduce incidences of flooding in the state in line with recommendations from the agency.

The NIHSA’s Director of Hydrogeophysics, Stephen Margima Jabo, said flooding has become a global phenomenon that has increased in frequency over the years. According to him, the effective management of flood risk should be a collective responsibility of all stakeholders from the federal, state, and local to individual levels, adding that the existing synergy between Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, stakeholders and other collaborative agencies involved in flood management and disaster issues should be further strengthened. He said government at all level should also put in place measures for better town planning and effective land use zoning, effective flood disaster management in the changing environment, improved biodiversity and ecosystem management for the enhancement of rapid and sustainable development in the country. States, he said should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers particularly, where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood waters will not be lost to the sea.

The agency said among others that “stakeholders in the water sector should carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas by the removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers to improve their conveyance capacities and from dams, lakes and reservoirs to increase their storage capacities for the containment of the incoming floodwaters; there is need for construction of weirs, small reservoirs on tributary, streams and rivers for conservation of flood water to be used during the dry season thereby preventing desert encroachment, increasing irrigation food crop production, improvement of grassland areas, nomadic settlement, peace and sustainable development by relevant government agencies; intensification of soil conservation measuring technics on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and increase ecosystem protection among others; enforcement of Town Planning Codes in the country to allow for the appropriate construction of houses, and drainage structures and constantly freeing the waterways from obstructions and provision of adequate refuse dumping facilities by relevant authorities.”","Tue, 11 May 2021 00:15:10 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Flood-1.jpg,"['water', 'flooding', 'happen', 'local', 'flood', 'waiting', 'states', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'country', 'state', 'areas']", ,flood
7,7,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Collaborative Call to Mitigate Flooding - THISDAY Newspapers,https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/04/26/collaborative-call-to-mitigate-flooding/,"Udora Orizu writes that the widespread destruction and loss of lives caused by flooding in 2020, calls for all hands on deck by all tiers of government to put in place structures and adhere to warnings issued by flood monitoring agencies ahead of the next flooding season

September 12, 2020, around 8:00pm, residents of Alapere area of Lagos State, raised alarm as another flooding tragedy struck. Two yet-to-be-identified children were swept away as people battled flood after a heavy rainfall that lasted for hours and led to destruction of properties.

This is just one of the horrific, heart-wrenching experiences Nigerians go through, following havoc wreaked by floods every year. Yet nothing is done by stakeholders to ameliorate the disaster.

Nigeria with a population of over 200 million people, faces numerous natural disasters, with flooding being the most common. Most states in the country are increasingly suffering from annual flooding during the rainy seasons. However unlike some natural disasters, rainfall flooding can be controlled with proper planning and the provision of necessary infrastructure.

Flooding in Nigeria is usually caused by climate change, river overflowing, dam opening, current poor urban planning practices, poor drainage systems that can’t cope and so on. In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the neighboring states.

Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals. The immediate impact of it include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases. These were seen recurring this year, in various states of the federation.

Havoc in Some States

In a report on October last year, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods since September have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across 22 states in Nigeria. Furthermore, around 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people were reported to be displaced.

According to the Red Cross, the overflowing Benue and Niger rivers caused severe floods in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara States from October 6, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. At least 57 people died, 473 were injured and 22,357 displaced. Flooding was also reported in southern parts of the country, Bayelsa, Anambra, Rivers and Delta States, were affected and fatalities reported.

One of the most devastating impact of floods was seen in Kebbi State. The flood swept away villages and peoples, displacing families and destroyed about 90 per cent of crops, putting the country’s food security at risk. Over 30 lives were lost, hundreds of houses destroyed and thousands of residents displaced by the devastating flood that sacked communities in the state.

The losses incurred by the farmers, particularly rice farmers in Kebbi State were colossal and immeasurable , they run into billions of naira . Thousands of hectares of fadama rice farms in the state were affected by the flood. Rice farms , other agricultural crops, livestock and even communities were not spared by the raging floods.

Chairman of the State Emergency Management Authority (KSEMA), Alhaji Sani Dododo, revealed that five different bridges had been washed away across the state.

The Birnin-Kebbi-Makera-Kangiwa road, an international highway, which runs from the state capital to Niger Republic, is at the risk of caving in at Duku. Some of the minor bridges and culverts along the highway are already caving in, following erosion caused by rising water overflowing the nearby River Rima.

Also, the Bagudo-Tuga-Kaoje route, which leads to Benin Republic border, including the Tuga Bridge, is also submerged, cutting border communities. Dododo, who confirmed the number of deaths recorded so far, said 10 people died in a boat that capsized at Ihiru in Jega Local Government.

“Only eight bodies have so far been recovered; a family of six – father, mother and children were wiped away in Arewa council area. We recorded one death in Yauri, among others. The numbers may increase, since we are experiencing rainfall daily. In Bagudo council area is the worst hit by the flooding, as it was learnt that 98 per cent of the villages were affected.

In Iwaro Oka community of Akoko South West Local Government area, Ondo State

a middle-aged man was swept away by flood. Sources said the motorcycle of the farmer, identified as Akede, was seen inside the river very close to a popular filling station, which made people aware that the farmer was missing. Family members were thrown into mourning when all efforts to find him proved abortive. His body was later recovered in a river very close to St Patrick’s College, Iwaro Oka.

In Lokoja, Kogi State, the road linking Kogi East and Eastern Nigeria to the state capital was flooded for days as canoe and boats were employed to navigate the roads which is meant for cars and other road users.

In Niger State, officials of the state government visited communities submerged by flood to ascertain the extent of damage and to enable government render assistance to victims.

In Kano State, the Kano Emergency Management Agency confirmed four persons killed and over 5,200 houses destroyed due to flooding in Rogo and Danbatta Local Government Areas of the state. He disclosed that two persons lost their lives and 200 houses destroyed in Rogo, while two other persons and over 5,000 houses were destroyed by flood in Danbatta.

Also the South-south and South-east were wreaked by flood havoc. South-south states like Delta had over 150 houses submerged by flood. In South-east, Anambra for instance, over 5,000 persons have been displaced by flood that submerged houses, schools and churches in the Ogbaru Local Government Area. The Chairman of the council, Arinze Awaogu, said about 1,000 of the displaced persons were being catered for at Internally Displaced Persons’ camps in the area, while many others trapped in their communities needed evacuation.

He said, ”Over 5,000 families have been displaced, while churches, schools and many residential houses have been submerged by flood, with farm crops destroyed and displaced persons seeking refuge in Onitsha and surrounding communities. At the moment, we are housing over 1,000 IDPs; we have over 5,000 persons who have been displaced; some are taking refuge in the residences of their relatives, who live upland, including Onitsha. We need the Federal Government’s assistance in the areas of donation of food items, non-food items, medical supplies, establishment of sick bays and sending enough medical personnel to help in handling the situation; our fear now is that of a possible outbreak of epidemic.”

Earlier in the year, heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

In Abuja, four Area Councils, Bwari, Gwagwalada, Abaji and Kwali which are prone to flood were affected by the disaster with Gwagwala being the worst hit in July as eight lives were lost, over 100 houses submerged and properties destroyed. On July 25, after a heavy downpour which lasted for hours, five residents were swept away and several houses and cars destroyed in Gwagwalada, Dawaki, Giri and Zuba where the flood cut the bridge linking Ikwa, Yimi and other villages.

The incidence was confirmed by the Director General of FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Idris Abbas who had said there was a building collapse in Dawaki as a result of the flood. Gwagwalada is flooded from Giri. A family of five were flooded at Giri.

“We got one body and still searching for four. We rescued six people and are in the hospital. The flood has damaged a lot of houses and property, especially at Gwagwalada. The residents are still saying some are missing but they cannot give us the identities of such persons who they claim to be missing. People should be careful when it is raining. They should not drive on water. They should not build on flood plain. They must respect the master plan of FCT and ensure that all drainages are clean. What happened in Giri-Gota was because people built on flood plain”, he said

Federal Lawmakers Laments

Back in September, the Kebbi State Caucus in the House of Representatives while commiserating with the government and people of the state on the recent flood disaster that ravaged the entire state, said the disaster is a major setback to the federal government effort to boost local rice production as part of measures to end rice importation.

The Chairman, Hon. Muhammad Jega, representing Gwandu/Aliero/Jega federal constituency, lamented that the disaster could not have come at a worse time for the farmers who were looking forward to a bumper harvest this year to reduce the rising cost of food items.

The lawmaker, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari and the state Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, for the prompt response to reduce the hardship caused by the flood, also urged them to as a matter of urgency send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state.

Jega further urged the federal government to commission a study with the aim of providing a lasting solution to the perennial flood disaster in the state.

According to him, “The flood is a serious setback towards addressing food security in the country; the government, therefore, needs to address the shortfall of the food supply chain to reduce the hardship and cost of food items in the market, and also address the severe environmental degradation caused by the flood. This may include adequate and early preparation for dry-season farming and reconstruction of major infrastructures affected in the state.

‘’The estimated cost of the disaster is over N10 billion across the state. We call on the federal government as a matter of urgency to send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state, as early preparation for dry season farming should commence in earnest with provision of seedlings, fertilizer and other inputs to be made available to the farmers in good time.’’

Also, a member of the House of Representatives, representing Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency of Delta State, Hon. Ossai Nicholas Ossai, decried the submerging of over 150 houses in Delta State, by devastating floods.

He said that since past two weeks, the Ndokwa East Communities of Delta State have been bedeviled by constant and frightening heavy downpour, being accompanied by excessive flooding and erosion, that is seriously and presently wreaking havoc in the Communities.

According to him, the affected communities are; Ossissa, Onyah, Ase, Ushie, Ibedeni; Asagba, Aballa-Uno, Agballa-Obodo, AgballaOshimili, Uchi, Okpai, Onuaboh, Inyi, Benekuku, Aboh, Onyah, Asaba-Ase, Ibrede, Ashaka, Afor, Abalagáda, Umuolu, Igbuku, Obettim, Obodo-Okolafa, Iyadama,0nuogboko, UtagbaOgbe, Utagba-Uno, Ogume, Onitsha-Ukwuani, Akarri, Umuolu, just to mention a few”.

He said he was disturbed that “schools, farmlands, health centres, places of worship have seriously been affected and over 150 households has been rendered homeless particularly children and women and more is still being affected daily. About 90per cent of the ommunities in the entire Ndokwa East Local Government Area has been submerged,and worse still is the deplorable economic conditions of the peasant farmers in these agrarian communities”.

He observed that these communities are often prone to serious environmental disaster as a result of vulnerability of constant coastal flooding and erosion from the River Niger”.

The legislator, pleaded with the Federal Governnment, to Direct the Ecological Fund office to conduct an environmental survey with a view to addressing the excessive flooding in these Ndokwa Communities and urge the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to urgently provide relief materials for the Hood victims in accordance with section 6 of NEMA Act.

NIHSA Flood Alerts

In February, the Director General of Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze, alerted the government, stakeholders and all citizens to use this period of dry season to prepare ahead for 2021 flooding.

Nze lamented that Nigeria currently doesn’t have enough dams, saying more dams would help to mitigate floods.

He explained that with the increasing global population and the expanding activities of man, flooding would continue to persist, hence the need to control human activities, environmental adjustment and purposefully adopting actions in certain areas that would make adjustment possible.

According to him, “Flooding problem is a global environmental issue which is faced by many countries worldwide, particularly in areas close to low lying terrains and river valleys. Over the past years, there have been increasing concerns that human actions and natural catastrophes have been adversely impacting the environment, posing serious ecological and environmental hazards.

“Though flood is a natural environmental phenomenon, it can be greatly accelerated by human-induced activities as it is the case worldwide. Some floods may result in major disasters involving structural and erosion damages, disruption of socio-economic activities, loss of lives and properties, displacement of people, destruction of agricultural land and contamination of water and environment in general.”

The director general said this is the appropriate time to construct drainages where they are necessary (but not provided), dredge river channels, clear blocked gutters and drainages, and pull down structures that are within the floodplains and flood paths.

“There is a reasonable time to do that before the rains set in. According to the 2020 Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public recently by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), February 24 and June 22 are the predicted onset of rainfall in the South-south and Northern states respectively, while the respective predicted cessation dates are December 28th and September 26th. This implies that Nigeria is likely to experience longer period of rainy season in 2020 compared to year 2019,” he added.

Again, in September, the agency warned members of the public to expect more floods in the months of September and October.

Nze, gave the warning at a press briefing in Abuja, saying that the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country.

Nze explained that any release of excess water from the dams in countries upstream Rivers Niger and Benue this year would have more negative impacts on Nigeria, which is located downstream of countries in the Niger Basin.

He identified the highly vulnerable states as Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa.

He said that the flood that ravaged Kebbi State just about a week ago left so many damages and noted that the current flooding situation called for vigilance on the part of all the stakeholders.

The director general called the states and local governments as well as multi-national companies and public-spirited individuals to join hands to save the country from the consequences of “twin pandemic” (COVID-19 and flood) in the year 2020.

Nze warned: ‘’The rains are finally here. The volume of river flows on our river is surging and river channels could no longer accommodate significant runoff as floodplains, which traditionally serve the alluvial plains and are rich in agricultural productivity, lost its retention capacity to give way to flooding of adjacent lands.

“Farmlands and crop yields are being lost to furry of floodwaters, livestock and ecosystem species are diminishing while hope for livelihood hang in the balance due to monumental economic losses.

‘’As a matter of fact, all the states of the federation have suffered several degrees of flooding since June 2020. The danger is not yet over. Information received from the regional Niger Basin Authority (NBA) by NIHSA, has it that as at 7.30am today September 10, 2020, the River Niger flood level in Niamey, Niger Republic, attained an unprecedented level of 7.02m (702cm). This is a far cry from the value of 6.60m which I reported in my last press briefing of August 25, 2020.

“Noting that the Red Alert Warning Zone in Niamey is 6.20m and above, the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country, Nigeria, which is at the Lower portion of Niger Basin within this month of September and October.’

‘’Based on the report of the expected flood coming down from Niamey and the projected contributions by the inland rivers, both Kainji and Jebbo Dams built on River Niger have continued to spill water downstream. The Shiroro Dam on River Koduno, with reservoir level at 381.48m as at 9.00am today, has been maintaining a regulated spilling into the River Niger. The effect of all these is that the communities in the states adjoining River Niger will continue to be highly inundated by River Flooding as is being witnessed in the recent time.”

Recently, The DG of NIHSA, briefing the press on March 24, 2021, again advised the three tiers of government and citizens across the country to prepare against impending devastating floods in 2021.

Nze, who gave the advice at a press conference in Abuja, said this was because Nigeria was at the receiving end of disastrous floods among the nine countries of the River Niger Basin.

He said, “There is still time for states/LGAs (Local Government Areas) and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

“As the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin which covers nine countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season with its attendant flood incidents.

He also advised Nigerians residing at waterways to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains, just as warned that Nigerians have about three months to prepare against the disastrous effects of flood.

He explained that the country’s geographical location is downstream of all the countries in the Basin, making it to be at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollutions from all the countries upstream.

The DG lamented that relevant authorities are frustrating the effort of the Federal Government by neglecting the predictions, as could be seen in the results of last year’s damages.

Nze while urging the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past years, noted that there is still time for stakeholders to take steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

Expectations from Stakeholders

In the last few months, President Muhammadu Buhari has been sending solidarity messages to some states affected by flood disasters with promises of federal aid. The president authorised needed assistance to 12 states worst affected by the seasonal rains. The states are: Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Edo, Anambra, Delta, Kano, Jigawa, Rivers, Bayelsa and Adamawa.

However, flooding in various state has become a recurring decimal for decades, all tiers of government are expected to put all hands on deck and come up with a permanent solution. Flood is a natural disaster, but lack of preparedness is a man-made disaster.

As Nigeria is months away till the next rainy season, stakeholders have ample time to do the needful and heed to flood warnings by various monitoring agencies in order to avert another impending tragedy.

One of the main strategies as stated by NIHSA is that, the 36 States and the FCT authority should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using the flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood water will not be lost to the sea to become saline water.

The agency is also urging state governments to pull down structures built on flood plains and expand the drainages for easy flow of water as one of the strategies mapped out.

According to them, the foodstuff, meant for distribution to the vulnerable, is to cushion the ravaging hardship in the region. Flagging off the exercise in Yola, Adamawa State, one of the associates, Dahiru Hammadikko, said the gesture was courtesy of Tinubu’s associates in the 19 northern states.

He said over 10,000 households in the 21 local councils of Adamawa were targeted to benefit. He lamented that Nigerians were facing hardship, which informed the group’s move to ameliorate the suffering of Nigerians, irrespective of religious and political affiliations.

The national coordinator of the Tinubu support group said: “The gesture is to honour the national leader of APC, due to his philanthropic disposition, which is why the rice was branded with his image.”

He described Tinubu as “a detribalised Nigerian, in whom the Northern region relies” as the unifying factor.

“Today, we are flagging off the distribution of 5kg of rice to Nigerians from the northern region. We are targeting one million beneficiaries in the 19 northern states and the FCT.

“But here in Adamawa we are giving over 10,000 people,” he said.

10,10,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Many states not taking precautions against floods –NIHSA boss - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/many-states-not-taking-precautions-against-floods-nihsa-boss/,"The Director-General, Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, Mr Clement Nze, tells OKECHUKWU NNODIM that the devastation caused by floods in many states is as a result of the failure of the governments to adhere to warnings

What are the types of flooding being experienced in Nigeria?

There are three major types of flooding that we experience in Nigeria. The first one is river flooding, which is not just from rivers that are within Nigeria but from River Niger and River Benue, and these are trans-boundary waters. There is also urban/flash flooding, and these are caused by poor drainage systems or even non-existing drainage systems in many major cities in Nigeria. Lastly is coastal or tidal flooding for states that are within coastal areas such as Ondo, Lagos, Bayelsa and Rivers.

Now, it is important to state that our Annual Flood Outlook is a scientific prediction done using historical data physically collected in the field, some of them over 40 to 50 years ago. So, we use it to project and see what is going to happen tomorrow. And from what we have seen using international standards to predict, we have said that not less than 121 Local Government Areas in Nigeria, in 27 states actually, will be affected by flooding in the course of the year. Also, about 302 LGAs will experience different magnitudes of flooding. And about 351 LGAs may have a lesser severity of flooding. But like I said, it is a prediction, which we monitor closely by weekly publications. We are talking about the issue of climate change and so what you see today may not be what will happen tomorrow. So, as a result of that, we will be updating the media, states and others on what they are likely to observe in the course of the year.

How are you interfacing with the states with respect to predictions in the AFOs?

We will be doing sensitisation programmes and will downscale it to the states. We will tell the governors that these are the locations in your state that are likely to be affected in the course of the year 2021. We informed the public through the press some months ago, as preparatory to the unveiling of the 2021 AFO. And by protocol, it is the Minister of Water Resources who interfaces with the governors on behalf of the agency. Last year, for instance, the minister sent letters to each of the state governors in Nigeria and detailed the states that would be affected by flooding in that year. But what they did with it is another cup of tea.

Also, we go through other systems in the states such as their emergency management agencies, water resources and environment ministries. We interface with them directly, but what they do with our information is another issue.

Are you satisfied with what states are doing about the recommendations in the AFOs?

Frankly speaking, they are not doing as much as we expect from them, otherwise, the level of devastation that happens year in year out could have been avoided or eliminated. We’ve been telling the state governors that the tempo of political activities they embark upon during election periods should be deployed against activities that encourage flooding. Go to the grassroots, you have councillors in LGAs. They should be able to cascade this information and domesticate it in their own locations. But often time, it doesn’t happen. However, when a disaster occurs, they are quick to complain and cry out to high heavens and maybe get some support from the humanitarian ministry. But in terms of ameliorating the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.

I recall in 2016/2017, I engaged some state emergency management agencies one-on-one and we were told not to come to tell them what will happen in the course of the year except we are coming with relief materials. But we told them that that was not our jurisdiction. Ours is to inform you about what is likely to happen in your own state. If it happens, you have the National Emergency Management Agency that can support you, not NIHSA.

What are states likely going to face by failing to abide by the recommendations in the AFO?

Going by the law establishing the agency, the agency’s powers begin and stop at predicting and releasing the message. We don’t enforce anything. Each state has its own regulatory body, such as the urban planning department and emergency management agencies. They also have environmental laws and ministries that are supposed to be the regulators to ensure that the dictates of our prediction are followed. I may then say that NEMA could now insist by saying, ‘Since you failed to do the needful, don’t run to us for relief materials.’ This is because, if you recall, when the flood was very severe in 2012, the Federal Government gave out a lot of money. Some states got about N4bn to N5bn, depending on the degree of devastation.

Maybe such decisions could be taken by NEMA so as to encourage states that are doing well in terms of adhering to the predictions to ensure that lives and property are not lost. We, as an agency, can’t enforce anything; we can’t force any governor to do the needful. But the governors on their own should in the spirit of humanity protect and help those who voted them into power.

Are you collaborating with sister agencies on climate issues?

In fact, our relationship with one of them, NiMet (Nigeria Meteorological Services Agency) is very superb and cordial. First of all, at the international level, the meteorological agency is Nigeria’s permanent representative with the World Meteorological Organisation, and that falls on whoever is the Director-General. Also, whosoever heads the hydrological agency in any nation is an adviser to that permanent representative. So, in that wise, there is a very good collaboration between NIHSA and NiMet; for instance, we requested rainfall data from NiMet. And this was one of the major inputs in the model to use for predictions. They provide us those data at no cost. And once they are releasing their own predictions, such as the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction, which is now called Seasonal Climate Prediction, they inform NIHSA.

So, we collaborate a lot; they provide us with data that help us to do our prediction alongside other river measurements that we do by ourselves. We use so much data – about 12 of them, but the rainfall data are among the major data.

What are some of the recommendations in the 2021 AFO, and what advice do you have for farmers?

Farmers should heed our predictions. They should also abide by our warnings. Those who farm within the river banks should ensure that their crops have early maturity. This is to ensure that before the onset of the rainy season or flooding, the crops would have matured and be harvested. Flooding doesn’t come with the rains immediately, rather it is when the soil is saturated and its moisture content becomes high that flooding will begin to take place. So, if there is a way they can be helped to plant crops that can mature easily, it should be done, so that before the flooding starts they can harvest. And after the flooding, heavy nutrients are now brought within the flood plain, which can lead to enhanced yields when the farming starts again.

The Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, for instance, once mentioned that because of the heavy nutrients that the floods brought, they were able to regain what they lost in one of the farming seasons. That governor is very active, he works with us and comes from time to time to ask what could be done to improve farming activities in his state.

What are some of the things states should be doing now, considering the looming flood?

Like I said in our press briefing in March, there is still time for states, LGAs and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021. We made it clear at the briefing that as the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin, which covers nine countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season, with its attendant flood incidents. Nigeria’s geographical location, downstream of all the countries in this basin, places it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollution from all the countries upstream.

We know that the persistent flooding and flood disasters have become an annual event in Nigeria since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster in recent history. In 2012, hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property losses running into trillions of naira.

It is in the light of the above that NIHSA wishes to urge the states and the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly menace of flooding in the past years. We recommend that the three tiers of government should consider clearing drainage systems and canals and also embark on projects for improving hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows. They should carry out the removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinths and floats on water channels and on all avenues for river runoffs. We also encourage people living along the waterways and those having socio-economic activities on flood plains to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains.

Description of the disaster

On 6 October 2020, flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of the torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto, and Zamfara state (amongst other states) affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin, which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas. Table 1 illustrates the flood impacts of the worst flood affected states.

The situation in Kebbi – the country's biggest rice-producing state – is especially dire, as vast farmlands are completely submerged due to the most recent rains. Meanwhile in Jigawa state, a total of 18 out of 27 Local Government Areas (LGA)s have been affected, with Gwaram, Birnin Kudu, Kirikasamma, and Gumel as the worst hit. Wide swaths of farmlands have been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of Naira. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), with the support from the Federal Government, is scaling efforts to assist flood victims by providing emergency needs. So far, the agency has distributed 30 canoes to inundated communities, as well as materials to build embankments to control the floods.

Kwara State is also concerning as more than 5,000 households have been affected. The government estimates damage worth N10bn have been incurred. At least three lives in Ilorin are believed to have been lost. Scores of houses also had their roofs blown off by the raging storm that accompanied the heavy rains in the Ilorin metropolis while electricity poles were destroyed in Taiwo and Odota areas of the state capital. Telecommunication masts and building walls were also damaged in Olonkonla, Bobonkiri, Egba-Akota, Aberi, Akuji and Idiope, all in Ita-Ogunbo area, Alanamu Ward in Ilorin West Local Government Area, the worst hit.

Since September to date, torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across Nigeria. Some 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people are reported to be displaced. Most of the those affected are children. Wide swaths of farmlands have also been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of naira. These floods have so far impacted 22 states in the country’s six geo-political zones: North West (4 state), North Central (4 states), North East (4 state), South East (4 states), South-South (3 states) and South West (3 state). This earlier flooding had weakened Nigeria’s water supply and road infrastructure, killing dozens and leading to disease outbreaks.

A government team began the delivery of food palliatives to the Kwara North Senatorial District, beginning with Jebba town in Moro Local Government Area and Lafiagi in Edu Local Government Area. Over 15,000 households across 357 communities of the state are estimated to have been affected by the ugly incidents that also destroyed farmlands and human dwellings worth billions of naira. In the wake of the floods, over 100,000 hectares of rice, maize and millet farms in Kpata-Gbaradogi, fishing and agrarian settlement in Pategi LGA were destroyed. About 100 residential buildings were also submerged while 1,500 people were rendered homeless.

The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, warned flood-prone states to prepare for flood emergency, rescue and rehabilitation. According to the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rainy season is expected to continue until December 28th in the southern parts of the country. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), predicted that at least 102 LGAs in 28 states fall within the highly probable flood risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 states of the Federation, including FCT, fall within the moderately probable flood risks areas.","Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540152-Nigeria%20Floods%20-%20Emergency%20Plan%20of%20Action%20%28EPoA%29%20DREF%20n%C2%B0%20MDRNG030.png?itok=T4e01g_v,"['n', 'dref', 'affected', 'north', 'epoa', 'flood', 'local', 'floods', 'states', 'action', 'area', 'farmlands', 'plan', 'nigeria', 'state', 'mdrng030', 'areas', 'emergency']", ,none
14,14,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Nigeria Loses a Quarter of Rice Production to Floods - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/nigeria-loses-quarter-rice-production-floods,"ARGUNGU - Farmers in northern Nigeria have lost more than two million tons of rice, a quarter of the country's projected harvest, due to flooding. Despite the loss, Nigeria is so far upholding a year-long ban on land-based imports of rice to crack down on smuggling and boost local production.

Ibrahim Adullahi is looking at what remains of his 350-hectare rice farm in Nigeria’s Kebbi state.

Abdullahi was expecting a harvest of 600 tons of rice, but weeks of severe flooding means he will be lucky to get 100.

“Since when I started farming, I have never experienced intensive cultivation of rice like now, because a lot of people are into the rice farming. But unfortunately, we experienced this intensive flooding that we are still experiencing now, and farmers are now counting losses because 90 percent of our farmers have lost what they have cultivated,” he said.

Nigeria’s biggest rice producing state, Kebbi, had projected 2.5 million tons this year.

But heavy September rains washed away two million tons. Local rice miller Mohammad Anuana said this could cause a further jump in the price of the grain.

“If rain has already washed away all the farm product, you know the goods will be rising up (in price) because the little one they have on ground - they will make sure they recover (the value of) the one that the water moves away. And, so they’ll double the price,” he said.

With Africa’s largest population, Nigeria annually imports billions of dollars of rice and wheat. But the country hopes to become self-sufficient.

Last year, the government banned land-based rice imports to crack down on smuggling and boost local rice production.

Despite the lost rice, the Nigerian officials say the ban will remain in place.

Chairman of the All Farmers Association in Nigeria John Wuyep said affected farmers will be compensated.

""The government and even the financial institutions have a machinery in force. So many who have lost now are already preparing for the dry season farming,” he said.

Nigeria’s farmers association says better groundwork is needed to prevent flooding and have a steady water supply during the dry season.

Flood reduction would also help save homes and the displacement of thousands of Nigerians from overflowing rivers.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2020-09/vlcsnap-2020-09-30-12h41m36s655.png,"['farmers', 'production', 'lost', 'flooding', 'local', 'quarter', 'price', 'tons', 'floods', 'million', 'nigeria', 'imports', 'loses', 'rice']", ,flood

Heavy rains have caused extensive flooding in Chad, Niger and Nigeria since the onset of rainy seasons in June. Chad’s rainy season, expected to last until October, is the heaviest in the past 30 years (OCHA 25/08/2020). Flooding in Niger has affected almost twice the estimated population. Flooding in Nigeria is less widespread than in 2019, but is still significant (NIHSA 06/2020; OCHA 21/07/2020).

Almost 60% of all affected people and over half of reported deaths from the three countries are in Niger, the country most affected by floods (UNHCR 15/09/2020). Flooding has affected more than 516,000 people across all eight regions, and resulted in at least 71 deaths (UNHCR 17/09/2020; OCHA 24/09/2020). Nigeria is at risk of crossborder flooding, given it is downstream from other flood-affected countries along the Niger River basin, including Niger (HNO 12/2019).

In all three countries, heavy rainfall and flash floods have resulted in the widespread destruction of shelters, driving displacement. Emergency shelters are overcrowded and unsanitary, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection and the spread of water-borne diseases (IOM 1/09/2020; OCHA 07/09/2020).

The Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region complicates flood relief efforts and increases protection concerns for highly vulnerable displaced populations in all three countries. The situation is most severe in northeast Nigeria, where over 2.7 million people are displaced and 10.6 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, especially food, shelter and WASH (OCHA 14/09/2020; UNHCR 31/07/2020). Additionally, cross-border violence from Mali affects northwest Niger and insecurity caused by banditry poses further risks to flood-affected populations in northwest Nigeria.","Wed, 07 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1538484-20201006_acaps_briefing_note_flooding_in_chad_niger_nigeria_.png?itok=WwqCv9xM,"['ocha', 'affected', 'chad', 'flooding', 'briefing', 'unhcr', 'shelters', '2020', 'countries', 'note', 'nigeria', 'widespread', 'risk', 'niger', '30', 'acaps']", ,flood
16,16,FL-2017-000126-NGA,How Africa's largest city is staying afloat - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210121-lagos-nigeria-how-africas-largest-city-is-staying-afloat,"Navigating the thronging streets of Lagos, Nigeria, is a challenge at the best of times. But during the rainy seasons, the city's streets can become almost impassable. Home to more than 24 million, Lagos is Nigeria's economic powerhouse, making it a destination for people seeking new opportunities. But that rapid growth creates pressure on the streets, and the environment.

The streets are often flooded, in part due to the dysfunctional disposal of the 6,000-10,000 tonnes of rubbish generated daily in the city. After a downpour, rubbish piles up in open gutters and makes moving around the streets difficult. “I worry when it rains, especially when it is heavy,” says Lagos resident Stephanie Erigha. ""It makes me anxious."" On one occasion when taking a taxi through a waterlogging-prone part of the city, she recalls the water gushing right into the back seat next to her.

While the overall climate in Lagos is expected to see less rainfall overall with climate change, the intensity of rain is expected to increase, bringing with it greater risk of flooding. Meanwhile, the low-lying city is also particularly vulnerable to water from another source: rising seas. If global warming exceeds 2C, the city is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100, according to research led by marine physicist Svetlana Jevrejeva, of the UK's National Oceanography Centre.

How, in the face of flooding, blocked streets and rising waters, is Africa's most populous city adapting?

Floating architecture

There is one part of Lagos that has extensive experience of dealing with high water. Much of the Makoko neighbourhood is not built on land, but rather sits on stilts above the waterline. Makoko, known as the ""Venice of Africa"", is a labyrinthine slum built on stilts and navigated by canoe. The slum has little access to electricity or clean sanitation, but it has also been home to innovations like the Makoko Floating School, a structure resting on recycled empty plastic barrels for buoyancy. The school's pyramid shape helped lower its centre of gravity and so increase its stability, while also being an ideal roof shape for shedding heavy rains.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/live/624x351/p094q1j4.jpg,"['afloat', 'water', 'rubbish', 'streets', 'slum', 'africas', 'staying', 'rising', 'lagos', 'stilts', 'shape', 'largest', 'city', 'makoko']", ,flood

The Edo State government said it has appointed a contractor for the flood control project at Ughoha community in Esan South Local Government Area of the state, signalling the commencement of the project.

The project coordinator, Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP), Tom Obaseki, made this known on Wednesday at Ugboha, while introducing the project contractor to the community.

Mr Obaseki assured the people that the best contractor was selected to handle the project because of the importance of the community to the state.

“Ugboha is very important to us and we thank the community for producing great men that have made so many positive contributions to the development of Edo State.

“We made sure that in the process of recruiting a contractor for the job, we went for the best of the best,” he stated.

Mr Obaseki solicited the support of the traditional head of Ugboha and members of the community for the smooth implementation of the project.

“We want to solicit the support of your highness and the entire people of the kingdom so that there will not be hitches down the line.

“Every time we waste or lose cannot be recovered. So, we want to seek your support in providing the enabling environment and security for the contractor,” he said.

The traditional head of Ugboha, Ukato Steven II, assured that the community would provide a conducive environment for the successful and timely delivery of the project.

Outrage as IDPs camps overflows with displaced residence



Governor raises the alarm as terrorists hoist flag in Kaore community

Affected communities speak out: “We don’t want Govt food or money but adequate security to enable us to return home

CAN goes spiritual; declares 3-day fast

By Wole Mosadomi

Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

“I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

“We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.”

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists’ presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. “Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don’t need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,” he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: “The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.”

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God’s intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

Speaking when the 2021 flood outlook was presented in Abuja, Nze said states have maintained a carefree attitude towards flood warnings over the years.

“Last year, the minister sent a letter to all the state governors in Nigeria and informed them in detail of what to expect, yet not too many states are doing something about it,” he said.

Nze urged state governors to use the same energy for political activities when tackling environmental challenges such as flooding.

He said: “It could be avoided or eliminated. The tempo of political activities they exhibited during the elections should be replicated in tackling this disturbing issue of flooding in the states.

“LGA councillors should be able to domesticate this information in their own locations but this doesn’t happen.

“Once the disaster occurs, they are quick to cry to high heavens, but in terms of reducing the impact of flooding before it occurs, they don’t seem to be doing much.”

The NIHSA DG also warned that going by historical data, there are indications that 121 LGAs in 27 states and the federal capital territory (FCT) are likely to experience flooding this year.","Sat, 08 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Flooding-River-Niger.jpg,"['political', 'rallies', 'flooding', 'tackling', 'occurs', 'states', 'nze', 'nigeria', 'governors', 'state', 'nihsa', 'treat', 'seriousness']", ,flood

There Is No End

BLUE NOTE

8/10

Though I’d witnessed the hypnotic magic of Tony Allen while he was drumming for his Afrobeat contemporary Fela Kuti, and had long been a fan of the rhythmatist’s work with King Sunny Ade and Ginger Baker, it wasn’t until the drummer played with Damon Albarn’s Gorillaz, then his The Good, the Bad & the Queen project, where I could speak to Allen. A casually cool drum god stuffed into a regal kingseat, Allen treated Albarn’s compositions and the rhythm section he had formed with Paul Simonon (of The Clash fame) in 2006 as but one more piece of his puzzle, a West African–styled Lego set layered with the ragged, angled tiles of R&B, funk, and jazz. He talked of taking the eccentric English music touched by dub and Afrobeat in stride, and made all that he laid his hands on a simple life pleasure—like sipping fine wine. Combine that cool complexity with an innate in-the-pocket oomph more finely regulated and metronomic than Clyde Stubblefield’s steady, burrowing groove, and Allen was magnificent—the rhythm divine personified.

Allen passed in April 2020 with a handful of compositions and demos in the planning stages for a new solo album—a soulful, personal catalog which merits greater examination—and to commemorate that passing, Blue Note drops There Is No End. Completed by its co-producers Vincent Taeger and Vincent Taurelle, with vocalists and rappers such as Sampa the Great and Danny Brown, the End’s game isn’t some grand finale or explanatory note summing up a career. Like everything else Allen was about, it’s but another piece of a greater puzzle.

That metronome’s meter, with a dub-house break and a hi-hat’s ride, turns “Stumbling Down” into something eerily atmospheric, yet sharply angled, a woozy track made whole by Sampa’s giddy rap. The same floppy dub break with tuneful jazzy brass applied doesn’t so much punctuate “Deer in Headlights” as it does stir up a smoldering psychedelic stew made weirder by Allen’s phase-shifting snare sounds and Brown’s leering voice. The Afro-pop of “Cosmosis” has the feel of being everywhere and nowhere at once, and aggressively yet.

Such aggression can easily be connected to years of warring strife, racism, insurgency, and pleas for justice in Allen’s homeland of Nigeria, and throughout a cut such as “Hurt Your Soul,” you can sense the pains of Allen’s drums, even when he’s rat-tat-tatting a snare to emulate the ring of gunshots. For every dramatic snare sound of Allen’s, there’s another tom-tom romp waiting to be beheld, even quietly and rumbling during “Très Magnifique” and its warm-winded rap courtesy Tsunami.

Though hardly or specifically hip-hop, it’s fascinating that Allen’s last full album is dedicated to the drummer’s relationship with rap, sweet or sour, and young collaborators. But, as its title signals, Tony Allen was a restless soul to go with his position as the rhythm divine personified.

By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja

A bill seeking to amend the fire service act of 1963 and include other natural disasters as emergencies to be given urgent attention has passed for second reading in the House of Representatives.

The bill is titled “An Act to repeal the Fire Service Act Cap. F29 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and enact the Fire and Emergency Service Act 2021 to provide for additional powers for effective service delivery; and for related matters”.

The non-fire occurrences listed by the bill needing emergency rescue included flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters.

The sponsor of the bill is Rep. Adejoro Adeogun Akoko South East: South West Federal Constituency of Ondo State.

Leading the debate on the general principle of the bill at Tuesday plenary, Adeogun said that the bill when passed into law would provide stricter penalties for violation of building codes and fire regulations.

He said: “The fire service act (1963) saddled the Fire service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies. This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required.

Also read:

“This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.

“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”

According to the lawmaker, the goals of the bill are essential to prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters; encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by States, Local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies; establish the office of the Fire and emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the Fire and emergency service; empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilize resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies; and provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officer.

“Mr Speaker, Hon. colleagues, the major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency.

“It will also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through the engagement of able-bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.

“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating of future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources. I am therefore seeking the support of all distinguished Honorable members of this house for the second reading of this bill and eventual passage”, Adeogun submitted.

The bill eventually received the overwhelming support of the House majority when subjected to a voice vote by the presiding officer, Ahmed Idris Wase and passed for second reading.

This was disclosed by the NHSA Director-General, Mr Clement Nze, in a press briefing on Wednesday in Abuja. He urged that strict town planning codes be enforced, calling for constructions of flood walls, buffer dams, dykes and other infrastructure that can hold water and prevent flooding.

What the NHSA is saying

“Federal, states and local governments should clear drainage systems and canals, and embark on projects that will improve hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows… carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas through removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers, to increase storage capacities,” Nze said.

READ:

The NHSA boss revealed that Nigeria is stepping into the 2021/2022 hydrological year in the River Niger Basin, which includes a total of 9 countries, citing the yearly occurrence of flooding in the country since 2012.

“It then means that Nigeria is gradually inching closer to its peak rainy season with subsequent flood incidents,” he said.

“Nigeria’s geographical location downstream, of all the countries in the Basin, puts it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollutions from all the countries upstream,” Nze added.

In case you missed it: According to the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rising heatwave in the month of March just before the rainfalls was caused by NorthWestern and South Western air masses from the Sahara and Atlantic Ocean which generates so much heat during the transition month period of March-April.","Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Rainfall.jpg?fit=900%2C506&ssl=1,"['rainy', 'river', 'nhsa', 'urged', 'floods', 'peak', 'season', 'states', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'closer', 'nze', 'countries', 'expected']", ,flood

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beat/University of North Carolina PressWho doesn’t love a book with more than one index entry for possum? Two hundred of them were cooked at an Oklahoma City bash in 1923, along with 5,000 chickens, 10 bears, 500 beef cattle, 5 tons of coffee, etc. These are but some of the many fascinating facts in Adrian Miller’s new book Black Smoke: African Americans and the United States of Barbecue.Meet One of the First Barbecue Kings: Henry ‘Poppa’ MillerThe Lost African-American Bartenders who Created the CocktailThe book has 22 recipes (bison skewers, banana pudding, alligator ribs), 16 mini-profiles (such as barbecue king Henry “Poppa” Miller), and a big mission.In the 1990s, Miller worked as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton in the One America Initiative, which had the goal of fostering dialogue and helping communities reconcile racial divisions. Miller’s books could be seen as an extension of that experience. His James Beard Award-winning Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time expounded upon the social history of key soul dishes—fried chicken, chitlins, yams. In The President’s Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas, Miller researched the contributions of African Americans who worked in the White House kitchen.So faced with a whitewashed and one-sided representation of barbecue, Miller got to work. While most people agree that barbecue is a result of European influences dovetailing with Native American techniques in Southern kitchens where the cooks were African Americans—that barbecue, in other words, is Black—evidence, by which I mean scholarly evidence, well-researched and reliably sourced, has been vanishingly scant.To find that essential information, Miller turned mostly to newspaper archives.“For all my books, the biggest boon has been newspapers,” he told me. “They were about capturing the daily life of the community, and so you got a lot more flourish and details about what was happening at a particular event.”He sifted through the records of the speakers and the attendees at big community barbecues—which was tough work, since the food was often barely mentioned.Eventually, “writers started paying more attention to the details and at a time when African Americans went unnoticed more and more of them started talking to these Black barbecuers.”“Now, let’s just be straight up,” Miller said. “Part of this was to mock them. So you’d have them speaking in plantation dialect. But you saw other writers treating this person as an expert, as an artist and showing some love.”“I’ve struggled on how to tell people this,” Miller told me. “During the racist times you actually got more details.”And by the 1830s, in order to have legit barbecue, it was thought, an African American cook and his crew were necessary and barbecue was understood to be a Black experience. Miller explained a complicated twist in the narrative in words far more polite than I might have chosen: “In the 1850s, as there’s more and more tension about slavery, you actually find pro-slavery advocates using the plantation barbecue as evidence of their generosity.”After the Civil War, a group of African Americans “emerged from slavery with a highly specialized and marketable skill.” Barbecue culture flourished because African Americans were barbecuing on their own terms. “And that shows up with political barbecue, church barbecue and also emancipation barbecues.”Barbecue, after all, is perfectly suited to big crowds. You can feed thousands of people, as many as show up, as long as you’ve got the wood, the space and the meat.But the meat, says Miller, is not as cut-and-dried, so to speak, as one might think.In words sure to bring upon him (if not me, by association) a plague of wonky BBQ commentary, Miller reports that: “The regional barbecue styles that we fight about so fiercely today, they’re only about a hundred years old. Before that, barbecue was pretty standardized. It was hardwood coals in a trench, butterflied whole carcasses, flip it and sauce it, cut it up and serve it.” Pork was common, of course, but so was lamb and mutton, and the first emancipation barbecue, which took place in Port Royal, South Carolina, was a beef barbecue.Equally fascinating are the unsung regions of barbecue that Miller has championed such as St. Louis, Chicago, and the east side of Texas, where the meat comes with sauce and the sides aren’t the Germanic salads you find in Central Texas but soul food greens and creole dirty rice.So what happened over the last century? How did we get to a place where white people are thought to own barbecue?“At the very time that people are getting interested in barbecue, the non-diverse food media basically said ‘OK, these are the people we think should tell you what barbecue is, and where to get the good stuff.’ And they just kept putting white dude after white dude out in front.”And as he says it, and we talk about the trends that get pushed in barbecue, it becomes obvious, almost to the point of hilarity: the reason the mantra of barbecue became minimal seasoning was because we kept asking white people how to make barbecue. I suggest that I hear an echo of the old joke about how white people don’t season their food, and he laughs and agrees.“We’ll just flip that to our advantage,” Miller said, “and say you don’t need to season.”This trend is a big part of what brought Miller to write this book. “Chronically, there’s been so little coverage of African American barbecue culture.” Everywhere in the food media, the lack of African American representation “just hit me over and over.”He wasn’t sure, upon setting out on the project, how much he would find, and he feared, in the beginning, that he might be embarking on a record of faded glory. “I really thought I was going to be writing an elegy about Black barbecue,” he said. But “it’s thriving. It’s resilient.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A Michigan man who “lost everything” in a flood a year ago just won $2 million from a scratch-off lottery ticket.

The lucky 29-year-old, who chose to remain anonymous, said he “couldn’t stop shaking” when he found out about his sudden change in fortune.

“Last year, I lost everything in a flood, so to win this prize is so overwhelming to me,” he said in a statement released by state lottery officials.

He was on his way to pick up his kids from school when he stopped at a grocery store in Midland — and a ticket for the lottery’s Lucky 7s instant game caught his eye.

“Seven is a lucky number for me, so I decided to take a chance and bought the ticket,” said the man, who also won $10,000 playing the lottery a few years ago.

“I scratched it off when I got back to my car. When I saw I had a match, I thought: ‘Great, I won my money back!’ When I saw I had actually won $2 million, I couldn’t stop shaking.”

He went to the lottery headquarters to claim his big prize, opting for the lump sum of about $1.3 million instead of receiving annuity payments for the full $2 million.

He said he plans to pay off bills and save what’s left of his winnings.

“Knowing my kids will be taken care of is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

28,28,FL-2017-000126-NGA,"Nigeria: Aftermath of Boko Haram Invasion - Niger State Communities in Panic Mode As Victims, Others Flood IDPs Camps - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/202104300443.html,"Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: ""I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

""I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

""We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.""

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists' presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. ""Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don't need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,"" he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: ""The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.""

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God's intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 28 Nigerian states are at risk of heavy flooding this year, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said Thursday.

This year's flood projections will, as expected, vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country, and rivers are likely to exceed flood level with some low-lying areas to be inundated, said the NIHSA in a statement following an earlier survey.

Out of the 774 local government areas in the country, it said, some 102 local government areas across 28 states are at risk of flooding -- one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria, which has a devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on floodplains for livelihood.

Although the projections showed that the floods this year might not be as severe as in previous years, it was important to begin to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns for preparedness, the agency said.

In March 2012, 32 of Nigeria's 36 states were affected by flooding, in which more than 360 people were killed and almost 2 million displaced.

The phenomenon is repeated across numerous communities in West Africa, where traffic and business come to a standstill for hours or days, waiting for the streets to drain. Sometimes the flooding becomes deadly.

Last year, hundreds of people were killed in a mudslide in Freetown, Sierra Leone, along a hillside where residents of the booming city had cleared forests to build homes. Victims were buried alive in their houses and vehicles. Environmental groups and local organizations had been warning for years that the development was risky.

In Nigeria, local television stations reported that more than 100 communities had flooded and broadcast images of muddy waters reaching the rooftops of clusters of homes. Some people died when flooding caused their homes to collapse, according to Agence France-Presse.

Local leaders in some areas were advising residents to evacuate. Officials in Anambra State set up 28 camps for fleeing residents. Thousands of people fled their homes in Cross River State, officials there said, noting that many of them lived in swampy areas or along waterways.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Nigerien student Hachimou Abdou has had to catch a boat to classes since river water swamped his route to university in the capital Niamey - one of about 760,000 people hit by severe flooding in recent weeks in parts of West and Central Africa.

Floods are common during the rainy season, but in recent years climate change, land degradation and poor urban planning have led to more frequent disasters as rapidly-growing cities struggle with heavier-than-normal rainfall.

Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Congo Republic and Senegal are among those worst-hit this year, with at least 111 people killed, according to latest figures from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Waters have yet to recede in parts of Niamey since torrential rains in August caused rivers to burst their banks, destroying nearly 32,000 houses and 5,768 hectares of farmland across Niger.

“I have to get to university - either I take a boat or I walk in the water,” Abdou said, before settling into a traditional wooden pirogue to travel up the flooded highway.

Flooding across landlocked Niger alone has so far impacted nearly 333,000 people. Over 188,000 people have been affected in neighbouring Chad, with OCHA warning of potential food shortages due to inundated land.

With further rain expected, particularly in Central Africa, the situation is expected to worsen, said OCHA’s director for West and Central Africa, Julie Belanger.

Communities’ ability to cope with natural disasters has been eroded by instability, food shortages and mass displacement in some areas. Over 25 million people are in need of humanitarian aid in the violence-plagued Sahel area, which includes Niger, Chad and Mali.

“Many of those populations live in flood-prone areas. It’s just a matter of time for them to be at risk of epidemics,” Belanger said, describing how quickly diseases can spread once floods wipe out access to clean water and sanitation.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200910&t=2&i=1532955151&r=LYNXMPEG891XR&w=800,"['recent', '760000', 'water', 'chad', 'university', 'central', 'floods', 'west', 'hit', 'parts', 'niger', 'severe', 'niamey', 'africa', 'shortages']", ,flood

An image of trucks and cars on a flooded road has been shared in multiple social media posts claiming to show a submerged highway in Nigeria’s southern Ogun state following a recent heavy downpour. This is partly false; while the location is correct, the photo has been circulating since at least 2019.

The image appears in numerous Facebook posts, including this one published on March 24, 2021, with more than 500 shares.

“Sango Ota bridge, I understand this was yesterday o (sic),” reads the Facebook post published on a page called “Lady K ifeoluwa show”. It has a history of calling for the secession of the Yoruba nation from Nigeria.

Screenshot taken on March 29, 2021, showing the misleading Facebook post

Sango Ota is a town in Nigeria’s southwestern Ogun state and is home to the country’s former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. The majority of inhabitants in the region are Yorubas, a large ethnic group in the west African country.

The rest of the post, translated from Yoruba into English, pleads for the “intervention” of state officials and then declares “end Nigeria now”.

The photo it refers to shows submerged vehicles on a flooded road, and features alongside an almost identical claim in this Facebook post with more than 800 shares, as well as on Twitter.

However, the image has been circulating online for more than a year.

Old photo

Using the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check traced earlier versions of the claim to Facebook accounts here and here on March 22, 2021.

It was reposted on Facebook the next day by Joe Igbokwe, the special adviser to the Lagos state governor for drainage and water resources.

“Sango Bridge after yesterday's rain, this is sign of what the people of that area should be expecting this year except the drainages are cleared. Please tell Ogun State to consult me (sic),” reads Igbokwe’s Facebook post.

AFP Fact Check has previously debunked misleading information shared on Igbokwe’s account.

In this case, AFP Fact Check confirmed that it actually rained in Sango Ota on March 22, 2021, according to the World Weather Online site.

Furthermore, an AFP journalist in Nigeria confirmed that the photo was indeed taken in the town.

However, the viral image is not evidence of any recent rainfall or flooding.

A Google reverse image search led to this Facebook post and the same picture from September 7, 2019, captioned ""Yesterday Rain @ Sango"". Five days later, global humanitarian organisation ReliefWeb reported that heavy rainfall in the preceding weeks had caused flooding in some parts of the country.

Flooding has long been an issue in the town. In 2011, residents called on the government to construct drainage to prevent an environmental disaster.

Now, like thousands of hectares of rice in Nigeria’s Kebbi state, it is under water.

“Almost all my farm has been flooded. I didn’t harvest any rice,” Ladan told Reuters News Agency. “It’s going to be devastating.”

Floods early this month across northwest Nigeria destroyed 90 percent of the two million tonnes that Kebbi state officials expected to harvest this autumn, the head of the state branch of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. The loss amounts to some 20 percent of the rice Nigeria grew last year, and the waters are still rising.

Further south, outside Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, chicken farmer Hippolite Adigwe is also worried. A shortage of maize forced him to sell most of his flock of more than 1,000 birds, and the 300 he has left are hungry. Chicken feed prices have more than doubled, and he is not sure how long he can cope.

Twin crises, floods and maize shortages, come just after movement restrictions and financing difficulties caused by COVID-19 containment measures complicated spring planting.

Some farmers and economists said it could push Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, into a food crisis. Rice is the country’s staple grain, and chicken is a core protein.

“There is a real fear of having food shortages,” Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. “The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Nigeria took roughly 4,000 tonnes of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s (ECOWAS) strategic stocks last month and released 30,000 tonnes of its own maize. It also gave four companies special permission to import maize.

The prominent Nigerian Economic Summit Group has called for “a complete overhaul” of agriculture policy.

Problems accessing foreign exchange to import food are adding to shortages. In July, the central bank added maize to a list of items for which importers are banned from using its dollars. Rice and fertiliser were already on the list, along with other items that Nigeria wants to be made locally.

Last week, even as food prices spiked, President Muhammadu Buhari promised that not one cent of central bank dollars would go to food or fertiliser imports, as Nigeria would continue encouraging local farmers over imports.

Importers can use dollars from pricier parallel markets. But these are tough to find due to an oil price crash that has cut Nigeria’s core source of foreign exchange.

Switching grains

Rice prices had already risen substantially due to a land border closure last year that aimed to stamp out smuggling and boost local production.

The worst is yet to happen. Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex

Peter Clubb of the International Grains Council said the spike drove consumers to eat maize instead. This, along with a disappointing crop late last year and the foreign exchange issues, boosted maize prices to 180,000 naira ($470) per tonne from approximately 70,000 naira ($183) in March.

Farmers sid that consumers grappling with inflation, as well as the first rise in fuel prices since 2016 and a power price spike, can only pay so much more for food.

Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex, said the central bank’s lending scheme for farmers has significantly expanded output, and can work long term.

But the coming months will be tough. Fertiliser prices hit a record after a COVID-19 outbreak shut down country’s sole urea plant for two weeks, meaning more farmers will skip fertilisers, limiting crop yields.

“The worst is yet to happen,” Balogun said. “It is a problem across grains.”

Buhari has pledged more support, and Agriculture Minister Muhammed Sabo Nanono visited the northwest area this weekend and promised to provide farmers with high-quality seeds and to set up a special committee to ensure they have all they need to plant new crops as soon as possible.

Adigwe, the chicken farmer, said he thinks barring foreign food in order to help farmers is not a bad idea, but “there are some factors that were not considered.”

Is the government doing enough?

Over the last few years in Nigeria, seasonal flooding has killed hundreds, destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, and displaced millions of people.

This year, since the rainy season began in June, twelve states have been badly affected. In four of them – Anambra, Delta, Kogi and Niger – the government declared a state of emergency. The National Emergency management agency (NEMA), which coordinate disaster management in Nigeria, estimates that two hundred people have died so far and over 600,000 people have had to flee their homes.

The havoc wrought by heavy rains this year has been devastating. But this level of destruction is not new to Nigeria. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and scores have died in floods. In 2012, particularly severe flooding led to two million displacements and 363 deaths.

Why Nigeria floods

Nigeria’s flooding problem derives from a combination of factors, natural and man-made alike.

On the one hand, rainfall has become significantly heavier in recent years due to climate change. This year, the Niger River reached 11.06m above sea level and could rise further, approaching the record 12.84m of 2012. Water levels have also risen in upstream Cameroon, Mali and Niger. These countries feed the Niger and Benue rivers, which flow through Nigeria. The towns along these two main rivers are particularly vulnerable.

Man-made issues have also contributed to the problem.

For example, Nigeria has several dams along its rivers, ranging from huge hydroelectric stations to smaller constructions for irrigation and fishing. These structures can, in theory, help manage water levels. But in reality, many have been poorly maintained and run, contributing to the build-up of water levels, endangering nearby towns and villages.

“Dams are not necessary facilitators of flood,” says James Akanmu, a water resource and environmental engineering expert. “But we often mismanage dams and they lead us into problems.”

Another contributing factor is a lack of town planning. As Nigeria rapidly urbanises, towns and cities have sprawled with little regard for environmental concerns. Waterways and canals that are crucial for flows are often filled in as part of building developments, while informal settlements in some areas vulnerable to flooding have doubled in population.

“People are building on water ways. People build houses without drainages. The government builds roads without drainages,” says Alabi Soneye, Professor of Geography at the University of Lagos.

“There is pressure in Nigeria cities. Too many people squeezed into small space and everything overstretched,” adds urban planner, Ugochukwu Donald.

The response

In response to this year’s floods, the government pledged $8.2 million for relief efforts as well as declaring a state of emergency in four states. NEMA set up five emergency operation centres to facilitate search and rescue operations and humanitarian support. These efforts have faced huge practical barriers in reaching flood victims, however, while they have also reportedly been undermined by poor management, bad governance and corruption.

Many also argue that such a reactive approach is insufficient in anything but the short-term. Experts say that Nigeria must proactively predict and prepare if it is to reduce the huge damage caused by floods.

Geography professor Soneye argues that the main problem is not planning but implementation. “Master plans are not Nigeria’s problem,” he says. “We have master plan documents, [but] nobody is acting on it. The disaster continues to grow.”

One area in which Nigeria has attempted to establish forward-thinking is through early warning systems. But this has not been straightforward. Nigerian meteorological agencies make predictions about potential flooding and warnings are meant to be sent to locations at risk, but the system is not always effective.

Furthermore, even when information is passed on, there are challenges associated with getting people to act accordingly. Around half of Nigeria’s population lives below the poverty line and moving households to safe areas can be complex and costly.

“It is not enough to tell people to move that the rains are coming. The early warning system needs to provide that support for such response to take place,” says Peter Nwilo, professor of surveying and geo-informatics at the University of Lagos.

Soneye suggests that many citizens are distrustful of state orders and that warning systems should work through local intelligence and community collaboration to be effective. “The people are not in the mood to believe anything that comes from the government,” he says.

Nwilo concurs. “Our warning system needs to be domesticated and localised before it works,” he says. “People are reluctant to comply with the early warning system until disaster catches up with them. Ignorance is huge and we must improve.”

Indeed, as floods continue to devastate areas of Nigeria year on year, the environmental, economic and – most importantly – the human toll is huge. The necessary actions in many cases are known, but as climate changes leads to more unpredictable and heavy rainfall, Nigeria’s flooding problems will only increase unless there is reliable forward planning, sound management and careful implementation.

“The situation is straight forward,” says urban planner Donald. “Flooding is a natural disaster. We cannot entirely rule it out. But somehow, Nigeria has failed to do the right thing: to make corrections from the past.”","Thu, 15 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://africanarguments.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nigeria-flood.jpg,"['problem', 'pours', 'water', 'seasonal', 'flooding', 'huge', 'emergency', 'management', 'floods', 'warning', 'system', 'nigeria', 'rains', 'growing', 'niger', 'nigerias']", ,flood

IT was past noon – lunch time – but there was only one customer at the bukka. Loretta Eze, the proprietor, surveyed the busy street as she stood by the entrance of her restaurant located by the corner of a street in the Wuse 2 area of Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. A number of girls in yellow shirts, who worked as attendants in the restaurant, were hanging around waiting for the solitary customer to finish his meal.

“It was not always like this,” Loretta told The ICIR‘s correspondent, who visited the restaurant while investigating the impact of rising prices of foodstuffs on the preparation and consumption of food, especially jollof rice.

“Food items are very expensive these days and the situation is very hard for those of us that are into catering and food business. Things are hard and as a result, we are not getting as many customers as in the past when things were cheaper,” Loretta added.

Higher cost of foodstuffs has forced restaurants, including roadside bukkas and ‘Mama put‘ joints, to increase the prices of different dishes on their menu and Loretta observed that the development had, in turn, forced some customers to stay away because they could not afford meals as in the past.

Loretta’s observations and concerns mirrored the findings in the SBM Jollof Index report for the first quarter of 2021.

The SBM Jollof Index, developed by SBM Intel, an Africa-focused research firm, simplified the appreciation of food inflationary trends using a common delicacy that most Nigerian households enjoy – jollof rice.

Across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, SBM collects data on the most common ingredients that go into cooking jollof rice in 13 markets on a monthly basis except for December, due to the seasonal spikes caused by Yuletide celebrations. From the prices collated, the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for a family of five or six is averaged and used as a proxy for measuring food inflation across the country.

The commodities that make up the Jollof Index include rice, curry, thyme, seasoning, groundnut oil, chicken/turkey (poultry), beef, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions.

The SBM Index is published three times a year – at the end of the first three quarters. Data from October and November are reflected in the Quarter 1 Jollof Index of the following year.

Cost of making pot of jollof rice rose between March 2020 and March 2021

According to the latest SBM Jollof Index report, the average cost of making a pot of jollof rice rose by 7.8 per cent between March 2020 and March 2021.

The sharp spike in the cost of preparing the delicacy was attributed to a number of events which impacted on food prices. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020, the border closure and foreign exchange restrictions in August 2020 were worsened by a sharp hike in energy tariffs by September of that year.

The situation was further compounded by the the #EndSARS protests, as well as the food blockade imposed by northern traders on the southern part of the country, which disrupted agricultural supply chain and the movement of people and goods.

The reopening of land borders in December 2020 did not result in a significant drop in the cost of food items – the price of a bag of rice only dropped slightly by a margin of N1000 to N3000 depending on the market but that did not translate into a drop in the cost of making a pot of jollof rice for the majority of Nigerians who buy from retailers.

The SBM Jollof Index noted that food prices remained high due to factors such as reduced local production, exchange rate fluctuations, poor harvest due to adverse weather, and high cost of energy and transportation.

Insecurity was also a major factor for the increasing cost of preparing a pot of jollof rice, translating into rising food inflation in Nigeria.

“Some of the jollof rice ingredients such as rice, onions and tomatoes have witnessed reduced local production because of protracted conflicts and terrorist attacks on farmers. Out of the 11 main rice producing states in the country, Benue, Borno, Ebonyi and Kaduna have witnessed attacks on farmers with the most gruesome being the execution of about 110 rice farmers in Borno in November 2020,” the report said.

Faced with deaths from terror attacks in insecure agrarian communities, several farmers are leaving the countryside and moving to the cities to take up menial jobs.

Despite recent drop in inflation rate, Nigerians are still groaning over increasing cost of food items

According to latest figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria’s inflation rate dropped from 18.17 per cent in March 2021 to 18.12 per cent in April 2021.

The 0.05 percentage points decline was the first recorded in headline inflation in about 20 months.

Food inflation also recorded a decline – from 22.95 per cent in March 2021 to 22.72 per cent in April, 2021.

However, while the NBS suggested that inflation might have peaked and could continue to drop, Nigerians are yet to get any reprieve while purchasing foodstuffs.

For Loretta, a food vendor who deals in foodstuffs, the price of food items has continued to spike in the market.

Making a comparison of what was obtainable in the past and the present, she told The ICIR, “Before now, I used to buy a small basket of tomatoes between N300 and N500, but now, it is N1500. Some tomatoes even go for N2500 per basket. Also, a basket of fresh pepper is N1500 now. Before now, you could get a pint of groundnut oil for N300, but it is now N650.”

She added, “Before now, with N2500 or N3000, I could prepare a normal pot of soup or stew but now, if you don’t have at least N7000 you will not get the taste you want due to the high cost of food items.”

Further lamenting the daily hike in the price of staple food items, she observed that, not too long ago, a mudu, or regular measure of beans, was between N250 and N300. But a mudu of beans is N800 now.

“It is the same case as meat. Before now, with N6000 or N8000, you could get the quantity of goat meat that would be enough for you, but now, you will have up to N15000 or more for that same quantity.”

According to her, the increase in the price of onions was ‘manageable’. “The quantity we were getting for N100 before is about N400 or N500 at the moment.”

Loretta also pointed to the sharp increase in the price of rice.

“Before now, a mudu of rice was N300, but now, a mudu of local rice is about N800,” a development which she admitted had increased the cost of preparing a pot of regular jollof rice.

Speaking further, Loretta said, “crayfish and stockfish are totally out of the question” due to recent hike in the prices of the food items.

Nkechi Emmanuel, a housewife, had a frown on her face as she walked out of Dutse Market, in the Bwari area of Abuja. She was clutching a handful of food items.

In a brief encounter with The ICIR‘s correspondent, Nkechi explained that the feeding allowance her husband gave her each month, which was never enough in the best of times, was now barely able to provide a pot of stew and soup.

“It has never been this bad and it is getting worse by the day,” the woman said in a frustrated tone.

All types of foodstuffs are becoming out of reach for the poor and the lower middle-class by the day.

Mary Okon-Essien operates a restaurant in the FCT. She took a break from serving a customer to respond to questions by The ICIR‘s correspondent on May 20.

Okon-Essien stressed that the increase in the prices of basic food items, which had driven up the cost of food, had resulted in reduced patronage for food vendors.

“Before now, the highest amount you could get egusi is N250 or N300 for a mudu, but now, a mudu of egusi is N700 or N800.

“The situation is very difficult for those of us that are into food business. Due to the high cost of foodstuff, it is not easy to sell and make profit anymore because customers are having problems with the higher prices,” she said.

Garri is generally regarded as ‘poor man’s food,’ but Okon-Essien said that was in the past.

“Garri is longer a poor man’s food. A mudu of garri is now N500,” she told The ICIR.

Okon-Essien also noted that another staple foudstuff – red oil – had become more expensive.

“Before now, you could get a tin of red oil for N200, but now, it is not less than N500,” she said, while observing that the situation was more worrisome because the food items were locally produced and not imported.

Besides becoming more expensive, some food items which Nigerians took for granted, due to their availability, are becoming scarce.

The increase in the price of fufu, a cassava meal, goes with the increasing scarcity of the food item, according to Okon-Essien.

“Fufu is a food item that is loved by Nigerians but right now, fufu is scarce and that has made it very expensive. I don’t know if Nigerians are not planting cassava again. Fish has also become very expensive. People now find it very difficult to afford fish for their meals.”

Okon-Essien corroborated the findings of the SBM Jollof Index for the first quarter of 2021.

“Not too long ago, with as little as N1000, you could prepare a pot of jollof rice for your family because with that amount, you would get rice and some amount of crayfish, onion, maggi and other foodstuff you needed. But now, that N1000 will only be enough for a mudu of foreign rice and if you want to cook local rice, then you will need N700 or N800 to buy a mudu of rice and as a result, you will not have much left for the ingredients needed for the jollof rice.”

Highlighting the dismal impact of high food inflation on the food industry, she observed, “Before now, when it was lunch time, you would see many people coming to eat, but now, lunch time seems like morning time, you hardly see anybody. You only see a few people coming to eat and this is because there is no money and everybody is ‘checking his pocket.’ Before now, they could get a plate of food for N250 or N300, but the least you can get a plate of now is N400 or N500,” the woman said.

The number of customers in restaurants has dropped, Okon-Essien noted.

Inflation rate still very high despite recorded decline

Nigeria’s inflation rate might have recorded a marginal decline in April but it remains very high and this is especially so for food inflation.

This was stated by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) which decried the current inflation rate of 18.12 per cent.

Director General of LCCI Muda Yusuf noted that despite the recently recorded decline in the inflation rate, “food inflation at over 22 per cent is still very high in spite of the marginal moderation in food prices in April 2021.”

Yusuf said the situation had continued to exert a negative impact on the activities of every economic agents, including households, businesses and investors, with profound impact on the citizenry, particularly the low and middle-income households.

“The high level of inflation continues to dampen consumer purchasing power at a time households incomes are not increasing in proportion to cost,” he said, adding that the development had resulted in rising production costs and depressed margins for businesses.

Nigeria at risk of famine

Meanwhile, the latest SBM Jollof Index report, which said Nigeria was currently on a slippery slope, noted that Nigeria might experience famine in the nearest future if production, consumption and political-economic dynamics remained unchanged from what was currently obtainable.

Noting that decline in food availability, exponential population growth and decline in entitlements were the main contributors to famine, the report observed that “history shows that the famines with the highest mortality rates resulted from poor harvests, natural disasters (droughts, flood), war/conflict, poor governance and policy failures – conditions which Nigeria fulfills easily.”

The SBM Jollof Index noted that over the last 10 years, food production in Nigeria had been dismally affected by continuous conflicts between farmers and herders in the Middle Belt, where more than 62,000 farmers were displaced from their homeland between 2010 and 2015, including terrorist attacks on farmers in the North-East and bandits’ onslaught in the North-West.

Added to these are adverse weather conditions and decreasing agricultural land due to urbanisation, and the effects of governance failure and some government policies, such as border closer, foreign exchange restriction, hike in electricity tariff and petrol pump price.

The SBM Jollof Index stated that the different factors had combined to continuously drive up food prices in Nigeria.

Poverty rising

The 2020 report by World Poverty Clock showed that over 105 million Nigerians lived in extreme poverty – as against 98 million in October 2019. The figure represented more than 51 per cent of the population.

This placed Nigeria as world poverty capital for two years running. Unemployment in Nigeria reached 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020. Nigeria is among most miserable countries in Africa, scoring 50.6 points in March 2021, as against 14.8 points in Ghana, 6.9 in Ethiopia, 13 in Kenya and 12.1 points in Egypt, among others.","Fri, 21 May 2021 17:07:41 GMT",https://www.icirnigeria.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Goat-meat-jollof-rice.jpg,"['sbm', 'inflation', 'food', 'mudu', 'cost', 'worsening', 'jollof', 'signals', 'rising', 'prices', 'index', 'pot', 'insecurity', 'preparing', 'rice', 'nigerias']", ,flood

As of 23 October, flooding has affected 2.2 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Nigeria, Togo and the Central African Republic, and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1541305-West%20and%20Central%20Africa%20-%20Flooding%20Situation%20As%20of%2023%20October%202020.png?itok=ZU-fKzR-,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', '23', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'rains', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,fldood

Respective National Societies, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), are working to respond to each of these disasters through different means. Some have Disaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREFs) or Emergency Appeals (EAs) launched, and others may require additional support in the future.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

In West Coast, Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Ghana have also experienced flooding throughout August-September 2020.","Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539716-Africa%20-%20Floods%20and%20multiple%20disasters%20-%20Information%20bulletin%2C%2006%20September%202020.png?itok=7OMwtMBe,"['affected', 'chad', 'sudan', 'flooding', '06', 'bulletin', '2020', 'floods', 'states', 'displaced', 'multiple', 'rains', 'information', 'niger', 'disasters', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

Thousands of people have been displaced following weeks of heavy rainfall in some central and southern states, the country's emergency response agency, NEMA said Tuesday.

Nigeria's two major rivers have burst their banks sweeping away homes in the central part of the country.

Residents steer a dugout canoe past flooded houses in Lokoja capital of Kogi State on September 14, 2018.

The agency warned the situation could worsen as water levels continue to rise in Lokoja capital of Kogi State, which lies at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers and is often one of the most affected states during the rainy season.

Five emergency operation centers have been created to coordinate search and rescue operations, while also providing humanitarian support for those displaced by the floods, Sani Datti, a spokesman for NEMA said.

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

Lagos State plans to stop being a receiver of processed rice and start processing its own Lake Rice, starting with the Kebbi State government.

Continuous heavy rainfall since July reached its peak in late September, causing severe and extensive flooding in 34 out of 36 states in Nigeria. Two major rivers, the Niger River and Benue River overflowed into the surrounding communities resulting in widespread destruction. The Nigerian government has declared a state of emergencies in nine states. The floods have affected 1.9 million people, destroyed 82,000 houses, displaced 210,000 people and devastated crops and livestock. Though flood water has receded in some communities, many people still do not have homes, businesses and farms to return to. They continue to seek refuge in schools and other public buildings where conditions are extremely poor. Fear of health outbreaks including malaria, cholera and typhoid remain high, as sanitary conditions have deteriorated especially in the temporary shelters.

Red Cross Actions

The International Red Cross has mobilized HKD 2 million from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to support the Nigerian Red Cross Society’s immediate relief activities. An emergency appeal was launched on 21 September 2018 seeking HKD 43.7 million globally targeting to assist 300,000 people for nine months in 10 states.

Since the onset of the floods the Nigerian Red Cross Society has mobilized over 2,000 volunteers and supported affected communities with evacuations, search and rescue, distribution of food and essential household items, provided first aid, psychosocial support and sensitized communities on good hygiene practices.

Besides other factors threatening food security in Nigeria, including the seemingly intractable terrorism, banditry and killer herdsmen's onslaught which are steadily spreading across the country, harvest of farm produce might be imperiled this year and even the next as a result of flooding.

In Kebbi State for instance, 500,000 hectares was recently devastated by flood, 450,000 hectares of it being for rice farms.

This has heightened fears that by next year, majority of farmers in the state, particularly rice farmers, would be out of business.

Many farmlands visited by our correspondent were overrun by floods, just as rice farms were submerged.

A farmer, Libabatu Usman Kamba, expressed fears over imminent food scarcity, particularly as most of the farmers would not be able to mobilize for the next farming season due to the zero harvest this year.

Kamba said she cultivated over 20 hectares of rice this year at Cida Kai village in Dandi Local Government Area but lost over 16 hectares of the rice farm to flood.

She said her crop was ready for harvest and was hoping to get 40 bags of rice per hectare and 700 bags of paddy rice.

Though she could not say what she spent on the hectares submerged in the flood, she added that most farmers would not be able to go for dry season farming this year, hence the need for urgent government intervention.

""The losses recorded this year are so enormous that majority of small holder farmers would not go back for this year's dry season farming.

""The usual practice by most farmers is to re-invest what they realized from rainy season farming for dry season farming,"" she said.

Zuwaira Abubakar, another rice farmer in Argungu, said barely all rice farms in the area were submerged and that would affect farmers' capital for dry season farming. Zuwaira, who cultivated over 25 hectares of rice, said she lost all to flood, adding that she had spent over N300,000 in the farm before the flood came.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid. Many of us will be out of business if no intervention comes our way.

""Farmers don't keep money, the more we make in the business the more we open more farmlands, that is the secret of the farming business otherwise you won't last long in it,"" she said.

In Danko Wasagu Local Government Area, a farmer, Usman Umar, told Daily Trust that they did not experience massive destruction as was the case in most parts of the state, noting that only about a hectare of seven hectares of his rice farm was washed away by the flood.

Another farmer, Suleiman Bashir, who stood helplessly by his rice farm which was submerged along Dukku/Makera road in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area, appealed to the state and federal governments to come to their aid.

""I don't know what to do, I have two large rice farms and they have been completely submerged.

""We are appealing to the state and federal governments to assist us,"" he said.

The chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Sani Dododo, said farm produce worth over N5 billion was destroyed by flood.

He added that the loss recorded in rice farming could be put at 90 percent of the total value of farm produce in the state.

""Over 500,000 hectares of farmlands have been destroyed by flood, the destruction translates to over N5billion worth of farm produce.

""Rice farms constitute to about 90 percent of the farm produce destroyed,"" he said.

The National President of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Aminu Goronyo, who toured some of the affected places while in the entourage of the Kebbi State governor, described the incident as devastating.

Goronyo assured the farmers of federal government intervention because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had sent its officials to the state to assess the situation for immediate intervention.

""The CBN governor has directed RIFAN to mobilise one million farmers that can produce five million metric tonnes of rice during the dry season commencing in November for support,"" he said.

Also speaking with newsmen at Bakin Gada in Argungu Local Government Area after inspecting rice farms destroyed in some local government areas, Governor Abubakar Bagudu expressed shock over the incident, describing it as regrettable.

Thousands rendered homeless in Bauchi

Thousands of displaced people including women and children and the aged have moved into public schools, primary healthcare centres and shops while hundreds of others have relocated to neighboring Jama'are, Azare and Giade local government areas of Bauchi State for shelter.

When our correspondent visited some of the affected areas on Wednesday, dozens of families had taken refuge at various public schools including the Adamami Primary School which was still occupied by the flood.

A victim and father of 11 children, Hamisu Magaji, said three families were sharing two classes.

""One class is accommodating 42 children sleeping on school desks while the male heads of families are sleeping on tables because water has taken over the environment.

""We are staying here due to the flood which destroyed our houses, properties, food and farmlands but we leave everything to God.

""We are yet to receive support or assistance from anybody four days after the incident, life has been difficult, especially taking care of the families but we are struggling to feed them, that notwithstanding, we are appealing to the government and organizations to come to our aid,"" he said.

His daughter, 18-year-old Halima Hamisu, who cooked food for children in the camp, told Daily Trust how they managed to sleep on school desks.

""We arrange the desks laying mats on top and putting long sticks on four angles to hang mosquito nets.

""We line up between 8 and 12 children inside the net and that is how we have managed in this class for the past four days as our mothers have relocated to a nearby village because they are nursing babies,"" she said.

A woman with four children at the Government Day Secondary School camp in Adamami, Barakana Mohammed, said her six months old daughter had been infected with cold.

""I have been sleeping on the floor with my children for four days due to the flood that destroyed our house and property and the bad condition coupled with the weather affecting the children.

""Life has become difficult living in a classroom but we pray for God's intervention.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid.""

A 60-year-old woman, Aishatu Abdullahi, now taking refuge at the camp, decried the absence of essential commodities and the sanitary situation in the camp, saying, ""We don't have food in the camp because water has destroyed everything and the little our caregivers are struggling to bring to the camp is not enough as we have small children.

""I am appealing to the government and privileged individuals in the name of God to support us with food and other relief materials so as to rescue us from additional hardship.""

The village head of Adamami, Malam Isa Nalaraba, said the flood had caused a lot of destruction but, ""We thank God for saving our lives and our children because almost more than half of Adamami is destroyed by the flood which displaced many people to neighboring communities while others have become refugees in their locality while many other residents have relocated to neighboring towns and villages.

""We are appealing to the government and individuals to assist the victims with relief materials to support them and continue their lives.""

Habiba Sani who was to wed in three months and three others including a 14-year-old girl and a 60-year-old woman drowned in flood waters in Bakatma, Shira Local Government Area of the state.

Habiba's father, Malam Sani Biidis, told Daily Trust that he was away when his neighbor invited her and his daughter to accompany him to remove weeds in a rice farm beside a river that was flooded following heavy downpour.

He described the deceased as a kind hearted and obedient girl who hardly argued or disagreed with people within and outside the family.

""They met their sad end when they tried to cross the river at a point where everybody including children used to pass from the village because the area is not deep or wide but as a result of the flood the volume and speed of the water had increased, unfortunately the moment they entered the river the flow dragged them down and they could not swim out of the water.

""It was some children who witnessed the incident that rushed to inform the family that they tried to cross the river but drowned in the process.

""When they launched the search operation their corpses were found in a nearby area some meters from the point of passage.

""I was away from home when I received a phone call that my daughter and one other girl had drowned.

""Habiba's death is painful but I leave everything to God and pray for their souls,"" Bidis said.

Badamasi Shittu, the father of the 14-year-old Ziyada Badamasi, said he asked them to go to his rice farm to assist him remove weeds and apply fertilizer.

""My daughter, Ziyada, told me that they would go before I arrived to apply the fertilizer.

""When they reached the point where people cross the river, they met some children but decided to cross and when they reached the center of the river, Ziyada shouted for help as the flow pulled them down and there was no mature person around to rescue them.

""It was one of the children who rushed home and notified us that Habiba and Ziyada had drowned,"" he said.

The Acting Permanent Secretary in the State Emergency Management Agency, Habu Ningi, said the flood affected 11 villages including Adamami, Bakatma, Alkaleri, Sawi, Dirmi, dago, Shira, Yana , Bege, Bukul, Fago , Tsafi and Disina all, in Shira LGA.

Bakatma village, Adamami, Alkaleri, and Disina town and other villages in Shira Local Government Area were flooded following heavy downpour between Sunday and Monday morning, destroying over 2,600 houses and many hectares of farmlands.

A resident of Adamami, Adamu Oni Adamami, said the heavy rain started on Sunday and around 11 pm people in the town were confused because water had taken over everywhere, gushing into houses at a high speed.

""The rain continued unabated and people started running for safety, especially women and children, to higher areas.

""The rain did not stop until 6am on Monday thousands of houses collapsed and many hectares of farmlands were destroyed.""

Oni added; ""Another devastation the flood caused is destruction of food.

""Apart from losing houses majority of the victims have no food and the farmlands have been destroyed, leaving us in a big calamity now and in future because the time to cultivate new crops has passed.

""We are calling on the government, individuals and corporate organizations to come to our aid before the situation goes out of hand.""

Niger farmers count losses

Many farmlands have been wiped out in Niger State where there is wide lamentation among farmers who are appealing to the government to come to their aid.

Our correspondent gathered that entire farmlands were washed away by floods, leaving farmers with nothing to harvest.

An affected farmer, Tukura Saidu from Kuyi village, said over 40 farmers were affected in his village as yams, maize and rice planted were all wiped out, adding that it was the first time of experiencing such a huge loss to flood.

Also, fish worth over N100 million were washed away by flood at Lapai Gwari in Bosso Local Government Area of the state, it was gathered.

A fish farm according to Daily Trust findings, the major place where fish sellers get fresh fish, was greatly affected, causing a rise in the price of fish in the area as residents now have to travel elsewhere to get fish.

A fish farmer, Malam Mohammad Tukur, lamented that the devastation caused by ravaging floods in Lapai Gwari was the first of its kind and appealed to the state government to urgently assist them.

He said about 2000 fish farms had been washed away.

Another farmer, Malam Abdullahi Saidu, said customers from across Nigeria were trooping to the farm before the incident but many farmers had lost millions of naira worth of investments to floods.

The Vice Chairman of Bosso Local Government Area, Malam Saidu Zegi, said in April this year, rainstorms affected over 200 people, just as many farmers lost their farmlands.

The Director General, Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, described the incident as not only pathetic and tragic but also devastating.

Inga said they had sent a team of experts from the agency to investigate the extent of damage caused.

This according to him is to enable the state government come up with modalities of assisting victims.

He said though the state government was battling with insufficient funds occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, it would not fold its arms to allow the people suffer without any aid.

Floods hit Enugu farms

Enugu State is not left out of the massive flooding and destruction of crops. Mr. Austin Obiora has a rice farm of about 235 hectares at Ihuokpara community in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

Speaking with Daily Trust, he recalled how a heavy rainfall on August 26 caused a massive flood which affected his farm. About 16 hectares of the rice field was adversely affected.

According to him, the rice had started flowering when the flood came.

""I had to start afresh because the rice planting season was almost over.

""I started doing another ""broadcasting"" (spreading) of rice seeds in a systematic and orderly way to enable them germinate very well,"" he said.

""It costs about N250,000 to cultivate one hectare of rice field and when multiplied by 16 hectares, it will be over N4m because I have to add the cost of labour,"" Obiora said, adding: ""Therefore, I lost over N4m due to the massive and devastating flood.""

He, however, didn't feel discouraged by the huge loss because he said upon realizing that some large hectares were still there for him, the unaffected hectares represent compensation for his loss.

""We pray that it doesn't happen again in the next planting season, nobody wants to incur losses,"" he said.

Asked whether any government agency came to his aide, he said he considered it would be a waste of time and energy to approach any government body, just as he did not insure his farm in the first place.

However, Obiora said he had learnt his lesson as he has started making arrangements for insuring his farms in future.

Another farmer, an elderly Rev Dr Lambert Echetu who is into maize and cassava farming, told our correspondent that the combined misfortune of flooding and activities of herdsmen had caused a lot of havoc to his maize farm of two hectares at Amagunze in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

He said: ""The cattle and flood messed up my maize farm.

""I planted maize covering two hectares.

""I spent about N240,000 on clearing the bush, seeds and fertilizer.

""We went to the Government House, Enugu to complain about the Fulani herdsmen and their cows destroying our farms.

""The first tragedy was done to the farm by the cows.

""The second tragedy was caused by the huge flooding, even though the place is swampy.

""When I got to the Government House, they would refer me from one office to the other and it was like a wild goose chase and I left,"" he said.

Echetu further said: ""As a servant of God, when I tried to get help from people and I didn't succeed, I handed everything over to God.

""I love farming because I have passion for it.

""I prayed over the farm project before I decided to farm.

""I have a lot of people who need my help in the village.

""My intention is after harvesting the maize, and bringing it to the church, I will distribute the maize to the congregation.""

He said despite the setback, he won't give up farming and had acquired over 100 hectares of land at Ihu-Okpara community, specifically for planting cassava in the next planting season.

Kano, Jigawa farmers cry out

Last month, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) revealed that 20 of the 44 local government areas in Kano State were at high risk of flooding during this year's rainy season.

Tarauni, Garum Malam, Rimin Gado, Gaya, Gezawa, Gwale, Shanono, Gabasawa, Gwarzo, Ungoggo, Warawa, Dawakin Kudu, Dambatta, Bebeji, Kabo, Wudil, Kura, Nassarawa, Kano Municipal and Kumbotso were the local government areas identified in the report.

With the recent wave of rainfall in the state, some of the identified local governments have already begun to experience heavy flooding which resulted in the destruction of several hectares of farmlands by flood, causing loss of millions of naira worth of farm products.

According to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) in Kano, so far, hundreds of rice farmers in five local governments have reported to have been affected by the flood.

The state chapter chairman of RIFAN, Alhaji Haruna Abubakar Aliyu, said farmers in Dambatta, Makoda, Ajingi, Gaya and Rinim Gado have been seriously affected by the flooding.

""Based on the directives received from the RIFAN head office after we had sent our report on the damages caused to our various members, the head office asked us to compile a detailed report on the flood which currently we are working on.

""We have so far identified five local governments, though we are aware there are more than that but we are still working on it,"" he said.

The state chapter chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Alhaji Zubairu Ibrahim, said the association was still assessing the areas affected and number of farmers and farm lands affected.

He added that the outcome of the ongoing assessment would be made public and the association was working on measures to be adopted in assisting the affected farmers.

Attempts to contact the state commissioner for agriculture and who is also the deputy governor proved abortive but sources close to the ministry said a committee had been inaugurated by the state government to look into the issue and present its report for further action.

In Jigawa State, following a two-day heavy downpour in Birninkudu Local Government Area, several houses and farmlands were said to have been destroyed.

Alhaji Wada Faka, the chairman of the local government, said a yet-to-be ascertained number of houses and farmlands were destroyed in Malamawar Gangaran, Babaldu, Wurno, Kiyako and Samamiya villages.

NEMA had also stated that the Nigerian Hydrological Agency (NIHSA) 2020 Annual Flood Outlook already listed 12 local government areas in the state as flood-prone areas.

The NIHSA report listed Kaugama, Taura, Guri, Gwaram, Dutse, Auyo, Miga, Malam Madori, Ringim, Birniwa, Jahun and Kafin Hausa as probable flood risk areas.

Nasarawa farmers groan under flood

Many farms and farming communities were recently submerged in flood waters in Nasarawa, a state with many small, medium and large scale farms.

A farmer in Doma Local Government Area, Abu Doma, said his farm and many others were washed away in a few days.

Same goes with people residing on the bank of the River Benue along the state's boundary with Benue State.

This is the second year in a row that River Kilema in Lafia has flooded and submerged farms, houses and cemeteries among others.

An official of the State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) who prefers anonymity said it was taking measures to mitigate a possible humanitarian crisis in the state.

The agency has been urging those living in flood-prone areas to leave such places.

He said last month, heavy floods occurred in three local government areas including Awe, Nasarawa and Toto.

The Director of flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr. Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umasha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.","Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn03.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00521229:97559b81f1c74f189f2c92809408b0aa:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'washed', 'children', 'homes', 'flood', 'local', 'farm', 'area', 'farmlands', 'nigeria', 'tears', 'state', 'away', 'rice', 'hectares']", ,none
48,48,FL-2017-000126-NGA,A Flood of Polluting Air Conditioners Hampers Africa's Climate Efforts - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-flood-of-polluting-air-conditioners-hampers-africas-climate-efforts,"As air conditioning sales in Africa soar, many of the units imported there are old and inefficient, driving up electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. But some countries are taking action, banning the import of used air conditioners and adopting tough energy standards.

It’s early August and a dozen air conditioners are keeping Joy Obehi’s clients cool on another hot steamy day in Lagos, Nigeria. But invariably the electricity flickers off and her expensive diesel generator rumbles to life. “The power goes out pretty much every day, usually for one hour or two hours,” said Obehi, who rents out short-term meeting space and spends as much as $300 a month on diesel fuel. “[Air conditioners] use a lot of power, but our clients expect our locations to be cooler.” As African incomes rise and the number of hotter days from climate change increases, demand is exploding for air conditioners around the continent. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, more than 500,000 air conditioning units are bought each year and the number is increasing by 4 to 5 percent annually, according to a recent report. But that demand comes at a price: the plethora of energy-sapping — but inexpensive — air conditioners that are stressing already overburdened electricity grids, saddling consumers with high energy bills, contributing to more frequent outages that damage local economies, and making a significant contribution to the continent’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of used and new inefficient AC appliances are being sold in Africa every year, many of them illegally. Many are obsolete secondhand appliances imported mostly from Europe, despite international laws forbidding such activity. The appliances also contain banned ozone-depleting refrigerants that are potent contributors to climate change.

Electricity demand for air conditioners is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040.

And with cooling demand proliferating due to urbanization and hotter temperatures, Africa’s air conditioning market is poised to get bigger. Electricity demand for air conditioners and other cooling appliances is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040, from 11 terawatt-hours (TWh) to 112 terawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency. If African countries adopt stricter air conditioning efficiency standards, energy demand could be cut in half, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 million tons by 2040, according to the United Nations. Africa’s cooling challenge is part of a much larger trend. Worldwide demand for air conditioners is expected to more than triple in the next 30 years, from 1.6 billion units in 2018 to 5.6 billion units by 2050. That amounts to 10 new air conditioners being sold every second for the next three decades. Without government policies to make air conditioners cleaner and more efficient, greenhouse gas emissions from ACs and other cooling equipment will jump by a projected 90 percent by 2050 — a huge step backward in international efforts to limit global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, says a new UN report. Now, some African countries are trying to tamp down on energy-guzzling cooling. Ghana is successfully enforcing a ban on imports of used cooling appliances, including air conditioners. Rwanda approved a similar ban, along with Africa’s toughest-ever energy performance standards for new cooling appliances, both of which are set to come into effect next year. A half-dozen other countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, have minimum performance standards for new air conditioners and refrigerators. But success is still largely elusive due to weak policies and minimal enforcement. “There are not many harmonized efficiency policies at the moment in Africa, and many of them are out of date, not enforced, and not stringent,” said Patrick Blake, a policy expert at the UN’s United for Efficiency Program (U4E).

Among the countries struggling with the issue is Nigeria, Africa’s second-largest AC market behind Egypt. “Compliance with our energy standards is very, very slow,” said Etiosa Uyigue, executive director of a Nigerian environmental group, the Community Research and Development Center (CREDC), which has been pushing for more stringent mandatory energy standards and environmentally friendly refrigerants for all cooling appliances sold in the country. The stakes are enormous. Air conditioner sales are rising steadily across the continent, especially in hotter, more prosperous countries in West Africa. Morocco, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast have all seen a doubling in air conditioner imports since 2010, whether used or new units, according to government data. The United Nations projects that air conditioner stocks will hit 1.5 billion units in Africa by 2030, up from 660 million in 2015. The strains are already being felt. Nigeria’s limited power supplies, which are half the size of North Carolina’s despite having nearly 20 times more people, turn on and off every day and occasionally cause national blackouts, as happened 11 times in 2019. Hot sticky days when air conditioners are humming full throttle are the worst. “We just had two outages today,” said Uyigue, speaking in July from his home in the capital Abuja, where he uses three generators and a small solar energy system to keep the lights on. A Nigeria Energy Commission study in 2014 estimated that air conditioners account for 25 percent of total energy consumption in Abuja and 17 percent nationally. Nigeria’s annual CO2 emissions have tripled since 1990. The country’s widespread reliance on noisy, polluting diesel generators costs the economy nearly $14 billion a year, primarily in added fuel expenses. Meanwhile, Africa is tethered to an AC market dominated by high-polluting inefficient appliances.

Many air conditioners sold in Africa are low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made.

For years, many African countries have been flooded with millions of antiquated secondhand air conditioners and refrigerators imported primarily from Europe. Nigeria and other West African countries with high summer temperatures and close proximity to European shipping ports are especially popular destinations for used cooling appliances, which arrive stuffed into containers, cargo vehicles, and even used cars. The appliances are often broken and those that still work often consume two to three times more electricity than new models. “They come in branded as new, but when they’re off-loaded it’s mostly near-end-of-life e-waste,” said Leslie Adogame, executive director of SRADev, a Nigerian nonprofit environmental health research group. “They’re certainly cheaper to buy, but they use a lot more energy and don’t meet environmental standards.” A half-dozen African countries have joined a United Nations working group, launched in April, that is trying to stop these flows, many of which are unlawful. Shipping non-working electronic equipment is illegal under both the Basel Convention, an international treaty governing hazardous waste, and the European Union’s Waste Shipment Directive. New cooling appliances being sold in Africa are not much better. Recent research by the energy efficiency nonprofit CLASP and the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development (IGSD) showed that 35 percent of new room air conditioners sold in Africa’s 10 largest countries in 2018 were low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China. A quarter of the 650,000 low-efficiency units — none of which meet common efficiency standards used in developed countries — were imported from non-African countries, primarily China. The remaining three-quarters were largely imported and then assembled in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Egypt.

“Environmentally harmful dumping is occurring in Africa,” said Gabrielle Dreyfus, senior scientist at IGSD. “These kinds of markets deprive consumers of a smarter choice by flooding markets with lower-price products that cost consumers more over time.” The report also showed that 790,000 air conditioning units sold in Africa contained obsolete ozone-depleting, greenhouse gas refrigerants known as R-22, which are being phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol. Another 820,000 units contained R-410A refrigerants, a highly potent greenhouse gas with 2,000 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide. They are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol’s Kigali Amendment, beginning in 2019 in developed countries and later this decade in developing countries. Efforts to halt these damaging trade flows have been going on for years, but most have been unsuccessful, in large part simply because more and more African consumers want affordable devices to stay cool. Ghana is a noteworthy exception. Alarmed by the millions of obsolete cooling appliances that were entering the country and the widening gap between energy demand and power production, the country banned all used air conditioner and refrigerator imports in 2008. In 2013, when the government began enforcing the ban, illegal imports plummeted. Last year, new appliances, mostly from China, made up 95 percent of the market. “We succeeded in reversing the market in favor of new appliances,” said Kofi Agyarko, director of energy efficiency and climate change at the Ghana Energy Commission, who credits tough enforcement for catalyzing the shift. While new, more efficient appliances cost two to three times as much as used ones, they consume a third as much electricity, with Ghanaians saving on average $140 a year on energy bills, Agyarko said. But even if countries can effectively ban used imports, how can they limit the flood of inefficient new appliances into Africa? Rwanda thinks it has the answer. Last year, as part of a comprehensive national cooling strategy, Rwanda enacted Africa’s toughest energy standards and energy labeling for new air conditioners and other cooling appliances. The mandatory standards, which take effect next year, are modeled after guidelines developed by the UN’s United for Efficiency program. Brian Holuj, who leads the program’s work on cooling appliances, says Rwanda’s efforts are an important breakthrough. “For the first time in Africa, Rwanda will demonstrate the impact of mandatory policies, coupled with strong energy efficiency requirements and limits on global warming-damaging coolants in new products,” he said.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, AC energy demand would be cut in half from current projections.

If other African countries follow Rwanda’s lead, air conditioning energy demand would be cut in half from current projections, according to the UN. “More than two-dozen full-sized power plants could be avoided through more efficient air conditioners and refrigerators in Africa,” Holuj said. A critical step, Holuj said, is for countries to come together regionally on consistent policies, backed by enforcement, that send a strong market signal to the industry. “The key is regional alignment,” he said, citing the EU’s success in developing common requirements and energy labeling. Dreyfus, the scientist at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, echoed this point: As long as markets for cheap products are able to flourish, high-efficiency appliances will have a hard time competing. “If a manufacturer feels they have to compete for market share by selling low-efficiency obsolete equipment, we have to close the loopholes to bring the market up so that they have the right marketplace in which to sell better products,” she said. Nigeria has tried some of the approaches Ghana and Rwanda are using, but they are not working, according to CREDC’s Uyigue. Nigeria imposed an import ban on obsolete used cooling appliances in 2010, but it is not being enforced. It adopted voluntary energy performance standards and energy labels for air conditioners in 2017, but compliance is broadly lacking. Numerous obstacles are impeding progress. The first is price — a low-performing air conditioner costs only $100 to $200. The second is trade barriers such as a 20 percent duty on imported assembled air conditioners, an important source of government revenue. The third — perhaps the biggest — is the government’s unwillingness to take the tough steps necessary to force a market shift.","Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/site/GP01QLI_High_res_Nigeria_web.jpg,"['africa', 'air', 'demand', 'climate', 'hampers', 'flood', 'conditioners', 'africas', 'efforts', 'cooling', 'used', 'units', 'appliances', 'countries', 'energy', 'polluting']", ,flood
49,49,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Nigeria: 10 Things Nigerians Should Expect in 2021 - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/202101030130.html,"The year 2020 has come and gone with its challenges which include the coronavirus pandemic, banditry, kidnapping, terrorism and several other depressing episodes, and of course some spirit-lifting events. Here, Daily Trust on Sunday gives a list of what to expect this New Year.

Increased agitation for 2023

There is likely going to be increased agitation ahead of the 2023 general elections this year, and among other issues, whether or not zoning will determine who political parties decide to make their flagbearer, for the presidency.

The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) is likely to entrench its position on the subject, as its president, Alhaji Yerima Shetima, has rejected the agitation for the zoning of the number one position. Holding the same position is Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari's nephew, who said competency and not zoning should be the consideration in electing Buhari's successor.

However, people like Alhaji Shuaib Mustapha Kano, political adviser to a former governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, are likely to remain adamant on zoning the presidency to Eastern Nigeria.

Both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have debated whether or not their parties' tickets should be zoned to the North or to the South. This debate will most likely deepen this year.

Floods still in sight

Flooding has become one of the disasters that never seems to go away, and 2020 is a typical example. It happened again despite forecasts by the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and the Hydrological Services Agency (HAS) that revealed there would be massive flooding across many states from the beginning of the year. Also, donor agencies and even private firms repeatedly warned of the impending and imminent floods. The floods came and agricultural output and property worth billions were lost. It happened in Akwa Ibom State where 100 houses were destroyed and 300 persons displaced in Eket Local Government Area (LGA) in 2020, and in Borno where hundreds of shelters in Internally Displaced People's (IDP) camps were destroyed. Thousands of people were displaced and property destroyed in several parts of the country.

A report by Relief Web posted on October 19, 2020, indicated that flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara states, among others, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas.

In Kebbi State were a massive flood ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5bn and rendered people homeless, the Director of Flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umaisha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.

This is an example of promises Nigerians continue to get and there is no certainty that this will not happen again.

COVID-19 vaccine for 20m people

The Federal Government is making efforts to procure 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 to check the spread of the virus. Everything being equal, this means less than a quarter of Nigeria's over 200 million population may be vaccinated. Nigeria's Health Minister, Osagie Ehanire, who said this at a press conference in December, 2020, pointed out that health sector employees would be vaccinated first, then the vulnerable and those with chronic illnesses.

So far, Nigeria has recorded not less than 70,500 COVID-19 cases with 1,184 fatalities, and more than 65,000 patients have recovered from the disease. As of January 1, 2021, 1074 new confirmed cases and deaths were recorded. Therefore, there is a high possibility of another lockdown in 2021 to curtail the spread of the virus across states, but whether this would have a positive impact is left to be seen because there are arguably more Nigerians in slums and ghettos where families share toilet facilities and other basic amenities, and then there is the danger of a rise in criminality and rape as was the case in 2020.

Budget increase impact

President Muhammadu Buhari recently signed into law the 2021 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly. The National Assembly had on December 21, 2020, passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill with an aggregate expenditure of N13,588,027,886,175 trillion.

It comprises total Capital Supplementation of N1,060,751,051,650 and total Capital Expenditure of N4,125,149,354,222. Statutory Transfer stands at N496,528,471,273; Rrecurrent Expenditure of N5,641,970,060,680 with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 3.00 per cent.

The National Assembly also provided N3,324,380,000tn for debt servicing which would obviously serve as a drain on the country's finances.

The legislators had increased the budget estimate by N505,607,317,942 from the estimate of N13,082,420,568,233 presented to the joint sitting of the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 8, 2020. This means Nigeria would have more money to pump into vital sectors of the economy like healthcare, education and security.

Insecurity still looms

The abduction of over 300 schoolboys by gunmen in an all-boys Government Science School in Kankara, Katsina State, is probably one of the biggest highlights of insecurity in 2020. Even though the boys have been released, the incident still raises questions about Nigeria's dwindling security. Kidnappings continue to happen on the Kaduna-Abuja road, Lokoja-Abuja Expressway, the Obajana-Okene axis in Kogi State, among others. In the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, Kuje Area Council has recorded several cases of people being abducted, particularly in their homes. Terrorism in the North East and banditry in Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna states, among others, is yet to stop and there is no clear sign that 2021 is going to be different. Nigeria still has the same security chiefs from 2020 and the cost of goods and services are still on the rise.

Stiffer laws against rape, gender-based violence

In June, 2020, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, said Nigeria recorded 717 rape incidents between January and May of the same year. This was before the lockdown due to COVID-19 which saw a spike in rape cases and gender-based violence. Some states have since taken steps to tackle the issue. One of such is Kaduna, where Governor Nasir el-Rufai signed into law the amended Penal Code Law 2020 that provides for stiff penalties for rape of a child, including death, surgical castration for male convicts, and bilateral salpingectomy for female rapists.

Also, in 2019 Nigeria launched a sex offenders' register as a vital step towards tackling reported cases of sexual abuse. With these steps, there is hope for the fight against rape and gender-based violence this year as many Nigerians, especially Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), continue to call for stiffer laws.

Possible food shortage

As the activities of the terrorist group Boko Haram continue, including that of bandits and kidnappers who have been reported to have whisked or attacked people from their farms, there is a possible food shortage in sight, especially in Northern Nigeria. In addition is the effect of the 2020 flood that destroyed many farms across the country.

Movies

The year 2021 promises to be eventful with the release of movies like the musical drama 'Dreamers' written by Michael Castiel and scheduled for release on January 31; 'Mamba's Diamond' directed by Seyi Babatope, written by Darlington Abuda and starring actors like Osas Ighodaro, Uchembe Williams and Nse Ikpe-Etim set for March 19; 'Retribution' which is still in development; 'Willie-Willie' also in the development stage, among others.

Music

Meanwhile, nominations for the 63rd annual Grammy Awards were recently announced with Nigeria's Burna Boy (for his recent album 'Twice as Tall') and Wizkid on the list for the 2021 awards by the Recording Academy. Burna Boy was nominated under the World Music Album while Wizkid for his feature in Beyonce's Brownskin Girl song.

Books! Books!! Books!!!

This year TJ Benson's debut novel 'Madhouse' is set for release. Also, 'The Days of Silence' by Angel Patricks Amegbe; 'What Happened to Janet Uzor' by Miracle Emeka-Nkwor and Onyeka Nwelue's 'The Strangers of Braamfontein', to mention a few.

Festivals

As always there are a number of festivals to look forward to this year. There is the Lagos Carnival held during the Lagos Black Heritage Festival, Afan National Festival, Argungu Fishing Festival, Atyap Annual Cultural Festival and several more.

Most book and art festivals come towards year-end such as the Ake Arts and Book Festival, Lagos Book and Art Festival (LABAF), Benue Books and Art Festival and the Abuja Literary and Arts Festival (ALITFEST).

• Short - range forecasts up to 31 th October, marking the end of the season shows continued favorable seasonal conditions in most of the region except some localized pockets of moderate dryness. It is thus likely that the rainy season will be abnormally late particularly in the Sahel region.

• Early October, the end of the rainy season in the Sahel, West Africa has been characterized by mostly adequate and well-distributed rains: this results in average to above-average seasonal rainfall The Sahel region benefited the most from very good conditions with well above-average seasonal rains, while belowaverage rainfall spread over the southernmost part of the region across the Gulf of Guinea. The cumulative heavy rainfall recorded from mid-August to September resulted in flooding, that have affected about 760,000 people in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal with at least 111 fatalities.

• As a result of increase in rainfall since late July and wetter conditions in August and September: a pattern of strongly above-average vegetation emerged during September and October in all of the Sahel. Agricultural areas benefitted from very good seasonal conditions. Good production prospects are certain this year in the region (in biomass and crops production). As a result of good seasonal performance in mid-October water resources remain at a good level. Overall they have reached their highest level throughout the West African region.

• Across the Sahel, harvest has started for main season millet and sorghum crops in southern Mali, Burkina Faso, southern Niger, and eastern Senegal. Meanwhile favourable harvesting of main season crops reached completion in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, southern Ghana, southern Togo, Benin, and central Cameroon, while crops are still developing in Guinea, northern Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, and northern Nigeria under generally favourable conditions. Despite localized floods impacting the Sahel and drier-than-average conditions along the Gulf of Guinea countries, overall conditions are favourable except in conflict-affected northern Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, and northeast Nigeria along with the conflict and floodaffected Far North region of Cameroon.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1540757-WFP-0000120139.png?itok=iitFCIc-,"['crops', 'monitor', 'situation', 'seasonal', 'region', '2020', 'west', 'season', 'floods', 'conditions', 'update', 'good', 'mali', 'southern', 'rainfall', 'sahel', 'africa', 'cameroon']", ,flood
51,51,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Investors support Shell's strategy for net-zero emissions despite backlash - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/investors-support-shells-strategy-for-net-zero-emissions-despite-backlash,"Nearly 89% of shareholders at Shell’s annual investor meeting on Tuesday voted in favour of the oil and gas company’s strategy to achieve a net-zero emissions business by 2050, the Financial Times reports. Despite this success, the firm is also “confronted by growing support for activists’ demands to set more ambitious targets”, the newspaper adds. It notes that a separate resolution by Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This calling for Shell to set more “inspirational” targets attracted the support of 30% of shareholders, although such resolutions require 75% to pass. According to the Times, Follow This “insists that Shell’s goals are not consistent with achieving the Paris climate accord, in part because it lacks near-term targets for absolute emissions reductions”. The Guardian notes that this “significant shareholder rebellion” came on the day that the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its net-zero pathway, in which all exploration for new oil and gas fields stops this year to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It quotes Charlie Kronick, a senior climate finance adviser for Greenpeace UK, who notes that Shell’s plans would increase gas production by 20% by 2030, “contravening the advice of the IEA”. Reuters states that, under its current plans, Shell intends to increase its investment in low-carbon energy sources in the coming years, “but at least 75% of its spending will continue to go towards oil and gas”. In Bloomberg’s coverage, it says that the oil giant also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its “spill-prone operations in Nigeria”.

Meanwhile, another Guardian story reports that, in Australia, politicians and companies are being urged by campaigners to abandon plans for new coal power, gas and oil investments in light of the new IEA report. In Europe, Politico reports that the landmark report is “giving Brussels new ammunition in its war on fossil fuels”, as its conclusions support the European Commission’s efforts to discontinue EU funding for oil and gas projects. According to EurActiv, environmentalists have “warned against some of the assumptions in the scenario” developed by the IEA, notably the growing shares of biomass used for energy. The piece adds that IEA modellers have explained that their scenario assumes no overall increase in cropland use for bioenergy production, or new bioenergy crops on forested land. The Guardian reports on comments from the UK climate champion, Nigel Topping, who says he is “stubbornly optimistic” that the world will arrive at an agreement to “forge a transition to a net-zero future” at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year. (For more on the IEA’s latest report, see Carbon Brief‘s coverage.)

52,52,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Conflicting reports emerge in Nigeria over video of downed plane - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/03/conflicting-reports-emerge-in-nigeria-over-video-of-downed-plane/,"National-World

Conflicting reports have emerged in Nigeria over a video of a downed plane, after the country’s air force disputed claims from Boko Haram that its militants shot down a jet.

The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) strongly questioned the authenticity of the Boko Haram clip which purports to show fighters shooting at the military plane, eventually causing it to fall to the ground.

The NAF suggested that the crash was due to an air accident.

The video was published by the SITE Intelligence Group and is circulating across Nigerian media.

“It is evident that most parts of the video were deliberately doctored to give the false impression that the aircraft was shot down” when it was “obviously an air accident,” the NAF said in a statement posted on Facebook Friday.

The NAF rejected the seven-and-a-half-minute edited clip, calling it “false propaganda” and urging Nigerians “to ignore the contents of the videos making the rounds until all investigations as to how the aircraft crashed are completed.”

The NAF reported the plane missing on Wednesday, with two pilots on board.

A spokesperson told CNN Thursday afternoon the fighter jet had been deployed near Borno State in northeastern Nigeria to provide air support to ground troops, who were under fire from Boko Haram fighters before radar contact was lost.

“The cause of the crash as well as the whereabouts of the 2 pilots remain unknown. The pilots are Flight Lieutenant John Abolarinwa and Flight Lieutenant Ebiakpo Chapele,” the NAF said earlier Friday.

In the disputed video Boko Haram claims to have shot down the Alpha Jet.

The footage shows multiple fighters shooting into the air before a blast lights up the sky as a plane ignites into flames and falls to the ground. The video then cuts to fighters standing around what appears to be the wreckage of the jet.

It then cuts to the plane, showing “NAF 475” — the missing aircraft’s ID number. It later shows a charred body.

Separately the video then shows what appears to be a patch laying on the ground, displaying John Abolarinwa’s name.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Boko Haram has increased attacks against the Nigerian military as it tries to regain control of lost territories in pockets of the country’s northeast.

Frequent air raids by the Nigerian military have continued to rattle the insurgents — dislodging them from their hideouts.","Sat, 03 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['air', 'video', 'plane', 'conflicting', 'reports', 'boko', 'haram', 'emerge', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'shot', 'naf', 'fighters', 'downed', 'shows']", ,flood
53,53,FL-2017-000126-NGA,"Nigeria: Dozens Killed, Houses Destroyed As Floods Ravage North-Central Nigeria - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009250681.html,"Torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks wreaked havoc in the North-central sub-region of Nigeria.

State governments in the North-central region of Nigeria are employing measures to halt the perennial flooding ravaging parts of the zone and alleviate the sufferings of the victims.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks claimed many lives, destroyed hundreds of houses and washed away farmlands and domestic animals in the sub-region.

The catastrophe compelled the governments in the zone to take steps to avert further flooding and provide succour to the affected people such as temporary shelters, food and medicines.

In Nasarawa State, Governor Abdullahi Sule ordered the immediate evacuation of persons whose houses had been submerged by flood in Nasarawa, headquarters of Nasarawa Local Government Area.

Mr Sule also directed that foodstuff, mattresses and other relief items be provided to the victims immediately.

His spokesperson, Ibrahim Addra, said the governor had visited the ancient town and sympathised with the people over the incident.

He urged the people to desist from erecting structures on waterways and stop indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the drains.

In response to the governor's directive, the Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) distributed food and non-food relief materials to over 45 communities ravaged by flood in Awe and Nasarawa local government areas of the state.

The Executive Secretary of the agency, Zakari Allumagas, said the governor gave the order during his visit to Nasarawa following the flood in the town.

Mr Allumagas said the relief materials comprised 44 trucks of 600 bags each of assorted grains and three trucks of non-food items such as building materials, children's clothing, cooking utensils and mats.

He warned against diversion of the items.

He also disclosed that over 700 households were displaced by floods in such communities as Ara, Udenyi Magaji, Ugya and Gude, Nasarawa town in Nasarawa Local Government Area, and Ribi and Gidan Soja in Awe Local Government Area.

The executive secretary said the state government was working with traditional and community leaders to come up with a directive banning approval and sale of lands near riverine areas of the state.

In Kogi, the State Commissioner for Environment, Victor Omofaiye, said many communities in some local government areas in the state had been ravaged by floods.

Mr Omofaiye said such communities included places in Kotonkarfe, Lokoja, Ajaokuta and Ibaji local government areas.

He said some victims of the disaster had already been moved to IDPs camps in Kotonkarfe, while the IDPs camps and flood estates in Lokoja were being prepared through clearing of their surroundings and fumigation for resettlement of the flood victims.

He said that the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had predicted that in 2020, about 10 local government areas would be affected by flood in Kogi.

They are Lokoja, Kogi/Kotonkarfe, Ajaokuta, Bassa, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela, Ofu, Adavi and Omala.

""The water level of River Niger is still fluctuating within the range of 10.5 to 10.7, but as at September 21, it was 10.7 compared to the 12.5 as at the same period in 2012 in Kogi.

""Flood is a menace that we experience in Kogi every year. The flood we experienced in Kogi in 2012 was massive and devastating; we do not pray for such in 2020, but we are actually on red alert,"" the commissioner said.

He attributed flooding in the state to human and natural factors.

According to him, the human factor has to do with the people's habit in managing the environment as they dump refuse on waterways and drains, thereby obstructing free flow of water.

Mr Omofaiye said that the confluence of two major rivers in Kogi: River Niger and Benue, which most times overflowed their banks, was affecting communities along the river paths, including those of other small rivers that took their sources from river Niger and Benue.

""Opening of dams, especially along River Niger, such as Lagdo Dam from Cameroon and other dams also cause flooding in Kogi due to high volume of water.

""We have done a lot of sensitisation and awareness creation to educate the general public, especially the people living in the flood prone areas in all the predicted local government areas.

""We are also partnering with the relevant stakeholders including SEMA to ensure that we are ahead of any emerging situation,"" he said.

He said he had led a team on assessment tour of some affected communities in Lokoja to ascertain the level of damage done by flood in the area and begin to tackle them head on.

The commissioner said the Governor Yahaya Bello administration would not relent in its efforts at tackling environmental challenges including flooding across the state.

He, therefore, advised the people living in the flood prone areas to relocate and move to high grounds in order not to endanger their lives as a result of floods.

The situation is similar in Plateau as the acting Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Rose Dakwar, said that floods had affected seven local government areas in the state recently.

Mrs Dakwar listed the affected local government areas as Mangu, Pankshin, Shendam, Quan Pan, Langtang South, Mikang and Wase.

She said that many farmlands, houses bridges and other valuables were destroyed by the floods in the listed areas.

""We as an emergency management agency, have already visited each of the affected local government areas in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).

""We visited and ascertained the level of damage and reported back to government.

""Government has, therefore, included the affected areas in the distribution of palliatives before the major assistance will come their way,"" she said.

Also, the NEMA Zonal Coordinator in Jos, Eugene Nyenlong, said the agency had composed jingles in local languages to educate the people on how to tackle floods if they occurred.

Mr Nyenlong also disclosed that the agency in the zone was making use of Flood Vanguards comprising youth corps members who raised alarms if flood occurred.

""We also have locals that are engaged to act in terms of response and evacuation when flood occurs,"" he said.

In Niger, not less than 500 communities have been flooded since the onset of the 2020 raining season in the state.

The Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Ahmed Inga, who disclosed this also said about 22 local government areas had so far been affected by the floods.

Mr Inga said 29 deaths were recorded during the floods, while 45,000 farmers were directly affected by the disaster.

""Farmlands and houses have been destroyed and assessment is still ongoing, "" he said.

He said Governor Abubakar Bello had directed the agency to look inward and design a better way of mitigating the situation by relocating the affected communities to safe areas.

The Governor of Niger-State, Abubakar Sani Bello [PHOTO CREDIT: Official Twitter handle of Mr Bello || @abusbello]He said that the state government had identified 13 resettlement sites in Muregi, Akere and Ketso, among others, where the affected communities were being resettled.

He said that compensations had been paid and allocation of plots to the affected communities would soon commence.

The director-general blamed the flooding partly on the situation where the state was home to three hydro-electric dams- Shiroro, Kainji and Jebba, and River Niger and River Kaduna flowing across parts of the state.

Similarly, the Benue Government has assured residents of flood prone areas of its plans to tackle the incessant flooding in communities in the state.

The State Director of Environment, Richarge Azaagee, who disclosed this, said plans were underway to address some of the flooding challenges, especially in Makurdi.

Mr Azaagee denied that the government had abandoned communities suffering from flood related challenges.

He said the government had already identified the causes of flooding in some communities/settlements and was working toward fixing them.

""The problem of erosion and flood is not just in Kaamem community alone, it cuts across many communities in Makurdi and the state at large.

54,54,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Floods And Food Shortages Threaten To Push Nigeria Into A Food Crisis - The Organization for World Peace,https://theowp.org/reports/floods-and-food-shortages-threaten-to-push-nigeria-into-a-food-crisis/,"Nigeria is currently dealing with twin crises, record-breaking flooding, and a food shortage. According to Reuters, this is threatening to push Africa’s most populous country into a devastating food crisis. In 2020, Nigeria has dealt with destructive floods that have killed at least 40 and have displaced over 15,000 people. Recently, in September of 2020, intense flooding caused by heavy rainfall in northern Nigeria destroyed thousands of homes and wide areas of crops. As reported by Reuters, the flooding in northern Nigeria has destroyed 90% of the 2 million tons of rice that was expected to be harvested this Autumn. This loss is equivalent to 20% of the rice that Nigeria harvested last year.

Destruction of rice paddies is not the only food-related casualty of these floods. A shortage of maize has made it extremely difficult for chicken farmers to feed their flocks due to the price of chicken feed more than doubling. For Nigeria, rice is the staple grain, and chicken is a core protein. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many movement restrictions and financing difficulties that complicated the spring planting of many crops including maize. The combination of crop-destroying floods and an already existent maize shortage makes it look as if Nigeria is on the brink of a damaging food crisis. Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, told Reuters that “there is a real fear of having food shortages. The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.”

Another effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is on fertilizer. After the virus’s outbreak caused a shutdown of Nigeria’s sole urea plant for two weeks, many farmers opted to skip using fertilizer on their crops, which has limited their crop yields.

Through all of this, the Nigerian government is still doing everything it can to promote domestic food production and local Nigerian farmers, but that may not be enough to sustain a country of nearly 200 million people through a looming food crisis. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that not one cent of the country’s central bank dollars would go towards food or fertilizer imports in an attempt to encourage local farmers and producers over imports. In August 2020, Nigeria took about 4,000 tons of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc’s strategic stocks (ECOWAS), released 30,000 tons of its own maize, and gave four companies special permission to import maize into the country, according to Reuters. The Nigerian Economic Summit Group has also called for “a complete overhaul” of agricultural policy.

In an interview with Reuters, Nigeria’s Agriculture Minister Muhammad Sabo Nanono said that “there is no question about it that there is an imminent problem with food insecurity, not only in Nigeria, but also in nations all over the world.” He is absolutely correct in that statement. According to a report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) called the Ecological Threat Register (ETR), food security is a major symptom of the ongoing climate crisis that is projected to worsen over the next several decades. By the ETR’s estimates, the global demand for food will increase by 50% by 2050. Approximately two billion people already experience moderate to severe food insecurity currently, and that number is expected to increase to 3.5 billion people by the year 2050. 822 million people currently experience undernutrition globally, leaving them at an extremely high risk of starvation. Additionally, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of food insecurity, at 52% of the population, and 18 of the 20 most food-insecure countries globally are located in the region.

What is happening in Nigeria should sound an alarm for the rest of the world. If the world continues on this trajectory, the climate crisis will only escalate in the coming years and decades. With that will come an increase in natural disasters, with flooding being the most common natural disaster to occur since 1990, according to the ETR. Flooding not only threatens people’s lives and property, but it also threatens the survival and harvestability of important crops, as seen with the current situation in Nigeria. Floods are also not the only natural disasters that will worsen with climate change, but wildfires and storm events like hurricanes will become more frequent and more damaging as well. All of these have the potential to threaten the food security of nations all over the globe. The ETR reports that 22% of countries will face catastrophic food insecurity by the year 2050, which would result in “substantial displacement of people or substantial increase in undernourishment.” That statistic shows that a food crisis like this will not be an event unique to Nigeria but could potentially threaten many other countries across the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst in worsening food security for countries around the globe. The United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) has warned that the number of people facing food insecurity could potentially double by the end of the pandemic. According to the Pullitzer Center, global shutdowns and border closures to curb the virus have caused tightened credit access to farmers, limited access to inputs for farmers, limited food transport services and food imports. Constraints like these have led to surges in food prices and limited many populations’ access to nutritious food. The effects of this can be seen in what is happening in Nigeria, and it has worsened food shortages that the country was already experiencing pre-pandemic.

The other countries of the world who have the means should take this opportunity to send humanitarian aid to Nigeria during this time in order to offset or prevent the looming food crisis. It would also be in the interest of the U.N. and other peacekeeping or human rights focused international organizations to aid Nigeria in any way that is possible so that the situation does not worsen into a debilitating crisis that could threaten millions of lives. The situation in Nigeria is of utmost urgency, so it is important that the international community acts with haste.

Furthermore, in order to take action towards preventing devastating food crises and worsening natural disasters in the future, the most important steps that nations can take is implementing aggressive climate change policies that curb emissions and aim to use cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy. This is especially true for countries who are the world’s biggest emitters and polluters, including but not limited to the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Combatting climate change will require an immense collective effort and continued inaction will only lead to more human suffering in places like Nigeria where people are already seeing the harsh effects of the climate crisis.

The impending food crisis in Nigeria is demonstrative of many issues that the world is facing. Swift action should be taken not only to aid Nigeria in combatting a destructive food crisis, but in the long run, all nations of the world should be putting progressive climate policies into effect. Growing food insecurity is a major symptom of a worsening climate, and the action should be taken now to ensure global food insecurity does not reach frightening levels in the future.","Sat, 19 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,"['farmers', 'climate', 'world', 'food', 'threaten', 'floods', 'push', 'crisis', 'nations', 'nigeria', 'insecurity', 'maize', 'countries', 'shortages']", ,none

In September 2018, heavy rains were experienced in Nigeria which caused severe flooding in 129 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of 12 States which affected 2,321,592 people, based on the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) situation report. An estimated 722,741 people were internally displaced, and 351,236 people had immediate humanitarian needs in food; shelter; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and health.

On 17 September, the NEMA declared a state of emergency in four of the worst-affected states (Niger, Kogi, Anambra and Delta), where thousands of communities had been forced to evacuate from submerged settlements and seek refuge in temporary Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps. As the Niger River continued to flow above danger level, and additional dams were released, a state of emergency also was declared in five more states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Taraba, Kebbi and Adamawa) on 11 October 2018. The flooding situation exceeded thresholds of local capacity to respond to the people in need.

The floods resulted in rapid population displacement, destruction of shelters, extensive losses to livelihoods and the local economy, in addition to high rates of water-borne diseases among the affected population and their host communities. Internally Displaced Persons staying with host communities were particularly susceptible to cholera and other water-borne diseases due to the poor access to potable water, hygiene infrastructure and medical care in those locations. These challenges also impacted displaced people in IDP camps, who similarly lacked access to basic water and sanitation services.

Upon the request of Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), IFRC launched an Emergency Appeal in October 2018 for 5.4 million Swiss francs to support 300,000 flood-affected people in the areas of focus of shelter and non-food items, livelihoods and basic needs; health; WASH; and protection, gender and inclusion (PGI) for 9 months. The objective was to provide lifesaving and recovery interventions in 6 out of the over 18 states in Nigeria affected by flooding. The intervention focused on 6 states identified during the multi-sector needs assessment as those in most need of assistance, namely Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Niger, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The initial plan was to have the affected population supported in an IDP camp setup (schools and health facilities).

However, the flood-affected population moved out of the camps earlier than expected. The government also aimed to vacate the schools that were used to host the IDPs to be vacated to avoid the disruption of the resuming of classes in January 2019. As a result, these changes affected the geographical context of the operation as the flood-affected population dispersed to different Local Government Areas (LGAs) and villages.

The operation had to strategize to ensure planned activities were to be held in their current location. Even though all affected families returned to their communities after the acute phase, the flooding resulted in long-term impacts, including a cholera outbreak in December when IDPs returned to their communities. The devastating loss to livelihoods and trauma of displacement also created psychosocial needs within the affected population.","Mon, 06 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1493663-MDRNG025eafr.png?itok=KHVy4p40,"['states', 'communities', 'n', 'nigeria', 'plan', 'needs', 'report', 'local', 'flood', 'population', 'emergency', 'mdrng025', 'water', 'flooding', 'final', 'displaced', 'response', 'appeal', 'affected']", ,flood

ABUJA, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Death toll has risen to 18 due to the floods caused by persistent rainfall in central Nigeria, said a local official on Wednesday.

Confirming the figure to reporters, Ibrahim Inga, head of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency in Nigeria's central region, said eight more deaths were recorded recently.

On October 16, Inga had earlier confirmed 10 deaths recorded over the past two months as the floods wreaked havoc in the state.

So far, 41,959 people have been displaced due to the disaster, the official said.

The floods, as a result of a localized high-intensity rainfall accompanied by torrential winds since August, also triggered massive run-off activities in streams and rivers in the state.

""The combined effect of the micro-climate trend and severe rainfall regime upstream of rivers Niger and Kaduna increased inflow in the basin, which resulted in the spillage of the water from the three hydropower dams,"" Inga told reporters.

He said 2,714 houses have been destroyed so far by the disaster. The flood swept through 20 local government areas, with 152 communities submerged.

The floods also badly damaged, roads, bridges, culverts and other buildings, the official said.

Inga said the excess waters had inundated several hectares of farmlands and displaced some dwellers in hinterland communities.

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, which is responsible for issuing flood alerts here, had since early August issued an alert over possible flooding due to the high intensity of rainfall across the country.

The hydrological body said the flooding incidents are due to high rainfall intensity of long duration, rainstorms, blockage of drainage systems and poor urban planning resulting from the erection of structures within the floodplains and waterways.

This year, Nigeria's 36 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja, would witness different levels of flooding, the hydrological body predicted.","Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['official', 'death', 'roundup', 'nigerias', 'recorded', 'xinhua', 'rises', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'flood', 'central', 'hydrological', 'disaster', 'inga', 'flooding', '18', 'floods', 'toll', 'rivers']", ,flood

59,59,FL-2017-000126-NGA,The new 'jollof wars' and why Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria for its first Africa base - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/14/the-new-jollof-wars-and-why-twitter-chose-ghana-over-nigeria-for-its-first-africa-base/,"National-World

Twitter’s announcement Monday that it will set up its first Africa base in Ghana, West Africa, has generated fierce debate among Nigerian users of the social media app, and reignited the never-ending rivalry between the two countries, known colloquially as the ‘jollof wars.’

Many Nigerians believe that Twitter’s decision is a snub to the continent’s largest economy, which is seeing rapid growth and investment in its tech scene.

According to NOI polls, 39.6 million Nigerians have a Twitter account, which is more than the entire 32 million population of Ghana.

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey capped a whirlwind tour of Africa in 2019 by pledging to move to the continent for several months in 2020.

Now it seems that his business will make that move first.

In a statement announcing the decision, Twitter described Ghana “as a champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet.”

The social media giant also cited Ghana’s hosting of the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) as another reason for moving there, saying it aligns with “its ambition to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa.”

Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said “the choice of Ghana as headquarters for Twitter’s Africa operations is EXCELLENT news,” and described it as a “beautiful partnership between Ghana and Twitter and which is critical for the dev’t of Ghana’s hugely important tech sector.”

‘No ease of doing business’

Some Nigerians blamed an “inconducive business environment” for Twitter choosing Ghana over Nigeria.

“Under @MBuhari our ease of doing business is so bad that it’s easier for terrorists to get phone lines than law-abiding residents. You can land at Ghana’s Kotoka Airport and get a SIM card at the airport. But a camel has to pass through the eye of a needle to get one in Nigeria,” said Reno Omokri via Twitter, a former presidential aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan.

Omokri was referring to the suspension of new phone lines registration because of a federal government policy to link all active SIM cards in the country to a national identity number (NIN) for security reasons.

The exercise is time consuming and the deadline has been extended multiple times, leaving new arrivals unable to obtain a local number, until at least May.

Another Twitter user, lawyer Moe Odele wrote: “One of our clients wanted to open shop in Nigeria for their West Africa office. Once we sent them a breakdown of the regulatory requirements for their industry (also tech), they hit us with ‘we will get back to you.’ We haven’t heard back since then.”

Another commenter, Onye Ajuju, said Twitter’s decision was justified and that Nigerians had a “bloated sense of entitlement.”

“It’s unbelievable seeing Nigerians throwing a tantrum because Twitter went to Ghana. The lack of awareness of how bad things are in the country, the bloated sense of entitlement, the unhinged expectations that everyone should accept Nigeria’s dysfunction…it’s incredible!” she said.

In 2019, Ghana ranked 13 places higher than Nigeria in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index.

Google,Microsoft and Huawei are among international tech giants that have expanded their operations in Ghana, targeting software developers and young creatives on the continent.

In 2018, Facebook opened its first community hub space in Africa in Nigeria’s commercial city, Lagos, while announcing plans last year to open an operational office also in Lagos, but for tech investors such as Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, there are lessons to be learned if Nigeria will continue to attract much-needed foreign investment.

“We have to think carefully about the reasons why Twitter chose Ghana — not necessarily in the context of whether we want to bring Twitter to Nigeria or not, but in the context of what it will take for us to remain a competitive destination for investors,” Aboyeji told CNN on Tuesday.

“We need to start thinking very carefully about enhancing democracy and the rule of law, freedom of speech, and most importantly, our role in enabling the Africa Free Trade Agreement. It’s not enough for us to just be a big market… We have next door to us, a very competitive neighbor, who’s doing all the right things to make itself the hub of West Africa,” he added.

‘A more productive market’

Another Nigerian tech entrepreneur and investor Bosun Tijani, told CNN that Twitter simply chose a more productive market to run its Africa operations.

“While Nigeria has a huge market that Twitter would love to target, the business environment here is quite demanding… It’s strenuous…the cost of running a business here is high. But with the AfCFTA single market agreement which Africa is signed up to, a company like Twitter can choose to set up shop in a small market like Ghana — that gives the best opportunity for it to operate — and still serve the Nigerian market,” said Tijani, who heads a tech innovation lab, CcHUB.

From tourism to tech, Ghana has been actively courting investors from the diaspora and in particular African-Americans, some of whom were given citizenship and encouraged to return to their roots.

Ghana also ranked as the 43rd most peaceful country in the world, in the 2020 Global Peace Index, placing 104 spots ahead of Nigeria — which grapples with Boko Haram insurgency and periodic outbreaks of violence.","Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['tech', 'market', 'twitter', 'chose', 'nigerians', 'doing', 'west', 'jollof', 'ghana', 'wars', 'nigeria', 'base', 'business', 'africa']", ,flood

Nigeria is approaching the peak of its rainy season, and flooding is expected to hit 15 out of its 36 states this month. The agency has issued a red alert because of above-normal water levels on the country's two largest rivers, the Benue and the Niger.

In August, many communities along the rivers were cut off due to collapsed bridges and impassable roads. Four students were killed when a pedestrian bridge fell at a university in the northern region.

FILE - Houses partially submerged in flood waters are pictured in Lokoja city, Kogi State, Nigeria, Sept. 17, 2018.

With thousands of houses and hectares of farmland and produce destroyed along with schools and shops, the economic impact of this year'sflooding is expected to be high. The country's emergency management agency is stepping in to distribute items like cement bags, blankets and hygiene products.

Peter Odjugo, a professor of geography at Nigeria's University of Benin, works with the Nigerian Meteorological Society. He has been tracking the extreme weather patterns and says the government has repeatedly failed to take preemptive measures to reduce the impact of flooding.

""What they prefer doing or what they are doing now is services after the impact, rather than preventing it from occurring,"" he said.

Odjugo suggests that the silt be removed from the rivers to increase the volume of water they can hold. He also recommends that town planners enforce regulation on where buildings are constructed, saying this is a glaring weak spot across the country.

City regulators look out for buildings being constructed near waterways. Such buildings are often marked with an X, designating an order to stop construction work.

Stella Ojeme, the director for information in the Federal Capital Territory Administration, says that even in the nation's capital ofAbuja, enforcing building codes is a challenge.

""Most of our people will go, buy white paint, paint off the stop work mark,"" she said. ""First of all, you find people [building] where they shouldn't build. You find people build on flood plains. You find some people dump their refuse in the gutter.""

Odjugo says climate change is making a real impact in Nigeria, but the government has not made the issue a priority.

Additional challenges

Additionally, the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency says its weather data collection equipment is being vandalized and stolen.

Clement Eze, the agency's director general, spoke at a workshop last month, asking the public to help stop the illegal activity, as it is hindering the agency's ability to forecast extreme weather.

""We can no longer take readings, maybe accumulated or about a week or two,"" he said. ""Or if there are no resources, it can even take more than six months before we can go back and replenish or repair and this equipment is imported from outside Nigeria.""

During Nigeria's worst flooding in 2012, the Niger River reached a record high level of 12.84 meters. Two million Nigerians were forced from their homes and 363 people were killed, according to the National Emergency Management Agency.","Thu, 05 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-09/RTX6J5VG.jpg,"['floodravaged', 'flooding', 'month', 'stop', 'unprepared', 'buildings', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'nigerian', 'rains', 'communities', 'impact', 'services', 'rivers', 'weather']", ,flood

…Urges residents in coastal areas to relocate, predicts 261 days of rainfall

By Olasunkanmi Akoni

Lagos State Government, yesterday, predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with attendant flooding across the state, even as it directed residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas of the state to move upland to avert needless loss of lives and property.

Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, accompanied by Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, said this at a media briefing on the 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions, and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja.

Bello said: “The forecast for 2021 is based on the informed global consensus that el-Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, is at the cool phase, which will continue till around June and likely give to a dominant el-Nino phase till the end of 2021.

“Generally, the Seasonal Climate Prediction for Lagos State signifies that on-set dates ranged between March 17 in the earliest, and April 6, while the season-ending may range between November 20 and December 5, 2021.

READ ALSO:

“The connotation is that Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while the maximum annual rainfall amount is predicted to be 1,747mm.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.”

Besides, he said the state government is collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NiMET, in downscaling the predictions to all stakeholders.

Also speaking, Mr. Igbokwe, stated that the government planned to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72kilometres spread across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state to checkmate flooding.

“I, therefore, urge residents to support the government to achieve a flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again been littered by residents,” Igbokwe said.

Meteorologist Luke Robinson said there could be significant rain in some areas around west central Montana.

“We are looking at some rain moving into the area starting mid week to the end of the week,” said Robinson. “This week we are looking at some pretty good soaking rains, particularly in southwest Montana and west central Montana. We will see the rivers and streams rising but right now we're not really anticipating any impacts from it.”

Robinson said the cold front will bring accompanying snow to the higher mountain areas.

“This system is moving in, it's going to be relatively cold, so we're actually looking at some accumulating snow in the mountains,” he said. “Those cooler temperatures will cut off all the hot mountain snow melt that we've had the past few days and most of the rise in the rivers and streams will be coming from mid to low level moisture coming into the area.”

Robinson said people who live in areas that usually flood in the spring may be nervous to see the river levels rising.

By Joseph Erunke

THE Executive Director, Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE, Dr. Ganiyu Agbaje, Tuesday, said Nigeria has improved on its possession of requisite equipment’s to better forecast flood, thereby mitigating the effects.

To this end, he expressed optimism that the negative socioeconomic impacts of flooding in the country would henceforth be mitigated through effective and accurate forecast.

Agbaje, speaking at the opening ceremony of Online Regional Training on Flood Monitoring and Forecasting Modelling, in Abuja, insisted that with the latest technology in the country, it will henceforth be easier to predict flood and locate the people who are really affected, a development he noted, would make the country make informed decision to reduce the disaster associated with the flood.

But he tasked experts on accuracy in their forecast using satellite technology, saying such was necessary in order to monitor flood as well as identify its hotspot areas with a view to making a quick damage assessment.

He spoke as Nigeria joined other West African nations to adopt satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

He explained that the training was held to equip participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-hotspot areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse which is a major cause of flooding in Africa.

Hear him:“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction but more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower in Nigeria and other countries.”

According to him, the training was not to teach participants how to predict but to show them how to use additional satellite data to do their prediction better and support other methods.

He said that the technology has been on for a while around the world, adding that African leaders in collaboration with the EU initiated the training to help Africa better monitor the environment and mitigate disasters.

Agbaje said that with the data, rainfall, rivers and the environment will be better monitored, adding that in the case of Nigeria, more information on the activities of River Niger will be known using the technology.

“We need to support our rural communities on how best use flood when it occurs because at times if it coming far away from this country, you can harness the water overflowing for many other things in agriculture. In raining season, you can channel it for irrigation.

“We are feeling the economic impact of this disaster. We are looking at riverine flooding. You know our people settle along the rivers. And they have their livelihoods there; they are farmers and can’t come to towns,” he added.

The three-day training, which holds simultaneously in four other West African countries, was backed by the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) under its Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) initiative.

It was conducted by the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE.

Also speaking at the event, the GMES & Africa Programme Coordinator at the African Union Commission, Dr. Tidiane Ouattara, who joined via video conferencing, expressed joy that the activities of the CSSTE consortium was able to continue despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Emphasising the need for the constant training of young people and experts on the African continent, he described the training as a major achievement that would help Africa to build infrastructure and reduce the economic damage of flooding.

Participants at the workshop were drawn from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

In their separate goodwill messages, representatives of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said the training is aimed at building the capacity of stakeholders to better utilise satellite technology in providing accurate, timely and easily assessable information to improve the management of the environment.

FLOODS

Heavy rains have been recorded in West and Central Africa in the past weeks, including in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Senegal, leading to devastating floods that have killed dozens and displaced thousands of people. In Niger, 329,958 people had been affected by flooding with 65 deaths. About 31,960 houses have collapsed and 5,768 hectares of farmland destroyed. Maradi, Dosso, Tahoua and Niamey are the most affected regions. In 2019, at the same time, 35,384 people were affected across the country.

In northern Nigeria, thousands of homes and wide areas of crops have been destroyed in recent flooding in the states of Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi and Sokoto. More than 30 people reportedly have died. In Borno State, about 26,000 people, including IDPs, have been affected by heavy flooding across camps and communities. Borno and Adamawa states remain at risk of heavy flooding according to the Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) released by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) in June.

In Chad, some 188,915 people (37,783 households) were affected by flooding in the central and southern provinces, in the Lac and N’Djamena respectively. Large pieces of farmland are inundated with a potential impact on food security and livelihoods.

In Senegal, an emergency aid plan has been activated following exceptional rains in the capital Dakar and large part of the country that caused devastating floods on 5 September. At least four people were killed, the exact number of the people affected is yet to be determined.

Mali has also seen severe flooding that began in July. By early August, more than 13,200 people, including 5,400 internally displaced persons, were affected by floods in the country. The worst affected regions are Gao, Mopti, Ségou and Sikasso. A total of 1,160 homes have been destroyed.

In Cameroon, more than 30,000 people have been affected by floods caused by heavy rains in Far North, West, Coastal, South and South-West regions, destroying homes, washing away livestock and devastating plantations.

Heavy rainfall at the end of July caused rivers to overflow in the Far North, affecting over 5,000 people. More flooding was recently reported in the area, with over 1,500 families displaced around Maroua.

Flooding also affected the city of Douala and surrounding areas of Littoral region in the South-West after a torrential downpour on 21 August 2020.

In Ghana, roads, bridges, homes and farmland were inundated in the Northern and North East Regions due to heavy rainfall and releases from the Bagre Dam in neighbouring Burkina Faso, which began in mid-August 2020. At least eight people have lost their lives. The spillage was necessary due to a sharp increase in the water level. Several areas remain inaccessible, making assessments impossible.

In Burkina Faso, three people died in Kaya, Centre-Nord after heavy rainfall on 4 September. Earlier flooding affected the capital Ouagadougou, reportedly killing one person and damaging houses and property.

The expansion of the epidemic to the Bomongo health zone, bordering the Republic of Congo, is a serious concern. Rapid response actions are needed and point of Entry/Control (PoE/PoC) must be reinforced to mitigate the risk of the epidemic spreading to neighboring Republic of Congo. As of 6 September, there are 112 Ebola cases (106 confirmed cases and six probable cases), including 48 deaths and 50 recoveries.","Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1534863-West%20and%20Central%20Africa%20%E2%80%93%20Weekly%20Regional%20Humanitarian%20Snapshot%20%281%20%E2%80%93%207%20September%202020%29.png?itok=ad73obf8,"['congo', 'homes', 'west', 'democratic', 'republic', 'humanitarian', 'including', 'rains', 'rainfall', 'weekly', 'regional', 'snapshot', 'central', 'heavy', 'africa', 'regions', 'flooding', 'floods', 'affected']", ,flood

Early warning systems, contingency planning and local action can strengthen West Africa’s responses to increasingly frequent severe flooding, but more investment is needed in forecasting, panelists said in a recent webinar organized by the African Development Bank.

“We need to explore new and innovative approaches to better forecast and communicate floods and early warning information,” said Anthony Nyong, the Bank’s Director for Climate Change and Green Growth, in his opening remarks for the webinar Flood Forecasting and Early Warning in West Africa: Gaps, Innovation, and Lessons Learned.

In 2019 alone, extreme flooding caused the displacement of up to 5.1 million people in Africa, including 3.8 million from countries experiencing food insecurity. West Africa is a hotspot for extreme weather due to its long coastline, which is home to densely populated low-lying cities and economic hubs, from Lagos to Abidjan and Dakar.

This year, floods in eight West African countries affected over 750,000 people and claimed at least 100 lives. With rapid urbanization and increasing climate risks, the impact of floods in the region will likely accelerate over the next five decades.

The November 19 webinar, organized by the Bank’s Clim-Dev Africa Special Fund, brought together experts from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Senegal’s national meteorological agencies to provide an update on flood forecasting and early warning systems (EWS) in West Africa.

A representative for the Niger Basin Authority discussed regional collaboration on flood forecasting among its nine members. The event included a panel discussion with leading experts from the Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.

“We know that flood EWS is a crucial flood management tool, comprising key components of disaster risk knowledge, monitoring, and forecasting-as well as communication and response. Yet, little is being done to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and operationalize flood forecasts and early warning systems,” said James Kinyangi, Coordinator of the Clim-Dev Fund.

Ousmane N’diaye, Director of Senegal’s National Meteorological Agency, said that better preparedness through climate information and multi-disciplinary planning targeting vulnerable populations is crucial to saving lives and property. He emphasized the importance of early forecasting and the use of social media platforms to broadcast alerts and provide real-time weather information in local languages.

Michael Talhami of the Red Cross said acting early and anticipating risk would reduce human exposure to disaster. All too often, he said, local actors and humanitarian organizations have to work with weather and climate data that is dated, of poor quality, or non-existent. One example is the abandonment of hydrometeorological data collection in rural Mali, which has had detrimental consequences for emergency preparedness and response.

The Bank’s Institutional Support to African Climate Centers Project (ISACIP) has invested over $35 million to improve climate information services throughout Africa since 2010. As a follow-up to ISACIP, the Bank, through the Clim-Dev Fund, is investing over $27 million in regional and country operations to modernize Africa’s climate and weather infrastructure and provide high-quality and reliable data.","Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['green', 'improve', 'head', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'flood', 'growth', 'forecasting', 'west', 'early', 'warning', 'million', 'plan', 'preparedness', 'information', 'africa', 'weather']", ,flood

In 2020, flooding has affected 2.7 million people in 18 countries in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact has been particularly severe, and the number of people affected is more than double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, recent flooding have occurred in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This year 197,000 houses were reported destroyed in thirteen countries of the region. 422,000 hectares of farmland were affected by floods, which resulted in the destruction of crops and fields, threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions were already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities have led the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organizations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO has supported the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people and help communities to bounce back faster.","Thu, 24 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1549862-wca_2020_flooding_snapshot_20201218.png?itok=ipFhZmgq,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', '18', 'overview', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'floods', 'vulnerable', 'republic', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

The Lagos State Government said Sunday night that officials are mandated to arrest anyone caught dumping trash in drainage channels and canals, according to the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR).

For years, residents in the region of 16 million people have complained about garbage piled along highways and drainage canals.

""The situation is getting out of hand, passing the refuse dumps is an eyesore,"" resident Halimat Mogaji told The Guardian in December. ""Most times I try to avoid walking past the dumps because of the amount of refuse by the roadside.""

Residents told the news outlet that the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), which is responsible for collecting trash, often won't pick up waste from households that are behind on bills.

The situation led to poor sanitary conditions in the area, as canals fill with trash and standing water, the ICIR has reported.

74,74,FL-2017-000126-NGA,How a hackathon sparked resilience and innovation throughout one of the largest western African cities - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/75652,"Source(s): World Bank, the (WB)



By Robert Reid, Iguniwari Thomas Ekeu-Wei, and Zirra Banu

Ibadan is the third most populous city in Nigeria—Africa’s largest country in terms of population and economy. This city of six million also happens to be the country’s largest in terms of geographic area, but like many other cities, urbanization is largely uncontrolled, and people are exposed to disasters like floods.

We had the opportunity to experience Nigeria’s creativity and innovation in Lagos city, when the World Bank partnered with Co-Creation Hub and other players to organize a hackathon that focused on leveraging data and technology to improve accountability and service delivery in governance. People, including data and software engineers, professional and academic experts, and civil servants, came together to develop solutions for improved policy, governance and development impact.

The Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project (IUFMP) —set up to tackle the city’s urban resilience challenges—submitted datasets for the hackathon, and one of the teams that worked on the data from the project emerged as winner in February, 2020. Teams developed a geospatial visualization platform to overlay and view the datasets from the geodatabases created as part of the Ibadan city, and flood and drainage masterplans preparation, demonstrating how the government and other stakeholders can use insights from geospatial data to accelerate effective decision making in urban planning, flood risk and environmental management. With this open data, the state government can now use up-to-the-minute information to identify, manage, prevent, and prepare for flood risks, and other ensuing impacts from floods.

Building on this with support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and with the collaboration of technical initiatives from experts in Ibadan and around Oyo state, the project scaled up the use of data for flood risk management and developed an advanced geospatial visualization platform that empowers the government to seamlessly apply geospatial data in daily operations.

This innovation strengthens the capacity of the Oyo state government to manage flood risk and inform decision making in other sectors in Ibadan using data, coupled with previous capacity building efforts, gigabytes of geospatial data available and GIS innovation laboratories have been setup under the project. The labs established at the department of Urban Renewal Enforcement Monitoring and Compliance and Office of the Surveyor General under the Oyo State Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. The Project Implementation Unit has been equipped with computers, servers, printers, plotters and software needed to apply these datasets in decision making. These datasets, which are publicly available via an advanced geospatial visualization platform, now strategically inform technical decision making and engagements. This enhances urban resilience and disaster risk management, aligning strongly with the Oyo State Government’s E-governance Program and leveraging internet connectivity infrastructure provided by the government in locations where the labs are present to facilitate data exchange.

From the people to policy—students sparking innovation

In August, the University of Ibadan and the project signed a formal memorandum of understanding, to foster capacity development, knowledge exchange and promote long-term project sustainability through collaborative research, data information exchange, internship programs for students, short courses and training programs for government staff and other professionals, and all-round collaborations that bridge the academic-policy-industry gap through open data and innovation.

With the rising thirst for innovative responses to managing flood risks in Ibadan, the University of Ibadan, in collaboration with the project, GIS Konsult Limited and other partners hosted the second season of the Ibadan Geo-Hackathon completed in November with the theme, “Ibadan Urban Resilience,” leveraging the advanced geospatial visualization platform and geodatabases to deliver solutions focusing on three thematic areas: risk-informed decision making, urban resilient design, and innovative technology solutions for urban resilience. The winning submissions for the respective categories include: Smart Citi, a web-based application for automated flood-risk assessment and waste management,, and Flood Health Risk Mapper an industrial research innovation, and Fire Incidents - A Reoccurring Menace, a story on disaster resilience. The city of Ibadan has now developed two comprehensive masterplans: A Flood Risk Management and Drainage Masterplan and a City Masterplan. Both documents create a vision for resilient and sustainable urban development in the face of climate change, identifying opportunities to boost inclusive economic development, and identify and prioritize the structures most at risk of failing (bridges, culverts, drainages, dam, etc.) to strengthen the government's capacity to detect and respond more effectively to floods, and build resilience long-term. The amount of data, maps and information generated by these master plans is vast. They include spatial datasets, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) topography, high resolution aerial imagery, and outputs of urban analytics, hydrological and hydraulic modelling. By making this information accessible to the public, it becomes useful for many stakeholders, and will inform individuals, private sector, and government decision making to better manage risks and improve urban development.

Open data for innovation and entrepreneurship in development

Entrepreneurship is on the rise—and so is innovation and collaboration for the benefit of all. With data open and publicly accessible, businesses, academia and university students alike can utilize information for research and development. This innovation helps civil servants in their work as they tactically tackle disaster and urban development challenges. In turn, the increased resilience helps everyone from kindergarteners to tailors, and keeps the city’s six million people protected from preventable disaster risks. That’s the impact of open data, open governance, and effective resilience building—all together, they spark cooperation, preparedness and innovation for the benefit of everyone.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['data', 'geospatial', 'sparked', 'urban', 'ibadan', 'hackathon', 'flood', 'innovation', 'making', 'risk', 'resilience', 'cities', 'project', 'largest', 'western', 'african']", ,flood

The floods are also the worst in the state since 1988, residents and state officials told PREMIUM TIMES, amidst fears the floods could worsen Nigeria’s current food insufficiency that has led to an increase in prices of basic food like rice.

The Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) said the deaths occurred in about 19 local government areas of the state

Hadejia Emirate, with eight council areas, is the worst hit, the executive secretary of SEMA, Sani Yusuf, told PREMIUM TIMES.

Mr Yusuf said the deaths were recorded since the commencement of the current rainy season.

“These are the number of deaths so far reported to the agency since the beginning of this rainy season,” he said.

He explained that the agency, with federal government support, is doing the needful to cushion the effects of the disaster by providing emergency needs to the victims of the flood.

He added that the agency has so far distributed 30 canoes to communities affected by the flood, as well as materials to the affected communities to build embankments in order to control the water.

Worst Flood in over 30 years

Hamza Muhammad, special assistant to Governor Muhammad Badaru on community development and social inclusion, said this year’s flood is the worst since 1988 with Hadejia emirate as the worst affected area.

He listed the affected local governments as Buji, Hadejia, Ringim, Taura, Jahun, Miga, Malammadori, Auyo, Kafinhausa and Guri.

Others include Gwaram, Kiyawa, Kaugama, Birninkudu, kirikasamma, Garki and Babura.

Cause of flood

Mr Muhammad attributed the cause of the flood to an overflow of Tiga and Challawa dams in Kano State as well as effects of climate change.

He also said torrential rainfall, as earlier forecast by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, contributed to the disaster.

In an earlier report done by this newspaper, Isa Mustapha, the executive director, Exceptional Leadership and Integrity Promotion, listed the major causes of the flood as insufficient drainage channels, silted dams, weeds, trypa grass overgrowing on river channels and river beds, as well as illegal diversion and encroachment of waterways.

Other causes, according to Mr Mustapha, include lackadaisical attitude towards the desiltation of the Hadeija-Yobe Kwamadugu River basin, as well as poor coordination among stakeholders on the control of the menace of flood.

Government’s intervention

Mr Muhammad said the state government has been doing its best since January 2020 to prevent the flood including directing officials to conduct a survey in flood-prone areas of the state.

He said the government had also deployed water pumping machines to the affected communities to evacuate the flooded water.

“Where we cannot use the machines to evacuate the water, we organized self help groups in such communities and empower them with tools for embarkment,” he said.

Affected communities deny government’s intervention

Contrary to Mr Muhammad’s claims, residents of the affected communities said the government is not doing enough.

They accused the government of not providing any remedial measures to help mitigate the impact of the flood.

Mr Mustapha and some officials of SEMA, while on an assessment visit to some of the flooded areas on Monday, were mobbed by angry residents who decried the government’s negligence of the areas.

One of the vehicles conveying the officials got damaged while journalists trying to take footage of the flooded areas were also chased away by the angry residents.

Impact of Flooding on Food Production

Officials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, are already lamenting the impact of the flood on food production in Jigawa, and Nigeria, especially rice production.

Jigawa is one of the states that has benefitted most from the federal government’s Anchors Borrowers Programme to assist farmers boost rice production in the country.

Mr Muhammad, the governor’s aide, expressed the fear that the state may experience food shortage, saying that “Sixty-five per cent of Fadama farmland were washed away by the flood especially in Hadejia where much anticipated rice is expected.”

He added that grains like millet, maize and sorghum were also lost to the flood.

Officials could not give the exact number of farmlands and houses that were destroyed by the flood but said the damage is unprecedented while assessment is ongoing.

In his reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari described this year’s flood in Jigawa as ”unprecedented and devastating.”

In a statement by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, Mr Buhari, on Tuesday, sympathised with the victims of the flood while assuring them of federal government’s intervention.

He described the flood, which has reportedly destroyed over 100,000 hectares of rice farms in the state, as a setback to agriculture especially rice production which his administration has actively promoted and discouraged its importation.

The price of rice has also doubled in the past few months across Nigeria due to various reasons including the floods affecting rice-producing states like Jigawa and Kebbi.","Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/09/Jigawa-flood.jpg?fit=718%2C405&ssl=1,"['experiences', 'affected', 'destroyed', 'flood', 'governments', 'food', 'farms', 'dead', 'muhammad', 'communities', 'worst', 'jigawa', '40', 'officials', 'state', 'maize', 'rice']", ,flood

The training, organised by the Centre for Space Science & Technology Education (CSSTE) was part of the Multi-Scale Flood Monitoring and Assessment Services for West Africa (MiFMASS) project under the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) Support Programme which seeks to help Nigeria and other West African nations to adopt a new system of utilising satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

Participants were mainly technical operational staff from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

The training, which holds simultaneously across four other West African countries, aimed at equiping participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-prone areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model, as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

According to the Lead of the CSSTE Consortium, Dr Ganiyu Agbaje, the training was in alignment with one of the major pillars of the GMES & Africa support programme, which was capacity building, and this had led the CSSTE consortium to identify strategic training needs of its collaborating stakeholders on the MIFMASS project with the aim to train and empower them to sustain the product and service outcomes after the lifetime of the programme.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, a major cause of flooding in Africa.

“Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say ‘you cannot dump refuse here,’ then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

“Also, it has been said that the whole of the Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction and more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower,” he said.

Dr. Agbaje, who also doubles as the Executive Director of the African Regional Centre for Space Science & Technology Education – English (ARCSSTE-E) in Ile-Ife, added that GMES & Africa is a joint initiative of the African Union and the European Union to harness the benefits of earth observation (satellite) data for inherent environmental challenges in Africa and their own MiFMASS project is one of the many ongoing research and development projects under the programme.

He pledged that two more training courses will be held as the consortium prepares for the conclusion of the project and the handover of its products and services to relevant agencies.

As well as the risk of further deaths and injuries, and damage to livelihoods and infrastructure, the Nigerian Red Cross is warning of a steep rise in the number of diarrhoea cases in Kogi, Niger, Anambra and Delta.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has launched an emergency appeal on behalf of the Nigerian Red Cross, seeking 5,425,000 Swiss francs to support 300,000 of the most vulnerable people for nine months. The operation will provide shelter and the distribution of relief items; livelihoods including cash transfers; health; water, sanitation and hygiene, and protection, gender and inclusion.","Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180817_085506021_iOS_edited.jpg,"['14', 'livelihoods', 'floods', 'states', 'cross', 'disaster', 'million', 'nigeria', 'nigerian', 'risk', 'niger', 'affected', 'kogi', 'red', 'emergency']", ,flood
80,80,FL-2017-000126-NGA,28 states at risk of flood - Agency - Premium Times,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/395058-28-states-at-risk-of-flood-agency.html,"No fewer than 102 local government areas in 28 states are at risk of flooding, according to the 2020 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO), released by the Nigeria Hydrological Survey Agency (NIHSA) on Thursday.

The states include the states of Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, Bayelsa, Sokoto, Kogi, Niger, Kaduna, Gombe, Adamawa, Benue, FCT, Nasarawa, Delta, Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Edo, Abia, Anambra, Imo, Borno, Kano and Kebbi.

At the Official Presentation of the outlook in Abuja, the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, noted that the outlook was a fallout from the devastating effect of the 2012 flood in the country.

He said the purpose of the outlook was to present probable flood scenarios for this year and to disseminate information to all, especially in flood-prone areas and further reduce resultant effects.

He said flood is one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria with devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on flood plains for livelihoods.

He said although the flood outlook had shown that 2020 floods might not be as severe as previous years, it was important for all stakeholders to carry out an aggressive awareness campaign for preparedness.

“It is pertinent to note that the impending flooding season with COVID-19 presents a fight against two threats; on one hand, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and on the other hand, the likelihood of an active 2020 flood season.

“The 2020 flood projections will as expected vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country.

“Overall, the flood level may not be as severe as previous years, but it is a certainty that our rivers will exceed flood level and many will be inundated again this year.”

The minister said as always, flooding was associated with increased risk of infections when the displaced persons were high and polluted water sources, added that it was important for all stakeholders to prepare earnestly.

He added that part of the intervention to promote hygiene was the recently signed Executive Order 009 by the President Muhammadu Buhari aimed at ending Open Defecation by 2025.

“Many state governors have bought into this idea, the ministry declared emergency in the water and sanitation sector to encourage hand washing and put in place the National WASH Response Committee for COVID -19,” he said.

The minister also commended the efforts of NIHSA in the development of a new Flood Mobile App, saying that it would add practical value to water managers and for overall disaster risks management.

The NIHSA’s Director-General, Clement Nze, said the 2020 AFO would go beyond borders and defer all barriers to reach the needy in providing information on early flood warnings required for mitigating risks in the country.

Mr Nze noted that the need to carry out aggressive sensitisation and awareness campaigns on consistent clearing of all waterways and maintenance of dams and reservoirs to ensure free flow of water in drainages.

The D-G said the Flood Mobile App would also be used to give actual daily flood situations to everyone, especially those at the rural areas through the use of SMS services.

The new Flood Mobile App is designed to be of practical value to the Water Managers, Technical Experts, Disaster Risk Managers, Policy Makers and Flood Forecasting Community for flood prevention and for enhancing flood early warning systems in Nigeria.

As of 10 October, flooding has affected around 2.1 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is almost double last year’s, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains are gradually subsiding in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Ghana, Benin and the DRC and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539455-WCA%202020%20Flooding%20Snapshot_20201013.png?itok=qKkz1Zc_,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'rains', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']", ,flood

83,83,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Lagos flood alert: Heeding the augurs - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/lagos-flood-alert-heeding-the-augurs/,"By Kayode Ojewale

SIR: Flooding does not just suddenly happen; it is usually preceded by some occurrences hinting its imminent arrival. When the flow of rain water on its way to the drainage channels or river is impeded, then flooding occurs. Flooding is having too much water in the wrong place. The cause of flooding is mainly man-made because of our unclean environmental habits. With just few days of rains, some parts of Lagos are flooded. How will residents of these areas, especially flood-prone areas fare when the peak of rainy season which usually comes with attendant flooding eventually arrives? The omens of flooding are here with us coupled with the warnings issued by appropriate authorities; are we heeding the augurs?

What’s the end gain if the rains, meant to bless us and water our plants, turn out to damage our crops, properties and even destroy lives due to our actions and inactions? Does it appear many have forgotten the losses, pains and agony that accompanied the ravaging heavy rains which caused disasters in different parts of the country in 2012, the year of flood fury?

Of recent, it is observed that sometimes the rains no longer pre-inform or send any signal before its arrival through warnings like cloudy sky, windy atmosphere and dark clouds. Rather, it will just begin to rain suddenly without any pre-notification and it will pour heavily. That’s another indication that the rains this year would be in a different dimension.

On April 14, the Lagos State government predicted high intensity high of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello.

“…Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm”.

“It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding”, he further added.

As a way of checkmating the looming flood, the state government plans to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72 kilometers spread across all the Local Government Areas of the State.

Flood alerts and warnings are usually issued to sensitize residents and the authorities on the need to prepare. Ignoring these warnings or not heeding the flood alerts may come with deadly consequences. In order to be prepared for the predicted floods, agencies in charge of disaster management and emergencies should be ready to ensure safety of lives during the peak of the rainy season.

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Nature’s fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lagos-flood.jpg,"['residents', 'rainy', 'warnings', 'water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'days', 'heeding', 'flow', 'lagos', 'alert', 'rains', 'state', 'areas', 'augurs']", ,flood

A total of 108 deaths and 192 injuries have been reported as of late August. Rainfall is expected to continue for the next week. Rivers and Bayelsa states are estimated to be amongst the worst affected states where water levels continue to rise. Initial assessments indicate that 13,031 homes were damaged or destroyed across all affected states as of late August. Shelter, food, NFIs and medical assistance continue to be key needs for the affected population

Crisis impact

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, widespread flooding due to ongoing rainfall has affected 441,250 people and displaced 141,400 people in Adamawa, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Delta, Edo, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Niger, Rivers, and Taraba states since late August (NEMA 24/09/2018; ERCC; 24/09/2018).

As of 24 September, flooding across 12 states and 50 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in central and southern Nigeria has caused 108 deaths and 192 injuries (NEMA 24/09/2018). Across all affected states, there is an urgent need for shelter, with around 13,000 houses damaged (NEMA 24/09/2018). The affected population has lost household and personal belongings. The floods have caused considerable damage to agricultural land across Nigeria, with 122,653 hectares of agricultural land destroyed. In addition to shelter, there is an urgent need for food, NFIs and medicine (NEMA 24/09/2018). The flooding is widespread and situation is rapidly evolving. As assessments are ongoing, the number of the affected people is expected to further increase.

Initial assessments indicate that Rivers and Bayelsa are amongst the most affected states. Water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa. As of 24 September, water levels in lower Benue state have subsided to 10m, compared to 11m on 21 September.

The Niger River at Lokoja city, Kogi state, has not receded, as it recorded water levels of 11.05m on 24 September (NEMA 24/09/2018). Light to moderate rainfall is expected to continue until early October.

Shelter: Flooding has displaced around 141,400 people across the 12 affected states, of which 80,600 people are estimated to be living with friends and family (NEMA 24/09/2018). Over 13,000 houses have been partially or totally damaged. IDPs have relocated to emergency shelters, such as LGA offices, schools, stadiums and churches.

Some of the affected population is staying in IDP camps that have been recently constructed by the Presidential Committee on Flood Relief and Rehabilitation (NEMA 21/09/2018). As assessments are ongoing, and water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa states, the amount of houses damaged, which are typically built with mud and thatch roods, is likely to increase (IFCR 23/09/2018). The affected population are in urgent need of shelter support and NFIs, such as blankets, mats, hygiene kits and kitchen sets (IFCR 23/09/2018).

Livelihood: New estimates indicate that 122,653 hectares of agricultural land have been flooded across central and southern Nigeria. Crops were destroyed before the harvesting season begins in October (NYTimes 17/08/2018). This makes the affected population more vulnerable to food insecurity, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of farmers. Flooding is also likely to affect other livelihoods, such as fishers and petty traders.

Food: There continues to be an urgent need for food assistance for IDPs across all affected states. Severe flood damage to agricultural crops means there is a risk that some communities will experience increased food insecurity throughout the harvest season. (Daily Trust 20/09/2018). There are still no reports on whether markets that have been flooded and closed. Transportation of food is likely to be severely restricted because main roads have been flooded.

Health: Since the publication of the briefing note on 21 September, 192 injuries have been reported since late August. Flood affected victims are likely to be in urgent medical care, as result of injuries and the risk of outbreaks made worse due to the extensive flooding. Health care support is particularly needed in IDP camps (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The risk that diarrhoea and cholera will spread remains high, as water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa, and have mostly not subsided in other communities.

Particularly in more populated areas, and overcrowded IDP camps where WASH facilities are inadequate, there continues to be a high concern for cholera to spread further. There have been reports of an increase in diarrhoea cases in four of the flood affected states (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of geographical information and data indicating which states are affected by the spike in diarrhoea cases. 27,927 cases of suspected cholera were reported between 1 January and 10 September countrywide (NCDC 10/09/2018). Between 1 January and 10 September, suspected cholera cases were reported in the flood affected states of Adamawa (2,002), Anambra (23), Bayelsa (no data), Benue (no data), Delta (no data), Edo (no data), Kebbi (198), Kogi (102), Kwara (no data), Niger (547), Rivers (no data), and Taraba (no data). (NCDC 10/09/2018). In Adamawa, an increase of 119 suspected cholera cases was observed between 17-23 September, most likely due to flooding facilitating the spread (Adamawa State Ministry of Health 23/09/2018)

As flooding has not receded, the escalation of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and-or West Nile fever remains a concern (WHO 2018). The Government recently confirmed that the malaria cases have increased due to the floods (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The current malaria incidence in Nigeria is 380.8/1,000 (2015) (PMI 2017). A distribution of mosquito nets for the flood affected population has been identified as a key priority (NEMA 24-09-2018 NaijaNews 18/09/2018).

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, there have been additional reports in local media sources that indicate antenatal care for pregnant women remains a key concern. This was reported in Uzanu community, Estako East LGA, Edo state and in Ogbaru, Amambra.

There is a need for psychosocial support, as flood victims have lost or been separated from their loved ones (IFCR 23/09/2018).

WASH: The displaced population is still staying in emergency shelters, such LGA offices, stadiums, schools and churches, which have inadequate sanitation facilities and are in urgent need of safe water. In most of the affected states, water sources have been contaminated by flooding (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of data on the potential amount of damaged water points.

Education: Schools continue to be used as evacuation centres across all affected states. On 18 September, primary and secondary schools were closed in Ogbaru, Southern Anambra state as a safety measure, following floods that displaced more than 1,1000 people (OCHA 24/09/2018). Considering the ongoing flooding, it is likely that many schools have been damaged by flooding (Premium Times 19/09/2018).

Protection: While there is no disaggregated data available on the amount of women and girls affected by the floods, it is likely that this group is disproportionately affected.

Women and girls that are displaced and staying in IDP camps continue to be at increased risk to gender-based violence. Overcrowding at IDP camps, with a lack of privacy and inadequate toilets and washing facilities, increases the risks and vulnerability of women and girls to gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (UNHCR 12/2017; OCHA 2016).

Impact on critical infrastructure

Since the start of the rainy season, in June, main roads have been flooded and bridges collapsed (Vanguard 15/09/2018). As water levels have not subsided and heavy rainfall is expected to continue until the beginning of October, main roads continue to be flooded across all affected states.

Power and telecommunications are affected in some of the flood-affected states. The Okpai Gas Independent Power Plant in Ndokwa East Council, Delta State, with power supply to Aso Villa, Abuja has been flooded (TheGuardian 25/09/2018). Communities in Kdokwa West and Ukwuani councils are also affected by the power cut.

Some LGA offices in affected are also likely to be impacted, as they are being used as emergency shelters for the flood affected population.","Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1171619-20180925_acaps_briefing_note_nigeria_floods_update_i_0.png?itok=EOQvdbLy,"['2018', 'data', 'likely', 'water', '26', 'flooding', 'continue', 'nema', 'flood', 'floods', 'states', 'levels', 'note', 'nigeria', 'briefing', 'affected', 'acaps']", ,flood
85,85,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Nigeria: Food Security Threatened As Floods Destroy Farms - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202009030184.html,"Fear of food crisis is heightening in Nigeria following massive floods that are ravaging crop farms in many parts of the country.

Many farmlands were reportedly destroyed by floods in Kebbi, Zamfara, Niger, Rivers, C/Rivers, Sokoto, Bauchi and some parts of Kwara State.

Rice and maize farmlands were most affected and farmers fear this could further hike the prices of the staple food in the country.

A Daily Trust market survey showed that prices of food items are already going up in the market.

In Kano, a 100kg of maize now costs N20,000, N22,000 in Benue, N24, 000 in Abuja and as high as N25,000 in Lagos State.

The same size of maize sold between N9, 000 and N11, 000 last year across the country.

Also, 100kg of local rice now costs N55,000 in Kano, N58,000 in Abuja, while prices of beans range from N22,000 to N24, 000 per 100kg depending on the market and state.

- The warnings -

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had warned that the current water level in the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin portends some level of concern for Nigeria as there could be a likelihood of river flooding in the states contiguous to River Niger.

The states, according to the Agency, are Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The Director-General of the agency, Engr. Clement Onyeaso Nze said the country through Kebbi State might be flooded beginning from September 6

Reports from Kebbi had shown that several hectares of rice farms were washed away by flood and similar incidence was also reported in some parts of Zamfara, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kwara, Cross Rivers, Rivers and Niger states.

The incident is already a source of concern for stakeholders in the food sector as they are expressing fears that if the ugly trend continues, there might be food crisis in the country.

In Kebbi State, over 500,000 hectares of farmlands were reported to have been destroyed by flood.

The Chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, Sani Dododo, who announced the incident said rice farms accounted for about 450,000 of the hectares while the remaining 50,000 were for other crops.

- Farmers narrate ordeal -

It was reported that farmers in Kebbi State lost over N5 billon to the flood.

A victim and female rice farmer in the state, Lubabatu Bunza, said she lost about 16,000 hectares to the recent flood in the state.

Also, Mallam Isa Ahman, another victim from Patigi LGA of Kwara State, said early last month, flood washed away about six hectares of his rice farm and four hectares of his maize farm.

The farmer said he obtained a loan from a commercial bank and invested on the farm, saying it would be difficult to repay the loan.

Many of the affected farmers in Kebbi and Niger states said they got their inputs from the Anchor Borrowers' Programme of the federal government and wondered how they would be able to repay the loans.

President of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Ibrahim Kabiru, said even though it would be difficult to ascertain the damages done to the farms by the flood across the country, the trend portents a great danger ahead.

He said the flood-affected rice, maize, sorghum and other crops in the affected states.

According to him, the situation was being worsened by the insecurity in the rural areas where the farms are located.

The farmers' leader had earlier warned that bandits were preventing farmers from accessing their farms, which he said was a dangerous pointer to food security.

Mr. Mathew Ajayi, a food security expert told Daily Trust on phone yesterday that already the country was nearing food crisis as this could be seen in the skyrocketing prices of food items across the country.

""It is obvious that we are approaching a serious food crisis considering the rising prices of food items across the country.

""And now look at the flood ravaging the farms' couple with the bandits chasing away farmers from their farms,"" he said.

Alhaji Muktar Umar, a farmer and local rice miller in Sabo-Wuse, Niger State, told Daily Trust on phone Wednesday that the country might experience serious rice crisis this year because of the flood incidence and security challenges threatening the farmers.

""From my experience as a farmer, I know many people go into rice farming this year but the farms are being washed away by the flood.

""Many farmers can no longer go to their farms now, most especially here in Niger State,"" he said.

- Buhari orders release of food items from reserves -

President Muhammadu Buhari said Wednesday that the flood disaster in Kebbi State had exposed the country to a major setback in the efforts to boost local food production.

Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed concerns over the heavy floods that took a number of lives, submerged thousands of hectares of farmlands and houses, destroying farm produce and personal belongings in the affected communities.

The president said: ""I am particularly sad over this incident because it is a setback to our efforts to boost local rice production as part of measures to stop food importation.

""Kebbi State is the focal point of our policy to produce rice locally as part of this administration's commitment to agricultural revival, which suffered relative neglect in favour of food importation.

""With the loss of six lives and still counting; thousands of hectares of land flooded and estimated economic losses of more than one billion naira by rice farmers in Kebbi State, we face a major setback in our efforts to boost local food production.

""This bad news couldn't have come at a worse time for our farmers and other Nigerians who looked forward to a bumper harvest this year in order to reduce the current astronomical rise in the costs of food items in the markets.""

The president, while sympathising with the bereaved families and farmers affected by the devastating floods, assured that ""we are going to work closely with the Kebbi State government in order to bring relief to the victims.""

In another statement yesterday by Shehu, Buhari expressed the concern of his administration about the sudden spiral of food prices at a time when the economy was already mired in a slowdown occasioned by the global coronavirus situation.

Buhari, however, assured Nigerians that the situation was transient.

He said his administration had already begun looking and putting in place measures to ameliorate the situation.

""While Providence has been kind to us with the rains and as such an expectation that a bumper harvest would lead to crashing of food prices and ease the burdens on the population, the government's concern is that the exploitative market behaviour by actors has significantly increased among traders in the past few years and may make any such relief a short-lived one.

""This year has indeed tested us in ways that globalisation has never been tested since the turn of the century.

""These challenges have disrupted lives and supply chains all over the world and Nigeria has not been spared.

""The effect has been deeply felt in the delays encountered in the procurement of raw materials for local production of fertilizer (damaging standing crops before harvest) and the speculative activities by a number of rice processors who are ready to pay for paddy at any price to keep their mills running non-stop.

""But of all these problems, the most worrisome is the activities of ""corrupt"" middlemen (with many of them discovered to be foreigners) and other food traders who serve as the link between farmers and consumers found to be systematically creating an artificial scarcity so that they can sell at higher prices.

""In dealing with these problems, the administration has, in line with its ease of doing business mantra, avoided imposing stockholding restrictions in order not to discourage investments in modern warehousing and cold storage.

""The president has just approved the release of food items from the strategic reserves, including 30,000 tons of maize to animal feeds producers to ease the high cost of poultry production.

""President Buhari's administration has raised some of these issues with the various food producer associations involved, particularly those of rice and other grains.

""With their cooperation, the high food prices should soon be a thing of the past.

""In addition, investments in the agro-allied sector by the private sector will significantly increase domestic production of farming inputs especially fertilizer, further crash prices, create employment and ease the pressure on our foreign reserves.

""One of these major investments is the Dangote Fertilizer plant, which is projected to come on stream by the 4th quarter of 2020,"" the president said.

- Experts suggest ways out -

The National President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Arc. Ibrahim Kabiru noted that to mitigate the effect of these calamities on the food system or food security, farmers should be encouraged to embark on full-scale dry season farming, which could lead to all-year-round farming

He advised that government should expand the nation's irrigable lands by investing more in water resources.

He also advised farmers to quickly plant alternative crops that require little time to mature in order to mitigate the crisis.

He said government at all levels could support such farmers with seeds and other inputs.

""Whereupon the time left for the rainy season cannot be sufficient for any crop, some form of compensation commensurate to the ascertained loss could be given to the affected farmers,"" he advised.

The farmer's leader urged his members to insure their farms, adding that the association is already working with National Agricultural Insurance Company (NAIC) to that all farmers insure their farms.

The women leader of the Kebbi State Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Lubabatu Usman Kamba suggested that the way out for some of the challenges was for the farmers to be provided with good knowledge of forecasting the planting season.

She said flooding has been the farmers' biggest nightmare, adding that they could only be addressed with good forecasting knowledge on when and where to plant the crops, which she said was currently lacking because of the near absence of extension service workers.","Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn05.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00540445:bd25877f5988946c2e238d58cdc5cf6e:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['farmers', 'niger', 'food', 'kebbi', 'security', 'floods', 'farms', 'prices', 'threatened', 'nigeria', 'destroy', 'rice', 'hectares', 'state']", ,flood
86,86,FL-2017-000126-NGA,"April 2021: Ninth-warmest April on record, NOAA and NASA report - Yale Climate Connections",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/05/april-2021-ninth-warmest-april-on-record-noaa-and-nasa-report/,"April 2021 was the ninth-warmest April since global record-keeping began in 1880, 0.79 degrees Celsius (1.42°F) above the 20th-century average, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, NCEI, reported May 13. NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europe’s coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Figure 1. Departure of temperature from average for April 2021, the ninth-warmest April for the globe since record keeping began in 1880. Record-warm April temperatures were limited to parts of southern South America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, as well as small parts of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. No portion of the globe was record-cold. (Image credit: NOAA/NCEI)

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

Francis Ighorurhie, aged 38, reportedly drowned on Thursday night at Kaiama Community in Kolokuma-Opokuma Council of Bayelsa State. Two Primary school pupils also drowned along Goodnews street in Azikoro Town in Yenagoa Council of the state.

It was gathered on Friday that Fr. Francis Ighorurhie, a Missionary of St. Paul (MSP) from Delta State, was until his death the Parish Priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church, Kaiama.

A priest, who spoke anonymously, said, “this is a sad moment for us. Father was on his way back from Bomadi in Delta State when he met his untimely death. But for the flood, he could have driven his car straight to his residence instead of parking same by the road.”

“It was as he was walking on the wooden bridge part of which had been submerged that he slipped and got drowned. Those staying at his residence had to raise alarm when they saw his car by the roadside and he was nowhere to be found.

“They however became suspicious when they saw a bag containing some provision floating on the water not far from the bridge. Divers were contracted and his remains were recovered.”

He added that his remains had been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa.

Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State government, yesterday, in a statement, sympathised with residents of the state over the impact of the rising flood, assuring that efforts are underway to mitigate its devastating effects on the people.

The state government, during its Eight Executive Council Meeting, presided over by the Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stressed that government is aware of the difficulties being experienced as a result of the flood, which has become a perennial problem due to climate change.

Speaking on behalf of the Governor, Ewhrudjakpo appealed to Bayelsans to exercise patience with the state government over the inconveniences being experienced as a result of the ongoing expansion of the Etegwe roundabout.","Sun, 18 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekiti-flood.jpg,"['saw', 'bayelsa', 'flood', 'residence', 'st', 'catholic', 'drowned', 'drown', 'remains', 'pupils', 'council', 'state', 'priest', 'result']", ,flood

90,90,FL-2017-000126-NGA,An Inland Delta Flooded - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147692/an-inland-delta-flooded,"Drought is a perennial problem in the semi-arid Sahel region of Africa. But in 2020, in Mali and other countries in West Africa, excessive rainfall has been the problem at times. Exceptionally heavy summer rains pushed seasonal floods on the Niger River and its inland delta to destructive levels.

After intense rains fell in July and August in the Guinea Highlands and overloaded many streams and rivers, it took several weeks for flood waters to work their way through the vast inland delta in central Mali. When the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured a natural-color image on October 29, 2020, water had spread widely across the nearly flat delta, which was once a lake bottom. Standing water appears black. Many flooded areas appear green because bourgou grass, rice, and other plants grow in the shallow flood waters. For comparison, the other image shows the dry landscape in May 2020, before the rains.

In late October, floodwaters reached their peak height at Mopti, a town at the confluence of the Niger and Bani Rivers. Water levels in the delta were recorded at 670 centimeters (22 feet) on October 26 and remained at that level until November 2, according to Mali’s National Directorate of Water Resources. That tied the peak water levels from 2018, the highest since 1969.

After November 2, waters receded at Mopti even as they continued to rise at points downstream such as Akka and Diré. It typically takes water a full six months from falling in the Guinea Highlands to reach the ocean at the Niger Delta in Nigeria. People watch the timing of flooding closely because it affects when rice can be grown, when fish will be available to catch, and when pastures can be ready for grazing. Water levels were expected to be low enough in mid-December 2020 for the annual cattle crossing on the Niger River at Diafarabé. In the much anticipated event, nomadic herders drive cattle across the river toward rich grazing lands in the inland delta and are reunited with their families after months apart.

While seasonal floods are common in Mali, the severity of the floods this year caused widespread damage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 1,160 homes were destroyed by flooding.

This is as the government has warned against heavy rainfall, flooding and possible flood disasters.

While making the disclosure through a signed statement, the Honorable Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said 23 million cubic meters of water will be released in October, which is the peak of the rainfall season.

READ:

Bello explained that the release of more water from the Oyan Dam, which will be the highest so far, is due to intensive rainfall over the past few days, expected to peak in the current month.

He, therefore, enjoined all residents of Agboyi-Ketu, Owode Onirin, Isheri, Ajegunle, Agiliti, Kara, Majidun and all areas bordering the rivers and the sea in Lagos to be wary of the staggered Oyan Dam release, adding that by November, a reduced release of 11million cubic meters will be affected as the intensity of the rainfall declines.

Bello pointed out that data provided by the Nigerian Hydrological Services noted that the months of July, August, September and October would be characterized by heavy rainfall, flooding and flood disasters in most parts of the country.

READ:

Reiterating that the reminder became necessary because the projected heavy rainfall, which had increased in September, would continue with high intensity this month leading to the staggered release of water from the dam, the Commissioner disclosed that Lagos is, however, intensifying measures to minimize the effect of the heavy rainfall on lives and property.

He averred that, in continuation of the preventive efforts against flooding by the State Government, work is almost completed on all the primary and secondary channels, stating that this is in addition to the efforts of the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) that are being deployed around the State to undertake quick fixes of clogged manholes or drains manually.

Bello said, “For a coastal city like Lagos, let me remind everyone that once it rains consistently for a minimum of eight hours, we are bound to have flash floods caused by the increasing inability of effective discharge into the lagoon, which is brought about by a rise in the ocean level. This will automatically lock up all our drainages and would be unable to discharge until the water level goes down.’’

“Flash floods are not peculiar to Lagos. It is the new wave in most coastal cities around the world, including those who have adopted the best of technological advancements to curtail flooding. Lagos is at the receiving end of three types of flooding, namely Coastal, Urban and River flooding because of the peculiarity of its location.”

While urging residents to adopt an attitudinal change by not dumping refuse in drainage channels and erecting structures on drainage alignments, Bello vowed that anyone caught violating the environmental laws of the State would be punished accordingly.

The Commissioner also emphasized that all residents owe the state a duty to support the efforts of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration to ensure that heavy rainfall does not wreak havoc in any part of the metropolis.","Mon, 05 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sanwo-olu.jpg?fit=900%2C618&ssl=1,"['residents', 'release', 'water', 'flooding', 'state', 'cautions', 'flood', 'lagos', 'disaster', 'warns', 'rainfall', 'dam', 'heavy', 'oyan']", ,none
92,92,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Reps to expand fire service operations - Punch Newspapers,https://punchng.com/reps-to-expand-fire-service-operations/,"The House of Representatives is considering an expansion of the scope of operations of the fire service to include accidents and emergency situations in the transport sector and at construction sites in the real estate sector.



When the bill becomes law, officers of the fire service who show gallantry will be specially rewarded.



This proposal is contained in the legislation titled ‘A Bill for an Act to Repeal the Fire Service Act, Cap. F29, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and Enact the Fire and Emergency Service Bill to Provide for Additional Powers for Effective Service Delivery; and for Related Matters.’



The bill passed second reading at the plenary on Tuesday.



Sponsor of the bill, Mr Adejoro Adeogun, while leading the debate for the second reading, said the proposal was to provide for additional powers and expansion of responsibilities of the fire service



He said, “The major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed, would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency. It would also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through engagement of able bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.



“Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources.”



Adeogun noted that the Fire Service Act (1963) saddled the Fire Service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies.



“This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and such other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required,” he said.



The lawmaker added, “This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.



“This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.”



The lawmaker listed the specific goals of the bill, saying it is to “prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters.”



He added that it would “encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by states, local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies.



“Establish the Office of the Fire and Emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the fire and emergency service.



“Empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilise resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies.



“Provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officers.”","Wed, 19 May 2021 08:43:56 GMT",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/19155231/Reps.fw_.png,"['flooding', 'service', 'construction', 'collapse', 'accidents', 'operations', 'scope', 'related', 'bill', 'reps', 'disasters', 'expand', 'emergency']", ,none

The Director-General of FEMA, Idriss Abbas, made the call in a statement on Sunday.

He said most of the deaths recorded in the past from flood in the FCT were as a result of non-compliance to instructions and early warnings.

Mr Abbas, therefore, emphasised the need for residents to adhere to instructions and early warnings from relevant authorities.

He added that attitudinal change was the key to reducing disasters to the barest minimum in the FCT.

He disclosed that the Search and Rescue team of the agency recently discovered the body of one Garba Joseph, 43-year-old from Akoka-Edo of Edo State, after two days search from a flooded river around TradeMoore Estate, Lugbe, in Abuja

“Narrating the incident, an eye witness account (one of FEMA’s volunteer/vanguard Kenneth Chima) who captured the incident on video explained that they were four men that tried walking through the water.

“And I kept warning them to go back, three of them went back but only this man insisted on crossing, unfortunately the water overpowered him and washed him away,” he said.

He decried the increasing rate of flood in the FCT due to residents’ apathy towards the government’s directives and early warnings.

“This is also despite FEMA’s consistent sensitisations based on The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) predictions of torrential rainfall and dangers of flooding.“

He said NIHSA’s most recent predictions warned of torrential rainfall and flooding from August, adding that FEMA had carried out aggressive sensitisation to educate residents on ways to prevent the impending flood.

He said FEMA was conducting sensitisation programmes in five different indigenous languages in the FCT using different media channels.

“We recently organized a meeting with our Volunteers, Vangards and Divers from all the area Councils within the FCT to educate them on how they can sensitise their people on how to prevent disasters to minimize loss of lives and properties.

“We also embarked on community to community flood sensitisation campaigns in the FCT and mounted billboards at all the flood prone points warning off and cautioning residents from these danger areas.”

The DG, who reiterated the agency’s commitment to reducing disasters to a barest minimum in the FCT, called on residents to complement the efforts of the FCT Administration by doing the needful.

He also advised residents not to underestimate the strength of water when it was flooded.

“What we are experiencing now is flash flood, the water builds up speedily and comes unnoticed hence very dangerous,” he said.

He called on community and religious leaders to take responsibility of sensitising their subjects, especially those who are living close to flood prone areas to move to higher grounds to avoid being washed away by flood.

He said that relevant authorities have been on their toes evacuating refuse around the FCT, distilling drainages and expanding narrow water channels to enable free flow of water for a safer FCT.

94,94,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Agency warns states contiguous to River Niger to brace up for impending flood - Guardian Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/news/agency-warns-states-contiguous-to-river-niger-to-brace-up-for-impending-flood/,"As River Niger reaches red alert

Following warning alert received from the Niger Basin Authority indicating that River Niger has reached Red alert of 6.60m the Nigerian Hydrological Service Agency has warned states contiguous to the Niger River to brace up for impending flood disaster.

The agency warned that It is expected that the flood magnitude sighted in Niamey, Niger Republic on the 23rd August 2020 would arrive Nigeria through Kebbi state on the 6th of September and flood other states contiguous to River Niger including Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa

NHSA Director General Engr Clement Nze in a press statement made available to journalists yesterday explained that he River Niger Basin which covers nine (9) countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, has Nigeria at the lowest portion of the Basin, meaning that that once the upper catchment of the Basin gets flooded, Nigeria should be prepared to experience flooding incident.

He said “As at today, the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin made up of Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso and part of Mali, have been flooded. The flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malanville (Benin Republic) have gotten to the Red Alert Zone”

Nze pointed out that Operators of Kainji and Jebba Dams have long been alerted to take appropriate measures in the operation of the reservoirs and accordingly, Kainji Dam is now spilling water at the rate of 1,000 m3/s that is 86.4 million cubic metres/day, saying this means that communities downstream Kainji and Jebba Dams could be flooded while Shiroro Dam on Kaduna River is still impounding, though there is the possibility of spilling water in the weeks ahead.

On River Benue sub-basin, the DG stated that the agency has maintained close contact with the Cameroonian authorities with regards to flood scenarios in the upper catchment of the sub-basin and Information received by NIHSA from the relevant authority in Cameroon stated that the Lagdo Dam is still impounding water.

He noted that the high intensity of rainfall during the last week of August has already saturated the soil and any rainfall of high intensity with long duration would translate into flooding in most part of the country.

He revealed that So far, Urban/Flash Flood has wrecked havocs in about 70 council areas in 20 states of the federation and the FCTof the Federation, including the FCT.

The NHSA boss recalled that the year 2020 Annual Flood Outlook predicted that some parts of at least 102 LGAs in 28 States fall within the Highly Probable Flood Risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 States of the Federation, including the FCT, fall within the Moderately Probable Flood Risk areas. The remaining 397 LGAs fall within the Low Probable Flood Risks areas.

It also warned The states that are contiguous to rivers Niger and Benue, namely: – Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa are likely to be affected by river flooding, while Coastal flooding is expected in Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, and Bayelsa States.

On account of poor drainage systems, flash and urban floods are expected to occur in major cities across the country, namely Birnin–Kebbi, Sokoto, Lokoja, Kaduna, Suleja, Gombe, Yola, Makurdi, Abuja, Lafia, Asaba, Port Harcourt, Yenagoa, Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Benin City, Oshogbo, Ado-Ekiti, Abakaliki, Awka, Nsukka.

The DG warned that the country still has many days of rainfall in the course of the year and More floods are expected in the months of August, September and October this year, in the event there is release of excess water from the Dams in other countries upstream rivers Niger and Benue this year, this will have more negative impacts on Nigeria which is located downstream other countries in the Niger Basin.

He urged that to prevent flood disaster,

blocked drainages and gutters should be cleared, river channels dredged and structures within the waterways and floodplains and flood paths pulled down.","Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-74.jpeg,"['river', 'world', 'flooding', 'flood', 'impending', 'expected', 'states', 'guardian', 'warned', 'nigeria', 'rivers', 'niger', 'contiguous', 'basin', 'warns']", ,flood
95,95,FL-2017-000126-NGA,"Nearly 80% of Nigerian farmers affected by floods, drought in 2020 — Report - Premium Times",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/agriculture/agric-news/436380-nearly-80-of-nigerian-farmers-affected-by-floods-drought-in-2020-report.html,"About 79 per cent of Nigerian farmers were estimated to have been affected by the ravaging effects of drought and flooding in 2020, a survey conducted in seven states of the country has shown.

The analysis by SBMIntel, an Africa focused research firm, revealed that the harvests of 26.3 per cent of Nigerian farmers were greatly affected by extreme weather conditions.

It said 52.60 per cent ”were somewhat affected and a fifth (21.1 per cent) were not affected by drought and flooding in the year under review.”

The survey, titled: “Nigerians just want to eat” and published this month, chronicled the major challenges bedevilling Nigerian farmers and food transporters which are capable of impeding national food security.

Survey

Data for the survey were sampled from seven Nigerian states, namely; Nasarawa, Osun, Benue, Oyo, Katsina, Ogun and Lagos.

Of the seven states surveyed, the report noted that the majority of the respondents (farmers) had their farms in the South-west States (73.7 per cent)—Lagos (36.8 per cent ), Oyo (21.1 per cent ) and Ogun (15.8 per cent ) .

Meanwhile, 10.5 per cent of the respondents had their farms in Benue and the remaining 15.9 per cent were equally distributed between Nasarawa, Osun and Katsina states respectively.

The farmers surveyed were mostly crop farmers who grew a wide range of staples with fruits, vegetables, cassava and maize farmers in the majority, the report noted.

Scourge

According to the survey, extreme climatic events such as flooding and drought witnessed in some states within the country triggered the negative effects being noticed on the prices of staple foods.

It said flooding in Nigeria was experienced in the north, mostly in states like Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara, and some parts of Kwara.

“In fact, in Kebbi alone, 500,000 hectares of farmland were destroyed by flooding, with the cost being upward of N5 billion,” the report said.

Also, it stated that the problem that faced farmers in the South-western region was the lack of rainfall experienced during the mid-planting season last year.

“Last year, the ‘August break’ actually began in early July and lasted through till the end of August. This prevented the planting of maize, cassava and cash crops like cocoa,” the survey added.

According to the survey, ”more than half of the farmers engaged had no irrigation system, even when they believed that it will help greatly in their farming endeavours.”

It said 57.90 per cent of the respondents said ”they do not own any irrigation system that could help complement the absence of rainfall when asked if they have, only 42.10 per cent had”.

”However, about 94.7 per cent of the respondents agreed to a large extent that an irrigation system would help their farming system while 10.5 per cent said it would only help to a small extent and 5.3 per cent said to no extent,” it added.

The survey said most farmers are getting discouraged over their inability to own irrigation systems or the technology of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) to support crops during adverse weather conditions.

Recommendations

In order to mitigate the challenges being faced by these farmers and food transporters, the report recommends that both state and federal governments adopt ”wider irrigation systems and as well facilitate the provision of early maturing and drought-resistant crop varieties.”

“Switching to climate-smart agriculture is the best way to guard against crop failure and poor yields,” the survey reads in part.

The report said respondents asked the government to fix access roads and provide adequate transportation that is cheap, effective and efficient.

“An efficient rail system will reduce the cost of transporting farm produce to the markets and improve food security. Security remains paramount followed by access to land and irrigation infrastructure,” the report quoted the farmers to have said.","Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/06/IMG-20200628-WA0015-e1593352816374.jpg?fit=970%2C436&ssl=1,"['farmers', 'flooding', 'survey', '2020', 'floods', 'cent', 'states', 'irrigation', 'respondents', 'system', '80', 'nigerian', 'affected', 'nearly', 'report', 'drought']", ,flood

The comparison rankles supporters of Israel but the growing Palestinian Boycott, Disinvestment and Sanctions movement draws on the struggle to isolate racist South Africa Pro-Palestinian supporters hold placards reading ‘Boycott Apartheid Israel’ during a protest to condemn the ongoing Israeli air strikes on Gaza, in Durban, South Africa, this week. Photograph: Rajesh Jantilal/AFP/Getty Images Ask an older generation of white South Africans when they first felt the bite of anti-apartheid sanctions, and some point to the moment in 1968 when their prime minister, BJ Vorster, banned a tour by the England cricket team because it included a mixed-race player, Basil D’Oliveira. After that, South Africa was excluded from international cricket until Nelson Mandela walked free from prison 22 years later. The D’Oliveira affair, as it became known, proved a watershed in drumming up popular support for the sporting boycott that eventually saw the country excluded from most international competition including rugby, the great passion of the white Afrikaners who were the base of the ruling Nationalist party and who bitterly resented being cast out. For others, the moment of reckoning came years later, in 1985 when foreign banks called in South Africa’s loans. It was a clear sign that the country’s economy was going to pay an ever higher price for apartheid. Neither of those events was decisive in bringing down South Africa’s regime. Far more credit lies with the black schoolchildren who took to the streets of Soweto in 1976 and kicked off years of unrest and civil disobedience that made the country increasingly ungovernable until changing global politics, and the collapse of communism, played its part. But the rise of the popular anti-apartheid boycott over nearly 30 years made its mark on South Africans who were increasingly confronted by a repudiation of their system. Ordinary Europeans pressured supermarkets to stop selling South African products. British students forced Barclays Bank to pull out of the apartheid state. The refusal of a Dublin shop worker to ring up a Cape grapefruit led to a strike and then a total ban on South African imports by the Irish government. By the mid-1980s, one in four Britons said they were boycotting South African goods – a testament to the reach of the anti-apartheid campaign. By then it was well entrenched in universities as one of the great left causes of the day, alongside the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and support for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. The musicians union blocked South African artists from playing on the BBC, and the cultural boycott saw most performers refusing to play in the apartheid state, although some, including Elton John and Queen, infamously put on concerts at Sun City in the Bophuthatswana homeland.

Photograph: Clive Limpkin/Getty Images The US didn’t have the same sporting or cultural ties, and imported far fewer South African products, but the mobilisation against apartheid in universities, churches and through local coalitions in the 1980s was instrumental in forcing the hand of American politicians and big business in favour of financial sanctions and divestment. By the time President FW de Klerk was ready to release Mandela and negotiate an end to apartheid, a big selling point for part of the white population was an end to boycotts and isolation. Twenty-seven years after the end of white rule, some see the boycott campaign against South Africa as a guide to mobilising popular support against what is increasingly condemned as Israel’s own brand of apartheid. As South Africa showed, building popular support for action takes years – and those who back the campaign face a far more effective opponent in the Israeli state. For all that, significant shifts in attitudes toward Israel, particularly in the US and within the Jewish diaspora, have presented campaigners with their best prospects to date for building a boycott and they are looking to the anti-apartheid movement as the example. One of the most important changes is the breaking of the taboo on comparisons with South Africa’s racist system. Israel’s leading human rights group, B’Tselem, issued a report in January called: “A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea: This is apartheid”. Human Rights Watch in the US followed in April, accusing Israel of “crimes of apartheid”. For years, Israel and its supporters have dismissed claims of similarities as antisemitic on the grounds they imply that the Jewish state is a racist enterprise. Israel continues to claim to the outside world that the occupation is temporary, even as it entrenches control ever more deeply, and that the Palestinians only have themselves to blame for failing to negotiate their way to an independent state.But the increasing focus on campaigns for racial justice in the US has contributed to a shift in focus from arguments about two states to abuses of individual human rights. *** The anti-apartheid boycott movement had credibility in good part because it was called for by South Africans even if it never had universal support among the country’s black population, in part over fear of loss of jobs. The African National Congress president, Albert Luthuli, made the call in 1958. The following year the Boycott Movement, later renamed the Anti-Apartheid Movement, was launched in London. Among the speakers was Julius Nyerere, future president of newly independent Tanzania. “We are not asking you, the British people, for anything special. We are just asking you to withdraw your support from apartheid by not buying South African goods,” he said. “The South African government is fighting against history and they are bound to lose. We know that the liberation struggle will triumph in South Africa. If you have confidence then we are going to win!” Nyerere was right. But it took another 30 years. Palestinians walk next to a giant statue of Nelson Mandela in the West Bank city of Ramallah in March. Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images The Palestinian campaign, the boycott, divestment, sanctions (BDS) movement, is not led by political leaders but civil society, which does not have the same standing in the kind of international forums where the ANC had leverage. On the face of it, that is a weakness. But the absence of the ageing and compromised Palestinian Authority leadership has opened the way for a younger generation usually much better at communicating how the Palestinian experience fits with growing global demands for racial justice. Add to that the wave of protests by a new generation of Palestinians inside Israel and the occupied territories, united by anger at two systems built on discrimination. White South Africa’s apologists, who included conservative politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, cast the ANC as a violent anti-democratic movement and a front for the Soviet Union. Britain’s rightwing tabloids looked around other parts of the African continent and asked why South Africa was being picked on when Idi Amin’s Uganda was so much worse. But millions of ordinary people saw through that for what apartheid was – a crime against the humanity of every South African subjected to its racist laws and practices.Israel has worked hard to keep the focus on Hamas and it routinely disparages critics by asking why they are “singling out” the Jewish state when its Arab neighbours are less democratic and more oppressive. But the events of recent weeks have shown the extent to which that tactic is increasingly ineffective, particularly amid international criticism of the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes to make way for Jews in East Jerusalem. By the 1980s anti-apartheid was one of the great left causes of the day alongside the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and support for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, as seen at this rally in Trafalgar Square. Photograph: David O’neill/Associated New/Rex And while Israel claims the BDS movement has no credibility and little support, its actions suggest it believes something else. Pro-Israel groups have worked hard to persuade US states to pass anti-boycott laws and to codify the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, with its ambiguous examples of when criticism of Israel is unacceptable. The long and terrible history of boycotts of Jews, particularly in Europe, adds a dimension to the campaign that South Africans did not have to consider. But it is no longer enough in itself to dismiss sanctions outright as too reminiscent of the 1930s.A group of more than 200 Holocaust scholars around the world has pushed back with with the Jerusalem Declaration which said that comparisons between Israel and apartheid, and calls for a boycott, are not in themselves antisemitic. Netanyahu has not helped himself by allying with Donald Trump or the far right in Europe such as the Hungarian president, Viktor Orbán, who has long trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories. Still, the challenges for the boycott movement are clear. Fifa – world soccer’s governing body – rejected demands for action over six Israeli league teams based in Jewish settlements on the grounds that the issue was too “political” . Which points to popular action leading the way, as happened against South African apartheid.

Argentina’s players voted to boycott the game. Photograph: Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty Images In echoes of the cultural boycott of South Africa, actors and film-makers have refused to play in Israel. Some called for the Eurovision Song Contest to be withdrawn from Tel Aviv in 2019. The New Zealand singer Lorde cancelled a concert in the city three years ago after fans urged her to join the artistic boycott of Israel. A pro-Israel group placed an advert in the Washington Post calling her a “bigot”. Three years ago Argentina cancelled a World Cup warm-up match with Israel after the players voted to boycott the game. The appearance of Palestinian flags at English Premier League and FA Cup matches in recent days suggests there is support for such action. It is an even larger challenge to persuade big business to show its disapproval of Israeli policies. Yet even in the face of pressure from Trump, parts of the American private sector stood against further restrictions on voting rights in the US and pulled funding for Republicans who backed the mob that stormed the Capitol in January. The movement also has important friends, among them black South Africans who were at the forefront of the struggle against apartheid. On Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa, a trade union leader who led the ANC’s negotiations with the white regime, said the forced removal of Palestinians to make way for Israeli settlers and the destruction of homes in Gaza “brings back very terrible memories of our own history and apartheid”. “This, for us, is very close to our own suffering under apartheid. When we see those images, we can’t but help to side with the Palestinians,” he said. • Chris McGreal was the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent from 2002 for four years after being based in Johannesburg since 1990","Fri, 21 May 2021 16:09:32 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Fy9KtD59qBfL3Wpu3pJEMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwMDA7aD0xMTI1/https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/21/60a7db3eb2bd3f477d72db73/60a7db3eb2bd3f477d72db74_o_U_v2.jpg,"['japan', 'south', 'african', 'israel', 'bbc', 'movement', 'vaccines', 'mrna', 'royal', 'ceasefire', 'campaign', 'africa', 'slammed', 'support', 'apartheid', 'antiapartheid', 'hamas', 'boycott', 'family']", ,flood

Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

Pictures and videos later posted online showed dramatic and even bizarre scenes of flooding in the city, including the capture of a crocodile in the floodwater. Another video, which went viral, was one of a man kayaking in floodwater on one of the streets.

Lagos has not been alone. Suleija, a town near the capital city Abuja hundreds of kilometres away, suffered its own flooding challenge in early July. Heavy rains washed houses away and caused others to collapse, trapping occupants. Thirteen people were reported to have died.

The two primary factors of flooding in Nigeria are climate change and poor urban planning.

Some of the worst flooding in recent memory happened five years ago in March 2012 when 32 of Nigeria’s 36 states were affected, 24 severely. More than 360 people were killed and almost two million people were displaced.

The seriousness of the flooding was attributed to a combination of two events: very heavy local rainfall and the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in nearby Cameroon.

Although the degree and seriousness of flooding in Nigeria fluctuates, flooding remains a recurring phenomenon in most parts of the country. The first factor aggravating flooding is climate change, which has been shown to contribute to more extreme storms and rainfall. Another factor contributing to flooding in cities is that Nigeria has experienced rapid urban growth and planning is poor.

The problem of flooding is not peculiar to Nigeria alone. In 2007, floods affected 1.5 million people across several countries in Africa, including Uganda, Sudan, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and Niger. Alluvial flooding is common for major rivers—such as Nile, Niger, Benue, Orange, Zambezi—in Africa. Major cities in Africa are also susceptible to fluvial flooding which occurs when excessive rainfall, over an extended period of time, causes rivers to overflow.

Why Nigeria suffers

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria (1978 to 2007) suggests that rainstorms are getting more intense. The data show that there are fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed much from previous decades. This means that more rain is falling on the days that there is rain, which in turn means that rain storms in the city are getting more intense, increasing the threat of flooding.

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria suggests rainstorms are getting more intense with fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed.

In addition to more intense rain storms, the other possible cause of flooding in coastal regions is rising sea levels. Although up-to-date data on the rising sea levels in Nigeria are scarce, it’s believed that if nothing is done, this is likely to aggravate flooding in the future, particularly in coastal cities.

Areas at risk include Lagos, which is on the coast, as well as the Niger Delta region which has many low-lying towns and villages. Being on the coast also makes these places more susceptible to storm surges. While these areas are no stranger to floods, evidence suggests that floods have become increasingly common and intense in recent times.

In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the adjoining states. The changes in rainfall patterns, particularly in frequency and intensity, have meant that these events have begun to happen more frequently.

In Nigeria’s cities, the most common cause of flooding after excessive rains is poor drainage systems that can’t cope. This is called pluvial flooding. Lagos provides a good case study.

Lagos as a case study

Lagos has been urbanizing rapidly. By some estimates there will be 19 million in the city by 2050, making it the 11th most populous city in the world. It is also home to most of the country’s industrial, commercial and non-oil operations.

Urbanisation and industrialisation increase the number of roads and buildings. This in turn increases the proportion of surface area where water cannot be absorbed into the ground, leading to rapid runoff which then causes flooding during storms. And in cities that manage their infrastructure well, storm water drainage systems are built so that water can be directed to rivers efficiently and quickly.

Lagos has not kept up with its infrastructure needs. The growth and expansion of the city has been largely unregulated. The has resulted in inadequate and poor housing, the development of slum areas and inadequate water supply and waste disposal, among other problems.

What’s complicated the situation for Lagos is that many parts of the city were originally low-lying mangrove swamps and wetlands, which have been reclaimed and settled, mostly by poorer communities and more recently through concerted efforts by the government.

These low-lying areas are particularly at risk of flooding, and the situation is complicated by buildings being constructed on water ways, and bad waste dumping habits which block the drains.

Up to 70% of the population of Lagos live in slums.

What must be done

It’s clear Nigeria needs to take measures to cope with flooding. This will require both local and international interventions, and could include early warning and rapid response systems, flood data gathering and modelling, proper urban and spatial planning, flood emergency preparedness and political will.

The country can learn from others. For example, in Mumbai, India various measures have been implemented to reduce the impact of flooding. These have included an emergency control centre, automated weather stations, removal of solid waste from stormwater drains and the development of emergency response mechanisms. Nigeria must invest in these measures, and sustain them.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos by Dallas County Police DepartmentDALLAS—After the kidnapping and killing of 4-year-old Cash Gernon in Dallas last week, neighbor Jose Alvarado checked his security cameras for any footage that might help investigators.What he found sent a chill up his spine.The video is from 10 weeks before little Cash was left dead of stab wounds on the ground. But it shows the teenager charged with abducting him, Darriynn Brown, skulking down the street, opening Alvarado’s backyard gate and peering in before quickly walking away.“It’s really scary,” Alvarado told The Daily Beast. “I have two kids, one girl and one boy, and they play basketball in the backyard.”Alvarado’s house shares a back alley with the home of Monica Sherrod, 35, who was taking care of Cash and his twin, Carter. She has said she was dating the twins’ father, Trevor Gernon, a 31-year-old construction worker, until he reportedly left town in March when a court ordered him to report to rehab.That left Sherrod to care for the boys for the next two months—unbeknownst to their mother, Melinda Seagroves, who lives in Houston.Early on the morning of May 15, a young man crept into the twins’ bedroom, lifted a still-sleeping Cash out of the toddler bed he shared with Carter, and walked out—a chilling scene captured in grainy black and white by a baby monitor.The footage, obtained by the Daily Mail, shows the intruder returning about two hours later, hovering over the bed where Carter remained in slumber, before abruptly leaving as though he was startled by something.By then, Cash was already dead.Antwainese Square, a Dallas teacher who lives in the area, was out for her morning walk around 6:45 a.m. when she saw a clump of hair on the ground she thought belonged to a dog.“I was on the phone with my mom,” Square told The Daily Beast. “As I got closer, I could see an arm and a foot and I just began crying, saying, ‘Mom, I think I'm coming up on a body.’ And I started, ‘Mommy, it’s a child! It’s a child!’ And the baby had blood all over his face. At that point, my mom told me to get off the phone with her and immediately call 911… The baby had ants all over the bottom of his feet. So I pretty much knew that he was gone.”Square said she remembers “being in denial,” and hoped Cash was actually just sleeping even though he was obviously dead. “I was just trying to put together all possible stories; there was no way in my mind that I would think somebody would do that to a kid,” she said, adding that she stayed with Cash’s body until police and paramedics arrived so no one would run over him.“One couple that was leaving out of their garage, I had to stop them to let them know that this baby was on the ground,” Square said.More than three hours later, Sherrod reported Cash missing. “The day that he was missing, I got up late and thought it was weird,” Sherrod would later tell the Daily Mail. “I was like, ‘It's 10 o'clock already, you guys.’ So I figured Cash was still in bed.” Cash Gernon was abducted out of his bed on May 15. Handout Later that day, police arrested Brown, 18, who lives with his parents about a half-mile from where Cash’s body was found, according to court documents. He was charged with kidnapping and burglary, but not murder because police said they are waiting for the result of forensic tests.Held in lieu of $1.5 million bail, Brown could not be reached for comment and does not have a lawyer listed in court records. His mother, Mimi, has told reporters that she believes her son is being framed.A tangled web of relationships, criminal records, and an unknown motive hangs over the case.Sherrod, the mother of several children, has a criminal record that includes assault and DWI. Trevor Gernon, who has an extensive rap sheet, appears to have vanished; a phone number listed under his name was disconnected. Darriynn Brown, meanwhile, is reportedly a friend of one of Sherrod’s children and had been seen playing with children in Sherrod’s care.Sherrod initially characterized any relationship she or her kids had with Brown, who attended the same high school as at least one of the boys living in her house, as minimal. She later told a reporter that Brown had visited her home two days before Cash’s murder, but she was out grocery shopping at the time.According to multiple neighbors, Brown was definitely not an unfamiliar face around the neighborhood. One told The Daily Beast the teen regularly played football and basketball with some of the kids who lived with Sherrod. Others said they had spotted Brown on their Ring security cameras hanging out in the area.Little information has emerged about Seagroves, who now has custody of Carter. Seagroves did not respond to multiple interview requests, but her mother, Connie Ward, told The Daily Beast this week: “We are not ready to give any kind of statement. My family is broken. It has been a nightmare listening and watching the news about our baby and stories being reported that are false.”Seagroves does not appear to have had any brushes with the law, but court records show both Sherrod and Gernon have records that include arrests for assaulting their own parents.In 2013, Sherrod pleaded guilty to attacking her mother, Lezlee Pinkerton. According to a criminal affidavit signed by Officer Glenn Burkheimer-Lubeck of the Harris County Constable’s Office, Sherrod “intentionally struck” Pinkerton in the head and chest with her hand and pulled her to the ground, then “cause[d] bodily injury” to Pinkerton “by stomping on [Pinkerton’s] toes with her feet.”“Complainant reports that she believes her toes are broken,” the affidavit says. Sherrod was sentenced to two years of community supervision, participation in a domestic violence treatment program, a $100 donation to a family violence center, and a $200 fine.In 2018, Gernon was arrested by deputies from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office for assaulting his father, Roger Gernon, during a dispute over a credit card bill, Texas court records show. When Roger Gernon told his son that he was going to call the police, Trevor grabbed the phone away, bloodied his dad’s arm with his fingernails, and elbowed him in the chest. Charged with misdemeanor assault and interference with an emergency telephone call, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 68 days in county jail.In addition to the assault of family members, both Sherrod and Gernon have a history of theft, fraud, and drug possession.Sherrod’s most recent arrest was for DWI; she has also pleaded guilty to identity fraud charges, meth possession, driving without a license, and misdemeanor theft.Gernon’s most recent arrest was for the possession of narcotics in 2020. He was previously charged for possession of methamphetamine in 2016. His rap sheet includes a range of other crimes.Neal Flanagan, who co-owns a corrosion-proofing business, told The Daily Beast he met Gernon in high school, then reconnected in 2016. He gave Gernon a bit of work because he was struggling. Then things went sideways.“My ex-wife and I were married at the time,” said Flanagan. “We had started having issues. She separated from me in January 2017. That’s when Trevor and her started seeing each other.”“I never did see him after,” said Flanagan. “A couple years later, he messaged me on Facebook. Like, ‘Hey buddy. How you been?’ Like nothing ever happened.""When he was sober, Gernon “was as good as you could ask for,” Neal’s father, Johnny Flanagan, said. But he added that he wasn’t surprised Gernon took off without his boys.“He's one of these guys that kind of goes whichever way the wind blows, you know, and he'll do good for several months and then do bad for several months and you know, just up and disappear,” Flanagan said.Gernon’s whereabouts are unknown. Following his indictment on felony drug possession charges last November, he failed to appear for a March 29, 2021, hearing and thus forfeited a $10,000 bond payment. There is now an open warrant out for his arrest.None of the various defense lawyers who represented Sherrod or Gernon in court agreed to speak, citing attorney-client privilege.Cash’s death has raised many questions about those responsible for him. But in the neighborhood where he spent his last months, the overriding mystery is why would someone kill a defenseless child and leave him on the street like trash. Steven Monacelli The solidly working-class Mountain Creek section of Dallas is a quiet place, bordered on one side by the 600-acre Cedar Ridge nature preserve. Houses are in decent shape, and yards are clean. On the street where Cash’s body was found, locals have been stopping at a shrine to leave toys, flowers, and other mementos.The woman who found Cash’s body, meanwhile, has been struggling with her emotions since that morning.“It's been difficult. It really has been difficult,” Square told The Daily Beast.“I have a 3-year-old and as we're dealing with this and processing this, I'm learning that I have little triggers. If I see a little boy, 4, 3, 5, I will burst out crying. It’s just a trigger for me. My own daughter is like a trigger. Sometimes she'll say something and I'll cry.“Because even though I didn't know that baby, he was just robbed of his life. So, it's been really hard. It's been really hard to just process this. And no matter how much you try to move on, you can't unsee what you saw.”Rohrlich reported from New York and Monacelli from DallasRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?
