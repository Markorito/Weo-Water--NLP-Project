The lack of rain, which is also affecting neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia, and political instability have tipped Somalia into a food crisis that could persist, even as drought conditions abate.

Image courtesy United Nations A malnourished child waits for emergency medical assistance from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), an active regional peacekeeping mission operated by the African Union with the approval of the United Nations. Somalia is the country worst affected by a severe drought that has ravaged large swaths of the Horn of Africa, leaving an estimated 11 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.

Vulnerability to diseases is also of grave concern – according to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR, hundreds of Somali children are dying from a combination of acute malnutrition and measles.

More than half of Somalia’s population is now suffering from lack of food as famine spreads to the Bay region of the country, where food production has fallen 82 percent, according to Voice of America. The famine — officially declared in July — is due in part to a La Niña-induced drought that first hit the Horn of Africa in 2010 and has continued into 2011.

The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon consisting of El Niño and La Niña cycles, and, according to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), although ENSO is naturally occurring, a warming climate may contribute to an increase in the frequency and intensity of El Niño cycles. This cycle is being classified as a moderate-to-strong La Niña, following 2009’s especially intense El Niño year.

La Niña is characterized by colder-than-normal water surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, causing heavy rains in Australia, Southeast Asia, and South America, while causing drought conditions in eastern Africa.

While drought still prevails in the region, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has reported that there should be near normal rainfall in the Horn of Africa by the end of this year. Though there is still the possibility of another La Niña, it is expected to be weaker than the current cycle. Either way — whether next year there is no La Niña, or just a weakened one — drought conditions will likely ease in the coming months, according to Voice of America.

The weakening of the drought, however, does not necessarily spell the end of the famine.

Food — if it becomes available — is difficult to distribute, and this is the challenge facing aid organizations, which have not lacked supplies as much as the means to get those supplies to people in need. Additionally, Somalia is still in a state of conflict, which will have a great influence on the future of its food supplies. The country’s government, though internationally recognized, is weak and opposed by a number of groups, including the Islamist al-Shabaab, which controls much of the country that has been hit hardest by the famine, the Guardian reported.

The political instability — and resulting inefficiency — also contributed to creating the crisis in the first place, WMO climate expert Rupa Kumar Kolli told Voice of America. Kolli said that meteorologists predicted the drought well in advance and warned policy makers in the affected countries, but they got little response because weather and climate information is often not taken seriously.

“Famines are man-made, whereas droughts are natural parts of the system,” Kolli said.

Government policies encouraging agricultural practices that better utilize water resources will be key to future food security in the Horn of Africa’s arid regions. According to Jeff Hill, director for policy at USAid, this means investing in pastoral livestock farmers, the Guardian reported.

“Livestock provides more food security than growing crops in many arid and semi-arid areas,” Hill said.

Unlike crops, livestock can be moved to water during the dry season’ but, currently, farmers often cannot move their herds freely, sometimes due to cultural and international borders, as was the case earlier this year in a dispute between two ethnic groups on either side of the Ethiopia-Kenya border. If they were allowed to follow the water, rural farmers could become more resistant to drought and famine.

1,1,DR-2011-000121-CHN,On Yunnan’s chromium trail - chinadialogue,https://chinadialogue.net/en/pollution/4493-on-yunnan-s-chromium-trail/,"In mid-August, the Yunnan-based blogger Dong Rubin revealed that a nearby factory in south-west China – Luliang Chemicals – had dumped 5,000 tonnes of toxic chromium tailings on a hillside in the township of Yuezhou. The resulting water pollution killed fish and livestock, endangered the drinking water of tens of millions of people and attracted widespread media attention across China.

Speaking to Guangzhou’s Yangcheng Evening News, Dong explained the impact of the pollution incident: “At its highest, the most toxic type of chromium, hexavalent chromium, was 2,000 times over the limit. Contaminated water was flowing directly into the Nanpan River, which feeds the Pearl River.” The Pearl River is an important source of drinking water for the downstream city of Guangzhou.

Globalisation has moved chemical production towards China and has turned the country into the world’s largest producer of chromium tailings – a waste product of chemical processes. Chromium and its various compounds have a wide range of uses: major ones include electroplating, drug manufacture and textile dyes. According to Ministry of Commerce statistics, 10% of all manufactured products involves chromium at some point.

A long history

Chromium is a major heavy metal pollutant found in surface water in China, where it often becomes hexavalent chromium, identified as genotoxic and carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO). It can be absorbed by humans through inhalation, digestion and skin contact. Pollution from chromium slag has occurred in the Chinese provinces of Jilin, Liaoning and Qinghai.

In 1992 a truck overturned in north-east China near the border with North Korea, spilling 1.5 tonnes of sodium dichromate – of which hexavalent chromium is a major part – polluting groundwater and poisoning 37 people.

After the recent news of chromium pollution in Yunnan, media investigations revealed that this was not a new problem – at least for local people. The website Yunnan.cn quoted residents of the village of Yangqiying as saying that trucks had been dumping “dark soil” since March, after which sheep started to die off, tobacco leaves grew mottled and white shirts washed in well water turned yellow. The villagers made a complaint to the local environmental authorities on June 12.

The official probe into the incident found that, starting in April this year, two truck drivers from Xingyi Sanli Fuel, in a bid to cut costs, had dumped over 140 truckloads of tailings in Luliang county’s Qilin district: one in Ciying village, 40 in Sanbao township and more than 100 in Yuezhou. In total, they dumped over 5,200 tonnes of chromium tailings.

But a reporter from New Express continued the investigation and looked through the local environmental protection bureau’s records of inspections at Luliang Chemicals. The reporter found that on six of seven visits between January 28 and July 25 this year, the bureau had recorded problems with the way chromium was handled. Further revelations came in a broadcast of CCTV’s News 1+1 on August 16: some chromium slag had been left untreated for as long as 17 years after production, dumped in the open near the Nanpan River.

According to the 2010 China Environmental Bulletin, by the end of that year there were still about 1 million tonnes of chromium slag piled in 12 provinces across China. Greenpeace discovered another seventy to ninety thousand tonnes of chromium slag in Yunnan in late August, said Ma Tianjie, a campaigner from the environmental group. They believe it was produced by Yundian Chemical Ltd. in Mouding, which has long since ceased production.

Governance problems

On August 13, Luliang county’s official microblog announced that two months earlier district environmental supervisors had informed the Luliang Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) that dangerous chromium waste had been found in the area, and asked bureau officials to inspect the chromium-tailings storage at the chemicals plant. It was later discovered that Luliang Chemicals and Xingyi Sanli Fuel had signed a deal in May regarding disposal of the chromium tailings without approval from the bureau. Drivers employed by Xingyi Sanli Fuel later dumped the tailings in Qilin district, also without authorisation.

The microblog also stated that on the morning of June 13 – the day the pollution alert was passed to the environmental protection bureau – government employees rushed to the scene, where they worked to remove 5,222 tonnes of chromium slag, 7,700 tonnes of polluted soil and 966 tonnes of polluted water (run-off from the tailings).

Officials from the EPB admitted to the Yangcheng Evening News that drivers had secretly dumped 1,000 tonnes of tailings, “polluting 100 cubic metres of stagnant water”. But despite local government claims on its microblog that all the waste had been cleared up in the three days after June 13, CCTV’s News 1+1 found on August 15 that the slag heap had been left uncovered, separated from the visibly dirty Nanpan River only by a wall. Under pressure, the plant ordered its workers to cover the tailings with asbestos tiles, build a covering and strengthen the wall.

On August 17, the Pearl River Water Resources Commission’s own investigation found that there were excessive levels of hexavalent chromium in the area of the Luliang Chemicals slag heap, describing it as a “serious matter that impacted the water security of both people and livestock.”

But there are also doubts about the monitoring. The local information office said that between 2009 and 2011 the county’s centre for disease control (CDC) took water samples from the reservoir at Xinglong village and that levels of hexavalent chromium had been found to be 0.004 milligrams per litre – within legal limits. But, according to the New Express, the centre’s head, Qian Xin, said that testing for hexavelent chromium had stopped in August 2009.

Following the discovery of the pollution, Yunnan’s environmental authorities failed to promptly inform the downstream provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong. After the incident was reported in the media, the Yunnan EPB announced that the water quality of the Nanpan as it left Yunnan was good, and on the same day Guangdong’s environmental authorities told Xinhua news agency that there was nothing unusual about water quality in the province and they would continue to monitor the situation carefully.

The two drivers who dumped the waste have since been arrested and face criminal charges; five others have been detained. Environmental officials from downstream Guangdong province said no changes in water quality had been observed and they would keep monitoring it closely. The drought in Yunnan might prevent the pollution from spreading to rivers – but, said Ma Tianjie from Greenpeace, if it rains no one knows what might happen to the lower reaches.

The continuing crisis

In the 1990s, China started to clean up the chromium industry, and many companies closed or merged. By 2005, only 25 were left, and the State Council – China’s highest administrative organ – ordered that all leftover tailings be safely dealt with by 2010. The Yunnan case shows this has not happened: large quantities of tailings are yet to be processed and dangerous dumping continues.

The incident is not at an end. Other reports show that “cancer villages” have started to appear. Chang Xiaoqiao, previously secretary of the technical office at Xinglong village near the chemical plant, told a Hunan-based newspaper that many villagers were suffering strange diseases, with 30 developing cancer. Qian Xin, from the Luliang CDC, confirmed that between 2002 and 2010 there were 14 incidences of cancer, with 11 people now dead – the youngest aged nine.

Chromium pollution has a major impact on the environment and restoring contaminated soil is difficult. In the 1970s, both Japan and the United States saw serious incidents of chromium pollution, the most famous being the 1993 case in California contested by the environmental activist Erin Brockovich, which formed the basis for the film of the same name. Developed nations have invested in methods for treating chromium waste, but to little effect. According to the China Chemical Times, many nations have instead reduced their production capacity and companies have closed down due to environmental pressures – and instead imported chromium compounds from developing nations, such as China. That has lead to rapid growth in the sector in China over the last 10 years, including the increased stockpiling of chromium tailings.

Praise or criticism?

""American parents and teachers use more compliments and encouragement to help a child develop,"" Chen says, adding it's the opposite for Chinese parents.

Chen's elder son Liu Changhao studies at an elementary school in Iowa City, so he learns the American way at school, but returns to a Chinese home.

""Sometimes he is confused about the different ways,"" Chen says. ""When he expects to get praise, it's not always the case.""

Aumer says her Chinese mother never says things like, ""Congratulations"", or, ""I am proud of you"", but her American father says things like, ""Good job, honey"".

Zhang Yuping, from China and the mother of a 17-year-old boy and 9-year-old daughter, says that when she receives her children's course results she tends to concentrate on their failings.

""When I point out what they didn't do well, my children always say, 'Mom, why don't you praise me for what I have done well?'"" Zhang says.

More authoritarian

Li Xiaomei's daughter, who was born in China and grew up in the US, was slapped on the face by her father when she refused to change her clothes.

Li's husband thought her then 13-year-old daughter's clothes were too revealing for her age and asked her to change into the clothes they bought her in China. She said no and added that he had no right to slap her.

Generally, Chinese parents are more authoritarian compared to American parents and expect their children to respect and obey, while American parents tend to see their children more as equals.

""For my mother, I think it's hard because she grew up in a completely different environment,"" Aumer says. ""I am not always obedient.""

She says she's not frightened of speaking her mind, but her mom usually retorts, ""You shouldn't talk to your mom like that.""

Josie Liu, the Chinese mother of a 4-year-old daughter, says she has adjusted her parenting to fit in with the US.

""When I grew up, my parents were pretty authoritarian,"" Liu says, adding she has to be more ""polite"" with her daughter in the US and instead of saying, ""Hey, you have to do this,"" she asks, ""Can you do this?""

Fostering independence

""Chinese parents are more likely to think children are vulnerable and dependent,"" says Chen Shuang, a Chinese history professor at the University of Iowa.

He says Chinese parents will do everything they can for their children instead of encouraging them to develop independence. Typically, they feed their children up to the age of 3.

Joyce Long, an American mother and wife of a staff representative of the Christian organization The Navigators, agrees with Chen.

She has worked with and advised Chinese parents in Iowa City for 16 years. She says the goal of an American family is for children to feed themselves as early as possible while Chinese families follow children around or put them in a high chair to feed them.

Long says Americans will let children play by themselves, while Chinese parents feel someone should hold the child or be with the child all the time.

Great expectations

""Why didn't you get first?"" was the response Aumer got when she called her mother telling her that she got a second-place award for her photos from the Iowa Newspaper Foundation.

This attitude underlines the fact that Chinese parents are good at raising stereotypically successful kids, as they are strict about their children's studies and have high expectations.

Liu Dongwang, the associate director of the Center for Asian and Pacific Studies, says he was not very successful raising his daughter, who will start her studies at the University of Iowa in the fall of 2011.

""She can only attend the University of Iowa,"" Liu says. ""I hoped she would have been admitted to one of those elite schools, and I would sell my house to pay for it if necessary.""

Long says Chinese parents not only want their children to do well academically, they also want them to excel at other things. Like Amy Chua's children, they often expect them to take piano or violin lessons at a young age and practice for a long time.

""I believe they want their children to become really skilled,"" Long says. ""Maybe it's part of the value system to do everything well.""

While Chinese parents expect their children to excel at what they do, American parents prefer their children to enjoy what they do. ""I would practice piano if I liked it,"" Aumer says.

But for her mother, practicing piano is not just a hobby and she demands that it is taken seriously. ""Looking back, I should have listened to my mother,"" Aumer continues. ""I wish I had listened to her and kept practicing and not let my father intervene. I would be much better now.""

Testing the limits

When a bunch of Chinese mothers gather together, they will most likely talk about their children.

""Americans don't usually ask somebody how their child did on a test like the ACT college entrance exam unless they're really good friends,"" Long says. ""Chinese parents fee free to ask such questions.""

Long says Chinese parents will compare their kids, even in front of them, which she believes can be hurtful.

Chinese parents, however, believe it motivates their children.

""Sometimes I will ask my children about their friends' scores when I see their transcripts,"" says mother Zhang Yuping. ""Often they will tell me it is not right to compare them.""

Aumer says she is always being compared with her sisters. Though she is the tallest girl in the family she is also the fattest and she hates being told to lose weight all the time.

""When I tell my friends (about this) they are shocked,"" Aumer says. ""But I don't take offence because I know she (mom) doesn't mean it.""

Confucian culture

""I guess Americans believe a kid should be independent,"" says Chen Tingting, but Chinese families are often dominated by Confucian ideas, which means a child has obligations to the entire family.

Chinese parents want their children to be successful mainly for their children's own good, but they also want their children to bring honor to the family.

""I'm not supposed to be over critical of my son. But sometimes I am still influenced by the Chinese way of thinking, so that I feel I lose face because my son is not behaving well,"" the mother says.

""I try to avoid thinking that my son is part of me,"" she says.

A middle way

Despite the huge differences between American and Chinese parenting styles, when Chinese raise their children in the US, they will gradually incorporate some of their values.

""Before we came here, the way we educated our kids and the way Americans do is like different tracks,"" Chen Tingting says. ""Now it seems those tracks are getting closer to each other.""

She is searching for a middle way between the two cultures and says though she does not want to raise her kids exactly like typical Americans, she is influenced by them.

""We do try to give more encouragement to our kids,"" Chen says, but change is not always easy. ""I am Chinese. Some concepts are deeply rooted.""

Raising kids in another culture, however, does have its benefits. Joyce Long says whenever somebody lives in a new country, they can always pick up some of the good aspects from that culture and at the same time, keep some of the good values of their own culture.

By searching for a middle way these parents search for the right way and the best of both worlds.

3,3,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Firm to get skyscraper project off the ground|Society|chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-09/06/content_13625651.htm,"Firm to get skyscraper project off the ground Updated: 2011-09-06 07:21 By Zheng Jinran (China Daily)

An artist’s impression of Zhongguo Zun in the CBD. The building, which will house offices of CITIC Group, will be the tallest in Beijing when it is fi nished, standing 510 meters. WU LU / FOR CHINA DAILY

BEIJING - Developers working on a new skyscraper, which once built will be the capital's tallest building, say they will break ground on the project on Sept 19.

CITIC Group, which won the rights to the land in the Central Business District with a bid of 3.6 billion yuan ($563 million) last December, plans to build a 510-meter-high office tower with 104 floors above ground and four basement levels.

""The final design hasn't been decided yet, as the group is waiting for the municipal government's approval, but the building will be higher than 500 meters,"" an insider at CITIC Real Estate who refused to be named said on Monday.

The new skyscraper is called Zhongguo Zun, which means China Goblet, as the inspiration for the design came from an ancient ritual vessel. Construction will be completed in five to seven years, the insider said.

The land where the building will stand is in the north of the CBD, which houses many international companies. The capital's tallest building now is Tower 3 of China World Trade Center, which is 330 meters tall and is also in the CBD.

""It is going to become a new landmark for the city,"" said an official in charge of the CBD who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

The skyscraper is expected to serve as an office building for CITIC Group. ""The company will occupy the whole building, and even then the space will not be enough,"" added the CBD official. ""Also, the company can't rent any of that office space for 10 years, as stipulated in the contract it signed with the municipal government.""

Wu Chengtao, editor of Skyscraper Magazine, said: ""The building, to some degree, demonstrates the city's image and economic strength, and will attract more investment. Besides, the competition among cities, both at home and abroad, has become more and more fierce, triggering many cities to pursue more super high-rise buildings.""

He said at least three skyscrapers above 600 meters were under construction in Shanghai, Wuhan and Shenzhen. The number of buildings higher than 500 meters is much larger, ""and I can't remember them all"", he added.

""Considering its economic strength and influence as the Chinese capital, Beijing could build one higher than 700 meters,"" said Wu. ""However, the tallest building will be about 510 meters, which shows the city is pursuing stable development.""

The design of the new skyscraper adopts many elements from traditional culture, such as the Kongming (Floating Paper) Lamp. ""The building will remind people of the ancient Chinese city, representing Beijing's image perfectly,"" said Wu.

However, the high-rise will bring about some problems, experts say.

""Having a large amount of people concentrated in a limited place will put huge pressure on transport and the environment,"" said Yan Jinming, a professor of land management at Remin University of China. ""Plus, the requirements for foundations, equipment to prevent disasters and fires are more strict, thus the cost is much higher.""

Wu agreed and said that since the CITIC Group is involved in broad business, lots of related enterprises will move closer for convenience, causing a hike in rental prices.

""However, as more jobs will be created, on a whole, the advantages brought by the new skyscraper will outweigh the disadvantages,"" he added.

4,4,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Public storm in Dalian - chinadialogue,https://chinadialogue.net/en/pollution/4511-public-storm-in-dalian/,"As Typhoon Meihua battered China’s east coast in early August, it also whipped up a public storm: a dyke protecting China’s largest manufacturer of paraxylene (PX) – a chemical used to make polyester products – was washed away, bringing the plant’s existence to the attention of the local population and triggering public safety fears. Over 10,000 residents of the north-eastern city of Dalian gathered in front of the municipal government building to express opposition to the project, demanding the plant be moved and the full details made public.

Following the uproar, Dalian authorities ordered the managers of the Fujia Dahua facility immediately to halt production and relocate their plant: the public campaign had concluded with the government bowing to public opinion – on the surface, a triumph. But the whole case highlights how, in the absence of strong rule of law, China’s environmental management has taken the road of what I call “interaction without rules”. This brings its own set of problems.

On environmental issues, “interaction without rules” normally goes through three stages: first, local interest groups and local governments push ahead with a polluting project in violation of environmental regulations. Second, local people spontaneously organise mass protests against the project in question, an activity supported by neither law nor policy. And third, in response to the threat to social stability created by the protests, local government halts the project – again, breaching laws. At every stage, the existing rules are lightly cast aside by all participants.

Take the Dalian case as an example: available material shows that construction of the PX project violated regulations. This major polluter is located just 20 kilometres from the city centre – closer than is permitted by government standards. And the plant started production before the environmental authorities had even authorised trial operations. These serious breaches of process should themselves have led to severe sanctions, but thanks to local government support, the project quietly went ahead, out of public sight.

During the protests that followed, exaggerated claims about the dangers of PX spread like wildfire, while online videos show the demonstrations were more unruly than those against a waste incinerator in Panyu, Guangdong, two years ago, for example.

Then, in the third stage, the Dalian authorities ruled that the facility must move – again without following due legal process or properly attributing responsibility, and leaving the taxpayers to foot the astronomical costs of relocation. As with the original decision to build the plant, the local government’s resolution to move it was not the result of due legal and administrative procedures, and there was no effective public participation or supervision.

We have seen many such cases in China in recent years. BASF’s Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) plant – the world’s largest – near the sensitive Three Gorges reservoir; PetroChina’s ethylene plant in Pengzhou, Sichuan; another paraxylene factory in Xiamen, in the east coast province of Fujian: all of these were heavy chemical projects with serious pollution risks, all were initiated without public or environmental oversight – and all resulted in public opposition.

When local governments use unconventional methods to build polluting projects, the public are forced to resort to unconventional means to protect their own interests. This kind of social interaction makes the management of environmental issues an even knottier task.

First of all, where local interest groups ignore existing regulations, they challenge the rule of law. These cases tend to involve local, state-owned enterprises or private businesses building polluting projects in breach of regulations with the tacit consent of the local government. This points to serious erosion of the authority of environmental law and environmental-protection officials. This erosion is often linked with corruption, which destroys trust between people and government, and can lead to social discontent and crisis. The disregard of the rules not only makes environmental issues more complex, but also affects government legitimacy and social stability.

Secondly, where there is “interaction without rules”, local interest groups become even more brazen in their pursuit of economic benefit, leading to greater environmental problems. Currently, an alliance between local interest groups and local government is forming localised “growth machines”. These interest groups care only about their own development plans and group interests, and have control of the local economy. They are often driven to break free of the restrictions of state law and policy – and sacrificing the environmental rights of ordinary citizens is not even an issue. The Dalian PX project was quietly started beyond the reaches of public supervision. This kind of furtive action demonstrates that local government and interest groups are acting deliberately and in full knowledge of the threat to public health posed by their projects.

Third, many members of the public, seeing that environmental management processes have been ignored during the construction of a polluting project, are forced to move beyond normal modes of political expression in order to protect their interests. The protests in Dalian can be considered a kind of mass action – a gathering of a large number of people in a particular place, without organisation, in response to a particular stimulus or influence. For the Chinese people and government – neither of which is familiar with the rules of mass action – the growth in these types of protests points to social instability as well as rising costs of social management. One possibility is that ""interaction without rules"" between local government, local interest groups and the public will increase unpredictable social acts, and in those circumstances there is no way for proper environmental management to proceed.

But there is another possible outcome. If, during this process, local interest groups, government and people can reach a consensus on improving the social system, a foundation for comprehensive environmental management can be established. Positive interaction could solve the issue of environmental management at its roots.

The evolution of the Taiwanese environmental protection movement provides a successful example. During the 1960s, years of drought and salinisation led to a shortage of water for industrial development in the Gaoping River basin. Local government set to work on long term water-resource development, but plans to create a reservoir at Meinong triggered large-scale public opposition in the Gaoxiong region, and for a period relations between the people and government were tense. After the formation of the Gaoping Protection Green Alliance, however, proposals for better management of rivers and ecological restoration – rather than just construction of a reservoir – were put forward, and the government followed the advice.

Between 1961 and 2004, the movement went through five stages of development: formation of an agenda, confrontation, dialogue and communication, participation and cooperation and, lastly, propagation of best practices. Long-term methods for managing local water resources were established. The Gaoping campaign is now a model for joint environmental management by government and people.

We can spot similar positive elements in China’s environmental movement. Despite the gulf of understanding between the people and the government, the protests in Dalian still followed the rules of peaceful, non-violent protest. During the demonstrations, there were constant, spontaneous calls for order to be maintained, and reminders to participants not to act or speak too radically, so that interaction would be allowed to continue. Similar scenes were witnessed during the march against Xiamen PX in late 2007 and protests against a waste-incinerator in Guangzhou in 2009. Just how important public opinion is to local governments such as those in Dalian and Xiamen is reflected in how they handled the situation. Overall, in most public environmental campaigns, the public is better at respecting and acting in accordance with the law than local government.

Public campaigns are one way for the middle classes to appeal for social reform. In Taiwan, many campaigns sprung up at the same time – in the 1980s, movements emerged against crime, pornography and nuclear power, as well as in support of environmental protection and consumer rights. These campaigns do not aim to overthrow the existing system, but to reform one part of society. Meanwhile on the mainland, factors including economic and educational development; public ideological awareness; government tolerance; and the appearance of new social action networks and organisers mean that public campaigns are also on the rise – including environmental movements.

We can expect these campaigns to be a long-term trend that develops in parallel with the growth of the middle classes. Experience from environmental campaigns in places such as Taiwan shows it is the public who push forward the environmental agenda, but ultimately the spark for positive interaction and system reform needs to come from the government.

UNICEF strengthens water delivery to vulnerable communities in Djibouti

DJIBOUTI CITY, 6 September 2011 – DJIBOUTI CITY, 6 September 2011 – As part of the response to the drought crisis in Djibouti, UNICEF launched a 75-day operation to provide an additional 35,000 people in water-deprived communities throughout the country with safe drinking water.

“Like other countries in the Horn of Africa, Djibouti has been suffering from the impact of recurrent droughts,” says Josefa Marrato, UNICEF Representative in Djibouti. “Needs this year have been particularly acute, and UNICEF has made it a priority to provide safe drinking water for children and their families in vulnerable communities.”

Djibouti is one of the most water-scarce countries in the world, with only 150 mm of rainfall a year on average. Nearly half the population in rural areas has no access to safe drinking water.

Though droughts are frequent, this year’s, coupled with an increase in food and fuel prices, has left 120,000 people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.

Children have been particularly affected: 1 out of 5 is malnourished, making Djibouti proportionally the second most affected country by the crisis in the Horn of Africa.

UNICEF has been responding to the increasing water needs, by supporting water trucking services and providing repair and maintenance equipment for wells and boreholes.

Some 35 areas in Djibouti have no access to safe water. Under the recently launched operation, UNICEF has rented five water trucks which the Ministry of Energy and Water in charge of Natural Resources to strengthen water trucking to these areas for a period of 75 days.

Working with counterparts, UNICEF’s priority is to save and protect children’s lives by providing life-saving supplies to the most deprived.

In April, demonstrators in Tabriz and Orumieh demanded Lake Orumieh be saved.

Iran's largest lake is dying, but it's giving new life to antigovernment protests along its receding shores.Lake Orumieh, one of the world's largest saltwater lakes, has shrunk by some 60 percent in recent years due to drought and misguided development policies. Environmentalists warn that unless something is done, the lake will disappear forever.This dire prospect has put locals who depend on the lake on edge. And seeing as the lake straddles the border of Iran's East and West Azerbaijan provinces, centers of the country's ethnic Azeri population that have a rich and volatile history of protest against Tehran, the central government is on edge too.Tensions over the lake's falling water levels boiled over last week, after parliament, the Majlis, decided against local lawmakers' proposed fast-track solution to the problem in an August 17 vote. Scores of locals took to the streets of Orumieh (aka Urmia) on August 27, and open conflict with security forces ensued.""Let's cry and fill Lake Orumieh with our tears,"" protesters chanted in Orumieh, as well as, ""Lake Orumieh is dying; the Majlis is issuing its death sentence"" (see video).And what might have been heard loudest by the authorities -- already sensitive to any signs of a return of the large-scale protest that followed the country's 2009 presidential election and wary of any outward signs of ethnic discord in the country's Azeri regions -- were chants like these: ""Azerbaijan rise up and cry out,"" and ""If Azerbaijan doesn't rise up, it will lose.""The protest was met with force by security forces, who reportedly used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowd. Videos purportedly from the protest that wereshow activists throwing stones, and antiriot forces firing back.Yashar Hakkapour, a Canada-based human rights activist, tells RFE/RL's Radio Farda that he heard reports of numerous injuries and arrests among protesters. ""Local sources informed us that some of the people were injured because the special forces attacked them with batons,"" he said.A protest planned the same day in Tabriz, the capital of East Azerbaijan Province that lies 80 kilometers east of the lake, never materialized.An eyewitness told RFE/RL that security forces prevented citizens from expressing their concerns over the state of the lake, and at least three people were detained.The failed protest came after a spate of arrests and incidents related to the outcry over the government's perceived inaction over the lake issue.Some 30 activists in the city were arrested on August 24 during a fast-breaking dinner in the middle of Ramadan. They were reportedly discussing the poor state of the lake.A day earlier, several activists were detained before and after a soccer match in Tabriz. Soccer fans assembled for the August 23 game reportedly chanted slogans against the Iranian parliament and accused it of issuing an execution order for the lake.In April, 70 people in Tabriz were reportedly arrested at a protest against the lake's rapid demise. Several of them were later sentenced to lashes and fined.The region's history as a hotbed of resistance -- highlighted by the Tabriz-centered constitutional revolution of 1906 aimed at bringing modern democratic practices to Iran -- could help explain the government's heavy-handed response.As Washington-based analyst Ali Afshari explains, Iranian authorities are concerned about an awakening of ethnic tensions that have led to large scale protests in the past. ""We have to see it in the frame of political and ethnic tensions that exists in that region between some of the ethnic Azeri Iranians and the government,"" he says. ""Some are after [more rights] while others might have separatist demands. This has led the government to react.""The development also comes amid strains in Tehran's relations with neighboring Azerbaijan that stem largely from Baku's concerns over the treatment of Iran's large Azeri minority.Activists in Azerbaijan have called on Iran to release Azeri political prisoners and to provide more cultural and political rights for Azeris in Iran. In the wake of the violence and arrests related to Lake Orumieh, groups such as the Association for the Defense of Azerbaijani Political Prisoners in Iran have condemned the Iranian government's response to the protests and have called for the release of those detained.Ardeshir Amir Arjomand, a top adviser to opposition leader Mir Hossein Musavi who left Iran a few months ago, told the opposition Kalame website that the Iranian government's response showed how much it fears protests of any kind. ""A government that is facing a legitimacy crisis is afraid of everything, from youths' joy, to having iftar in parks, everything,"" Arjomand said. ""They even see the water of Orumieh Lake as a security issue.""The security implications are not lost on those outside the government either. In covering the protests, the business-oriented website Aftab noted, ""If officials did not want to rescue the dying Lake Orumieh, then they should at least be aware that not doing anything serious about the issue can create deep security issues in the northwestern region of the country.""Questions have also been raised over whether the lake's demise is the true reason for the protests, or just a convenient excuse to air political grievances.Analyst Afshari doesn't think it really matters either way. ""Some of those who took part in the protests have genuine environmental concerns -- Lake Orumieh is a key factor for development and the environment of that region, not only the provinces of East and West Azerbaijan but also for other provinces, so some are really concerned,"" he notes. ""Others might use the issue for their own political and ethnic activities; yet we shouldn't forget that it's the people's right to protest.""If there is one point of consensus, it is that saving the lake appears to be the goal of all parties and in the interest of all Iranians. The polarizing point is just how to go about it.The parliament's August 17 vote against the ""double urgency"" bill was not the final nail in the coffin for Lake Orumieh, even if that is how the decision is perceived by some.What the vote did kill was a proposal submitted by lawmakers from Orumieh that called for allocating funds to channel water from the Aras River to raise the level of the lake. In rejecting the proposal, the parliament effectively opted to continue its current review of the situation.This has led to accusations of inaction by some, but those who voted against the bill defended their decision by saying it was submitted in haste and had little chance of restoring the lake.Among them is lawmaker Salam Khodadadi, who told Iran's official IRNA news agency last week that the regional representatives who proposed the bill should have presented the bill as a national project and not as a regional one.Only the central government can solve the problem of the lake, he said, adding that 8.5 billion liters of water evaporates from the lake every year.""If it continues like that, we will be left face-to-face with a national tragedy in two years' time,"" he said.Another lawmaker, Jamshid Ansari, described the drying-up of the lake as a national problem and warned that if the issue was not dealt with properly, 18 of Iran's 31 provinces would be affected.Iranian authorities have blamed a variety of factors, including drought, for the lake's dropping water level. And the government has announced a plan to invigorate the lake that includes reducing the amount of water drawn from the lake for irrigation and supplying it with remote sources of water. In 2010, Vice President Mohammad Javad Mohammadizadeh said 2 billion cubic meters of water would be added to the lake over five to 10 years.Environmental experts and others cite misguided policies and poor decisions as the biggest contributors to the lake's demise. ""We've built 35 dams and 10 more are being constructed,"" says Ismail Kahrom, a well-known environmental expert and university professor in Tehran. ""It means we have deprived Orumieh Lake of 5.5 billion cubic meters of water per year.""Experts have called for action before the lake -- a UNESCO Biosphere reserve home to hundreds of species of birds, reptiles, and mammals -- fades away forever.","Thu, 01 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://gdb.rferl.org/C1B5E50B-CF2C-40A1-8493-2775114BFA75_w1200_r1.jpg,"['lakes', 'irans', 'protests', 'gives', 'protest', 'security', 'political', 'water', 'lake', 'dying', 'orumieh', 'ethnic', 'azerbaijan', 'antigovernment', 'life']", ,none

NEW YORK - Americans on Sunday remembered the horror of Sept 11, 2001, and the nearly 3,000 people who died in the hijacked plane attacks as authorities worked to ensure the emotional 10th anniversary was peaceful.

President Barack Obama and former president George W. Bush stood in silence on Sunday and a church bell rang twice at the precise moment ten years after the first jetliner struck the World Trade Center.

Obama read Psalm 46 that reminds the faithful that God is a refuge and strength that dwells in ""his city.""

Bush read a civil war letter from president Abraham Lincoln to a mother who lost all five of her sons.

As cellist Yo Yo Ma played mournful background music, relatives of the Sept 11 dead began entering a transformed Ground Zero, the centerpiece of a day of mourning and remembrance around the nation and world to mark 10 years since the worst terrorist attack on American soil.

The heart of the ceremony to consecrate the memorial began with the reading of the names of nearly 3,000 people who died in the attacks.

The memorial opens to the public on Monday. It sits next to a construction project where office towers, a transportation hub and a cultural center are taking shape. The signature skyscraper, One World Trade Center, is rising quickly and will be the tallest in the country when completed.

Thousands gathered on a clear Sunday morning to grieve where the twin towers of the World Trade Center once stood. With security high and no traffic, there was an eerie silence where a decade ago the 110-storey skyscrapers collapsed after being hit by hijacked airliners, sending a cloud over lower Manhattan.

The somber ceremony - with bagpipes, youthful voices singing the national anthem and firefighters holding aloft a tattered American flag retrieved from Ground Zero - drew tears. Family members wore T-shirts with the faces of the dead, carried photos, flowers and flags in an outpouring of emotion.

For the first time, relatives saw the just-finished memorial and touched the etched names of their dead loved ones. Some left flowers, others small teddy bears. Some used pencils to trace the names on paper, others took a photograph.

Many wept as the names of the dead were read, by wives and husbands, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers and children, some choked with emotion at their personal loss.

""I haven't stopped missing my dad. He was awesome,"" said Peter Negron, who was just a child when his father, Pete, was killed in one of the stricken towers. ""I wish my dad had been there to teach me how to drive, ask a girl out on a date and see me graduate from high school and a hundred other things I can't even begin to name.""

The al-Qaida attacks of 2001 are now such a part of American life that they have been included in the school curriculum. This was the first anniversary that included a US president.

The memorial includes two plazas in the shape of the footprints of the Twin Towers with cascading 9-meter waterfalls. Around the perimeters of pools in the center of each plaza are the names of the victims of the Sept 11 attacks and an earlier 1993 attack at the trade center.

""Ten years have passed since a perfect blue sky morning turned into the blackest of nights,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said during the ceremony.

""Since then, we've lived in sunshine and in shadow, and although we can never unsee what happened here, we can also see that children who lost their parents have grown into young adults, grandchildren have been born and good works and public service have taken root to honor those we loved and lost.""

Obama visited the North Memorial Pool, which sits in the footprint of the north tower. He walked around the pool hand-in-hand with first lady Michelle Obama, former president George W. Bush and his wife, Laura.

In a somber moment, Obama touched the names of the dead, engraved in stone, before he greeted some family members.

Police in New York and Washington were on high alert against a ""credible but unconfirmed"" threat of an al-Qaida plot to attack the US again on the 10th anniversary.

Security was especially tight in Manhattan, where police set up vehicle checks on city streets as well as bridges and tunnels coming into the city. There was an unprecedented show of force in Manhattan from roadblocks on Times Square in midtown to the area around Ground Zero farther to the south.

""It was our Pearl Harbor,"" said John McGillicuddy, 33, a teacher from Yonkers, New York, getting coffee and carrying two American flags on his way to the World Trade Center, referring to the Japanese attack that led America to join World War II.

""Every year, September is always rough,"" he said, as he prepared to grieve his uncle, Lieutenant Joseph Leavey, a New York firefighter who died in the south tower.

Pope Benedict prayed for Sept 11 victims and appealed to those with grievances to ""always reject violence as a solution to problems and resist the temptation to resort to hate"".

In the Sept 11 attacks, 19 men hijacked airliners and crashed them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon outside Washington and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Just weeks after the attacks, US forces invaded Afghanistan to topple that country's Taliban rulers who had harbored the al-Qaida leaders responsible for the Sept 11 attacks.

Obama was set to visit all three attack sites on Sunday.

""There should be no doubt: today, America is stronger and al-Qaida is on the path to defeat,"" Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday.

In Afghanistan, NATO-led forces said on Sunday that on the eve of the 10th anniversary a suicide bomber driving a truck of firewood attacked a NATO base in central Afghanistan in an operation for which the Taliban later claimed responsibility.

NATO said that the Saturday afternoon attack killed four Afghan civilians and injured 77 NATO troops.

US forces killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May.

Sunday's Ground Zero ceremony had moments of silence marking when the planes hit the twin towers as well as when they collapsed. Other moments of silence marked when a plane hit the Pentagon and another crashed in Shanksville after passengers fought back against the hijackers.

Sunday's ceremony was the biggest of a weekend of such events from coast to coast.

A decade later, after a faltering start, there are signs of rebuilding progress at the World Trade Center. The new One World Trade Center rises more than 80 stories above the ground as it inches to its planned 541 meters height, or 1,776 feet - symbolic of the year America declared independence from Britain.

The memorial plaza is ready and the neighborhood has enjoyed a revival, making it a trendy Manhattan place to live.","Mon, 12 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/images/911/attachement/jpg/site1/20110912/0013729e4a600fd7868701.jpg,"['center', 'memorial', 'dead', 'attacks', 'remember', 'sept', 'names', '11', 'day', 'world', 'york', 'trade']", ,none

Russian customers choose clothes at a market in Manzhouli, Inner Mongolia autonomous region. China and Russia have pledged to increase bilateral trade to a value of $200 billion a year by 2020, up from $55.4 billion in 2010. Liu Zhaoming / for China Daily

The Sino-Russian trade relationship is about to become more profitable

MOSCOW/ST PETERSBURG - Ding Yanna has been involved in Sino-Russia trade for more than 19 years. Since arriving in Russia as a student in 1992, she has sold fur coats, been a construction contractor and is now opening a restaurant in St Petersburg.

Unlike many of her Chinese peers, Ding spends most of her time with Russian friends and only conducts business in accordance with local laws and regulations.

Although it has brought a lot of extra costs, such as the payment of taxes and the cost of hiring lawyers and accountants, this approach has allowed her business to survive and thrive.

""If you want to do business here over a long period, doing it legally is of the utmost importance,"" said Ding, who also has a business in Moscow. She said she is planning to establish a school to provide basic business knowledge to Chinese entrepreneurs working in Russia.

Illegal Chinese business activity in Russia is one of the most sensitive issues facing the future of Sino-Russian trade. In 2009, around 150 Chinese businessmen and a large amount of their goods were detained by Russia's Federal Migration Service in raids at the Cherkizovsky Market, in the east of Moscow. The raids and subsequent detentions quickly escalated into a diplomatic spat, with Chinese officials demanding that the Russian government should protect the interests of Chinese businesspeople in the country. China also sent a delegation to Moscow to conduct negotiations on the issue.

Three years later, many of the merchants who stayed in Russia have relocated to a different market in a southeastern corner of the city. Officially it's called the Moscow Trade Center, but is better known to locals as Lyublino.

Although many of the Chinese dealers are still complaining about the Cherkizovsky raids, during which contraband goods worth about $2 billion were seized, most of them are getting used to the new place.

""I like the new market, it is much cleaner and better regulated compared with Cherkizovsky,"" said Li Xue, who came to Russia in 2000 and owns a shoe store at Lyublino. She said business has improved since she moved from Cherkizovsky three years ago.

According to official figures, about half of Russia's trade is now conducted with other European countries..

Its trade with China, meanwhile, accounts for about 10 percent of its total trade. Earlier this year, China and Russia pledged to increase bilateral trade to a value of $200 billion a year by 2020, up from $55.4 billion in 2010. However, a lot of the trade volume is conducted through energy sales.

Cai Guiru, chairperson of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Russia, said in an article earlier this year that the biggest obstacle for Sino-Russia trade is ""Gray Customs Clearance"", in which some government-connected ""clearance"" companies have been pushing imported goods into the Russian market at a tax rate much lower than the official level.

The Russian authorities have long criticized the low level of business education of Chinese traders and workers in their country, noting that Chinese commodities traded to Russia often go through the

gray market rather than the proper channels.

""China and Russia need real international trade instead of covert transactions such as street vendors, illegal private banks, and urban marketplaces,"" said Cai. He added that Russia needs licit Chinese commodities and welcomes entrepreneurs who will run their businesses legally.

Cai said that if long-standing illegal business practices are allowed to continue, Sino-Russian trade will remain at a low level.

According to official figures, there are between 200,000 and 400,000 Chinese living in Russia. A 2008 study by Aleksander Larin, a researcher at the Institute of the Far East in Moscow, shows that the average Chinese migrant in Russia hails from northern China.

Deng Weining, secretary general of the association of South China dealers at Lyublino, said many Chinese dealers have started to conduct legal business since they moved to the new market. ""Russia needs Chinese goods, but it also wants quality Chinese goods,"" said Deng. He noted that Chinese dealers need to be united to raise the average price of Chinese goods to counter rising costs.

According to Deng, a Chinese T-shirt will often sell for 200 roubles ($7) in an urban marketplace. The same item will fetch more than 400 roubles in a mall or even 4,000 roubles if it's passed off as an exclusive brand in a specialized shop. That affords Chinese dealers a chance to make a much bigger profit if they manage to ascend the value chain, he added.

Ling Ji, minister counselor for economic and commercial affairs at the Chinese embassy to Russia, said the Sino-Russian trade volume totaled around $30 billion in the first five months of this year. ""It shows that the Sino-Russian trade relationship has very great ability to restore itself,"" said Ling.

Meanwhile the Chinese and Russian governments have set a target of raising the volume of trade between the two countries to $100 billion by 2015.

""The US and Canada are not very populous compared with China, but their trade volume exceeds $600 billion. China and Russia share a 4,300-kilometer-long border, so it's really a pity that their trade volume is only $55.45 billion,"" said Cai.

10,10,DR-2011-000121-CHN,U.S. experiences second warmest summer on record: Texas has warmest summer on record of any state - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110910134446.htm,"The blistering heat experienced by the United States during August, as well as the June through August months, marks the second warmest summer on record, according to scientists at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, N.C. The persistent heat, combined with below-average precipitation across the southern U.S. during August and the three summer months, continued a record-breaking drought across the region.

The average U.S. temperature in August was 75.7 degrees F, which is 3.0 degrees above the long-term (1901-2000) average, while the summertime temperature was 74.5 degrees F, which is 2.4 degrees above average. The warmest August on record for the contiguous United States was 75.8 degrees F in 1983, while its warmest summer on record at 74.6 degrees F occurred in 1936. Precipitation across the nation during August averaged 2.31 inches, 0.29 inches below the long-term average. The nationwide summer precipitation was 1.0 inch below average.

This monthly analysis, based on records dating back to 1895, is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides.

U.S. climate highlights -- August

Excessive heat in six states -- Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana -- resulted in their warmest August on record. This year ranked in the top ten warmest August for five other states: Florida (3rd), Georgia (4th), Utah (5th), Wyoming (8th), and South Carolina (9th).The Southwest and South also had their warmest August on record.

Only nine of the lower 48 states experienced August temperatures near average, and no state had August average temperatures below average.

Wetter-than-normal conditions were widespread across the Northeastern United States, which had its second wettest August, as well as parts of the Northern Plains and California. Drier-than-normal conditions reigned across the interior West, the Midwest, and the South.

Hurricane Irene made landfall near Cape Lookout, N.C. as a Category 1 storm on August 27, marking the first hurricane landfall in the U.S. since Hurricane Ike in September 2008. Irene made a second landfall in New Jersey as a hurricane on August 28, marking only the second recorded hurricane landfall in that state.

Irene contributed to New Jersey, New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire having their wettest August on record. Meanwhile, Massachusetts (2nd), Connecticut (2nd), Delaware (3rd), Maine (3rd), Maryland (5th), Pennsylvania (5th), and Rhode Island (9th) had a top 10 wet August.

Several major U.S. cities broke all-time monthly rainfall amounts during August. New York City (Central Park) measured 18.95 inches of rain, exceeding the previous record of 16.85 inches in 1882. In Philadelphia, 19.31 inches of rain was observed, besting the previous monthly record of 13.07 inches in September 1999.

Louisiana (3rd), Tennessee (4th), Texas (5th), Mississippi (6th), Georgia, (6th), Illinois (8th), Washington (9th), and Alabama (9th) had precipitation totals among their top ten driest on record.

Despite record rainfall in parts of the country, drought covered about one-third of the contiguous United States, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index indicated that parts of Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas are experiencing drought of greater intensity, but not yet duration, than those of the 1930s and 1950s. Drought intensity refers to the rate at which surface and ground water is lost, due to a combination of several factors, including evaporation and lack of precipitation.

An analysis of Texas statewide tree-ring records dating back to 1550 indicates that the summer 2011 drought in Texas is matched by only one summer (1789), indicating that the summer 2011 drought appears to be unusual even in the context of the multi-century tree-ring record.

U.S. climate highlights -- Summer

Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Louisiana had their warmest (June-August) summers on record. Average summer temperatures in Texas and Oklahoma, at 86.8 degrees F and 86.5 degrees F, respectively, exceeded the previous seasonal statewide average temperature record for any state during any season. The previous warmest summer statewide average temperature was in Oklahoma, during 1934 at 85.2 degrees F.

Fifteen states had a summer average temperature ranking among their top ten warmest. West of the Rockies, a persistent trough brought below-average temperatures to the Pacific Northwest, where Washington and Oregon were the only states across the lower 48 to have below-average summer temperatures.

Texas had its driest summer on record, with a statewide average of 2.44 inches of rain. This is 5.29 inches below the long-term average, and 1.04 inches less than the previous driest summer in 1956. New Mexico had its second driest summer and Oklahoma its third driest summer. New Jersey and California had their wettest summers on record with 22.50 inches and 1.93 inches, respectively.

The U.S. Climate Extremes Index, a measure of the percent area of the country experiencing extreme climate conditions, was nearly four times the average value was during summer 2011. This is the third largest summer value of the record, which dates to 1910. The major drivers were extremes in warm minimum and maximum temperatures and in the wet and dry tails of the Palmer Drought Severity Index.

Based on NOAA's Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index, the contiguous U.S. temperature-related energy demand was 22.3 percent above average during summer. This is the largest such value during the index's period of record, which dates to 1895.

Other U.S. climate highlights

During the six-month period (March-August), much-above-average temperatures dominated the southern and eastern United States.

A 4S (sales, spare parts, service and survey) automotive service center in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. Sichuan Bohong Industry Co Ltd hopes to establish 50 4S shops within five years. Experts say Bohong's acquisition of Wescast Industries Inc will increase the Chinese company's competitiveness. An Xin / For China Daily

Company will purchase Canadian car parts supplier for $183 million

BEIJING - China's Sichuan Bohong Industry Co Ltd has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Canadian auto parts supplier Wescast Industries Inc to acquire the latter at an expected price of approximately $13.60 a share in cash, a deal with a total value of about $183 million.

The two said in a joint statement that Bohong has completed its due diligence and, as a sign of good faith to complete the acquisition, has agreed to provide a deposit of C$2 million ($2.03 million) to Wescast, a leading supplier of cast exhaust manifolds for passenger cars and light trucks.

To complete the acquisition, Bohong said it will need to obtain committed financing from China Development Bank Corp before Dec 30, which is also the deadline for the two parties to achieve a definitive agreement on the arrangement, according to the statement. The period can be extended upon payments of subsequent deposits.

The acquisition will be subject to a number of closing conditions.

""We are excited by the prospective combination of Bohong and Wescast for our customers and employees. We believe that the two companies are highly complementary in terms of products, services and operating values,"" said Ed Frackowiak, chairman and CEO of Wescast.

""In particular, we are excited by the potential to pursue future opportunities globally. This acquisition would accelerate some of the exciting new technology initiatives underway at Wescast.""

Established in 1999, Sichuan-based Bohong is engaged in the automobile, manufacturing, real estate and new energy sectors. With assets valued at around 3 billion yuan ($470 million) and more than 2,300 employees, the company's annual sales was nearly 4 billion yuan last year.

Wescast currently employs about 2,000 people globally in seven production facilities and five sales and design centers. It supplies the car and light-truck markets in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Australia.

""Bohong intends to build on Wescast's long history and believes that this acquisition will help Bohong and China's automobile industry to reach a new platform in servicing global customers,"" said Dong Ping, chairman and CEO of the Chinese company.

Bohong, which plans to establish 50 4S stores (sales, spare parts, service and survey) in southwestern China within five years, also aims to invest 2 billion yuan in machinery production and the casting and machining of auto parts.

""Chinese investors are becoming very active on the global transaction market for automotive suppliers recently,"" said Shen Jun, a partner at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants.

""And the takeover of foreign auto suppliers can help Chinese automakers improve the competitiveness of their products, then win higher market share with more complex products and technologies in international markets,"" Shen said.

Alex Fan, president of merger-and-acquisition specialist Crestridge Consulting in Los Angeles, agreed that it's smart for Chinese automakers to target struggling parts suppliers overseas.

He said that ""buying a parts manufacturer can truly help Chinese automakers acquire the technologies, which is a shortcut to strengthening their capability to produce high-quality and value-added cars"".

12,12,DR-2011-000121-CHN,War of the papayas|HongKong Focus|chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2011-09/08/content_13645581.htm,"War of the papayas Updated: 2011-09-08 07:45 By Kahon Chan (HK Edition)

Augustine To's organic farm is among the few that still cultivates papayas. Kahon Chan / China Daily Augustine To works in his field. Kahon Chan / China Daily

An alien plant form has invaded Hong Kong and within a few short years has virtually overrun the territory. The invader is a genetically modified form of papayas, which has become so prevalent that a debate is underway as to whether the engineered food should be exempted from the Genetically Modified Food Ordinance, which became law on Sept 1. Local organic farms are mounting vigorous opposition. Kahon Chan reports.

On a typical July morning in Pahoa of Hawaii, papaya farmer Lea Bernardo woke up to a staggering scene: thousands of papaya trees in his farms and in neighboring farms had been chopped down at the trunk, leaving all the fruit to rot. The Hawaii Papaya Industry Association called it was an act of ""eco-terrorism"" and offered a reward of $10,000 to track down the offenders.

The papayas trees that had been attacked were genetically modified (GM) to resist a deadly ring spot virus, as were the trees on 170 other farms on Oahu and the Big Island. The ring spot virus became epidemic more than half a century ago and during the 1950s wiped out all the papaya farms on the island of Oahu. Scientists from the University of Hawaii came up with a permanent solution in the 1990s - the genetic makeup of papaya plants was partially swapped to make them immune to the virus. The modified plant has been described as transgenic.

Transgenic papayas were first grown commercially in 1998 and now make up the majority of Hawaiian papayas. Though the genetically altered plants were credited with saving the industry, according to Hawaii's Department of Agriculture, the annual yield of papayas in 2009 remained lower than when the ring spot virus was at its peak.

The act of vandalism in July was another harsh reminder that environmental activists continue to haunt the food industry and even consumers. These activists oppose the practice of genetically modifying plants because the downstream affect of the modifications cannot be foretold. Greenpeace, for instance, contents the GM papaya contains a protein that causes allergies and a strain of antibiotic resistance marker gene. Evidence to support this argument, however, is limited.

Organic farms in Hawaii have faced a more pressing challenge. Certified organic farms are prohibited from producing GM crops and if bees land on flowers of organic papaya trees after a buffet in a GM papaya field, DNA of the modified papaya will blend with that of the organic fruit so that its seeds are thus ""contaminated"". The fruit can no longer be sold at the lucrative ""organic"" price.

In Hong Kong, 9,000 km away from the vandalized farms in Hawaii, Augustine To Yat-man lost his only certified non-GM papaya tree early this summer. It came down during a tropical storm. The good news for To is that the lateral shoots growing from the broken trunk will grow into virtual clones of the certified tree and its fruit will be ready for harvest in just a few months.

Exposed to open air, however, To's organic papaya trees are now just as vulnerable as those in Hawaii.

""The problem is how necessary it was,"" he questioned. ""No one will die from a papaya hunger. It is ridiculous to work on this project with uncertainties,"" he added, entering his own doubts about the need for GM papayas.

In 2006, an NGO, the Green Produce Foundation, reported that transgenic papaya seeds were unwittingly distributed to the foundation in the spring of 2005. Green Produce described the error as ""heartbreaking"" as its organic farms had been growing and selling GM crops for a whole year.

Papayas do grow fast. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has tested DNA among engineered crops since 2008 and found out 35-61 percent of the papaya samples collected from local trees contained engineered genes. They are all over the place.

The prevailing theory points to villagers' habits: seeds of savory fruits are randomly dumped in their backyards and the subsequent cross-pollination has carried the viral resistant genes everywhere. Since organic farms have to bear the high cost of genetic modifications testing if the produce proves to have been result turns out to have been modified. As a result, certified farms in Hong Kong avoid growing papayas.

When the Genetically Modified Organisms (Control of Release) Ordinance kicked into effect on Sept 1 2011, papaya remained the only GM crop extensively grown in Hong Kong. The new law, enacted in accordance with the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, under the Convention on Biological Diversity, regulates the release of GM organisms into the environment. The ordinance specifies that if a GM organism is released into the environment, it must be destroyed, unless it is approved or exempted.

A controversial legislative process is underway aimed at excluding papayas from regulation. Augustine To, with other farmers and NGOs, formed a union in June demanding that the proposed exemption be thrown out.

He said: ""The government spared no resources to rectify the situation and turned a blind eye to it. Is this what a responsible government should do?""

To show what could be done, the union plans to designate a ""genetically modified organism-free (GMO-free) agricultural zone"" in the rural area of Hok Lau in Fanling. That plan is to swap other villagers' papaya trees with non-modified papaya seedlings on a voluntary basis. ""The villagers are not stubborn. I walked into a neighbor to tell her that 'my tree is better than yours' and offered the swap. She was happy about it.""

The official explanation of the AFCD is that according to a risk assessment required by the new ordinance, papaya is not a native plant and that its transgenic version is ""extremely unlikely"" to bring any adverse impact on the local habitat.

The unofficial obstacle is the vast spread of transgenic papaya trees. Augustine To estimated there are at least 500 papaya trees in the proposed ""GMO-free zone"" and his estimate for all of Hong Kong would be counted into ""many thousands"".

Jonathan Wong, director of Hong Kong Organic Resource Centre and a professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University, agreed the exemption is ""unfair to some degree"" to local organic farmers, but the entire GMO Ordinance might be rendered valueless if papayas are not exempted. ""If you enforce it against the papayas, how practical would it be?"" Provided that transgenic papayas are in the wild for several years, it has become difficult to reverse their potential impact on the habitat.

Wong does not support genetic engineering, but he does not deny the lack of strong evidence that the engineered papaya is harmful in any way. For instance, allergies attributed to transgenic papayas may have nothing to do with the engineered gene. ""We are talking about coexistence. One cannot write off the other. Conventional agriculture is still the mainstream.""

The center is now looking into ways to help the organic farmers, including recognition of a papaya fruit as organic even its seeds were contaminated by the viral resistant gene.

In the eye of a supporter of genetic modification, there is even a feeling that the intent of the ordinance has been ""somehow distorted"".

Lam Hon-ming, deputy director of the State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology at Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that the ordinance never was intended to imply that GM crops are dangerous, either for human consumption or for the environment.

""A procedure to follow and a prevention are two different concepts,"" he said.

He understands that advocates for organic farming would prefer ""the world to be wholly organic"", but with inadequate scientific proof to back their argument against modified crops, he said ""it does not make much sense to chop away others' trees because you want to protect your organic crop"".

Lam expressed concern even at the way the GMO ordinance is phrased, in that it stipulates the release of any such organism ""must not"" be approved by the Director of AFCD unless he is satisfied that ""possible adverse biosafety effect"" is acceptable or manageable. Wording such as this, Lam argues, might reinforce ""misinterpretation"" of the intent of the ordinance, adding that it appeared the law was drafted to satisfy the demands of pressure groups.

Green Produce Foundation, which was the recipient of the errant distribution of GM papaya seeds in 2005, is participating in the campaigning against exempting papaya crops for organic food standards. But in order to prevent the public from unwittingly GM plants in the future, the foundation argues the case also underlines the importance to enforcing mandatory labeling for engineered foods sold in the market.

Lam Hon-ming countered ""there is no real case to pursue"" a mandatory labeling that may involve a lot of public expenses.

The Executive Secretary of Green Produce Foundation Vicky Lau Yuen-yee said she hears differently from people in the food industry. She said if a mandatory labeling law were put in place, food companies would simply avoid the labeling hassle by switching to non-modified foods.

""We may have no confirmed evidence, but if there is concern, there should be mandatory labeling for consumers to make their own choice,"" she said, ""At least people should be informed about what they are buying.""

After all, it is the market that matters. Back at his organic farm deep in the woods, Augustine To admitted that public attention to the campaign has been limited and the government could just ignore their voice with all the procedures underway.

""In the end, we will leave the consumers to determine if our argument is important or not,"" he said.

A tag is tied to the organic papaya fruit sold in Wan Chai to inform customers not to plant the seeds, which might be contaminated by engineered genes.

Flames roar near Bastrop State Park as a wildfire burns out of control near Bastrop, Texas September 5, 2011. An estimated 1,000 homes are being threatened in Bastrop County, just east of Austin, as a 14,000-acre (5700-hectare) wildfire rages out of control, causing evacuations. [Photo/Agencies]

SAN ANTONIO - Sixty separate wildfires, whipped by strong winds, were burning across Texas on Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and killing at least two people, officials said.

Authorities in Gregg County, in northeast Texas, say a 20-year-old woman and her 18-month-old daughter were killed on Sunday when they were trapped in their mobile home by flames.

The Texas Forest Service estimates 424 homes may have been destroyed so far, including 300 from the so-called Bastrop County Complex fire east of Austin.

Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is running as a Republican presidential candidate, is cutting short his campaigning and returning from South Carolina to Texas on Monday.

""I urge Texans to take extreme caution as we continue to see the devastating effects of sweeping wildfires impacting both rural and urban areas of the state,"" Perry said in a statement.

Perry had been slated to participate in televised forum with other Republican candidates on Monday.

More than 3.6 million acres (1.5 million hectares) in Texas have been scorched by wildfires since November, fed by a continuing drought that has caused more than $5 billion in damage to the state's agricultural industry and shows no sign of easing any time soon.

The Texas Forest Service responded on Sunday to 63 new fires burning on more than 32,000 acres (13,000 hectares), including 22 new large fires.

Officials said the worst of the fires was the Bastrop County Complex fire, which stretched for 16 miles (26 km).

Officials said the fire had jumped a road that they had hoped to set up as a barrier, and has now spread to 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares).

""We have about 16 miles long at this time and about 6 miles wide (10 km),"" said Bastrop County Fire Chief Ronnie McDonald.

Residents said the fire had moved very quickly, driven by the strong, gusty winds.

""It's pretty dire,"" Justice Jones of the Forest Service said on Monday morning.

The Bastrop Complex fire has forced the evacuation of several subdivisions in the county of 70,000 people.

""This is a shock,"" said one man as he drove out of the fire zone near Bastrop with his family. ""We had some nice plans for Labor Day, and this gives you a sick feeling.""

The Texas Forest Service said dozens of aircraft were responding to fires, including four heavy airtankers, 15 single-engine airtankers, and 13 aerial supervision aircraft.

In the Steiner Ranch area of Austin, a separate fire has forced the evacuation of some 1,000 homes. One woman desperately scanned the wall of thick black smoke and flames looking for her lost dog.

""I was just driving around the neighborhood, I'm five months pregnant, and I was taking in smoke and I was freaking out,"" she said. ""I looked to the right of me and everything over there was full of fire, it was just gone.""

About 200 homes had to be evacuated due to a brush fire in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville, and about 150 homes were evacuated in Longview, in east Texas.

Workers prepare a wind turbine for shipment at the Gamesa factory in Tianjin. The company said it will invest in two new plants in China. Provided to China Daily

Beijing - Gamesa Corp Tecnologica SA, a leading Spanish wind turbine manufacturer, plans to invest 90 million euros ($128 million) by 2012 in China, the world's largest wind power country, said Jose Antonio Miranda, the newly appointed chairman of Gamesa China.

That figure includes investments in two new plants in Jilin province and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region this year.

China is planning to greatly expand its offshore wind power capacity to 5 gigawatt (gW) by 2015, and wind turbine manufacturers are preparing to capture the demand.

Gamesa is set to launch its first offshore prototype, the 5 megawatt (mW) G11x model, in the US next year. Meanwhile, it is developing the larger, 6 or 7 mW G14x wind turbine, which is expected to be operational in two or three years.

The new chairman hopes the G11x will be installed in China in two years.

But the Chinese manufacturer Sinovel Wind Co Ltd has already made a 6 mW wind turbine and is looking into following through with 10 mW turbines.

Though China represents more than 20 percent of its revenue globally, Gamesa's market share has been declining since 2005, when it commanded one-third of the market.

The wind power sector is seeing a trend of focusing on quality, while in the past it was growth, Miranda said.

""People have started to think about the quality of the machines and the real value of high quality products after the incidents in Gansu province,"" he said.

Four major incidents happened this year in Jiuquan, Gansu province, one of the country's major wind power bases, in which equipment failures led to 2,978 turbines being disconnected from the grid, raising concerns about the Chinese wind turbines.

The energy cost of running an offshore turbine will be huge in 20 years and low quality machinery that will eventually damage the investment return is a poor idea, Miranda said.

By the end of 2010, China's overall wind power capacity amounted to 44.73gW, up 73.3 percent from the previous year. From 2006 through 2009, the growth rate of the country's installed wind-energy capacity averaged 113 percent.

""We are seeing consolidation in the onshore market and hopefully we will gain even more market share in the process, "" Miranda said.

Growth in the onshore wind power sector will slow due to tightening financing, and a switch of focus to quality, he said.

Seeing itself as more than just a wind turbine maker, Gamesa is also looking at the wind farm business and has more than 2,900 mW of capacity in the pipeline to be developed in China.

NEW YORK - On that fateful September morning, renowned artist Xu Bing was groggily getting up after a late night at work in his Brooklyn art studio. He turned on the television to find that New York had changed forever.

Xu Bing's display, lines of a poem written in the dust of 9/11, indicates how suddenly life can end. [Photo/China Daily]

He ran outside and watched as the second plane hit. Then he saw the buildings collapse. The scene felt like a movie, too enormous to comprehend, he said.

But in the following days, as the scope of the damage became clear, he ventured into Manhattan to collect dust from the fallen towers because he wasn't sure what else to do.

""9/11 really made me feel that my life was tied to the city,"" he said. ""Before 9/11 I had always felt that I was an outsider in New York, but that day changed everything. The city will always be a part of my life.""

That dust is now part of a new installation called ""Where does the dust itself collect?"", on display at The Spinning Wheel Building in New York.

In a 25-by-20-foot area, Xu has spelled out the outlines of a Chan Buddhist poem: ""As there is nothing from the first, where does the dust itself collect?""

Visitors are invited to view the piece from a raised platform.

Co-hosted by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and Chinatown's Museum of Chinese in America, the exhibition has been timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of 9/11 and will be on display through Oct. 9. Although the exhibit has shown previously in Berlin, Sao Paolo and Wales, where it won the first-ever Artes Mundi Prize, the piece was never shown in New York.

""It's very special and it means a lot to me that I am able to exhibit in New York for the anniversary,"" Xu said. ""I've been reflecting about this show. On my way from China to New York for this exhibition, security was incredibly heavy. We've been dealing with heightened airport security for ten years now. We are so conditioned and adapted to this new reality, but when you really stop and think about it, we've come to live in a truly strange world.""

Xu began conceptualizing the installation in 2002 but struggled with it, he said.

""I think it's very difficult to represent such a traumatizing event. In the face of such enormous tragedy, art becomes weak. On the other hand, there's a traditional Chinese saying that you should use lighter symbolic things to deal with very heavy matters.""

Andrew Horwitz, director of public programs for lower Manhattan council, compared the piece to a ""totem.""

""What I find most compelling about it is that it uses the physical evidence of 9/11 in juxtaposition with this Zen poem and while the dust is tangible and real, the idea of the poem is ephemeral,"" he said.

""It's a balance between the physical world and the non-physical world. It speaks to the ephemeral nature of our lives and how quickly what we know and the world we live in can be reduced to dust.""

Xu said that he chose this poem in particular because of the tension it addresses between the physical and spiritual worlds.

""Which realm is ultimately more powerful or everlasting? I find that very interesting,"" he said.

Xu is best known for his controversial 1988 piece, ""Book from the Sky,"" which featured thousands of nonsensical characters that appeared to be Chinese, printed on panels and scrolls. In 1994 he debuted ""Square Word Calligraphy,"" using English words and letters to create characters that also appeared Chinese in structure and style.

A collection of his work titled ""The Living Word"" is currently on exhibition at the Morgan Library and Museum, and a separate collection called the ""Tobacco Project"" is on display at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts through December.

""Xu Bing is very important, not just as a Chinese artist but as an artist of his generation,"" said Herb Tam, the curator for the Museum of Chinese in America.

""What separates him from other artists in the Chinese avant-garde movement is that he still maintains touchstones of traditional Chinese art. Even though this 9/11 piece doesn't overtly mark itself as being Chinese, it does connect to a deep spirituality that can be interpreted as Asian. [Xu] maintains a provocateur sensibility in the same way that other artists have done, but he's also much more tied into and captivated with the traditional Chinese-ness of where his work comes from.""

Mike Fu, the Events Program Coordinator for Columbia University's Weatherhead East Asian Institute, attended the reception because he was familiar with Xu's work.

""What he does is so provocative and interesting,"" he said. ""He's incredibly influential and well-connected in the art world. I think that his work really forces you to reevaluate your assumptions about culture."" The exhibition also attempts to recognize the effects of the tragedy on Manhattan's Chinatown, said Nicola Salvage, director of marketing and communications at lower Manhattan council.

""I think that people generally focus more on the perspective of the families who were affected by 9/11 directly, and that's understandable,"" she said. ""But people forget that there were many other communities that were affected by the tragedy. Chinatown is such a small, tightly knit community, and the effects on tourism and the lives of the people who live there were underrepresented in the mainstream media.""

In addition to Xu's exhibition, lower Manhattan council is hosting an initiative titled ""InSite: Art + Commemoration,"" featuring free arts events and a multimedia web site honoring the 10-year anniversary, Salvage said.

The New York City government recently gave Xu Bing a piece of 9/11 debris, he said. He hasn't decided what he will do with the piece yet.

""But first, I plan to bring it back to China,"" he said. ""Over a hundred Chinese people died on 9/11, and they also deserve to be honored.""","Mon, 12 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/images/911/attachement/jpg/site1/20110912/0013729e4a600fd78b0306.jpg,"['chinese', 'exhibit', 'artist', 'xu', 'manhattan', 'piece', 'art', 'anniversary', 'honored', 'dust', 'feels', '911', 'poem', 'york', 'exhibition']", ,none
16,16,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Ancient Incan agriculture revived due to climate change - Public Radio International PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-09-09/ancient-incan-agriculture-revived-due-climate-change,"Story from PRI's The World. Listen to audio above for full report.

To get to some of Peru's most remote Andean communities, you head out over pockmarked dirt roads from a small town already 10,000 feet up. Up – up – up — past llamas and alpacas and sheep and cows. The vegetation thins out and the air becomes even thinner. Your lungs clamor for oxygen and you're offered coca leaves to help adjust to the altitude.

And then, after four hypnotic hours, you've arrived – at a patch of sparse farmland near the town of Pomacocha, at 13,000 feet an outpost at pretty much the upper limits of agriculture.

For centuries, Pomacocha's thousand or so residents have grown corn in the fertile valleys below the town and potatoes on slopes that push against the sky above, fed by seasonal rains and glacial streams.

But climate change is hitting the high Andes hard. Temperature and precipitation swings are becoming more extreme, the glaciers are shrinking fast, and a tough place to farm is becoming even tougher.

So to help them deal with an uncertain future, residents are looking back in time—to before the arrival of Europeans.

From a field of brown soil, Pomacocha resident Mariano Ccaccya unearths a small, pink potato—a huaña, one of the first to be grown here in decades. The huaña is the native potato in this part of Peru, but Ccaccya says it had fallen out of favor in recent decades and was about to disappear.

Huaña are bitter, Ccaccya says, and it takes a lot of work to make them palatable. But he says there are good reasons to grow them in times of increasing uncertainty.

Ccaccya, who's the local head of a nonprofit group that's leading an effort to revive ancient Andean crops, says huañas can be stored for two or three years, more than four times as long as most other potatoes. Ccaccya's colleague Adripino Jayo says huañas also resist frost, hail, extreme rain and drought.

""It's very, very strong,"" Jayo says. ""Now that we're in the crisis of climate change, it's worth recovering these potatoes.""

Others think so too. Jayo and Ccaccya's organization, Cusichaca Andina, recently won a grant from the World Bank to further its efforts to promote a variety of resilient ancient Andean crops, including quinoa, amaranth, and different types of potatoes and squashes.

But changing what's grown here is only part of the plan. Cusichaca Andina is also looking to the past to try to change how crops are grown.

On a steep slope in a valley about two hours from the potato fields, Jayo pulls away a stand of brush to reveal an overgrown rock wall. He says the stones are part of a long-abandoned system of agricultural terraces, built into Peru's mountains by the Incas more than 500 years ago.

Terraces like these once blanketed thousands of square miles of the Andes, and were described in the 17th century book The Royal Commentaries of the Incas, by Garcilaso de la Vega.

""They built level terraces on the mountains and hillsides, wherever the soil was good,"" De la Vega wrote. ""And these are to be seen today in Cusco and in the whole of Peru.""

Just a small fraction of the terraces are still used today. After the European conquest, Spanish crops and agricultural systems largely displaced traditional ones.

But here in Pomacocha, old terraces are being restored, and new ones are being built.

Ccaccya says they have a lot of benefits. The terraces help channel water for irrigation while avoiding erosion. They can hold water for months, which is crucial in a place with only intermittent access to water. And plants grown on them are more productive, he says.

Cusichaca Andina is also working on reviving another ancient technology for holding and transporting scarce water—Incan irrigation systems that Garcilaso de la Vega called ""extraordinary.""

""The Cisterns, or Conservatories, were about twelve foot deep, in channels made of hewn stone,"" de la Vega wrote, ""and rammed in with earth so hard, that no water could pass between… But the Spaniards little regarded the convenience of these works, but rather out of a scornful and disdaining humor, have suffered them unto ruin, beyond all recovery.""

Centuries later, the digging and hammering of a handful of men near Pomacocha suggests that the ruin of the Incan irrigation channels was perhaps not quite beyond all recovery. The workers are chiseling and lining up stones along a long-abandoned canal once used to divert water from a nearby spring.

""It's always been here,"" Jayo says, pointing at the stone canal. ""It's probably from pre-Incan times, but it's still useful for irrigation, with a little help.""

Cusichaca Andina and other groups in the Andes have recovered these and other ancient agricultural treasures through a combination of archaeology and exploring local traditions. And they're teaching communities throughout the Peruvian high Andes how to rebuild and use them, along with other ancient agricultural techniques.

It's all part of an effort to increase the resilience and food security.

But the leaders of Cusichaca Andina realize they can only make a small dent in a vast need. Jayo says the Peruvian government has a big role to play as well.

""We see the difficulties in the national context,"" Jayo says. He says the group wants politicians in Lima to apply what it's doing across all of the Andes.

So far national politicians haven't picked up that slack.

But the work here may have relevance to mountainous regions beyond Peru. For instance Cusichaca Andina's founder, British archaeologist Ann Kendall, recently traveled to China. The world's largest country faces huge challenges from climate change and water shortages. And it also happens to have its own system of ancient mountain terraces that Kendall thinks may just be waiting to be revived.

Retired NBA star Yao Ming may ""go back to school and get very fundamental study"" at one of China's most prestigious universities this fall.

""I'm thinking about going back to school this fall,"" the towering former Houston Rockets center told US sports writer Graham Bensinger during an exclusive interview in Shanghai.

""I think education is very, very important. Remember the NBA Cares. Always tell read to achieve, read to achieve. How can you not read to achieve and then tell other kids to read to achieve?"" Yao said during the first interview since his retirement in July.（Note: NBA Cares is a program that NBA sponsors help poor kids learn to read and study.）

The Chinese basketball legend is ready to make up for his missed school days, which according to Yao ended when he was 17. He plans to go to Shanghai Jiaotong University, one of China's oldest and top public research universities based in Yao's hometown of Shanghai.

But which major Yao Ming will choose to study is unclear until this October, Yao's agent Zhang Mingji was quoted as saying by Chengdu Business Daily, a local Chinese newspaper based in Southwest China's Sichuan province.

""Yao Ming will definitely not have classes like those freshmen. He will have special teachers arranged by the university,"" Zhang said.

Yao expressed his desire to go back to college life but it would be hard for him.

""It's harder for me. It's a different life. The professional life just needs you to manage yourself, but…You cannot stop working and you have to keep thinking in college,"" Yao said during the Bensinger interview. ""(I need to) Go back to training my idea and thinking, and that is very very important.""

During the one-on-one interview, Yao Ming also mentioned he started thinking about retirement in 2009 when he had been hesitating about reconstructive surgery but his doctor warned him of life in a wheelchair or crutches by age 50 without the timely surgery.

""So I ask him, 'What if I had this surgery? What is the chance for me to back on court?' And he said, 'You can play basketball again, but nothing is guaranteed.'""

Yao revealed an annoyance to Bensinger that most people may not know – he has been deaf in his left ear since age 8 after a high fever, but the deafness doesn't have much impact on the basketball ace's life.

""I'm living well… I still can clearly hear from my right side,"" according to Yao.

Weight soars about 10kg

Yao told Bensinger he could ""focus on sharks, some other businesses and his foundation"" after ending his professional career as a basketball player two months ago.

""Now I have to spend double the time (that I've spent on basketball court) in meeting rooms, sometimes 15-16 hours in two days.""

Yao said he also put on weight because he has not been working out much since retirement. ""I'm getting fat... because my size, I've put on 20 or 30 pounds (9Kg or 13kg), but it doesn't show very much. I'm thinking about going back to work out in a very short time.""","Tue, 06 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110908/0022190dec450fd2658f06.jpg,"['bensinger', 'fall', 'ming', 'basketball', 'yao', 'interview', 'nba', 'thinking', 'school', 'read', 'life']", ,none

BEIJING - The capital city will cap its annual coal consumption at 20 million tons by 2015, as part of its plan to release less carbon and further reduce air pollution, the municipal commission of development and reform said on Monday.

The city will rely on other forms of energy, such as natural gas, petrol, diesel and import electricity from other provinces, to meet its increasing energy demand.

""With the city continuing to expand and more people settling in Beijing, the energy demand is set to increase, so the pressure to further bring down energy and carbon intensity is mounting,"" said Wang Yingjian, a senior official from the municipal commission of development and reform.

Beijing is the country's second largest energy consumer, and by 2015 its total energy consumption is expected to reach 90 million tons of coal equivalent, an increase of about 20 million tons from the 2010 level.

According to the commission, Beijing aims by 2015 to reduce its energy consumption for each 10,000 yuan ($1,566) of GDP by 17 percent compared with the 2010 level and carbon emissions by 18 percent.

The green goals are slightly stricter than the five-year national energy target of 16 percent and carbon intensity target of 17 percent.

Construction, vehicles and residential electricity consumption account for the bulk of the city's greenhouse gas emissions, according to Guo Qingshan, deputy director of the municipal commission's environment and resource department.

""We will continue to prioritize the development of public transport systems, and improve traffic efficiency through city planning,"" said Wang.

Between 2006 and 2010, Beijing cut its energy intensity by 26.59 percent, which was the best performance in the country.

""Beijing already boasts higher carbon productivity than most other cities in the country, thanks to its optimized industrial structure,"" said Zou Ji, China director of the World Resources Institute, a US-based environmental think tank.

The output of Beijing's service industry now accounts for 75 percent of the city's total revenue, which helps the city maintain a rapid economic growth without putting too much carbon into the air, said Zou.

To achieve its green goals, Beijing will also replace four large-scale coal-fired power plants with natural-gas electricity generation systems.

It will also increase the share of renewable energy in the whole energy mix from 3.2 percent in 2010 to 6 percent by 2015, officials said.

19,19,DR-2011-000121-CHN,"Radical changes in agriculture needed for food, water security - eco-business.com",https://www.eco-business.com/news/radical-changes-in-agriculture-needed-for-food-water-security/,"Experts in water, agriculture and conservation banded together at last week’s World Water Week in Stockholm to call for a major shift in global policies on agriculture and natural resource management, a change they said was urgently needed for future food and water security.

The call to action came on the back of a study released on during the conference by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Sri-Lanka headquartered International Water Management Institute (IWMI), which found that current agricultural trends are destroying the world’s natural resources, particularly its water supplies.

The study, An Ecosystem Services Approach to Water and Food Security, recommended urgent action to integrate greener farming methods and the conservation of natural areas to ensure food security and protect water sources.

Farming accounts for 70 to 90 per cent of water use in some areas, noted the authors of the study, who warned that in some of the world’s largest growing regions, including the ‘breadbaskets’ of northern China plains, Punjab in India and the Western United States, water was being used faster than sources could be replenished.

“Agriculture is both a major cause and victim of ecosystem degradation,” said IWMI’s scientific editor Eline Boelee in a statement.

She added that increasing agricultural production in a sustainable way i s a priority for future food security, but that “we need to take a more holistic ‘landscape’ approach.”

To achieve a ‘landscape’ approach, experts from IWMI and UNEP recommended ‘agroecosystems’, meaning systems whereby planning for food production and other land uses is integrated into a broader plan – one that ensures clean water, clean air and biodiversity for the long term.

Implementation will require combining the efforts of the agricultural sector and natural resource managers and advocates - two interest groups which have been traditionally separate and often in conflict, they noted.

Deputy director general for research at IWMI, David Molden, said, “The various political, research and community alliances now emerging are challenging the notion that we have to choose between food security and ecosystem health by making it clear that you can’t have one without the other.”

He noted that recent alliances between agricultural and conservation groups are blurring the lines between sustainable farming and natural resource protection. “For instance, UNEP has adopted food security as a new strategic concern. And IWMI and its partners in the CGIAR are developing a multi-million dollar research program that will look at water as an integral part of ecosystems to help solve issues of water scarcity, land and environmental degradation,” he added.

The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is host to IWMI and brings together research groups from around the world to find solutions to agricultural and food security issues.

Experts from UNEP and IWMI agree that agencies and organisations that manage agriculture, water resources, wildlife, forests and other natural resources often operate in isolation, and that much greater cooperation is needed for a sustainable approach to food production.

A separate study from IWMI, Wetlands, Agriculture and Poverty Reduction, found that efforts to preserve wetlands by excluding agriculture can actually increase the rate of destruction of the eco-system. IWMI’s Matthew McCartney, who co-authored the wetlands report, said, “Blanket prohibitions against cultivation do not always reduce ecosystem destruction and can make things worse.”

He cited an example of a farming ban on grassy wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa that led to grazing in the wetlands and deforestation upstream of the wetlands, both of which had greater negative environmental impacts than the earlier farming methods.

“What is needed is a balance: appropriate farming practices that support sustainable food production and protect ecosystems,” said Mr McCartney.

IWMI’s Mr Molden said it was essential to change the way modern societies view water and ecosystems and the way people interact with them.

One relationship society will need to understand is the inevitable link between growing enough food to feed communities and having a healthy water supply.

While a person consumes on average 2 to 4 litres of water per day for drinking, producing the food they eat requires 2,000 to 5,000 litres of water. With the world’s population expected to grow by 2.7 billion people by 2050, pressure on water resources will increase dramatically.

At the same time, the natural systems that store, filter and protect those water resources are increasingly degraded. China’s official agency reported recently that over the past 50 years, roughly 1,000 of the nation’s 3,000 natural lakes have disappeared. Other strains on water resources include rising pollution in waterways, plummeting levels in ground aquifers and lowered dam levels due to drought and damaged ecosystems.

“Managing water for food and ecosystems will bring great benefits, but there is no escaping the urgency of this situation. We are heading for disaster if we don’t change our practices from business as usual,” said Mr Molden.

World Water Week has been hosted annually by the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) since 1991 and brings together experts and decision-makers from around the globe to find solutions to pressing water issues.

One-third of top 50 also delegates of National People's Congress, CPPCC

SHANGHAI - The Sany Group's founder Liang Wengen is China's richest man with a fortune of 70 billion yuan ($11 billion), according to the Hurun Rich List 2011.

The list, released by the Hurun Research Institute on Wednesday, showed that the nation's most affluent group continued to expand rapidly this year, buoyed by China's unceasing construction boom and growing retail market.

It has been a record year for China's rich, despite the ongoing difficulties of the world economy.

The number of US dollar billionaires on the list shot up to 271 from 189 last year and 130 in 2009.

The cut-off point to make the top 1,000 on the Hurun list jumped to $310 million, compared with $220 million last year and $150 million in 2009. The average wealth hit $924 million.

""China's rich have defied the global financial crisis with another record year of growth,"" said Rupert Hoogewerf, the institute's chairman and chief researcher.

Another driver for the growth in wealth has been a large number of successful stock market listings.

Twenty-nine individuals in the top 50 count property as one of their main sources of wealth.

The super-rich are well-connected too, the report said. About one-third of those in the top 50 are delegates to the National People's Congress or Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, or are senior Party members.

With China's construction explosion showing few signs of slowing, Liang's heavy construction equipment is in strong demand and his Sany Group has come a long way since its founding in 1989 as a small welding materials factory in central China's Hunan province.

Liang's $11 billion fortune is based on his 58 percent stake in Sany, which currently contains two listed companies. The 55-year-old plans to go public with the entire operation next year.

Another member of the super-rich, Zong Qinghou, founder of food and beverage giant Hangzhou Wahaha Group, fell to second place this year from first in 2010.

The 66-year-old's company has seen profit margins squeezed, resulting in a drop in his wealth from $12 billion last year to $10.7 billion this year, even though sales rose about 30 percent.

Zong was followed by 43-year-old Robin Li, CEO and co-founder of Baidu Inc and the youngest of the top 10 with a net worth of $8.8 billion.

Google Inc's withdrawal from the Chinese market last year has allowed Baidu to build on its dominance in the Chinese-language Internet search services.

Hidden billionaires

The real number of China's wealthiest people is probably a lot more than 271, since there are an estimated 300 hidden US dollar billionaires.

""You can double the real number of billionaires in China to nearer 600,"" Hoogewerf said.

More broadly, China has 960,000 individuals with personal wealth of 10 million yuan or more, according to the Hurun Wealth Report 2011 released in April, up 85,000 or 9.7 percent year-on-year.

The average rich lister on the Hurun Rich List 2011 is 51 years old. On average, these individuals left government jobs at age 33 and invested in what are now their main businesses at 37.

It took the average entrepreneur 10 years to list their company, and many started to cash out last year, according to the institute.

Not only are China's rich getting richer, but they are also becoming increasingly generous, according to the Hurun Philanthropy List 2011, a ranking of the 100 most generous individuals measured by the value of their cash or cash-equivalent donations over the past year.

Cao Dewang and his family donated $700 million in the past year, taking the title of China's most generous philanthropist.

TOKYO - Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda, a fiscal hawk, will become Japan's sixth prime minister in five years after winning a ruling party vote on Monday, an outcome likely to please investors worried about a bulging public debt.

Noda, 54, who defeated Trade Minister Banri Kaieda in a run-off vote, must cope with a resurgent yen that threatens exports, forge a new energy policy while ending the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl, and find funds to rebuild from the March 11 tsunami at a time when huge public debt has already triggered a credit downgrade.

Financial markets, political commentators and the Japanese public are sceptical whether the new leader will have the vision, determination and time to tackle those challenges.

Bond markets are expected to welcome the choice of Noda, who among the candidates has been the only one consistently calling for Japan to face painful reforms to rein in the country's ballooning debt.

Government bond futures nudged higher after Noda made it into the second round of voting although the Topix share index erased its gains after he won the final vote.

""Let's do the utmost to tackle what we have promised and if there's not enough money, we might ask the people to share the burden,"" Noda said before the vote, in a reference to future tax hikes.

Like Kan, the new leader -- to be formally voted in by parliament on Tuesday -- faces a divided legislature and internal party rifts, raising concerns that he will join a gallery of short-lived prime ministers.

No Japanese prime minister has lasted much more than a year since 2006 and most market players polled by Reuters this month thought the next government head would be no exception.

REVOLVING DOOR LEADERS

In a rare moment of levity ahead of the vote, the jowly Noda compared himself to a ""dojo"" loach fish -- an eel-like denizen of the deep.

""I do look like this and if I become prime minister, the support rate would not rise, so I would not call a snap election. A loach has its own abilities even though it cannot do as a goldfish does.""

The results were announced by a party official after paper ballots were fed into a counting machine.

Noda has said Japan should not build new nuclear reactors, effectively phasing out nuclear power over 40 years, although he wants to restart off-line reactors after safety checks to avoid a power crunch. Japan relied on nuclear power for about 30 percent of its electricity before the Fukushima crisis.

Sceptics worry whether Noda will last any longer than his five predecessors, each of whom left office after about a year.

Moody's Investors Service cut Japan's sovereign credit rating last week citing a buildup of public debt and a lack of leadership and a long-term strategy to cope with its fiscal challenges.

Instead of a deep debate over how to end Japan's decades of stagnation and revitalize the world's third-biggest economy, the leadership race had turned into a battle between allies and critics of Ichiro Ozawa, a 69-year-old political mastermind who heads the party's biggest group even as he faces trial on charges of misreporting political donations.

Defeated candidate Kaieda was backed by Ozawa, while Noda was supported by his critics.

One of the new leader's first challenges will be seeking opposition help in parliament, where the opposition controls the upper house and can block legislation. Noda has floated the idea of a ""grand coalition"" with opposition rivals -- although the two biggest opposition groups have been cool.","Mon, 29 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110829/0013729e48090fc5705e14.jpg,"['public', 'wins', 'party', 'japans', 'vote', 'opposition', 'noda', 'japanese', 'japan', 'prime', 'nuclear', 'minister']", ,none

Mountains are clearly close to ink artist Ma Jizhong's heart.

The native of Shaanxi province, which is home to the Qinling Range, says, ""I spent my youthful years in mountainous areas, and mountains have become the fountain of my artistic inspiration Actually, mountains are the refuge of my soul.""

He was speaking at the opening of his exhibition that runs through Sept 12 at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing.

Ma's five-decade oeuvre includes caricature, New Year pictures, ink figure paintings, and picture-story illustrations.

But he is best known for miti shanshui (dense landscapes), a less popular genre of Chinese ink landscape paintings, that emerged in the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) and reached its height in the Yuan Dynasty, thanks to master painter Wang Meng (1301-1385).

""The creation of a piece of miti shanshui is not only time-consuming but also technically demanding,"" explains Xue Yongnian, art critic with the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

A typical miti shanshui work often, if not always, is a well-proportioned composition on a huge rice paper scroll. Deftness in Chinese calligraphy is a prerequisite for a miti shanshui painter as the lines, dots and patches of the landscapes are all rendered in calligraphy style. Any completed miti shanshui piece must be done with great care to detail and the overall look should be such that whether viewed from afar or up-close, the painting retains its vivid look, Xue says.

This explains why very few modern painters go down this path, Xue says, pointing out that Huang Qiuyuan (1914-1979), Zhang Ding (1917-2010) and Yang Shanshen (1913-2004) were among the few courageous ones who did.

""My decades-long experience of living and working in the mountains of my home province has convinced me that this genre best suits the natural beauty of the mountains of northern China,"" explains the 70-year-old.

Born into a Catholic family in Feicheng, Shandong province, in 1941, Ma had a tumultuous childhood, defined by wars, natural disasters and abrupt family changes.

""My mother married three times just to keep her five kids alive amid a time of chaos,"" recalls Ma, who moved to Xi'an in the late 1940s where his early interest in painting was encouraged by his primary and middle school teachers.

Ma was first trained in basic Western painting techniques at Xi'an Fine Art Academy from 1958 to 1962. In 1969, he moved to the mountainous areas of Taibai county and worked for the next two decades in a culture center where he trained himself in ink art.

In late 1988, Ma moved back to Xi'an where his unique painting style attracted critical attention.

Although Ma lives in the city, he continues to be drawn to the mountains.

""I feel an invisible bond with the mountains the lush trees, the chirping birds, the gurgling springs, and the simple but healthy life of the local residents, all gladden my heart.

""I will paint the mountains all my life.""

One of the 16 Jiahu bone flutes in the collection of Henan Museum. Provided to China Daily

Editor's Note: Every week we look at a work of art or a cultural relic that puts the spotlight on China's heritage.

Music is as old as mankind and has taken as many forms as human evolution.

In 1987, 16 bone flutes which date back to around 6,000 BC were excavated from an early Neolithic tomb in Jiahu, Central China's Henan province. These bone flutes, the nation's oldest known musical instruments, are much older than flutes excavated in Mesopotamia and appeared 2,000 years earlier than in Egypt.

In ancient times, superstition and witchcraft were invoked to explain natural phenomena and bone flutes were used as the medium to link God and humans in sacrificial rites.

The Jiahu bone flutes, now kept in Henan Museum, and still playable, are made of the wing bones of red-crowned cranes and are about 20 cm long. They are open-ended and their finger holes vary from five to eight, although most have seven. The best-preserved one is 22 cm long and has seven holes.

Several half-way marks have been discovered on some of these bone flutes, which indicate that the number of holes and the distances between them were accurately measured and amended before drilling, to ensure they accorded with the musical range in which the flutes were intended to function.

Once these flutes were made, a smaller hole was sometimes drilled beside a few finger holes to correct the deviation of intonation. This technique is still in use in Chinese instrument making.

""The discovery of the Jiahu bone flutes has improved our understanding of Chinese music history stretching back 10,000 years,"" says Chinese music expert Xiao Xinghua, who has studied bone flutes for more than 10 years.

But the discovery of Jiahu bone flutes also leaves many unsolved mysteries, Xiao adds. For example, the finger holes are only 0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter. How were such small and smooth holes drilled? What kind of tools did the flute makers use?

Another enigma concerns the flute makers' mathematical abilities and musical temperament. Only if both of these had existed to a high degree could they have determined the number of finger holes on each flute and their spacing so that all the finger holes were positioned to provide the perfect intonation on bones of varying length and thickness.

Yoga students hang like bats from the ceiling of a loft space in the heart of Manhattan's fashion district. In the Om Factory yoga studio, situated in a former garment factory, practitioners call it ""antigravity"" yoga.

The company website claims this combination of traditional yoga, aerial acrobatics, dance Pilates and calisthenics assists students realign their bodies. The hammocks allows students to hold and balance in difficult yoga poses longer, helping them gain better kinesthetic awareness. It also helps them build strength and become more flexible. Hanging upside down is also thought to help decompress the vertebrae.

Traditional yoga has many styles, which aim to help practitioners gain strength, flexibility, breath control, spiritual awareness and realignment of the body. Yoga teachers will often incorporate props to help students work their way into poses. One style uses a very hot room to add a different element to the practice. It is difficult to say how many people practice yoga but according to a BBC story in 2009, more than 30 million people practice it worldwide.","Sun, 11 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110911/0022190dec450fd649643a.jpg,"['students', 'om', 'practice', 'chinadailycomcn', 'help', 'practitioners', 'poses', 'antigravity', 'factory', 'gain', 'yoga']", ,none

Three Czech ice hockey world champions, a Swedish Olympic and world champion and a Slovak great were among the victims of a plane disaster that killed dozens north of Moscow on Wednesday, officials said.

The disaster was feared to have killed 43 people on the charter flight carrying one of Russia's top ice hockey teams, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, form Tunoshna north of Moscow for a Continental Hockey League (KHL) match in the Belarussian capital Minsk.

The three Czechs were Jan Marek, Karel Rachunek and Josef Vasicek, all stars of the national side that won the world championship six times since 1996, the Czech embassy in Moscow said.

""This is a shock; Not only were they excellent hockey players but also great friends and people,"" said Czech ice hockey association chief Tomas Kral on news website www.idnes.cz.

The Slovak foreign ministry said there was one Slovak victim, and that the only Slovak national on the passenger list was Pavol Demitra, a Slovak forward who led the national side at last year's world Championship.

Rachunek, who turned 32 in August, played for Ottawa Senators for three years starting in 1997, and later for New York Rangers and New Jersey Devils. He scored an equaliser against Sweden seven seconds from time in the 2010 world championship semi-finals which the Czechs eventually won.

Marek, 31, had become a popular forward in the KHL, playing initially for Magnitogorsk before joining Yaroslavl.

Vasicek won the Stanley Cup with Carolina Hurricanes in 2006, and scored the final goal in the Czech Republic's 3-0 win against Canada in the world championship final in 2005.

Swedish ice hockey player Stefan Liv was also among the 43 perished hockey players on Wednesday, the Swedish Embassy in Moscow confirmed to news agency TT.

The 30-year-old national team goalkeeper, an Olympic and world champion in 2006, was killed along with many of his team mates when the plane came down shortly after taking off for a flight to Belarussian capital Minsk. Two passengers survived but were in a grave condition.

""We are in mourning, and our thoughts are with those close to him and his relatives,"" Swedish Hockey Association chairman Christer Englund said in a statement on the association's website (www.svenskhockey.se).

28,28,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Frank McCourt is offered $1.2 billion for Dodgers - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-xpm-2011-sep-01-la-sp-dodgers-mccourt-sale-20110902-story.html,"In an international twist in the Dodgers’ ownership saga, Frank McCourt has been offered $1.2 billion to sell the team to a group indirectly financed by the government of China.

The bid is headed by Los Angeles Marathon founder Bill Burke, according to a letter sent to McCourt on Tuesday. The letter was disclosed to The Times by two people familiar with its content but not authorized to discuss it publicly.

The proposed sale price would set a record for a Major League Baseball team. However, the bid was received with skepticism within MLB, where executives wondered whether the proposal might be used by McCourt to stir negotiations with other potential buyers or to persuade a Bankruptcy Court judge to keep McCourt in charge of the team.

“There are questions within the sports industry about whether this is a genuine offer,” said one industry consultant who works extensively with MLB and other professional sports leagues.

The offer was unsolicited, according to a person who had spoken with McCourt’s representatives but was not authorized to discuss the conversation.

It is uncertain whether the embattled Dodgers owner is receptive to the offer. McCourt has said that he had no interest in selling the Dodgers and that he intended to remain the owner after the team emerges from bankruptcy protection.

Steve Sugerman, a spokesman for McCourt, declined to comment on whether McCourt had received the letter and whether he would consider selling the team.

In a brief telephone interview, Burke declined to discuss the bid. “I have no comment at this time,” he said.

Forbes magazine estimates the Dodgers’ worth at $800 million. McCourt bought the Dodgers for $430 million in 2004, and the team and related entities carry debts of “over $550 million,” according to a June 20 letter sent to McCourt from MLB Commissioner Bud Selig.

The bid terms proposed by the Burke group call for an all-cash payment to buy the Dodgers, all real estate related to the team and the team’s media rights, according to the letter. Attorneys for McCourt have said he could try to keep Dodger Stadium and the surrounding parking lots even if he sold the team.

The offer would expire in 21 days, according to the letter, with the goal of closing a deal within 90 days, subject to the approvals of MLB and the Bankruptcy Court.

The letter did not say whether the bid would be subject to the approval of Jamie McCourt, the ex-wife of Frank McCourt, who claims half-ownership of the team. But Jamie McCourt probably would endorse a deal since she had asked the judge overseeing the couple’s divorce to order the Dodgers sold, a request that was then withdrawn in deference to the Bankruptcy Court.

The bid was presented on behalf of the Burke group by Signal Capital Management of New York. The firm has offices in Beijing, according to its website. Shane Rodgers, its chairman and chief executive officer, said in an email that the firm would not comment “on any potential or proposed transactions.”

The letter did not specify who would finance the Burke bid, other than to say the money would come from “certain state-owned investment institutions of the People’s Republic of China” and unidentified American investors. Foreign investment is not necessarily an obstacle to MLB ownership; the Seattle Mariners’ ownership group includes a significant Japanese presence.

McCourt has spoken with at least two other groups about a sale of some portion of the Dodgers and could use the $1.2 billion as a minimum value in those discussions, said a person familiar with them but not authorized to talk about them publicly.

McCourt also could cite the offer in Bankruptcy Court to counter MLB claims he has irreparably mismanaged the team.

It is uncertain whether sale discussions with any group might explain why McCourt’s attorneys have yet to pursue the cable television rights sale that they said would be the key to getting the Dodgers out of Bankruptcy Court.

Bruce Bennett, the Dodgers’ lead bankruptcy attorney, had promised to move forward on the issue at an Aug. 16 court hearing but did not do so. Fox Sports has threatened to sue for damages if the Dodgers void the two years remaining on the current cable contract to pursue a new one.

McCourt has discussed the sale of at least a partial share of the Dodgers with at least two other groups, said a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. It is unlikely Selig would sanction any deal that did not include an exit path for McCourt, but McCourt has signaled his intent to challenge Selig’s authority in court.

The record sale price for a major league franchise is $845 million, set two years ago when the Ricketts family bought the Chicago Cubs from Tribune Co., publisher of The Times.

That deal included the team, Wrigley Field and a 25% stake in a cable sports channel. The Burke group proposes paying almost half again as much for the Dodgers, their stadium and a chance to start a cable sports channel or negotiate a new cable television contact.

Despite the Forbes estimate, the team could be worth from $900 million to $1.1 billion, said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd, a Chicago-based sports industry consulting firm.

But with Fox at risk of losing the Dodgers to rival Time Warner’s fledgling Lakers channel, the bidding on the TV rights could be so robust that the team itself could fetch $1.2 billion or more in “a full-fledged auction” in Bankruptcy Court, said a prominent sports investment banker, who declined to be identified because he could represent potential bidders for the Dodgers.

Burke sold the Los Angeles Marathon in 2004, building the race into one of the largest in the United States but jousting with city officials in various financial skirmishes, including disputes over reimbursement for city services and ownership of the L.A. Marathon name. Burke is the husband of retired Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.

Burke sold the race to Devine Racing. In 2008, Devine sold the marathon to McCourt.

29,29,DR-2011-000121-CHN,City of Zibo has its eye on new materials|Zibo Special|chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-09/03/content_13610594.htm,"City of Zibo has its eye on new materials Updated: 2011-09-03 07:49 By Zhao Ruixue (China Daily)

Prominent scientist Shi Changxu (left) presenting a plaque to Zibo's Party chief, Liu Huiyan, on behalf of the Chinese Materials Research Society, proclaiming Zibo a 'New Materials City'.

Zibo's new materials industry saw robust growth throughout 2010, thanks to the city's effort to develop high-tech industries, especially new materials.

The sector has 561 related enterprises and had an industrial output value of more than 181 billion yuan last year.

Thanks to that, Zibo was declared a New Materials City by the Chinese Materials Research Society, in September 2010.

Actually, this started much earlier. Back in 2002, the Ministry of Science and Technology had already designated the city as a new materials commercialization and industrialization center.

Now, after almost a decade of growth, Zibo has several new material areas focusing on advanced ceramics, new chemical materials and heat-resistant products.

In the chemical materials sector alone, it has 188 enterprises with various products, a number of which have the largest market share for their type in China.

Some analysts have said that the city's production capacity for pollution-free refrigerants, plastic agents and fireproof fiber are in the lead in Asia.

What is driving the boom in new materials is a large amount of investment in R&D. The city has 70 research centers and enterprise technology centers, five of them at the State-level and 50 at the provincial-level, as well as 11 post-doctoral research sites.

A number of its companies and institutions own the intellectual property rights to key technologies and products. For instance, in the ceramics industry, companies have at least 200 patents, three of them at the State-level. The products covered by these patents cover a wide range, such as the aerospace, defense, and nuclear energy sectors.

The city has cultivated several leading brands, including Huaguang, a leading name in household chinaware.

The Great Hall of the People, on Tiananmen Square, the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, and Zhongnanhai - the central government complex - have used its high-purity quartz products for several years.

In addition, low-iron glass products from Zibo's Jinjing Group have been used on Trains on the Tibet line and at a number of Beijing Olympic facilities, such as the Bird's Nest and the Water Cube. Its window glasses see wide use in many landmark buildings.

Another contributor to Zibo's new materials development is the annual China (Zibo) International New Materials Technological Forum, which opened in 2002.

This is a forum for sharing the latest technological innovations and has given both the city's economy and its international reputation a great boost.

The last nine forums attracted a large number of academics and industry professionals from more than 30 countries and, witnessed the signing of 5,155 technological project agreements.

Thanks to its good environment, Zibo has ranked among China's 'garden cities' for many years now. Hou Heliang / for China Daily

Leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa held talks on 14 April aimed at coordinating their positions on the global economy and other international issues, host nation China said. EPA/HOW HWEE YOUNG / POOL Since 9/11, Western economies have stagnated while the BRICs – Brazil, Russia, India, and China – are surging [EPA]

Ten years after 9/11, the instant history is being written. In the French newspaper Le Monde, a highly intelligent commemorative supplement dubbed the period “The Decade of bin Laden”. But is that right?

In the ten years since 9/11, the combined GDP of Brazil, Russia, India, and China (the BRICs) rose from 8.4 per cent of the global economy to 18.3 per cent. Anglo-Saxon-style capitalism crashed.

Moreover, it was the decade when Internet access went global – from 360 million people in 2000 to more than 2 billion people today. It was a time when the war in Iraq divided the world, but also when a civilian surge for freedom finally hit the Middle East, as millions of Muslims turned for inspiration to democratic governance, not global jihad.

None of this was the doing of Osama bin Laden. To be sure, al-Qaeda was (and is) a new and serious kind of threat. Born of 30 years of tumult in the Muslim world, al-Qaeda has a worldview, not just a local view. It aspires not just to change, but to revolution.

Indeed, the notion of a “war on terror” in reply was misguided in part because it allowed people to think that al-Qaeda was just another terrorist group like the IRA, the Baader-Meinhof Gang, or the Red Brigades. It wasn’t – and isn’t. But it also aggrandised Bin Laden’s claim to be a world historical figure.

The fight – led by the United States, with the rest of the West providing lower-key support – has weakened Al Qaeda’s influence and capacity. But it has also been an enforced detour from the vital diplomatic task of building new rules and institutions for an interdependent world.

I don’t see any alternative to our determination, in 2001, to drive the Taliban from control of Afghanistan. The tragedy is that, once that battle was won, the peace was lost. The Bonn Conference of December 2001, which was called to draft a new Afghan constitution, excluded the vanquished. Whereas the US built its own democracy from below, on federalist principles, Afghanistan had imposed upon it one of the most centralised states in the world – despite being one of the world’s most decentralised societies.

Tragically, the signals from former Taliban in their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar were misread. The Taliban, who demanded to be left alone in exchange for staying out of politics, were driven into Pakistan, where they reconvened. The new security threat called for a military response, though the struggle should have been predominantly political and diplomatic.

The best way to understand the current situation comes from an analogy offered by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Foreign policy during the Cold War, she says, was like steering within the Panama Canal; after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was like steering within the English Channel – plenty of water on all sides, but land visible, too. Today, foreign policy is like being on the open seas, with no rules beyond countries’ 200-mile maritime borders, and no land in sight.

If that is right, we face urgent tasks – the first being to reassert diplomacy’s place in international politics. The late US statesman Richard Holbrooke once said to me that the United States since 9/11 had suffered a “militarisation of diplomacy”. We now need the opposite. In a world of asymmetric threats, we should follow the US defense department’s field manual: In counterinsurgency, politics require primacy.

Second, we must rethink our notions of a balance of power, because they no longer concern just states, but also peoples. As the Arab Spring has shown, the ubiquity of information means that future coalitions need to be formed at the micro level, in the villages and valleys of places like Afghanistan and Pakistan, rather than only at the macro level of managing the global system.

Third, we are entering an era of resource scarcity. Aside from the atomic bomb, this is the most dangerous security development in two centuries. If you think the blame game in Europe over Greece is bad, just wait for arguments about who is causing drought and food-price inflation. These are not just “environmental” questions. They are questions of justice and responsibility, and stronger regional and international institutions are needed to address them.

Finally, the West must rediscover the joys of multilateralism and shared sovereignty. That is tough when, in Europe, nobody wants to pay Greece’s bills. But multilateralism is a global insurance policy against abuse of power by any state. The problem is not that the European Union and other multilateral institutions are too strong; it is that they are too weak. Indeed, regional institutions in the Arab world, Africa, Latin America, and East Asia are still in their infancy – and need to grow up fast.

Over the past few centuries, there have been three systems of international order: economic and military domination; a balance of power; and shared sovereignty. They can coexist, as they more or less did in the years after 1945 in various parts of the world. But the US today is on the back foot, economically and militarily. New powers like China and India are rising, not risen, mixing assertiveness with emphasis on their continued “developing” status. Europe, where shared sovereignty has been embraced, is struggling to solve its own problems, never mind becoming a global player.

So no one is in charge. This is all the more problematic at a time when the world’s states and people are more intertwined than ever, as ideas, information, finance, migrants, and problems flow ever more seamlessly across borders.

A century ago, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Norman Angell argued in The Great Illusion that economic security enables military expansion, not vice versa. In fact, neither is achievable without political vision. That is the most important lesson of the post-9/11 decade.

Actress/singer Rene Liu at her first interview after marriage. Jiang Dong / China Daily

Taiwan actress/singer Rene Liu jokes about her hairstyle in her latest film Love in Space, a romantic comedy to be released on Sept 9, calling the small buns ""bullshit"".

Acclaimed for her 18 albums, four books, and award-winning performances in hit films, such as Feng Xiaogang's A World without Thieves and Sylvia Chang's Siao Yu, Liu is usually portrayed as smart and elegant, but proved she is also funny, in her first interview after marrying on Aug 9.

""I had no idea being married was so exciting, because I've never been married before,"" the 41-year-old says, laughing.

Liu, who has often expressed a wish to marry, announced she had wed her Beijing businessman husband, who is two years younger, on her website. It shocked her fans, who didn't even know she had a boyfriend.

When asked how she kept the secret, she laughs again: ""Do you really think I would tell a journalist?""

Since her big screen debut in 1995, she has rarely talked about her love life, but has in the past 11 years often been referred to as a ""sheng nu"" - an unmarried lady older than 30. As a result, she would often be asked to share her feelings about other actresses getting married.

""I've been asked so often and every time what I was actually thinking was, 'What the hell is the matter with me?' Thank god I won't be asked that question now.""

She says she will continue her acting and singing career after marriage. Her new essay collection, Incomplete Me, has just hit the bookstores, too.

Her new film, Love in Space, co-produced by Fox International and the mainland's Huayi Brothers, tells the hilarious love stories of three sisters. Liu's love story takes place in a space capsule, in zero gravity. ""The other two actresses were in a romantic film, but I thought I was in a kungfu flick,"" she says.

The first day of shooting she had to fly on a wire for eight hours. ""When I stood on the ground again I told my agent, return the money because I quit,"" she jokes.

She describes filming as ""exhausting"".

As for having a baby, the question journalists are now asking, she is straightforward. ""No, I am not pregnant,"" she emphasizes. ""The best thing about my life so far is that I never know what will happen the next day. The baby thing will happen when it happens.""

32,32,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Weather experts: U.S. summer hottest in past 75 years - CNN International,http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/09/08/weather.record.heat/index.html?iref=NS1,"(CNN) -- The summer of 2011 was the second hottest on record for the United States, and the hottest in 75 years, government weather experts said Thursday.

Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas experienced their warmest summers ever, with several states seeing an average of more than 86 degrees, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.

For meteorological purposes, summer consists of the months of June, July and August.

At least 22 people died as a result of the heat wave that swept the nation earlier this summer, according to the National Weather Service.

For 15 states, the average temperature ranked among their top 10 warmest, while overall, 46 of the lower 48 states saw average to above-average temperatures. Oregon and Washington were the only exceptions.

Texas had the distinction of experiencing the warmest summer on record of any state in America, with an average of 86.8 degrees. Dallas residents sweltered for 40 consecutive days of grueling 100-plus degree temperatures. Oklahoma, at 86.5, also topped the previous record, of 85.2 degrees, set in Oklahoma in 1934, amid what became known as the Dust Bowl.

For the month of August, Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas had their warmest in recorded history, while regionally, the Southwest and South also had their warmest August ever. Only nine of the lower 48 states saw August temperatures near their average readings, while none experienced below-average temperatures.

Temperature-related energy demands soared more than 22% above the norm this summer, the largest increase since record-keeping of energy demands began more than a century ago, NOAA said.

The persistently warm temperatures for the months of June through August, combined with below-average precipitation, also contributed to a record-breaking drought across the southern part of the United States. Texas was subjected to its driest summer ever, with a statewide average of only 2.44 inches of rain -- 5.29 inches below the long-term average, and more than an inch less than the previous driest summer in 1956.

Neighboring Southwestern states New Mexico and Oklahoma were also drought-stricken, experiencing their second- and third-driest summers respectively. Conversely, New Jersey and California had their wettest summers ever.

Meteorologists are predicting no immediate end in sight to the heat or drought afflicting the Southern states. NOAA announced Thursday that la nina, a naturally occurring climate phenomenon located over the tropical Pacific Ocean, is expected to strengthen and affect global weather patterns. Scientists attribute the extreme weather around the globe during the first half of 2011 to the weather event, and predict that the drought currently overtaking the states of Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma is likely to persist.

The extremely dry plains are a tinderbox for Texas; nearly 180 wildfires have been reported across the state in the past seven days, the Texas Forest Service Texas said. A large wildfire blazing outside Austin has destroyed nearly 1,400 homes and is not near containment.","Fri, 09 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/US/09/08/weather.record.heat/tzvids.hot.summer.gi.jpg,"['warmest', 'temperatures', 'mexico', '75', 'hottest', 'experts', 'texas', 'oklahoma', 'states', 'summer', 'past', 'weather', 'summers', 'average']", ,drought

NEW YORK - Roger Federer waited at the US Open for hours, eager to get on court for his fourth-round match. Once he finally started playing, shortly before midnight, he didn't take long to win.

Still, Federer enjoyed each of the 82 minutes he needed to hit 14 aces - including four in one game - and generally overwhelm 36th-ranked Juan Monaco of Argentina 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 in a match that ended shortly before 1:15 am local time on Tuesday.

""Other sports start at 8 in the morning, like golf. It's crazy how our schedules change all the time. As tennis players, it makes it extremely difficult to be on your 'A' game every single day,"" said Federer, whose record 16 Grand Slam titles include five at the US Open.

He watched some of the match before his in Arthur Ashe Stadium - No 1 Caroline Wozniacki's victory over No 15 Svetlana Kuznetsova, which lasted 3 hours, 2 minutes - and also warmed up several times, grabbed a bite to eat, and tried to relax.

""Your body is also jumping out of your skin because you want to go, then you're held back again,"" he said. ""It's tough.""

There was also the matter of the mist that started falling early in the third set, raising the possibility of a rain delay - or even a suspension of the match, with a resumption on Tuesday afternoon.

""There was not much margin there for us because it was already so late,"" Federer said. ""So one rain delay and probably they would have sent everybody home.""

The third-seeded Swiss had 42 winners and only 21 unforced errors against Monaco in a match that took 1 hour, 22 minutes, less than half the time it took Wozniacki to get through.

As late as Federer-Monaco ended, it doesn't even rank among the 10 latest-finishing matches in tournament history. The record is 2:26 a.m., for a Sept 4, 1993, match in which Mats Wilander beat Mikael Pernfors.

Given all the time-wasting before he got on court, Federer liked the way he played.

""I'm extremely pleased with my reaction out there,"" he said. ""I played really well, crisp, nice. I felt fantastic.""

Federer played brilliantly right from the start, taking the first five games - and 20 of the first 25 points - in only 12 minutes. He didn't miss a beat in the second set, hitting four aces in his opening service game.

""Roger was playing unbelievable. I didn't have time to play,"" Monaco said. ""The ball was coming very fast, he was serving unbelievable and I couldn't be quick like I can be in most of my matches.""

But he also blamed himself for not preparing properly.

""Maybe I made a mistake: I warmed up about five hours before the match. We'd been waiting for four hours in the locker room,"" Monaco said. ""I got on the court, I'm feeling a little tight. Then during the match, it takes me some time to feel my legs.""

Federer reached his 30th consecutive major quarterfinal.

He also earned a rematch against 11th-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who pulled off a stunner in the Wimbledon quarterfinals two months ago by becoming the first man to beat Federer in a Grand Slam match after dropping the first two sets.

""It's sure something I'm looking forward to. Look, I live for the big matches, live for playing a guy who is explosive, has got some firepower,"" Federer said. ""I like to play those kind of players, especially now that we're in the deeper stages of the tournament.""

Students from Islamic Kasim Tuet Memorial College participate in a Chinese culture week before Lunar New Year. Writing Chinese can be a difficult task for them. Provided to China Daily Before Islamic Kasim Tuet Memorial College became a designated school, the majority of the admitted students were Chinese. Kahon Chan / China Daily Shirley Lo (left) and Edmund Chan. Kahon Chan / China Daily Students from Islamic Kasim Tuet Memorial College sample traditional festive food during a Chinese cultural week. Provided to China Daily

Summer finally comes to an end, but the heated debate over equal education for ethnic minorities carries on. Teachers and concern groups share their personal experience and views with Kahon Chan about the situation ignited by the Equal Opportunities Commission.

Summer holidays finally come to an end and students return to schools. Some have big plans. Among them is Akash Limbu. His goal as he heads back to school is to speak a bit more Chinese. He hasn't done very well with the language in his first 11 years in Hong Kong. He can only manage a few basic greetings and self-introduction.

""Maybe I did not work quite hard enough on it,"" said the 16-year-old Nepalese, attempting to explain his weak Chinese. ""It's kind of hard to understand and remember those Chinese characters.""

Hong Kong bills itself as ""Asia's World City"". The word ""diverse"" is part of the branding - creating the image of a city that is ""pluralistic and tolerant"". Akash may represent part of this so-called pluralistic community, but he has not experienced much tolerance in the education system at many levels.

Like a lot of Chinese fellows, he is not very well aware of the fact.

Akash plans to advance his studies at a local tertiary institution. His family can't afford to pay for overseas study. To move on, Akash will require a passing grade in both English and Chinese, in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education commencing in 2012. The prerequisite is a challenge for many Chinese, let alone Akash.

There is another way, the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) Chinese examination. It was introduced in May 2008 for non-Chinese speaking local students for alternative qualification for admission to universities. The institutions' recognition of GCSE's based on its low threshold on its Chinese standard is largely unenthusiastic.

Receipt for poverty

""The point is whether all courses in the university are lectured in Chinese? Not medicine, definitely not English Literature. Then why is it necessary to get passes in English and Chinese?"" James Lung Wai-man, chairman of Southern Democratic Alliance, questioned. He has advocated equality for ethnic minorities since 2002 and recently set up a food bank for minorities because the existing food banks cannot spare resources for translators.

""An ethnic Indian from Hong Kong may not be qualified for the language requirement, but why is an Indian from New Delhi admitted with exemption in Chinese? I can't imagine a local citizen would end up like that."" The language barricade for higher academic achievement, as James cited, may result in ethnic minorities ending up in cross-generational poverty.

Though the Education Bureau stated that there is also an increase in non-Chinese speaking students attending programs offered by Vocational Training Council (VTC) and other operators, James noted VTC only offers English courses on security and construction, suffocating the career options of minorities.

Going back the basic question: how does one speak so little Chinese when the language and the people are virtually everywhere in Hong Kong?

It can't be true for everyone. Akash has only a couple of Chinese classmates as he attends one of the ""designated"" secondary schools, where he is surrounded by other South Asian fellows and English is inevitably the sole teaching medium. There has been little pressure to learn Chinese at all.

Curriculum vacuum

At another designated school, the Islamic Kasim Tuet Memorial College, Chinese teacher Shirley Lo described her first encounter with ethnic minorities when she was still a fresh graduate five years ago. ""When I stepped into the classroom, I had no idea what was going on. I had never seen that.""

With help from colleagues, Shirley picked up the skills that were not part of her professional training in Chinese language education. ""South Asians of secondary schools might be learning numbers, from one to five. They are there to recognize a character at a time."" She said, ""My mind-set had to get back to the basic.""

Senior Chinese teacher Edmund Chan went through an even steeper learning curve. Before the Islamic school became a designated school, more than three quarters of the admitted students were Chinese. Chan could elaborate on cultural essence beyond the textbook.

Five years into the scheme, South Asians make up more than three quarters of all fresh faces showing up in September and change has to come.

""I felt they needed more help. Apparently, they are not well accommodated in Hong Kong as you don't see many of them working in a lot of industries."" He said, ""We want them to survive here.""

While Chinese teachers like Chan or those in 27 other designated schools across Hong Kong are aware of the children's vulnerable future, they are not equipped with the most needed survival kit.

Aside from a ""supplementary guideline"" supplied to the schools on Chinese language education, the Education Bureau told China Daily that ""tailor-made teaching and learning materials"" were provided to both teachers and students. But the teachers were only aware of piles of materials prepared by another designated school and with concern of breach of copyright laws, they are now using textbooks for GCSE Chinese exams instead.

The whole idea of not having a fixed curriculum for the non-Chinese speaking students is because the government expected a low recognition for a substandard curriculum, as the bureau told a working group under the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) in April.

But the absence of staged learning objectives and respective tools laid out by professional curriculum planners, as told by teachers from the Islamic school, leaves a lot of inconsistency. For instance, a discrepancy among primary school graduates has posed great challenges for secondary schools, so there can be little wonder that Shirley had to begin her class with numbers.

'They really don't care'

James Lung felt that government officials were reluctant to make greater effort because they are only working for the international instruments effective for Hong Kong. That includes the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Executive Director of Hong Kong Unison, Fermi Wong Wai-fun, identified a misconception of equality among the policy-makers through her decade-long lobby.

""From top to bottom, education officials felt they have done more than enough for the minorities because it would be unfair to Chinese citizens."" She said, ""One bowl of rice for everyone seems fair, but in fact some of us need two bowls to get filled. The ethnic minorities need more support to attain fair competition.""

When the EOC hosted a news conference in July to address all the concerns about education among ethnic minorities, friends of Fermi, familiar with the government, suggested the bureau should have responded with some trepidation. The threat of a judicial review of the Bill of Rights Ordinance, published on a local press, may have mounted more pressure.

But the Education Bureau is determined to keep its answer neat and short: ""The Education Bureau is re-examining our support measures with reference to the recommendations of the Report"".

Fermi felt that prejudice was prominent at the bureau. ""(Staff are) supposed to listen to what we have to say. The politically appointed officials come down to argue with the stakeholders. He never delivers our genuine demands back to the office, where no one really owns this issue and looks into it. No one.""

Despite a lot of disappointment, she still plans to present another proposal to the Education Bureau in late September. ""Thousands of Hong Kong kids have moved to other places like Canada and Australia and how are they treated? They were not put in designated schools but were given great resources. My proposal will follow this principle,"" Fermi said.

It was also clarified that only a few of the 100 complaints among minority students could be presented to the Equal Opportunities Commission as formal complaints. A judicial review would be only be a desperate last resort since the ethnic minorities are deeply worried about creating upset in the mainstream society.

Out of the many concerns, with which Edmund Chan did not fully agree, was the allegation of racial discrimination at designated schools. Chinese parents would take much of the blame. ""They don't understand us. They see more Pakistanis and Nepalese walking through the school gate, the parents and students won't get in to ask and opt us out. Without any policy change, I assume Chinese will disappear from here in ten years.""

He acknowledged the family background of certain South Asian students was no stimulus to their learning incentives, but he has seen outstanding students. Inadequate language support presents an obstacle to their future.

""There is a blank in our education system. Hardly any effort has been made from publishers, Examination and Assessment Authority to Education Bureau."" He said. ""The bureau informed you about the Chinese learning support operated by the University of Hong Kong, but it would be unnecessary if there is a full plan and curriculum.""

As the interview wrapped up, the teacher was informed that the story will be told in about 1,500 words and he responded: ""It is just too short to address this issue.""

Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel is designed to be a flagship including all the five Sheraton signature experiences. Provided to China Daily

The visit of the Real Madrid soccer team to the Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel confirmed its status as a flagship hotel. Li Wenfang reports.

The hotel market in Guangzhou, Guangdong province is booming after the city hosted the 2010 Asian Games. It has become one of the biggest inbound and outbound tourist cities in China, says James Greig, general manager of the recently unveiled Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel.

""With the tightened relationship with Hong Kong and Macao, Guangzhou's future is promising in the hospitality business. The city will become more and more important in South China, even the whole of China,"" Greig says.

Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel is one of the four hotels in the Starwood hotel group that operates in Guangzhou, with 1,518 rooms in total. The other three are The Westin Pazhou, Four Points by Sheraton Guangzhou, Dongpu and The Westin Guangzhou.

Greig says three more hotels are in the pipeline: Sheraton Huadu Resort, Aloft Guangzhou University Park and W Guangzhou.

Sheraton Guangzhou, the first Sheraton brand operating in the Guangzhou market, is the newest five star hotel located in Teem Mall, the premium shopping mall and Fortune 500 company office tower complex in the epicenter of the Guangzhou central business district.

Owned by GDH Limited, the hotel is designed to be a flagship Sheraton hotel. It includes all the five Sheraton signature experiences, that is Link@Sheraton, a comfortable place to work, play or simply relax with high-speed Internet access 24 hours, Shine Spa, SweetSleeper Bed, Sheraton Lounge and Sheraton Fitness.

The hotel boasts over 1,300 square meters of meeting space, and state-of-the-art audio and video facilities. It runs four restaurants and a bar, including authentic Cantonese dishes at the YUE Chinese Restaurant and regional home-style Italian fare at Bene Italian Kitchen.

Greig says: ""We tried to recruit as many local associates as we could to present local culture. The YUE restaurant, with its traditional Cantonese flavors, fits this market.

""You can feel the Cantonese style in our lobby. We put a feng shui art piece in the lobby, which features water, fire, metal, wood and earth (the five elements). Also, we use ancient gold coins' shape to decorate our window on the third floor.""

Greig recalls the exciting moment when the Real Madrid soccer team arrived as the hotel's first VIP group after it was opened in July.

""When Real Madrid was staying at our hotel, we needed to cope with both the team as well as the fans. For the team, we needed to make sure it had the appropriate food, as requested. They all had a comfortable stay in the hotel, which was not disturbed by fans.

""Also, we needed to make sure daily operations were on the right track. On the other hand, we needed to cope with the thousands of fans and ensure their safety in and outside the hotel,"" he says.

""During those days, although our team worked over 12 hours a day, we felt satisfied that the Real Madrid team gave the hotel a high recommendation and they all had a nice stay in Guangzhou.""

The Sheraton hotel chain includes more than 400 hotels in 72 countries and regions. It recently completed a $6 billion global revitalization and is now in the midst of a $5 billion global expansion over the coming three years.

Sheraton is owned by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc, one of the leading hotel and leisure companies in the world with 1,051 properties in 100 countries and regions with 145,000 employees at its owned and managed properties.

RIYADH - Australia overcame heat and jetlag to ease past Saudi Arabia 3-1 while Japan looked jaded during a 1-1 draw with Uzbekistan in the third round of Asian qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup on Tuesday.

Australia's patchy 2-1 victory over Thailand last week was unconvincing but at Dammam two goals by Josh Kennedy and a penalty from Luke Wilkshire lifted the Socceroos to the top of Group D.

Kennedy opened his account against the Thais and on Tuesday he was at it again, heading a Wilkshire cross into the net just before halftime.

The Japan-based striker added a second goal on 56 minutes after cashing in on Brett Holman's defence-splitting pass.

The hosts pulled a goal back through Nassir Al Shamrani but Kennedy was then fouled in the box and Wilkshire converted his penalty in the 77th minute.

By contrast, Japan's away-match experience was all about toiling for a draw.

Uzbekistan wasted a string of chances against a weary-looking Japan side yet to taste defeat in 13 games since Italian Alberto Zaccheroni took charge in October.

Captain Server Djeparov volleyed Uzbekistan into the lead after eight minutes, celebrating with a triple back flip as the home fans lit flares and roared with delight.

Shinji Okazaki's diving header gave Japan a barely-deserved equaliser in the 65th minute, triggering something of a shootout as both teams suddenly threw caution to the wind.

""Uzbekistan pushed us around a bit,"" Zaccheroni told reporters. ""Give them credit, they are a very good side. We were better in the second half but we must play better than that.""

Japan still top Group C on four points, ahead of Uzbekistan on goal difference.

As autumn nears, Beijing's restaurant scene comes alive with foods to awaken the senses, at a range of tasting events and festivals.

The 7th Beijing International Western Cuisine Festival, which kicked off in mid-August and will last till Sept 30, is a case in point.

Diners can log on to http://xcwhj.huishua.com (in Chinese only) to download discount coupons to member restaurants of the Beijing Western Cuisine Association.

SOPEXA, an organization dedicated to cultural exchange between China and France, will organize the 10th French Festival at Sanlitun on Sept 24 and 25. From noon to 8 pm on these two days, one can sample French foods and wines, and learn about French products. Representatives from major French companies - Air France, Aussino World Wines, Evian, Nespresso, Sinodis and Michelin - will also be present at the venue.

With the evenings becoming cooler, many Beijing residents are seeking out outdoor dining options. The Scarlett wine bar and restaurant is one such. The restaurant offers a delectable combo platter with five cheeses and three cold cuts.

The chef's recommendation includes a very tender chicken main course, served with noodles, and a great value beef fillet, for 298 yuan ($47), which is good for at least two. The restaurant offers a range of international wines. The restaurant has a modern feel.

The most striking aspect of Bloo Dining restaurant is the round dining area with French windows that allow sunlight to stream in. A highlight at the eatery is Hainan chicken rice. According to chef Bob He, the restaurant uses a 1.5 kilogram Wenchang chicken from Hainan island, which he puts in seething hot water, then turns off the fire, and keep the lid on for 25 minutes. After that, the whole chicken is put in iced water, yielding a chicken that is tantalizingly tender. The chicken rice costs 80 yuan a person.

Yet another restaurant with a great outdoor ambience is Nuage at Houhai. Its second floor opens on to a great view of the lake. The restaurant offers Shandong cuisine on the first and third floors, and French-style Vietnamese foods on the second and fourth floors. At a recent tasting, I was delighted to discover the slightly sweet Vietnamese curry chicken, which made for a perfect combination with steamed rice.

I would also recommend chicken salad, and Vietnamese rice noodles, served with battered beef, onion slices and coriander.

Britain's Prince Harry will party in Las Vegas while training in the US.

The 26-year-old royal - who is renowned for a love of nights out - will spend 48-hours in the gambling city while undertaking a 12-week helicopter training course in California and Arizona later this year, as it is part of the ""tradition"" for those taking part.

""The course doesn't have much downtime, it's pretty intense. This is a chance for pilots to let their hair down, kick back and enjoy themselves.""

As part of his US training, Harry - who was recently promoted to a Royal Air Force Captain - will learn how to use weapons systems on board a helicopter and take part in mock combat missions with American forces.

He will also be taught techniques which will help him avoid surface-to-air missiles.

What are shown in these photographs became a part of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York on Aug 22, 2011. The museum, which occupies seven stories below the ground at the World Trade Center site, is due to open in 2012, on the 11th anniversary of the attacks.

A fire helmet that belonged to Chief Joseph Pfeifer.

Joseph Pfiefer , the battalion chief of Engine 7, Ladder 1, was on a routine call in downtown Manhattan when he heard the roar of American Airlines Flight 11 passing overhead on course to the North Tower of the World Trade Center. His unit was one of the first to arrive at the scene, and he set up a command center in the North Tower's lobby. That day, he was being followed by two French filmmaker-brothers, Jules and Gedeon Naudet, and their footage from the scene shows Pfiefer's brother Kevin, also a firefighter in a different unit, preparing to head upstairs for the unfolding rescue mission. When the South Tower collapsed, Pfiefer radioed evacuation orders to his officers in the North Tower. Pfiefer, along with the rest of Ladder 1, survived that day. His brother did not.

A recovered FDNY Squad 252 helmet that belonged to deceased FDNY member, Kevin M. Prior.

Kevin Prior , a firefighter with Brooklyn's Squad 252, can be seen in video footage of the North Tower lobby recorded after the first plane hit, getting ready to go upstairs. Responding to a Mayday call sent out by fellow firefighters encountering breathing problems, he and five other members of the squad are thought to have been on a floor in the 20s when the tower collapsed. Prior's body was found three weeks after the attacks and buried on Long Island, but his mother was troubled that his helmet had not been returned to the family, and said as much in a television interview. An employee at the city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner happened to catch the broadcast, recognized Prior's squad and badge numbers, and hand-delivered the badly damaged helmet to his grateful family.

An NYPD Emergency Service Unit hardhat and folding shovel used on Sept 11, 2001 and during the clean-up period at ground zero, by police officer Kenny Winkler of NYPD ESU 1.

Kenneth Winkler was off-duty from a night shift as an officer with the New York Police Department's Emergency Service Unit, on the morning of the attacks. He nonetheless joined his colleagues on their vehicle and they raced toward the World Trade Center, and stayed in the vehicle outside to coordinate communications between different parts of the force. After the South Tower collapsed, he ordered everyone still inside the North Tower to leave. He had to abandon the vehicle after the North Tower collapsed, and set up a new command center nearby and continued to try and coordinate communications. Later, he would work on the pile during the rescue operation, wearing his NYPD hardhat and carrying his hand shovel, and returned periodically to the site during the following nine-month clean-up operation.

Shoes of survivor Roger Hawke during his evacuation from the 59th floor of the North Tower.

Roger Hawke worked at Sidley Austin, a law firm that had offices on the 57th through 59th floors of the North Tower. This was not the first attack on the World Trade Center he had lived through: He was there in 1993 too, when bombs exploded at the complex. Soon after the first plane crashed somewhere above him on 9/11, he made his way to one of the increasingly crowded and hot stairways. It took about 90 minutes to descend to safety. He headed on foot to the apartment of his daughter and son-in-law on the Upper East Side, arriving there caked in ash, leaving his dust-choked shoes at the door before entering. His 4-year-old granddaughter jumped into his arms but then recoiled at the smell of smoke permeating his clothes: ""Papi is on fire from the inside,"" she said.

A ""Little Red"" doll discovered by Brian Van Flandern on Sept 12, 2001.

Brian Van Flandern awoke in Queens on the morning of 9/11 to the news of a plane hitting the North Tower, and was determined to volunteer despite his emergency medical technician license having recently expired. After repeated failed attempts to enroll at several impromptu volunteer coordination centers that had sprung up around the city that day, he decided to head to the World Trade Center site and managed to get past a checkpoint to join other volunteers on what became known as ""the pile"". He spent 24 hours helping search for trapped and wounded survivors. Morale quickly flagged: He recalls only one successful rescue, in which a man was freed from a piece of steel piercing his ankle. Before leaving the site, he found a rag-doll in the rubble. At first, it seemed to be evidence of a child caught up in the attacks. He later learned it was one of several mascot dolls that sat together on the shelf in the offices of the Chances for Children charity on the 101st floor of the North Tower, other examples of which were found scattered far and wide across Lower Manhattan.

Blood-stained shoes worn by Linda Lopez as she was evacuated from the 97th floor of Tower 2 on Sept 11, 2001.

Linda Lopez was at work at the Fiduciary Trust Company on the South Tower's 97th floor when the first plane crashed into North Tower, sending a fireball past their window and radiating a heat that she said felt like being sunburned. There was quickly a sense of confusion: Was it a bomb? Were the rumors that it was a plane crash true? Should people in the South Tower ignore the advice coming over the public address system to stay put and evacuate instead? Lopez felt she had to get out. She had reached only as far as the 61st when she was thrown against a wall as the second plane crashed into the floors above her. Taking off her shoes, she continued to head down the stairs, passing firefighters heading in the opposite direction. She ran barefoot out of the building, across broken glass and other debris. ""Lady, your feet are bleeding,"" someone said to her as she paused a few blocks away in relative safety. She put her shoes back on, and began learning the details of what it was she had just escaped from.

Ironworker construction helmet belonging to Larry Keating.

Larry Keating was an ironworker foreman who helped oversee the removal of wreckage from the World Trade Center site during the nine-month clean-up operation following the attack, and was chosen by the ironworkers union, Local 40, to represent his colleagues at the ceremonial removing of what became known as Last Column - an upright piece of the towers that had become covered in mementos from the clean-up workers and from which flew an American flag. He wore his hardhat throughout the clean up, and continued to wear it proudly for site visits until his death in 2011 from a heart attack.

A Port Authority Police Department uniform hat, badge number 899, and Port Authority Pipe Band hat belonging to victim Liam Callahan.

Liam Callahan was a Port Authority police officer who had been commended for his ""heroic actions"" after responding to the 1993 World Trade Center bomb attack, and was a first responder on the morning of 9/11. Even after the towers collapsed, Joan, his wife, continued to hope he might somehow turn up in time for the celebration of their 20th wedding anniversary the next day. He was killed at the age of 44. His family donated his Port Authority police uniform hat and the uniform he would wear as a drum sergeant in the force's Emerald Society Pipes and Drums band.

A red wallet belonging to victim Gennie Gambale, recovered from the rooftop of the Marriott Hotel at the World Trade Center.

Gennie Gambale was a vice president at Cantor Fitzgerald and was working on the 103rd floor of the North Tower when the first plane crashed into the lower floors, trapping those above. Her family put up thousands of posters around town in the hopes that she might be found alive, but it was in vain; she was 27 when she was killed. A police officer, who happened to be the mother of one of Gambale's friends, found Gambale's wallet on the roof of the nearby Marriott hotel and immediately recognized the name on the damaged cards inside, and ensured it was quickly handed over to the family.

Shoes worn by Florence Jones on Sept 11, 2001 as she escaped from the World Trade Center.

Florence Jones was still in her office at Baseline Financial on the South Tower's 77th floor when the second plane crashed into the building just one floor above. She and several colleagues tried two stairwells before finding their way to stairwell A, the only one not damaged by the crash. She took off her high-heeled shoes to hasten her descent - her boss carried them down for her. They were among the last to make it out of the tower before it collapsed.

Actress and environmental activist Daryl Hannah was briefly arrested outside the White House on Tuesday during a protest against a proposed $7 billion oil pipeline, police said.

Hannah was released after paying a $100 fine, following her arrest for failure to obey a lawful order, said U.S. Park Police spokesman Sergeant David Schlosser.

More than 70 people were arrested in the Tar Sands Action protest on Tuesday, which is named after efforts to block the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project to bring oil sands petroleum from Canada to Texas refineries.

The 50 year-old Hannah is best known for playing the mermaid Madison in 1984 film ""Splash,"" and had roles in 2003 film ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" and its 2004 sequel.

Hannah was arrested in a sit-in outside a gate to the White House after she refused police orders to leave, said Daniel Kessler, spokesman for the Rainforest Action Network, which was part of the demonstration.

Canadian-born ""Superman"" actress Margot Kidder and hundreds of other protesters have been arrested since the action outside the White House began on August 20, Kessler said.","Wed, 31 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110831/00221917e9c40fc7f60155.jpg,"['white', 'protest', 'oil', 'hannah', 'outside', 'house', 'pipeline', 'arrested', 'daryl', 'action']", ,none

Chin Kwai-lam sits in a factory-converted room. He lives with four other households. The families may be evicted in October as ordered by their landlord. Yik Yeung-Man / For China Daily After a long day of work, Chin Kwai-lam (left) and Liang Fawei share a cigarette break in Liang's 250-square-foot unit.

Yik Yeung-Man / For China Daily

With rents and land prices shooting up, and the government cracking down on illegal, subdivided accommodations, many families still live in fear of becoming cast out onto the street with nowhere to turn. Ming Yeung reports.

It's cramped and musty in what Chin Kwai-lam and his family call ""home"". The dwelling on Bedford Road in Tai Kok Tsui used to be a garment factory. Now it's dilapidated and derelict.

The tiny abode is only 200 square feet. It's cluttered. Clothes and cooking utensils are scattered among Chin's other meager possessions. He barely has room to move.

It's all he can afford. There's nowhere else to go.

Hong Kong's property prices soared to a 13-year high in February. In lock step, landlords moved frantically to jack up rents. The increases were dramatic - with landlords raising rents 20-30 percent year on year.

There's no rent control and tenants in cramped, partitioned apartments in which several people reside, pay more per square foot of living space than people in luxury flats.

Chin says the family pays HK$2,500 a month and a few hundred Hong Kong dollars over and above that for water and electricity, accounting for one third of his wife's monthly salary. Chin does casual jobs and he cannot rely on his income from one month to the next.

Chin's his family lives there, more or less protected because they are in a legal gray area. Fire hazards are much greater in old factory buildings than in residential units. Moving into a residential building presents no option for Chin. He says the rent in a residential building would be double, or HK$5,000 a month, at least.

The family has been in the place for more than three years - awaiting allocation to public housing. The situation is not secure. The landlord demolished all subdivided flats on the upper two floors of the building. Only five families remain in the building.

The landlord issued a legal notice to Chin and his neighbors in May requesting that they move out by the end of June. They're still there. But rumors are floating around that everyone will be evicted in October. Chin now lives in terror that he and his family could end up on the street.

At dead end, Society for Community Organization (SoCo), a poverty advocacy group, suggested that the tenants not move from their illegal abodes unless they are relocated to public housing, transit centers or interim housing.

Transit centers and interim housing are temporary accommodations provided by the Housing Authority (HA) for those who become homeless as a result of natural disasters or clearance operations.

SoCo estimates subdivided flats in industrial buildings house more than 10,000 low-wage earners, the majority of whom are waiting for public housing.

The HA says it has plans to build 75,000 public housing units during the next five years, averaging about 15,000 new flats per annum.

But the supply is vastly inadequate, observes Sze Lai-shan, community organizer from SoCo, adding that grassroots families like Chin's are in a long queue waiting for public housing. By the end of March, about 152,400 applicants were on the waiting list. The average waiting time is three years.

At a meeting with a group of subdivided flat residents on Aug 23, lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung made a promise to Chin that he will discuss the matter with the HA and try to re-house the affected families to interim housing as soon as possible.

""Compulsory demolition (of illegal subdivided flats) perhaps is necessary for the sake of your safety, but it can only be done after your relocation is taken care of. How nerve-racking it is to live constantly under threat,"" Leung told the people at the meeting.

When local light industry migrated to the mainland in the early 1990s, an abundance of industrial buildings and warehouses were left vacant in older factory areas such as Tai Kok Tsui, San Po Kong and Kwun Tong.

Seeing the housing needs of the working poor, owners of vacant industrial buildings were more than happy to convert the abandoned spaces into rooms to make extra money, disregarding that they were violating the law.

The trend toward living in flats in converted factories began just a few years ago. The flats offer cheaper rent for relatively bigger floor space. The ""easy-come-and-go"" atmosphere attracted poverty-stricken people who can barely afford deposits required by residential building owners.

Li Hung-ha also lives in a room in a converted factory building. The single mother lives with her 11-month-old son in a factory on Larch Street. The floor has subdivided into 39 rooms, no more than 150-square-foot each. About 40 people share the space which has two washrooms and three shower rooms in one corner.

Li moved to the factory building in 2009 when her pregnancy forced her to stop working. Losing her job meant she could no longer afford the subdivided room in a private residence in Mong Kok.

Since the whole floor is partitioned entirely by wooden planks, cooking on gas stoves is strictly prohibited in Li's building, owing to the fire hazards.

""I fear nothing but a fire. If there's a fire, there's no way out,"" Li complains.

Apart from unauthorized door openings that do not meet fire safety requirements, common problems in such units are the addition of partitions that block fire escape routes and the overloading of buildings because of excessive partitions and raised floor platforms.

Li tells China Daily that people from the Buildings Department (BD) occasionally knock on the doors, wanting to come in to carry out inspections. The tenants just ignore them, she says.

The BD intended to break into the flats on Aug 22, but temporarily suspended the plan after negotiations with SoCo. The organization is lobbying legislators to relocate the affected tenants.

""Breaking into the building will not ultimately solve the problems. If the tenants are evicted, they will reside in another industrial building,"" Sze Lai-shan notes.

The BD did not respond to China Daily's inquiry about how the department handles situations when landlords refuse to comply with demolition orders as well as relocating displaced tenants, commenting that the department ""has been occupied by other commitments recently"".

Under the Buildings Ordinance, officers can break in to a premises for an inspection, in the presence of police, to find out if there are unauthorized additions or alterations that affect fire or structural safety of a building.

Li says she wants to find a safe and decent room because her baby suffers given the poor hygiene and the heat during the extremely humid summer months.

""The one more month CSSA (Comprehensive Social Security Assistance) payment released in July was mostly spent on my baby's medical treatment,"" she laments while looking at the toddler who has been unwell in the last few months.

Li and her baby rely on HK$6,000 social welfare a month. More than one third of it, HK$2,400, goes to rental. The remaining amount is barely enough to feed them, let alone provide sufficient funds to move.

Lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung is urging the Social Welfare Department (SWD) to help needy people pay deposits and other expenses if they are to be moved back to private residences.

A spokesman for the SWD replies that the department works with Integrated Family Service Centres to link up with people in need, especially elderly and disabled people, to whom they offer assistance.

The department will also take into consideration the circumstances of individual needs, the spokesman adds, to grant special emoluments to able-bodied people.

But according to Li, the SWD agrees to pay only HK$4,000 to subsidize her and she needs at least HK$8,000 in total for all expenses.

Chin Kwai-lam's neighbor Liang Fawei says he prefers to live in interim housing rather than a private residence not because of the skyrocketing rental rates but because of the limited space.

Liang's family will be allocated a room in public housing in 2012 at the earliest.

As advised by Liang's welfare officer, the family of five could consider applying for CSSA so that the household would get rent allowance as well.

According to SWD's mechanism, rent allowance granted to social welfare households ranges from HK$1,265 for a person to HK$3,545 for four people.

""It's not about the pecuniary assistance. Even if I can afford HK$6,000 for rental a month, there's no way I can find a room as good as this one,"" he stresses.

Now living in a 300-square-foot room, the family once rented a flat half that size on Canton Road for HK$4,100 a month.

Liang recalls the rooftop unit was boiling hot, forcing them to move back to the factory building.

""I have no other requests. I just wish that we will be granted a place in interim housing before October, before we are evicted and end up living on the street,"" Liang says, faintly.

Many industrial buildings have been left vacant in old factory districts like Tai Kok Tsui since the 1990s. Landlords thus partitioned the empty spaces into sub-divided flats which are now housing some 10,000 low-wage earners. Yik Yeung-man / For China Daily

45,45,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Hurricane Irene Sets Record for Most Expensive Disaster Year - Daily Beast,https://www.thedailybeast.com/hurricane-irene-sets-record-for-most-expensive-disaster-year,"Mother Nature has plans to stir up more trouble over this Labor Day weekend. Hurricane Katia continues to churn across the Atlantic while something that looks suspiciously like a nascent tropical storm brews off the coast of Cuba. That’s just the latest in a summer full of extreme weather: Domes of heat across the central and eastern U.S.; Dust Bowl-like levels of drought in the Central Plains; flooding and beach erosion caused by Hurricane Irene along the East Coast. And we haven’t even hit the peak of hurricane season yet—Sept. 10.

And just who pays for all these disasters? That’s a question being asked in Congress right now. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the No. 2 House Republican, said earlier this week that additional disaster funding has to be offset by spending cuts—a suggestion that thrusts emergency funds into the middle of highly partisan budget disputes.

Even before Hurricane Irene tore up the East Coast and devastated parts of interior New England, FEMA’s disaster relief fund was at a low of $792 million. Whenever the fund drops below $1 billion, FEMA is forced to prioritize its relief efforts and make very difficult choices. Because of this “immediate-needs status,” long-term projects like rebuilding roads, bridges, and schools are put on hold to deal with the needs of Hurricane Irene’s victims. In fact, the Associated Press reports that some federal money pledged to tornado-ravaged Joplin, Mo., and other disaster sites is being diverted to help victims of Hurricane Irene.

How to pay is just one of the many difficult discussions about extreme weather we face. And like most hard conversations, this is one that will only get harder the longer we wait. Climate scientists have warned that as the planet warms, extreme events will increase in frequency and severity. The physics are quite straightforward. All weather is under the influence of climate change now because all weather is being born into a warmer, moister environment. Thanks in part to warmer oceans, water vapor in the atmosphere has already increased about 4 percent and it will continue to increase as the planet warms—providing more fuel for storms. Events like droughts, wildfires, heat waves, and heavy downpours are going to become more frequent, more intense, and last longer. In fact, we can already see this playing out in historical data.

And while weather coverage has dominated the headlines all year, these climate facts are rarely mentioned. Given how high the stakes are, it’s critical that weather events be placed in their full climate context right along with society’s increasing vulnerability to extreme weather events due to population growth and coastal development among other factors.

Our weather is getting worse, and not saying it won’t make it go away. According to Munich Reinsurance America, one of the top providers of property and casualty reinsurance in the U.S., the number of natural disasters has tripled over the past 20 years. Average thunderstorm losses have increased five-fold since 1980. For the first half of 2011 there have been $20 billion in thunderstorm losses, up from the previous three-year average of $10 billion. The reinsurance company has also gone on the record saying, “It would seem that the only plausible explanation for the rise in weather-related catastrophes is climate change.”

Preliminary estimates place the total damage on property and the economy for all weather-related disasters this past year at more than $35 billion. With four months left in the year, we’ve already set a record for the most billion-dollar weather disasters, breaking the old record of nine that occurred in 2008.","Thu, 01 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1493059163/articles/2011/09/01/hurricane-irene-sets-record-for-most-expensive-disaster-year/worst-disaster-year-tease_xugyxt","['extreme', 'hurricane', 'climate', 'sets', 'events', 'irene', 'expensive', 'weather', 'record', 'disasters', 'billion', 'reinsurance', 'disaster']", ,flood_and_drought

It's a Woody Allen movie so there's a lot of walking, talking, and walking. Owen Wilson in Midnight in Paris. Gil (Owen Wilson, far right) grins and bears it as the insufferable Paul (Michael Sheen) bloviates on everything and nothing in Midnight in Paris.

Woody Allen returns to Europe for a film only Woody Allen fans will be charmed by. Elizabeth Kerr reports.

Woody Allen's latest European flight of fancy, the time traveling romantic comedy Midnight in Paris, follows the alleged renaissance the intensely New York director is having. On the heels of the generally well received Match Point (set in London) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (duh) comes Woody's fetishization of the City of Lights. In case you were wondering, he's in production on a film set and shot in Rome (The Bop Decameron, whatever that means). It seems no location in the old country is safe from Woody's neuroses and obnoxious alter egos.

Midnight in Paris is Allen's biggest commercial hit in over 20 years and now reigns as his all time box office winner. The buzz coming off its premiere at Cannes in May was universally positive, if not downright fawning. Saying Midnight in Paris is only a so-so endeavor, with plenty of ridiculousness and irritating Woodyisms in it is akin to blasphemy - kind of like saying Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 just wasn't that strong a film. In the world of Woody sycophancy choosing Owen Wilson to take up the Allen avatar is ""novel"" casting, not ""mis""-casting. The romanticization of Paris' lengthy artistic history is cleverly snarking at notions of what constitutes highbrow culture, not gleefully wallowing in them; heaven forbid you try to sit through the film without a crash course on World War I-era art history first. And as was the case with Allen's rendering of London and Barcelona, there's nary a ghetto or angry immigrant in sight.

Gil (Wilson) is a good-natured Hollywood hack (the ""hack"" part is Allen's so-called disguise), in Paris with his fiance Inez's (Rachel McAdams) parents. He's successful but has a hankering to write a novel - to be a ""real"" writer. Inez and her parents are dismissive at best, and Gil's obsession with the legacy of the Lost Generation gets on their nerves. While out strolling one night (there are lots of strolls along the Seine and through the city's cobbled arrondissements), as the clock strikes midnight, a vintage car rolls up, picks him up, and whisks him off to a party evidently raging in the 1920s. Cole Porter is playing the piano, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald socialize, and Ernest Hemingway broods in the corner. Eventually he meets Adriana (Marion Cotillard), an artist's muse who he bonds with instantly. Meanwhile back in 2011, Inez is star struck by an arrogant Man Of The World, Paul (Michael Sheen), though she carries on with snobby wedding plans.

Yet another late-night stroll through the arrondissement of Paris sees temporally displaced Adriana (Marion Cotillard) falling for Gil (Owen Wilson) in Midnight in Paris.

There are some interesting ideas lurking beneath the surface here, chiefly the power of nostalgia to cloud our perceptions and the cyclical nature of that nostalgic glow. How many times have you heard the phrase, ""Popular music just isn't as good as it was in the '60s/'70s/'80s,"" lately? Give it some time. The '90s will have its turn soon. How about, ""Movies are all special effects now""? Gil's rose-colored glasses perception of the fecund 1920s is mirrored by Adriana's view of the previous ""great moment,"" the Belle poque. No doubt, there are Allen fans out there pining for the days of Annie Hall and Interiors. There's an understated melancholy for days gone by - in Paris and likely in Allen's native New York - that deserved more attention. The Paris that Gil is so fond of doesn't exist, as Inez reminds him time and again, and that sense of grand loss informs the narrative, giving it what little thematic heft it has. It even flirts with Allen acknowledging his own penchant for wistful backwards glances.

But Midnight in Paris is one part romantic comedy of sorts, though with Wilson in the lead it's only vaguely romantic, and with the exception of a few choice bit parts, rarely funny. Of the cabal of Lost Generation giants that make appearances in the film, Corey Stoll in a rip-roaringly macho, dour, and hilariously literary turn as Hemingway stands out, as does Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein. Perhaps, though, the high point of the film comes courtesy Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. The single scene in which the Spanish surrealist fixates on a rhinoceros is outr art comedy at its finest. This guy deserves a film of his own, just not one by Woody Allen.

As should be expected with an Allen film, the women characters leave a lot to be desired: Inez is ostensibly there to act as the foil that pushes Gil toward his destiny but to do so she had to be shrewish, shallow, and unsupportive. Inez has no redeeming qualities that would hint at why Gil went out with her a second time, never mind proposed marriage; Adriana's ""job"" is professional adoring girlfriend of artistic geniuses; a classy art gallery guide (Carla Bruni) is a tool for Gil to vindicate himself with; and a young antique dealer, Gabrielle (La Seydoux), proves to be the girl of his dreams when she repeats - word for word - Gil's feelings on Paris in the rain. The common bond between them? They're hot and they all desperately want Gil. This is only a few steps away from porn logic - which is at least honest about its male fantasy.

Like Match Point (Tate galleries at every turn and rolling countryside perfect for fox hunts) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (fiery Spanish lovers sitting at charming cafs drinking wine), Midnight in Paris has a travelogue tone that never becomes to threatening, or steers too far from lushly photographed landmark set pieces (Look! The Eifel Tower! Again.). Whatever it is that has inspired Allen's diversion from what he knows best (Manhattan) remains a mystery, but after three major films it's clear Allen's brand of neurotic inertia doesn't transplant to Europe very well. Had Allen taken a stab at dismantling that perception of European laissez faire existentialism, he might have been on to something. But he didn't. Make your wagers now for how many shots the Colosseum will make it into - with excitable, hand-talking Italians walking by - in Allen's next European foray.

48,48,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Water as a Tool of War: Qaddafi Loyalists Turn Off Tap for Half of Libya - Circle of Blue WaterNews,https://www.circleofblue.org/2011/world/water-as-a-tool-of-war-qaddafi-loyalists-turn-off-tap-for-half-of-libya/,"Muammar Qaddafi’s great achievement of tapping desert aquifers and sending the water hundreds of kilometers to Tripoli, the capital, and other coastal cities is now the focal point for sabotage and siege. Aid agencies have begun humanitarian relief as rebel leaders try to gain control of water-producing regions.

Libyan forces loyal to Qaddafi have taken control of the operation center that supplies Tripoli with water from the Great Manmade River — the 2,820-kilometer (1,752-mile) network of pipes, pumps, and storage tanks that Qaddafi began building in 1984 — according to yesterday’s report by The National, an English-language newspaper in the United Arab Emirates.

The western half of the country is now without running water, according to The National, and international organizations have initiated relief efforts in the Libyan capital. Power cuts have disrupted the pumps running the water supply. Qaddafi’s forces have attacked water operation centers and still control two cities that are essential to operating the system. There have also been rumors that Qaddafi’s supporters have poisoned a reservoir, according to The National.

“Our staff were terrorized,” said Abdussalam Jehawi, a board member of the Great Manmade River Authority in Benghazi. The loyalists “stole their four-wheel drive vehicles, used machine guns, took all their food,” he told The National.

A back-up operations center in the eastern city of Sirte is also beyond reach. Sirte, Qaddafi’s hometown, is one of the few cities still held by troops loyal to the deposed leader.

A member of the rebel National Transitional Council told the Sydney Morning-Herald that the council was still trying to gain control over much of the country’s remote, rural southern region. He did not know of any plans for how to secure water supplies and oil facilities in that region.

The European Union has allocated $US 16 million for humanitarian needs. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) delivered some 113,000 bottles of water to Tripoli in the last week and is preparing to deliver 5 million liters (1.3 million gallons) by truck and tanker from sources in neighboring countries. An aid organization from the island country of Malta is sending a ship with 300,000 liters (80,000 gallons) of bulk water and 50,000 liters (13,000 gallons) of bottled water.

“UNICEF is responding to the immediate needs in Tripoli, but we remain extremely concerned about the situation, should there be a shortage of water in the coming days,” said Christian Balslev-Olesen, the head of UNICEF’s Libyan office, in a press statement. “This could turn into an unprecedented health epidemic.”

A UNICEF team is currently exploring alternative water supply wells within Libya.

The Great Manmade River provides billions of liters of water a day from 1,300 wells in the Sahara. Because substantial amounts of electricity are needed to move the water through the system, power cuts during the revolution have periodically put the water supply at risk.

Last week, during the first day of fighting in Tripoli, an 18-hour power outage cut new water supplies from flowing to the capital, The National reported. Now that they control most of the capital, the rebels are shifting their focus to the areas that regulate the water supply.

“This could be taken care of soon, if Sabha and Sirte are taken by the rebels,” Jehawi, the river authority board member, told The National. “Until then, there is not much we can do.”

Sabha, near the main water source for the Tripoli line of the Great Manmade River, is likely the last stronghold for Qaddafi, rebel leaders told Reuters.

Opposition forces have been fighting the Qaddafi regime since early this year, as waves of revolutionary action have rippled throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Last week, the Libyan rebels seized control of the capital for the first time.

The battle of September covers of renowned magazines is on.

September, the month that marks the change of seasons, is critical for magazines. Editors give it all they've got in coming up with great ideas and producing an excellent issue.

The cover, as the first thing readers see, naturally becomes the most important part that goes into making a magazine. The best of the best will be used, from photographers, stylists, makeup artists and the most attractive and 'in' models or stars.

Cosmopolitan invited Angelababy, a Hong Kong based model, to add new vitality into the cover. Harper's BAZAAR asked Tang Wei to shoot a face-shot cover with dazzling and charming red lips. Zhang Ziyi and Shu Qi both collaborated with ELLE and shot feminine and graceful covers. Vogue and Marie Claire gathered supermodels to cover this significant month.

Chinese actress Fan Bingbing has joined hands with top-class men's magazine Esquire and worked up quite a transformation for the magazine's 15th anniversary issue. Her delicate features and beautiful locks were nowhere to be seen with her new 'bald' head and masculine expression, making her stand out among the numerous feminine covers of other magazines.

This is the third time Fan Bingbing worked with Esquire. When asked whether she is scared for her upcoming 30th birthday, Fan replied: ""I'm scared of drinks with color, nightmares and tanning under the sun, but I'm not afraid of turning 30.""","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110830/001ec97909630fc69edb35.jpg,"['fan', 'issue', 'scared', 'magazine', 'bingbing', 'covers', 'making', 'outshines', 'worked', 'magazines', 'cover']", ,none
50,50,DR-2011-000121-CHN,What Afghans think of the war: 'Why are you Americans here?' - Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2011/0909/What-Afghans-think-of-the-war-Why-are-you-Americans-here,"Stacks of folded carpets line every wall of Haji Mohammad Qul's rug shop on Chicken Street, Kabul's shopping destination for foreigners in search of Afghan souvenirs.

Though Mr. Qul sells predominately traditional Persian carpets, like most Chicken Street venders he offers a small selection of Sept. 11-themed rugs. These commemorative carpets are about the size of a doormat and feature crude, hand-woven images of planes striking the World Trade Center.

Despite selling several of these rugs each month, Qul says he doesn't really know where the image on them comes from or what Sept. 11 is.

""It's just an item in our shop that we sell to Americans and Europeans,"" he says with a shrug.

When pressed on what, if anything, he knows about the events of Sept. 11, 2001, he changes the subject to a drought in northwest Afghanistan. Asked again, his teenage son, who everyone says is the most educated person in the family, reminds him about Osama bin Laden.

Qul continues: ""Yes, I think it's from bin Laden. We were refugees in Pakistan at that time, and I had to take care of my family.... I was too busy to pay attention to the political events in the news.""

A decade after Sept. 11, Qul is just one of many Afghans who say they have heard almost nothing about the attacks that led to the fall of the Taliban government and an ongoing, 10-year foreign military presence in his country.

As US policymakers debate keeping troops in Afghanistan as far out as 2024, the void of information among large swaths of the Afghan population this deep into the war may cast doubt on the ability of the United States to effectively accomplish its goals here in the coming years.

""The foreigners absolutely did not communicate.... They only spoke with bombs and guns,"" says Najib Mamalai, an independent political analyst in Kabul. ""They alienated every single human body in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq to their causes. Nobody believes in their cause now.""

Following the Sept. 11 attacks, the US invaded Afghanistan in order to eliminate it as a terrorist haven and to install a government capable of creating the stability required to support this goal. The US has spent an estimated $450 billion on the war in Afghanistan, including more than $70 billion on development projects. Additionally, more than 1,750 US soldiers and almost 950 soldiers from allied nations have lost their lives here. More than 13,000 US soldiers have been wounded.

Have the Soviets left?

Although there has been significant development in Afghanistan during the past 10 years, much of the country remains cut off from the recent wave of progress.

""They know why they are here. I don't know the reason why they are here. You should ask them why they are here, to make peace or to destroy Afghanistan. I don't know why,"" says Momin, who sells tailoring supplies in Jalalabad and, like many Afghans, only has one name. He also has no idea what occurred on Sept. 11. ""Something happened in Pakistan on this day, but I don't remember exactly what. I don't have details about it – maybe they had a fight with India,"" he speculates, adding that he is certain nothing happened in America on that day.

About 72 percent of the country is illiterate, and in some remote areas of the country there are small pockets of people who are unaware that the Soviet war ended – some 22 years ago. In rural areas that now have cellphone service, there remain Afghans who've never used a telephone and say they have no need for one.

During the Taliban regime, television was banned. Only a very small group of people had access to sets they'd managed to hide. Mohammad Kabir Raufi, another carpet vendor in Kabul, had managed to keep one hidden in his house despite the prohibition. He remembers watching the events unfold on Sept. 11.

""It's just the educated people who work and have knowledge who will recognize [images of 9/11],"" says Mr. Raufi. ""The ordinary people will not. They don't know where the twin towers were or what happened to them and what was the result of the attack.""

More common are Afghans who heard of the attacks and sensed the inevitability of yet another war in their country. As US and NATO forces began pouring into the nation, though, the attacks in New York and Washington and the crash in Pennsylvania became an afterthought for Afghans who were understandably more focused on the troops in their own country.

Even among educated Afghans who know what happened on Sept. 11, there are still many who strongly doubt what they saw or heard and earnestly believe readily disprovable conspiracy theories.

Habibullah Rafi is a respected historian who specializes in Kabul history at the Afghanistan Academy of Sciences, an academic research institute. On the morning of the attacks, he was with his family in Calgary, Alberta. Today he says that he believes America planned the attacks so it could invade Afghanistan and Iraq.

""After Russia was destroyed in Afghan­is­tan, America needed a way to sneak in here,"" he says, echoing a popular theory.

Among his reasons that the US remains here, he lists America's plan to ""steal Afghanistan's resources."" Although the country could be sitting on considerable mineral deposits, the scope of these deposits is still debated, and many experts speculate that the cost of extracting them could severely diminish returns on the minerals. So far, China is the only nation conducting major mining operations here.

Though concerns about Israel are predominately confined to the Arab world and not a major topic of conversation in Afghanistan, Mr. Rafi also accuses the US of wanting to pave the way for an Israeli occupation here.

The most popular conspiracy theory for Israeli regional domination, based on a fraudulent document, says that Israeli territorial ambitions extend to the Euphrates River in Iraq, about 1,000 miles from Afghanistan's western border. There is presently only one known Jewish man living in all of Afghanistan: Zablon Simintov. His family frequently urges him to move to Israel.

US reassurances that troops are in Afghanistan to eliminate terrorist havens seem increasingly suspect to Afghans after Mr. bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in May, and even more so now that Al Qaeda's No. 2 was killed there in late August.

Even for those who've heard America's message about why the US must stay in Afghanistan, strong indications that Al Qaeda has relocated to Pakistan – combined with a civilian death toll that has risen with each new year – help fuel suspicion and misinformation.

""After Osama and a lot of other Al Qaeda leaders were killed [in Pakistan], still America is here in Afghanistan,"" says Saleh Mohammed Saleh, a member of the Afghan parliament from Kunar. ""This makes the Afghans not trust anyone and be suspicious of the activities of America.""

Living in a nation transformed

Today, the actual causes of the war are largely irrelevant to many Afghans who now live in a nation that has been completely transformed by the US presence.

""At the beginning, it had a very positive effect for our business and it was a shining moment for us,"" says Majeed Uzbek, who sells handicrafts in Kabul. ""They came because the Taliban did this attack and they've done a lot of rebuilding. This was 100 percent good for Afghanistan.""

Indeed, foreign aid in Afghanistan has had such a massive impact that the World Bank now estimates that international military and donor spending accounts for 97 percent of the country's gross domestic product. This estimate has triggered concerns among US policymakers that the Afghan economy might collapse as foreign spending decreases in Afghanistan.

But many Afghans complain that only a select few actually see any monetary benefit from the war.

""Only the people in the cities are happy with the American presence, because their lives have changed a little – along with the warlords who got rich during this period,"" says Shah Mahmoud Hamdard, a pharmacist in Uruzgan Province in the south of Afghanistan. "" But if you go to rural areas, especially Uruzgan, the life of the people has not changed or maybe got worse during these past 10 years.""","Fri, 09 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.csmonitor.com/csmarchives/2011/09/0912-OAFWAR-AFGHANISTAN.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,"['country', 'americans', 'afghanistan', 'attacks', 'sept', '11', 'war', 'pakistan', 'dont', 'afghans', 'think', 'know']", ,none

Actor Mel Gibson will pay the mother of his 22 month-old daughter $750,000 and get joint custody of the child, ending a bitter custody and financial dispute that badly damaged his Hollywood career.

The ""Braveheart"" director and his former musician girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva agreed to a settlement detailed in a Los Angeles Superior Court hearing on Wednesday following a more than year-long war of words.

Judge Peter Lichtman banned both Gibson and Grigorieva from writing books about their relationship, which unraveled in early 2010 amid accusations of violence and extortion.

""I would like to thank your honor for bringing this matter to a reasonable conclusion,"" Gibson told Lichtman at Wednesday's hearing.

Grigorieva, who had been seeking millions of dollars from the Oscar-winning actor, thanked Lichtman for ""the tremendous help to resolve this situation.""

The acrimony between the couple became public a year ago when taped phone calls were leaked online in which Gibson was heard ranting, cursing and insulting Grigorieva.

The leak appeared to have been aimed at putting pressure on the actor to increase an initial settlement offer to Grigorieva that was reported to be around $15 million. Los Angeles prosecutors later decided against charging Grigorieva with extortion.

In March, Gibson admitted slapping Grigorieva during an argument and was sentenced to three years probation.

The widely-heard tapes further tarnished a reputation damaged by Gibson's 2006 anti-Semitic tirade following a drunk driving arrest in Malibu.

His manager quit, he lost a cameo role in ""The Hangover: Part Two"" because other people refused to work with him, and the release of his movie ""The Beaver"" was delayed and ultimately flopped at box offices in May.

Gibson, who was once estimated to be worth $900 million after a string of hit movies like ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""The passion of the Christ"", reached a private settlement with his wife Robyn in June that wrapped up their divorce after 28 years of marriage.","Thu, 01 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110901/b8ac6f27aa0f0fc96ce70b.jpg,"['damaged', 'mel', 'financial', 'lichtman', 'gibson', 'settles', '750000', 'custody', 'grigorieva', 'los', 'angeles', 'settlement']", ,none

ISRO scientists have given the green signal to the engineering model, while the flight model is being assembled in Banglore, IIT-K Registrar Sanjeev Kashalkar said.

Over 62 students and faculty members of the institute worked hard to built ‘Jugnu’ weighing 3 kg, he said.

On being asked about the delay in the project, he said it took some time for the faculty members and students as it was an indigenously built satellite.

“Jugnu is likely to be launched by the end of next month if everything goes according to our plans,” he said.

Even though Rs. 2 crore was sanctioned for developing the satellite, the cost was brought down to a lesser amount as the institute came up with indigenous technique, he said.

The ISRO and IIT-K had signed a MoU to develop the micro satellite in 2008.

The satellite which will be in the space for about a year will be launched with the help of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), he said.

The data received from ‘Jugnu’ will be studied with the help of a tracking system installed at IIT-K and the received pictures and information from it will be used for research purpose.

54,54,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Crape myrtle tree: Beauties that can take the heat - Los Angeles Times,https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/home_blog/2011/09/crape-myrtle-trees.html,"It’s no better when trying to explain crepe versus crape, a task that reduced the writer of an information sheet for the horticultural extension service Floridata to exclaim, “It's a common name and since there's no authority that manages common names for plants, you can spell (or call it) whatever you like!” The crape myrtle became popular in spite of dowdy nomenclature because of exceptional mettle and formidable beauty. The early and most popular introduction to the U.S., Lagerstroemia indica , is notable for the streaked taupe- and sage-colored trunks, exceptionally hard and smooth wood, and blushing variety of flowers.

An artist friend of mine calls crape myrtles “living bouquets.” In the hottest weeks of summer, the man to whom we owe thanks for the white, pink, lavender and red bouquets now before us, often un-watered and somehow unwilted, is Donald Roy Egolf. From 1958 until his death in 1990, Egolf was a plant breeder at the U.S. National Arboretum in Washington, D.C. His contribution was so outstanding that this column, besides constituting the deepest of bows to those wonderful plants, bears the suggestion that we rename the crape myrtle the Egolf tree, or Egolfus donaldii, so as to take in many new compact and shrub forms. This is only half in jest. The existing names are crying out for a makeover. In the 18th century, Linnaeus, the Swedish father of modern systematics, honored countryman Magnus von Lagerström by donning the crape myrtle genus Lagerstroemia. As more and more variations -- trees as well as woody shrubs -- were discovered in India, China, Japan and Australia (never Sweden), the genus grew.

Yet susceptibility to mildew, which can deform those fantastic flowers, dogged the reputation of Lagerstoemia indica for more than a century. In the 1960s, it was part of what inspired Egolf to embark on what became an epic breeding program crossing indica with the Japanese species, Lagerstroemia fauriei

“Fauriei gives the plants the mildew resistance,” Pooler said. After what Pooler can only guess were “tens of thousands” of experimental crosses, then successive testing by cooperating nurseries, a new generation of hardy crape myrtle cultivars was born. The National Arboretum introductions are immediately recognizable through tribal names such as Hopi, Arapaho and Muskogee.



“Lagerstroemia fauriei tend to be trees,"" Pooler said. ""They’re big plants. Faurieis all have white flowers and they don’t rebloom.” By contrast, some indicas not only come in a rainbow of colors but also rebloom. Shortly after the flowers fall in September, a spectacular autumn leaf show begins. By the time leaves running the gamut from orange to deep burgundy have fallen, the crape myrtle will have given more than four months of spectacular color. (That colorful foliage pictured at right was photographed in Woodland Hills in a previous September.)



To the eyes of connoisseurs, however, bare-limbed winter might be the tree’s best season. When it comes to crape myrtle bark, whether it is the lighter sage tones of the indica or cinnamon color of the fauriei, for elegance of shedding and suppleness of underwood, the crape myrtle can rival its barky beauties manzanitas and madrone any day.



To Pooler, who oversees open-air trial grounds in the relatively wet climate of the mid-Atlantic, it comes as a surprise that Westerners prize crape myrtles for their drought tolerance. Some USDA maps don’t even show California as part of the plant’s growing range. Yet if you look where university extension programs and nurseries have embraced crape myrtles, you will find locales that are hot and often dry: Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and California. To the mind of Nicholas Staddon, director of new introductions for California’s Monrovia Nursery, these plants bring crucial late summer grace notes to regions that by late August and early September are deep red on the USDA drought monitor.

“As a general statement, Lagerstroemia need regular watering when they first start out,” Staddon said, “but it is absolutely amazing how drought tolerant they become when they’re larger.”



His recommendations for Southern California homeowners include the hybrid shrub or small tree Pecos for pink blossoms, dark bark and maroon fall leaves; the indica cultivar Catawba for violet flowers and red-orange fall leaves; and hybrid Zuni for purple flowers and orange-red autumnal leaves. A favorite of his is the Oklahoma State University indica cultivar Centennial Spirit for a large shrub or tree because of its deep red, long-blossoming flowers.

For homeowners who have small spaces, are looking for low-growing shrubs or wish to grow crape myrtles in pots, Staddon also suggests the University of Georgia dwarf series of Cherry Dazzle, Raspberry Dazzle and Snow Dazzle.



The potential for partnering crape myrtles of different sizes (from ground cover to tree), of different flower colors (white to burgundy), different fall foliage (orange to crimson) and different bark types (green-gray to cinnamon) is so wide open as to defy planting suggestions. They work beautifully in Asian gardens but look ideal in a cottage garden. When artfully pruned, their grace as multilimbed open trees make them a Modernist’s dream. For a native plant lover like me, they partner perfectly with shrub and ground-cover cultivars of manzanita. Bees do browse, and Pooler noted a light scent.



In every instance, they are water-wise, so tough that city of Pasadena urban forester Darya Barar likes to use them in tough spots, such as a row of little tree wells along Fair Oaks Avenue, where a larger, arguably more beneficial shade tree simply wouldn’t fit. In this thankless situation, Barar’s succession of cleverly selected crape myrtles responds with a blushing bouquet of summer flowers and autumn foliage. (The photo above shows an unwatered tree after a week in which temperatures spiked above 100.)



In home settings, Barar and Staddon see crape myrtles as ideal candidates for patio plants. To get young trees established in the ground in the foothills, Barar recommends a drizzling hose running for 45 minutes once a week in dry season. Potted plants will need daily water outside of dormancy and periodic soaking when dormant; they will endure pots, but if you can, put them in the ground.



For those who do their own pruning, Clemson University has produced an excellent guide. This much is obvious to the National Arboretum’s Pooler: If your crape myrtle needs regular hacking, it’s in the wrong place. A perfect pruning maintenance regime would be doing nothing. Apart from the lightest clearing of dead growth and pruning of suckers if you want to preserve a more open or tree form, these generally slow-growing plants should not require regular work, or water. Most appreciate full sun.



If it comes to taking out a badly positioned or hopelessly mutilated crape myrtle, harvest it carefully, retaining the limbs in long sections. Even call a local carpenter. This is prized hardwood. Also expect the roots to resprout. While this can be a nuisance with grafted plants such as roses, the beauty with crape myrtles (largely propagated from cuttings, so have true-to-breed rootstock) is that they flower on new growth each season. This means that suckering roots from a felled tree will emerge as a clump of late summer flowers. According to Pooler, in cold regions where crape myrtles can’t survive the frost but roots do live in mulched beds, gardeners use them as annuals.



Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden horticulturist Frank McDonough mans the county’s help line for troubled gardeners. Many of the problems that he hears about with crape myrtles, he said, concern mildew on indicas set in lawn and inundated by sprinklers. Another common insult, he said, is weed whacking scars on trunks -- yet another reason to reduce or remove water hogging lawn and offer your neighbors hardy and beautiful flowering trees and shrubs instead. The funniest note from McDonough wasn’t about how we water crape myrtles but how they water us. If you’ve ever wondered where fine droplets came from on a clear sunny day in summer, look to your crape myrtle, he said. The “spitting,” he said, comes from the flowers. (That's the white crape myrtle Natchez, photographed last month in Jackson, N.C.)



Egolf’s obituary in the Washington Post records that after nearly 30 years of crossing crape myrtles, he produced 23 named cultivars. The idea -- Egolf’s idea -- behind the tribal series names, explained Pooler, was to identify them immediately as a product of the National Arboretum. It was pure gravy that these trees proved so durable in the dry West. So let’s keep the tribal names begun by Egolf and change the botanical and common ones. Here’s to the Egolf tree, whether it be a Comanche, Sioux or Cheyenne. In fact, from this fan out West, a request to the National Arboretum: How about an Egolf Gabrielino?

In his speech before Congress on Thursday, President Obama is expected to mention one state program that he says is working to create jobs in this bad economy.

It's called Georgia Work$, and it's a voluntary program that pays people who are receiving unemployment benefits a small stipend while they receive up to eight weeks of on-the-job training at a participating company, in the hope that they get hired. The companies, in essence, get free labor, while employees get a chance at a more permanent job.

While it's clearly an oversimplification, we couldn't allow this anniversary to pass without offering our own list of ""winners & losers"" in the decade since 9/11 and the accompanying ""war on terror.""The years since 9/11 have witnessed the biggest expansion of the U.S. national-security state since the Cold War. Over the course of the decade, Washington has spent well over $7 trillion on the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. (The U.S. intelligence budget alone, for example, has doubled over the past 10 years.) The creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the establishment of a new Director of National Intelligence amounted to the largest reorganization of the federal government since World War II.Many of the details remain obscure, however, thanks to a corresponding widening of the culture of official secrecy. In its expose "","" ""The Washington Post"" revealed that 854,000 people now hold top-secret security clearances, and that 33 building complexes had been built for top-secret intelligence work in Washington and the surrounding area since 9/11. ""Together they occupy the equivalent of almost three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings -- about 17 million square feet of space.""During their fight to establish control over Afghanistan in the 1990s, the overwhelmingly Sunni Taliban massacred Afghan Shi'a and killed 10 Iranian diplomats stationed in the north of the country. So Tehran was only too happy to see the Americans wipe out the Taliban government in autumn 2001. Iran's leaders were even happier when the new government of President Hamid Karzai turned out to include leading members of the Northern Alliance (including many Persian-speaking Tajiks who had benefited from Iranian support during their long years of resisting the Taliban). In 2003, when U.S. troops invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein, the Iranian government had reason to rejoice again. Hussein, the man who unleashed the eight-year Iran-Iraq War in 1981, was Iran's bitterest enemy, and his Ba'athist government was replaced by leading members of Iraq's majority Shi'ite community. Many of them had lived in Iran or otherwise enjoyed Iranian sponsorship for decades before the U.S. invasion.All this has considerably boosted Iran's regional influence even as the country continues to develop its nuclear program.Before 9/11 there were just a few private security companies in the world, usually operating well outside the limelight. But over the past decade the business has. That growth has spurred concerns about the wisdom of empowering private companies to carry out many of the functions once performed by the official military. During the war in Iraq the name of the company Blackwater became such a synonym for gun-toting irresponsibility that it was forced to rebrand itself. (Now it calls itself, rather mysteriously, ""Xe."") Next year, the U.S. State Department is actually set to double the number of private security contractors working for it in Iraq (from 2,700 to 5,500).Of course, 9/11 has been a boon to the broader private security industry as well. Everyone from the manufacturers of airport scanners to those little bottles for getting your shampoo past security have seen a windfall as well.Ex-KGB man Vladimir Putin rose to the presidency on the back of his prosecution of Russia's second war against Islamist rebels in the breakaway North Caucasus republic of Chechnya. Before 9/11, many Western governments criticized Russia for its attack on the separatists, which included indiscriminate use of bombing and artillery and the ""disappearing"" of large numbers of young Chechen men. Ties between some of the separatists and Al-Qaeda received considerably less attention. But in the wake of the attacks in New York and Washington, only the latter point seemed to matter any more. The Kremlin and the White House agreed to share intelligence and cooperate in Afghanistan, and U.S. criticism of Russia's human rights record suddenly quieted dramatically.Other dictators in the post-Soviet Union -- especially in Afghanistan's Central Asian neighbors -- were also happy to play up the terrorist threat in return for U.S. support. All too often the need to keep supply lines to the war effort in Afghanistan trumped human rights concerns.During the Cold War, the West's communist opponents prided themselves on their atheism, which made professing the creed of nonbelief somewhat complicated. Not so in the 21st century. The spectacle of religiously motivated aggression presented by the September 11 attacks has provided a powerful argument to those who dismiss faith as mere superstition. Philosopher Daniel Dennett, physicist Stephen Hawking, and journalist Christopher Hitchens have all figured prominently in the attack on organized religion. Prominent atheist Richard Dawkins sold 2 million copies of his 2006 book ""The God Delusion"" --before the start of the ""war on terror.""Atheists still face something of an uphill climb, though: Islam remains the world's fastest-growing religion, and an overwhelming majority of Americans continue to profess belief in God.By the end of the last century, the U.S. aerospace industry had developed remote-controlled unmanned aircraft that used advanced communications and information technology to spy on hard-to-reach targets in far-away places. Then someone got the idea of putting missiles on the drones. Ten years later, the military robotics industry is. The U.S. Air Force now trains more operators for ""remotely piloted vehicles"" than it does pilots. The success of U.S. drone warfare is driving a global boom in military robotics that is transforming the nature of war itself.Even though Turkey has had a few scattered problem with Islamists of its own, the decade since 9/11 has been mostly the story of a steady uphill climb. The government of moderate Islamist Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who came to power in 2003, has overseen a period of strong economic growth that it has used to bolster its credentials as the one country in the greater Middle East that has managed to embrace progress even as it stresses its Islamic roots. Erdogan has managed to maintain Turkey's NATO membership even while the Turks have defied the United States on some issues (such as denying access to U.S. troops on their way to invade Iraq in 2003). Turkey has also boosted ties with countries like Iran and Syria at the same time as it has pursued improved relations with the European Union and Russia. The post-9/11 dysfunction of places like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia has helped Turkey to burnish its credentialsIn the weeks following September 11, Congress passed two laws that gave the White House far-reaching powers for prosecuting the war against Al-Qaeda. The first, the Authorization for Use of Military Force, granted the president the authority ""to use all necessary and appropriate force"" against the terrorists -- essentially carte blanche for the president to do whatever he deemed worth doing. The second, the USA Patriot Act, gave the federal government broad scope for conducting surveillance against its own citizens with the aim of preventing future attacks.Over the past 10 years the Supreme Court and Congress have curtailed much of the power that the executive branch accrued during the opening phases of the ""war on terror"" -- but not all of it. Though the Obama administration has put an end to some of its predecessor's policies, including the approval of some forms of torture in interrogations, President Barack Obama has also extended some parts of the Patriot Act. He is holding to aand he has continued the CIA's drone campaign against targets in Pakistan with minimal public accountability. But then, don't wars always end up giving more power to presidents?The antisecrecy website's greatest scoops -- hundreds of thousands of declassified cables on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- would have had far less oomph with no ""war on terror"" to illuminate. WikiLeaks impresario Julian Assange likes to compare himself with Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, whom he credits with singlehandedly ending the Vietnam War. (Didn't the Viet Cong have something to do with it? Never mind.) Let's face it, revelations about trade negotiations just aren't as sexy.Thirty years of war have not helped Afghanistan's environment, which is also bedeviled by drought, deforestation and the plundering of resources. But one ray of light shone through this summer when the country's national environmental protection agency approved protection for 33 endangered species in the country, including the(panthera uncia). There's little the government can do to enforce its laws, but every little bit helps; the Taliban would have never gone to the trouble. The recent creation of a national park in Bamiyan Province also raises hopes that Afghanistan's nature can finally catch a break.2,996 people lost their lives in the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and in the aircraft that crashed into them. 1,300 orphans were created that day. In the 10 years since, the New York City coroners' office-- just under 60 percent of the total. The rest remain unofficially accounted for. The terrorist attacks of September 2001 tore a hole in the lives of thousands of people that can never be filled.Small wonder that 500 relatives of the 9/11 victims are suing the bin Laden family company and Saudi princes for $1 trillion. The aim: to prevent future financing of similar attacks.Yes, Al-Qaeda succeeded in striking a huge blow at the United States and its economy. Yet the organizers of the attack clearly did not foresee what they were unleashing. In his statements during the 1990s, Osama bin Laden referenced the 1983 suicide bombing in Lebanon that spurred Ronald Reagan to remove U.S. Marines from that country as well as the 1993 Mogadishu battle that led the U.S. to abandon its Somalian peacekeeping operation. Bin Laden believed that the Americans were too cowardly to retaliate on a grand scale. As a result, the full-blown U.S. assault on Afghanistan in the weeks after 9/11 clearly caught him off-guard, and the main Al Qaeda organization never really managed to recover its balance. Osama bin Laden is dead. The planner of the 9/11 attack, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is in U.S. captivity. Countless other Al-Qaeda operatives have been killed or captured, reducing the organization to a shadow of its former self. Unfortunately, the ideas that fueled it live on.The political and religious tensions fueled by the 9/11 attacks and the U.S. response to them have affected no country more dramatically than Pakistan. Over the past 10 years more than 30,000 Pakistanis have died as the result of terrorist attacks -- including Benazir Bhutto, the country's former prime minister, and a number of other leading cultural and political figures. U.S. attacks on jihadi safe havens in the Pakistani tribal areas have fueled an anti-Western backlash among many people in the country and exacerbated an already severe jihadi threat. The spiral of radicalization threatens the very integrity of the country.The overwhelming majority of Pakistanis are likely more concerned about development than politics. But they have seen little benefit from the billions of dollars the United States has transferred to Islamabad in the years since 9/11, most of which has gone straight to the military.Just over 6,000 U.S. service members have lost their lives in the U.S. ""war on terror,"" and another 43,000 have suffered injuries. The second number might not seem so daunting until you realize that a large percentage of those wounds involve severe brain trauma and the loss of one or more limbs as the result of hugely destructive roadside bombs favored by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. The flood of casualties has overtaxed the health system for veterans.The brunt of the vast overseas military commitments assumed by the United States since 9/11 has been born disproportionately by the relatively small number of Americans who serve in the armed forces and their families. Many regular soldiers and Marines have spent multiple tours of duty overseas -- creating enormous burdens for their families at home. Civilian America, by contrast, has made few comparable sacrifices for the war effort.2,753 of the nearly 3,000 people lost on 9/11 died in the World Trade Center. Among them were 343 firefighters and 60 police officers. People from some 70 countries were among the dead, reflecting New York City's vaunted multicultural character. Another 422,000 New Yorkers have displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder since the attacks. And thousands of first responders -- firefighters, medical emergency personnel, and others who participated in the rescue effort at Ground Zero -- appear to be suffering from lung disease and cancer as a result of inhaling toxic fumes and dust from the collapsed towers. Hundreds of them have died since the attacks, though it is hard to be sure just how many of those deaths can be attributed directly to the aftereffects of 9/11.The city. It was compelled to accept billions of dollars in emergency aid from the federal government in the two years after the attacks. It is estimated that New York City has lost a net total of 100,000 jobs in the decade since 9/11. And that's not even to mention the invisible hole in a majestic skyline.Rank-and-file Muslims in the United States and Great Britain had to cope with a flurry of hate crimes and angry incriminations in the aftermath of 9/11 attacks. Though many Muslim organizations publicly distanced themselves from Al-Qaeda and its actions, Western public opinion tended to focus instead on indications of strong anti-Western sentiment in many Islamic countries -- especially in reaction to America's military and political interventions in the Middle East and South Asia.In fact, though, there is plenty of evidence that Muslims' revulsion toward Al-Qaeda and its allies has steadily grown over the years -- not least because it is mainly Muslims who have died in the countless suicide bombings in Iraq and Afghanistan. (Indeed, Al-Qaeda's No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahiri, once famously chided Iraqi Al-Qaeda operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi for unnecessarily stoking sectarian warfare.) Nowadays jihadi websites tend to spend lots of time complaining about their inability to find recruits.The polarizing effect of 9/11 and America's response to it long overshadowed theuntil the 2009 Green Revolution in Iran and the more recent Arab Spring, which have shown that many young Muslims around the world reject violence and terrorism and aspire instead to peaceful political change.Before 9/11 only 10 percent of bags checked on flights in the United States were screened for weapons or explosives. Five weeks after the attacks, President George W. Bush signed a law mandating that all bags be screened. U.S. airline passengers, previously accustomed to only cursory checks, now had to get used to arriving at airports hours in advance, removing shoes, belts, and water bottles before submitting themselves to elaborate checks. As the U.S. authorities demanded comparable scrutiny on flights coming into the country, these innovations have rippled out through the international aviation system.On the planes themselves, a new era of vigilance and paranoia kicked in -- sometimes justifiably, as shown in the case of the ""underwear bomber"" thwarted by passengers in December 2009. Back on the ground, though, the effects are debatable. Recent tests of airport security systems by enterprising journalists have shown that determined smugglers can still get plenty of dubious articles through the checks.The informal and anonymous networks used for financial transactions in much of the Middle East and South Asia. But the revelation that Al-Qaeda sometimes used hawalas to transfer the funds for their operations triggered a backlash. In Afghanistan, U.S. task forces have cracked down on leading hawalas to curtail financial flows of drug lords and insurgents. The U.S. Treasury Department has pressured Dubai and other Persian Gulf banking centers to implement tough money-laundering laws. And U.S. intelligence agencies have used electronic-surveillance techniques to ensure that the money changing hands through hawalas is clean. Hawalas may never be the same.Pacifists are still around, but arguing the case has certainly become harder in an age when terrorist groups explicitly embrace suicide-bombing attacks on defenseless civilians. (""Where Have All the Pacifists Gone?"" ran the plaintive title of one 2003 essay.) In the United States, a wave of patriotic sentiment in the wake of the attacks inspired thousands of college-age Americans to sign up for military service rather than antiwar demonstrations.The peaceniks who remain earn respect precisely for their noble persistence in the face of overwhelming odds. The name of one group formed by family members who lost loved ones in the 2001 attacks says it all: "".""Osama bin Laden made sure that most of the hijackers on the 9/11 planes were Saudi citizens -- knowing that the resulting revelation would complicate the kingdom's relationship with the United States. It worked, at least in part. While Washington and Riyadh have more or less managed to carry on as before, U.S. public opinion toward Sauid Arabia has taken a nosedive. 9/11 threw a harsh spotlight on Saudi financial support for many extremist groups around the world as well as the Neanderthal doctrines of the Wahhabi Islam practiced inside the kingdom. No one in the outside world cared much about Saudi women being denied the right to drive until after 9/11.And even as the longing for reform seems to have gained strength in the wake of the Arab Spring, Al-Qaeda-style radicals who decry the royal family's decadent habits are still finding plenty of traction. The monarchy's future does not look promising.","Thu, 08 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.rferl.org/Content/responsive/RFE/en-US/img/top_logo_news.png,"['afghanistan', 'united', 'attacks', 'security', 'alqaeda', 'losers', 'states', '911', 'war', 'iraq', 'winners', 'president']", ,none
57,57,DR-2011-000121-CHN,The limits of farming - The Boston Globe - Boston Globe,http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2011/09/04/the_limits_of_farming/,"BY THE year 2050, Earth will be home to another 2 or 3 billion more people. The most vexing question is: How will we feed them all? Not only will there be more people, but everyone will have more money to spend on food. Where, on this ever more crowded planet, will we grow all of it?

By 2050, the world’s farmers will need to supply almost twice as much food as they do today, according to an analysis by the World Wildlife Fund. Put another way, we will need to produce as much food in the next 40 years as have in the last 8,000.

Where will the food come from? Today, we use about a third of the planet’s land surface for agriculture, according to Jason Clay, a senior vice president at the fund who prepared the analysis. But when you subtract the areas that are already “taken’’ - deserts, mountains, lakes, rivers, cities, and highways - the figure rises to about 58 percent of the land. Take out the national parks and other protected areas, and food production already consumes 70 percent of available space. At current growth rates, Clay says, we will be nearing the planet’s capacity by 2050.

For every square inch of unclaimed land to be converted to farming would be an irreversible ecological disaster. But even if you are entirely deaf to green arguments, the problem is fundamental and unavoidable: At some point, the amount of land devoted to agriculture must stop expanding, because there is only so much land.

What we must do, then, is freeze the footprint of food - find a way to roughly double the productivity of farming, so that we can produce twice as much food on the same amount of land. It is a daunting technological and social challenge, and one that does not have a single solution, according to Clay’s report on the idea in a recent issue of Nature.

The most powerful tool is one that makes some environmentalists uncomfortable: genetics. The tools of modern biology have brought tremendous improvements in some crops, like corn, by breeding in traits like faster growth and increased resistance to drought and disease. But of the 10 crops that produce about three quarters of the world’s food, only one is on track to double production by 2050.

A consortium including the World Wildlife Fund and BGI, a genome research group based in China, will be working through a list of “orphan crops,’’ such as cassava, banana, and peanuts, which are widely used for food, but which have not had their DNA sequenced. Such information would make breeding useful traits faster and more efficient.

Without genetics, it is hard to see how the footprint of food will ever be frozen, or how we will avoid hitting the planet’s limited land capacity. For those who shudder at the very mention of genetics, remember that genetic manipulation is what created almost all the food we eat. Those delicious heirloom tomatoes you enjoy? They are the product of genetic engineering - albeit a cumbersome form of it - at the hands of farmers.

Another approach is to reclaim land that was farmed and then abandoned. When I spoke with Clay recently, he was in Brazil, and he told me that some farmers there were buying degraded land and using no-till farming to grow soybeans. The value of the land has been increasing even more than the income from their crops - a win for everyone.

“What they are doing is growing soil instead of soybeans,’’ Clay said.

The planet’s limited land area is a stark fact that changes how you look at farming. For example, from a long-term global perspective, organic farming is a problem. Organic generally takes more land to produce the same amount of food. Done on a vast scale, it could aggravate the conversion of wild land to agriculture.

There are many problems vying for our attention, but this is one we simply have to get a handle on: Farming must get better, or it will continue to expand - until it can’t.

59,59,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Farmers' choice: Vamban 6 blackgram variety - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/farmers-choice-vamban-6-blackgram-variety/article2432985.ece,"A new variety blackgram called Vamban 6 has been developed at the National Pulses Research Centre, Vambam, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

According to Dr. P. Murugesa Boopathi, Vice Chancellor, the new blackgram variety comes to harvest in 65 to 70 days and is suitable for growing in all seasons.

Better yield

“It is heartening to note that Vamban 6 gives high yield, about 890 kg/ha in irrigated condition and as high as 850 kg/ha in rainfed. The variety is preferred by farmers because it yields higher and is resistant to yellow mosaic virus disease and the possible damage due to pod borer is less,” he said.

Dr. M. Paramathma, Director of Research urged farmers who prefered to take up this new variety for cultivation, to treat the seeds with two grams Carbendazim or Thiram per kg of seed.

Recommendation

“Rhizobium should be mixed with seeds after 24 hours of Carbendazim treatment. For an hectare 20 kg seeds are sufficient. Three packets of Rhizobium mixture with rice gruel shade dried for 15 minutes is recommended.

Reiterating the urgent need for increasing the pulses production, Dr. Murugesa Boopathi suggested two critical technologies to double the pulses yield, namely the seed drill to maintain proper plant population and using mobile sprinkler for irrigation during 35 to 45 days after sowing.

Pulse wonder

He also said that the University has developed “TNAU pulse wonder”, a micro nutrient mixture to boost pulse yield.”

This, if popularized widely, will have great impact on increasing the yield up to 20 per cent, he added.

Apart from these benefits, the pulse wonder also decreases flower shedding and increases drought tolerance.

Mechanisation of pulse cultivation is a priority area according to Dr. Boopathi who stressed that “it is planned to create a model farm at the National Pulses Research Centre which would be under 100 per cent mechanization as a demonstration plot to educate farmers.”

60,60,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Chile bets on early pomegranate varieties - FreshFruitPortal.com - Fresh Fruit Portal,https://www.freshfruitportal.com/news/2011/09/12/chile-bets-on-early-pomegranate-varieties-2/,"Chilean fruit company Subsole has taken on three Israeli pomegranate varieties in a bid to extend the season, amid growing demand for the product and the opening of new markets.

The Chilean industry is currently dominated by the late-growing Wonderful variety and the fruit is certified for export to the European Union, Russia and the U.S. If pomegranate popularity rises further it could be a good way for Chile to solve its water problems, as the fruit is highly drought resistant.

Subsole managing director Claudio Sarah told www.freshfruitportal.com the new early varieties Emek and Shani-Yonay, as well as late-growing Kamel would be licensed in a controlled and responsible way.

""It's important to have volumes but in the future. The first thing we're focusing on is quality,"" says Sarah.

The varieties were developed by Israel's agricultural research institute Vulcani Center, which has undertaken significant genetic improvement efforts for the fruit that is highly consumed in the Middle Eastern region. The center is working with Subsole and Chilean nursery Viverosur in commercializing the varieties in Chile.

Viverosur general manager Alejandro Navarro, says the objective is to safeguard cultivated area for the varieties to achieve good profitability levels for producers.

""In this way a new set of pomegranate varieties are generated that enhance the fruit's production under solid criteria, differentiating from the disparities present with the Wonderful variety due to its high genetic variability,"" he says.

While Subsole is the founding partner for the varieties in Chile, other companies have committed to planting them too such as Dole Chile, Agricola Garcés, Agrícola Plaza Vieja, and more recently berry exporter Valle Maule.

""We're dealing in a long-term initiative that will improve not only the supply but will also consolidate the Chilean presence in international markets, assuring better prices through a transition between the early varieties and the Wonderful as a late fruit,"" says Subsole president Miguel Allamand.

The three varieties are characterized by their good taste, colorful aril-covered seeds, attractive consistency, and a strong red peel that delivers better protection from the sun in comparison to the Wonderful. Following healthy demand in global markets, plantation area for Emek, Shani-Yonay and Kamel has grown strongly in Israel.

Meeting market needs

""The market wants fruit that's early and red, and today the earliest we have is in Copiapó, where we start in March,"" says Sarah.

The advantage of the three Israeli varieties is that they ripen for harvest between one and two months before the Wonderful, starting with the Emek. This allows for a diverse range of benefits including the arrival of fruit in destination markets during periods of low supply.

From a productive point of view, the new varieties also allow growers to offset the adverse weather conditions in the late summer as pomegranates are very sensitive to rain.

""Like any early fruit the distribution of sizes of the Emek and Shani-Yonay is reduced, and it's maximum potential productivity is lower than the later varieties, except the Kamel which is like the Wonderful,"" says Subsole agronomist Constanza Hojas.

In terms of export the Wonderful tends to pack an average of 50% categories 1 and 2 export quality, but the Israeli varieties have an export pack rate of around 70%. Subsole expects to have the fruit ready for trade in 2015, with the first plantations to take place this Spring in Vicuña, Ovalle and Copiapó with a starting area of around 40 hectares.

61,61,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Malaysian journalist killed in Somalia - CNN.com - CNN International,http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/09/03/somalia.journalist.killed/,"(CNN) -- Somalia's government said Saturday they are investigating the death of a Malaysian cameraman who was shot dead when African Union peacekeepers allegedly fired on his convoy.

Noramfaizul Mohd Nor was travelling with a convoy of humanitarian workers when a contingent of Ugandan-nationals with AMISOM opened fire, killing Nor and wounding another journalist, TV-3 reporter Aji Saregar Mazlan, Somalia's transitional government said in a Saturday statement.

""The police and the security forces immediately reached the location of the incident and started a full investigation for the shocking action,"" the government said.

Attempts to reach AU representative were not immediately successful Saturday.

On Friday, Nor was heading to the outskirts of Mogadishu to cover a Malay-sponsored project to help drought victims on behalf of Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.

In an interview with Bernama, Malaysia's Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said Nor was a ""hero.""

""He was willing to take the risk to provide extensive coverage of our missions to help others in many parts of the world,"" he said.

Reporters without Borders, an activist organization on behalf of journalist, said Friday that Somalia continued to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, often caught in the cross-fir between Islamic Al-Shabaab militia and pro-government forces.

""Nor joins the long list of journalists killed in the course of their work in Somalia, Africa's deadliest country for media personnel with 23 killed since 2007,"" Reporters Without Borders said Friday.

""Despite the recent retreat by the Islamist insurgent group Al-Shabaab, the violence and fighting in Mogadishu have not stopped and covering Somalia continues to be extremely dangerous,"" the organization stated.

62,62,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Gov't initially 'mishandled' `06 flood response -US ambassador said in cable - Stabroek News,https://www.stabroeknews.com/2011/08/29/news/guyana/gov%E2%80%99t-initially-%E2%80%98mishandled%E2%80%99-06-flood-response-us-ambassador-said-in-cable-2/,"A year after the worst flood in the country’s recent history devastated areas along the coastland, the administration botched its initial response to the returning heavy rainfall, which necessitated a massive public relations exercise and a relief spending effort.

This was former US Ambassador Roland Bullen’s assessment of the government’s response to the flooding between December 2005 and January 2006, and he suggested that the initial “underestimate” of the situation showed that lessons of the previous year had not been learned.

“What is not questionable is the GoG[Government of Guyana]’s mishandling of the flood situation. After initially dismissing the media’s coverage of the flood problem as overblown, then saying it had not been properly kept abreast of the situation, the GoG is now engaged in a high profile scramble to address the matter,” he said in the January 13, 2006 diplomatic note released by WikiLeaks.

Bullen further noted that this “inept response presented opposition parties with a golden opportunity to score political points with a disaffected Guyanese public in an election year, but the rudderless opposition failed to capitalize.”

He said that many of the affected areas were also underwater during the previous year’s devastating floods. “The absence of simple factual data about levels of rainfall and status of drainage infrastructure combined with the GoG’s incoherent approach suggests that Guyana has learned little from the past and remains at the mercy of the rains,” he declared.

Flooding attributed to seasonally high rains had been plaguing most of coastal Guyana except greater Georgetown since the end of December, Bullen explained in his report. He further cited the Stabroek News’ report on December 25 that flooding in the eastern region of Mahaicony had been occurring for a week and the follow up on January 5 about flooding in Black Bush

Polder, in the Corentyne, and later about Canals 1 and 2 polders on the West Bank of Demerara, in the backlands of the Essequibo coast and the Pomeroon River region.

He did note that these were all agricultural areas a few miles inland from the coastal strip where 90% of Guyana’s population lives.

According to Bullen, after an initially slow response, the GoG has mobilized “a highly public flood relief campaign, with virtually every cabinet minister visiting one of the affected regions.”

Bullen said the Embassy had also been receiving data from the Hydromet Office, but pointed out that the data was of limited use, since 13 of 14 rainfall gauges were on the coast and therefore did not report interior rainfall.

Later, in a follow-up cable, dated January 17, 2006, Bullen also referred to the lack of adequate information on rainfall at the conservancy. He said that after a meeting held by the government with donors, the Head of the Civil Defence Commission, Chabilall Ramsarup acknowledged that there were no rainfall gauges in the conservancy or the conservancy watersheds “so assessing how much water is draining relative to how much is falling is impossible.” Bullen also cited the difficulty of obtaining accurate information on the EDWC. He said that on January 17, 2006 at a meeting of the Guyana Citizens’ Initiative for Flood Relief, Major General (ret) Joe Singh had said that the level that day in the EDWC was 58.65 GD (an increase of one inch overnight) and that he expected the Lama sluice to be opened immediately. Bullen said that an EDWC engineer related to embassy’s consul that same day that the EDWC level was 58.4 GD compared to the 58.5 GD the day before. Further, the engineer said that the Lama sluice was not open. “Such conflicting reports reflect the difficulty of obtaining accurate data on the status of the EDWC”, he said in the cable.

Bullen concluded that there are two major differences between the response in 2005 and that in 2006. He explained that the interventions after the 2005 floods to restore the drainage and irrigation infrastructure, while “leaving much to be desired,” worked. “Georgetown and the populated East Coast have not so far experienced and serious or sustained flooding, although many buildings built on ground in violation of building codes have experienced intermittent water intrusion,” he said.

Additionally, he said in 2006, the GoG was much more pro-active in sharing information and consulting concerned constituencies, including the donor community and the political opposition. “This in turn provides an environment in which people are able to make better-in-formed decisions and a political environment in which the government and opposition can concentrate on managing the situation rather than harping at each other,” he added.","Mon, 29 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png,"['bullen', '06', 'response', 'data', 'mishandled', 'ambassador', 'flood', '2006', 'rainfall', 'cable', 'situation', 'flooding', 'opposition', 'govt', 'edwc', 'initially']", ,flood

GENEVA, August 30 (UNHCR) - The IKEA Foundation has donated US$62 million to UNHCR for the agency's expanding operation to help tens of thousands of Somali civilians at the huge Dadaab refugee complex in north-east Kenya.

""The donation, which will be staggered over three years, is the largest private donation that the UN refugee agency has received in its 60-year history, and the first time that a private body has chosen to directly support a major refugee complex,"" UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards said in Geneva on Tuesday.

UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres, who is currently in East Africa to assess the situation for displaced Somali civilians, welcomed the donation. ""This humanitarian gesture by the IKEA Foundation comes at a critical time,"" he said. ""The crisis in the Horn of Africa continues to deepen with thousands of people fleeing Somalia every week. We are extremely grateful. Help like this can't come a moment too soon.""

Edwards, speaking to journalists at Geneva's Palais des Nations, said UNHCR was working with the staff of the Foundation on the development of a detailed submission for how these funds will be used, but in the short-term the focus will be on helping up to 120,000 refugees who have recently arrived from neighbouring Somalia at Dadaab, the world's largest refugee complex. Edwards said there would be a ""particular focus on refugee families and children.""

The Dadaab initiative is part of a broader partnership between the IKEA Foundation and UNHCR that began a year ago and includes funding support to UNHCR's work in Bangladesh, eastern Sudan and Kenya. IKEA also provides in-kind product support to UNHCR's emergency operations in Kyrgyzstan and Tunisia as well as expertise in logistics, supply, packaging and warehousing.

Dadaab, which lies in a remote and arid region of Kenya, was first opened in the early 1990s after the onset of civil war across the border in Somalia. This year it has seen a dramatic surge in new arrivals as a result of the conflict and drought in Somalia.

Originally designed for 90,000 people it now hosts a population of approximately 440,000 refugees, 150,000 of whom have arrived in the last three months. This is putting enormous strain on those living and working there as well as host communities. Many of the newly arrived refugees are suffering malnutrition, and are in critical condition.

The IKEA Foundation donation will immediately help UNHCR expand its life-saving help for people already arrived at the camp.

""This initiative is a bold but natural extension of IKEA Foundation's long-standing commitment to making a better everyday life for children and families in need throughout the developing world,"" said Per Heggenes, chief executive officer of the IKEA Foundation. ""Supporting UNHCR, both immediately and over the long term, is one of the most effective ways to immediately make a difference in the lives of thousands of refugee children and their families.""

UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, relies on donations to help millions of refugees and other displaced people around the world. Most of these donations are from governments.

DOLLOW, Somalia, August 30 (UNHCR) - UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres visited Somalia on Tuesday and called for greater efforts to provide life-saving aid to tens of thousands of displaced Somalis inside their country.

Noting that UNHCR is assisting around 850,000 Somali refugees in neighbouring countries, with at least 1,500 still fleeing Somalia every day, Guterres, who heads UNHCR, said: ""We should not aim at emptying Somalia, but rather at making every effort to provide aid inside [the country].""

The High Commissioner made his call while visiting Dollow, a dusty town on southern Somalia's border with Ethiopia. Thousands of people fleeing drought, famine and violence in other parts of Somalia have flocked here, with many crossing into Ethiopia.

Guterres, accompanied by Sweden's Minister for International Development and Cooperation Gunilla Carlsson, came to Dollow to show solidarity with the displaced population at a time of extreme suffering and to mark the Eid al Fitr holiday, which marks the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.

The visit represented the start of a major new effort by UNHCR and its partners to step up humanitarian aid inside Somalia, where huge numbers of people are in need of urgent assistance. UNHCR has had only intermittent access to many areas due to extreme insecurity.

Many of the displaced Somalis who talked to Guterres in Dollow had harrowing tales of loss and starvation during their flight across harsh desert terrain. He said it would be better if the international community could bring the aid to them, rather than have vast numbers of people risking their lives in search of food, water, shelter and other vital assistance.

""I am always fighting to make sure Somalis have the right to seek asylum,"" Guterres said before adding: ""Somalis should have the right to choose to stay in their own country."" He called on all parties to cease violence, respect humanitarian law and to allow unfettered access to all people in need.

Carlsson added that it was critical for the international community to ""not only help in an emergency, but to address the root causes.""

The displaced in Dollow are camped in makeshift shelters of sticks and tattered cloth. Many say they will remain there until the rains come and the fighting between government troops and the Al Shabaab militia eases.

One woman, Hado Sugow, told the delegation she lost four of her children to starvation and thirst during the 15-day trek from her home to Dollow. ""I will go back when there is rain,"" she insisted. Somalia has been suffering its worst drought in more than half-a-century.

Dollow also serves as a major transit point for Somalis headed for the four UNHCR-run refugee camps in Ethiopia's Dollo Ado district, which is a two-hour walk across the border. But increasing numbers, particularly farmers, are reluctant to leave Somalia, waiting instead to return to their land if the rains return as predicted in October.

The UN refugee agency continues to have indirect access to populations in Al Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia through its NGO partners, who employ hundreds of Somali staff to distribute international aid.

UNHCR is significantly scaling up its distribution of emergency assistance packages in a bid to reach at least 400,000 people by mid-September. UNHCR is also enhancing its staff presence in Dollow and Dobley, also near the border, as well as in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.

""This famine should be a turning point and we are determined to make a real difference to Somalis where they are, so that they don't feel compelled to move to another country,"" said Bruno Geddo, UNHCR's representative to Somalia. ""Humanitarian access in Somalia is gradually opening up and we are moving in to help step-by-step.""

Two Russian spacecraft -- a Progress and a Soyuz --can be seen parked at the orbital outpost on the left side of the frame.

Hurricane Katia can't seem to decide what it wants to be — after becoming a hurricane on Wednesday night (Aug. 31) it then dropped back down to tropical storm strength, but has since climbed back up to Category 1 hurricane status.

The Expedition 28 crew aboard the International Space Station took this photo of Katia when it was still a burgeoning tropical storm earlier in the week as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean. [Astronaut's space photo of Katia]

Astronauts aboard the orbiting laboratory caught several glimpses of Hurricane Irene from space and remarked on its awesome size.

Katia has winds of 75 mph (120 kph), just above the threshold for hurricane status. The storm is expected to strengthen in the next 48 hours and could become a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength) by the middle of next week.

Katia is still far out at sea -- some 705 miles (1,135 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands -- so it is too early to tell yet whether it will pose a threat the U.S. East Coast, which is still recovering from the damage wrought by Irene.

When the GOES-13 satellite passed over Katia (right, center) on Aug. 30, 2011, just after daylight reached it in the Atlantic, it revealed a well-developed storm. The bright vertical line on the Earth shows daylight to the east of the line, and imagery is visible. (Image credit: NASA/NOAA GOES Project )

Another space snapshot from the GOES 13 satellite revealed a stunning view of Katia and much of the Earth in a stunning view from orbit. That image was also taken while Katia was a tropical storm. [See the amazing GOES 13 view of Katia]

Hurricane Katia is the second hurricane to form during the 2011 hurricane season, which has been predicted to spawn an above-average 14 to 19 named storms (which include tropical storms and hurricanes), seven to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season will see 11 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes.

August through October are the peak months of the Atlantic hurricane season.

Forecasters and Gulf Coast residents are also keeping an eye on Tropical Depression 13, which is poised to dump up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain in some areas along the drought-plagued southern states.

DADAAB, Kenya, September 5 (UNHCR) - The new academic year got under way on Monday in the world's largest refugee camp complex, with some 43,000 Somali children turning up for classes at Dadaab in north-east Kenya.

Some, particularly those who have arrived in the last three months, are going to school for the first time. But enrolment rates among the estimated 156,000 children of school age are relatively low in Dadaab's camps, which have 19 primary schools and six secondary schools.

Many of those entering school were among the more than 100,000 Somali refugees who have arrived in Dadaab since June after fleeing conflict, drought and famine in their homeland, bringing the refugee population here close to 470,000.

""These children are in strong need of the routine and protection that school provides,"" said Linda Kjosaas, the UNHCR education officer in Dadaab. ""Circumstances here are far from ideal and we should be providing them with much more, but children are happy and, talking to their parents, it is clear that they value education highly.""

At the recently opened refugee site called Ifo 2, boys played football and girls skipped in the courtyard of a brand new primary school on Monday. ""Most of these children have arrived this year from Somalia,"" said the headmaster, Mohammed Abdullahi Bashir. ""We decided to open the school two weeks earlier to give them a chance to catch up.""

So far, about 1,100 children have been enrolled at this school and 11 of the school's 24 classrooms have been filled. ""Every day more children are enrolling,"" Bashir added.

Very few of the new arrivals received any formal education in Somalia. To help them cope, UNHCR's partner, CARE, recently began an accelerated learning programme to teach them basic literacy and numeracy skills. Some 1,500 children between the ages of five and 13 benefitted from this programme.

The schools at Dadaab follow the Kenyan education curriculum. There are also private and religious schools, adult literacy centres and four vocational training centres for refugee and local youth.

With the large influx of refugees from Somalia this year, more than half of whom are children, the demand for classrooms, desks, stationery, textbooks and teachers in Dadaab has increased dramatically - at least 75 new schools will need to be built.

Currently, there is only one teacher for every 100 pupils. In some of the schools, teachers work double shifts, teaching one group of children in the morning and another in the afternoon. Most of the teachers are refugees themselves. For teenagers, opportunities to start or continue formal education are few.

Because of overcrowding, most of the refugees arriving from Somalia this year settled outside the three existing camps with little access to basic services. In recent weeks, UNHCR has been transferring these refugees to two new sites. To date, some 30,000 refugees have been relocated to the new sites, where UNHCR is building temporary schools for 14,000 children.

68,68,DR-2011-000121-CHN,"Out of a job, Gadhafi's Tuareg fighters may create new troubles - CNN International",https://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/09/08/libya.tuareg/,"(CNN) -- They are the Kurds of Africa, an ancient stateless people with their own language, a minority spread across several countries, weathered by their harsh surroundings.

And like the Kurds, the Tuareg are now at the center of international attention. Some are helping Moammar Gadhafi loyalists escape Libya across the endless expanses of the Sahel. Many more are trapped in Libya, trying to escape its post-revolutionary chaos.

Gadhafi often turned to the nomadic Tuareg to bolster his forces and his attempts to manipulate and destabilize the poor countries to the south of Libya: Niger, Chad and Mali. The Tuareg were capable mercenaries. And there was a hint of romance in the arrangement -- Gadhafi has always painted himself as a desert Bedouin.

Peter Gwin, a journalist with National Geographic, has visited Tuareg areas of Mali and Niger frequently. He says one Tuareg who had visited many Libyan army bases told him that even before the uprising against Gadhafi began there were some 10,000 Tuareg fighters in the Libyan military.

For the Tuareg it was a marriage of convenience; they could send money home and received arms and money for their rebellions. Gadhafi long supported the Niger Movement for Justice, a Tuareg rebel group, and gave its leaders villas in Tripoli.

As the revolt against his rule began, Gadhafi sent recruiters to Mali and Niger. Gwin says they were reportedly offering $1,000 a month to Tuareg recruits, an incredible sum in an area where the average income is less than $1 a day. Hundreds signed up.

One fighter Gwin met in the Malian city of Timbuktu described being involved in carrying out Gadhafi's order to ""clean"" the city of Misrata, a rebel stronghold.

""I asked him did that actually happen,"" said Gwin, ""and he said half of Misrata was cleaned. ... and I said what about civilians? And he said: 'Everyone.' What about women and children? And he nodded and said: 'Yes.' ""

But Tuareg fighters told Gwin that Gadhafi had failed to deliver on many promises -- of cash, homes and cars. And they were not expecting to be bombed from the air. Many deserted and began the long difficult journey home across the Sahara and arid mountain ranges, avoiding checkpoints as they went.

The danger now is that many of them -- young, jobless men -- will rekindle simmering revolts. In Niger the rebels control swathes of territory.

Gwin describes it in September's edition of National Geographic magazine as ""a vast primordial landscape -- a place defined by salt pans that take the better part of a day to cross, dune fields that rise and fall like violent seas, and mammoth outcroppings of glassy marble and obsidian that breach the sand like extinct sea creatures.""

The Tuareg trust few outsiders. Gwin says it is not only to combat the elements that the men cover their faces with turbans, and they are guided by a proverb: ""Kiss the hand you cannot sever.""

But since Mali and Niger gained independence, the Tuareg have been neglected and marginalized. In Niger, the Tuareg complain that they have no schools or wells -- even as governments have raked in millions from rich seams of uranium.

That was the spark for the most recent revolt. Not all Tuaregs supported it; there are disparate factions and clans. Even so, the governments of the Sahel -- especially Niger -- are shuddering at the prospect of well-armed fighters returning to their unstable countries.

A group of prominent Tuaregs from Niger and Mali has appealed to Libya's National Transitional Council to protect those Tuaregs still in Libya. Mohamed Anacko, head of the Agadez Regional Council in Niger, told CNN that they ""wanted to avoid a crisis like in Libya here at home. So (we wanted) to make a contract between those who fight, who are in the Libyan army and the NTC.""

Niger and Mali are very fragile states, Anacko said by phone from Agadez. ""There really is a risk of famine this year. There are lots of people who are arriving, some are transferring to West Africa but (others) are remaining in Agadez some months. ... so we have lots of worries this year, in the next three to four months.""

Human rights groups have also called on Libya's new rulers not to seek revenge against the Tuareg and other Africans, to prevent a further flood of refugees. Niger -- in the grip of a prolonged drought -- is already struggling to absorb as many as 200,000 of its own citizens who have returned from Libya, according to the European Union's counter-terrorism co-coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove.

There is also the risk that renewed instability in the region will play into the hands of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), one of the group's fastest-growing affiliates, which has made a lot of money from kidnap ransoms.

Terrorism analysts say AQIM may already have obtained weapons looted in Libya's chaos. Nigerien forces were involved in a shoot-out in June against an armed group carrying detonators, explosives and cash. The government said they were destined for AQIM.

Anacko told CNN that his group was trying to help Libyans and others who were trying to escape the fighting, to prevent al Qaeda from taking advantage of the situation. ""If we don't help them, it is certain that al Qaeda will take them,"" he said. ""We open the door, weapons or not, they give away their weapons and they go back.""

The Tuareg are not Arabs and have little sympathy for al Qaeda, but their paths may cross in the flourishing drugs trade in this part of Africa. The Tuareg have a reputation for doing business with anyone.

In his National Geographic piece, Peter Gwin relates a conversation with a Tuareg rebel commander who said the West should help them combat al Qaeda and drug smugglers. ""Given the Tuareg history of betrayal and infighting,"" Gwin asked him, ""could the West trust them?""

""He answered with a click of his tongue. I couldn't gauge his expression because his face was completely obscured by his turban.""","Thu, 08 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/newsscanner/no_image_cnn_90x51.jpg,"['tuareg', 'gwin', 'gadhafi', 'al', 'niger', 'told', 'gadhafis', 'qaeda', 'create', 'national', 'libya', 'mali', 'troubles', 'job', 'fighters']", ,drought

71,71,DR-2011-000121-CHN,"Oregon has fancier crops, but hay and straw are doing just fine - OregonLive.com",https://www.oregonlive.com/environment/2011/09/oregon_has_fancier_crops_but_h.html,"They don't have the refined reputation of wine grapes or the healthy allure of blueberries, but the hottest Oregon crops this summer may be the state's most basic.

The price for premium alfalfa hay shot through the barn roof this year, while baled straw -- literally the chaff of Oregon's grass seed harvest -- feeds dairy cows and beef cattle in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

It's a market with surprising angles and international connections. Hay and animal feed filled 30 percent of the export containers shipped out of the Port of Portland's Terminal 6 in 2010. There's even a market for the plasticized twine cut off bales before they are compressed and rewrapped for export: China grinds it up to make toys.

And for farmers who grow forage crops, at least, the price is right. Supply is down because many switched in recent years from hay to wheat and corn, crops that command a good price and are less hassle to harvest and ship. With increased demand, including from Middle Eastern and Asian brokers, the best hay jumped to $250 a ton this summer, about $100 more than a year ago.

""Anything that is under $220 a ton is a bargain, snatch it while you can,"" advised Frank Maricle, an 18-year-old

-- yes, a hay blogger -- who farms with his father.

""I kind of wanted to grow hay to pay for college,"" Maricle said. But like others, he plowed up some of his hay acreage last year and grew wheat instead. Most of his hay customers were hobby ranchers with horses to feed, and he recently warned them on his blog that ""discounted hay is a thing of the past.""

""We find ourselves in a very tight supply situation with hay right now,"" said Seth Hoyt of Ione, Calif., who analyzes the hay market with his online

.

Demand for hay up

Mylen Bohle, an Oregon State University Extension Service agronomist in Prineville, said a confluence of market circumstances is at work. Farmers switching to wheat or corn gain a nitrogen ""fix"" provided to the soil by years of growing alfalfa, he said. That allows them to reduce fertilizer use, save money and pad the profit margin -- another reason to switch from hay.

Meanwhile, milk price increases provided dairy farmers the revenue they needed to afford the higher hay prices, Bohle said.

The demand shows no sign of cooling, Bohle said.

have had inquiries from drought-stricken Texas, and Oregon hay has traveled to Florida, the Carolinas and Alaska.

Hay is not a market newcomer. Alfalfa hay was Oregon's fifth leading commodity in 2010, with nearly $176 million in gross farm sales -- well ahead of wine grapes, blueberries, hazelnuts, hops, pears and dozens of other more glamorous crops. Other types of hay ranked 10th.

Hay is from grass cut before it goes to seed. Straw is the plant material left after harvesting the seed heads, as grass seed farmers do.

The straw market is even more confounding, considering its bumpy beginning.

For decades, Oregon's grass seed growers burned their fields after harvest, killing weeds and pests and eliminating the tons of straw blown out the back of harvest combines. Billowing columns of field burning smoke once were common summer sights in the Willamette Valley as farmers burned up to 250,000 acres annually.

But the Legislature gradually reduced the acreage that could be burned, culminating in 2010 with an annual limit of 15,000 acres, confined to the Silverton Hills area of Marion County and to specific varieties of grass.

Harvesting straw

Some grass seed farmers switched to alternative crops such as wheat because grass seed prices fell with the recession. But soil conditions don't allow everyone to make the switch, and many grass seed farmers still need a way to remove the immense amount of straw generated during the harvest.

In the Aurora area 25 miles south of Portland, 22 grass seed farmers bought a bale compressing facility in 1995 and formed Quality Trading Co. The company uses hydraulic presses to squeeze bales to about half their original size, allowing for more material to be loaded into shipping containers. Some bales are shrink-wrapped in plastic to hold them together during shipment. Containers are hauled by truck or rail to the ports in Portland or Tacoma, where they're loaded onto ships.

Quality Trading takes in straw from about 50 growers. About 15 such pressing plants operate along the Interstate 5 corridor from Portland to Eugene, storing and compressing straw gathered during the summer's frenetic five-week harvest. About 600,000 to 625,000 tons of straw is shipped over the course of a year, said Matt Eide, Quality Trading's operations manager.

What began as a way to get rid of excess straw now is a moneymaker. Grass and grain straw ranked 30th with $23 million in gross farm sales in 2010, according to the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Farmers get $15 to $20 a ton.

Straw doesn't pack much protein, and Oregon farmers are more likely to use straw as bedding for cattle or dairy cows, not as feed. But Japanese and South Korean farmers use it as a filling fiber food base, reducing the amount of more expensive, higher-protein feed that they have to buy.

Japanese buyers are particular: they don't want weeds or dirt in the straw, but they're loyal to a consistent product.

""Japan started it all,"" Eide said. ""We've stuck with our Japanese customers, and they've stuck with us.""

72,72,DR-2011-000121-CHN,"Police Beat, Tie-Up, and Fire On Citizens Protesting Dying Ramsar Protected Lake in Iran - Green Prophet",https://www.greenprophet.com/2011/08/iran-lake-urmia-protests/,"Police violently repressed activists protesting the nearly irreversible damage done to the Middle East’s largest salt lake over the weekend. This image was taken of a protest earlier this year.

Like a chain of dominos, citizen protests are erupting everywhere: following the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions catalyzed in part by skyrocketing food prices, political protests have swept throughout the Arab world. But it hasn’t stopped there, and not all battles are political.

In Jordan, ordinary people are protesting government plans to include nuclear power in its arsenal of energy sources, while in the United States, Bill McKibben and other well-respected community members, including Jim Hansen from NASA, have been arrested for marching against the Keystone XL Pipeline – a carbon bomb that climatologists say would officially end the battle against climate change (humanity 0 vs. climate change 7 billion). But none of these latter environmental events has garnered such an extreme response as the Lake Orumiyeh protests in Iran, where bloggers report that people are being arrested, beaten, and in some cases tied to trees for protesting the slow death of the world’s second largest salt lake.

Dried up Mecca

In part because of drought and in part because of poorly managed dam construction and irrigation projects, Lake Orumiyeh or Urmia in Northwestern Iran has shrunk to roughly 60% of its original size. Once a mecca for flamingos and other wildlife, the dying lake now more closely resembles a dusty moonscape.

Residents in Azerbaijan that rely on the Ramsar protected site for their sustenance claim that Revolutionary Guards are responsible for shrinking lake levels and the subsequent rise in salinity and decrease in biodiversity. Global Voices claims that if Lake Urmia dries up completely, millions of people will have to settle elsewhere.

Authorities get dirty

Spurred on by these concerns, thousands of protestors spilled into the streets of Tabriz and Urmia last weekend in order to put pressure on the government to step up conservation efforts. But eyewitnesses report that protests quickly took an ominous turn.

According to one blogger, Urmuiscielli, policemen beat and arrested protestors, some of whom were tied to trees.

Although the police crackdown was censored in the mainstream Iranian press, Iran’s Independent Press picked up the story, and the blogosphere was populated by video footage and calls for other citizens to support Azeri activists and re-launch anti-regime demonstrations.

Crimes against humanity

If taken seriously, the increase of environmentally-themed disputes between citizens and their governments, even in the Middle East, could spur a whole new era of accountability measures. Protestors who show little willingness to compromise until real action is taken have the power to disrupt the smooth functioning of society to such an extent that governments (a la Egypt) will have no choice but to instill effect change.

And eventually, when environmental degradation is unequivocally linked to an increase in environmental refugees, green-minded lawmakers such as Polly Higgins, who has been campaigning the United Nations to make Ecocide a crime against humanity, will be better poised for success.

Of course, none of this will happen in Iran anytime soon given that country’s oppressive regime and appalling environmental record, even though these protests show an increasingly emboldened (or desperate?) populace.

One has to applaud Whole Foods for taking action against a drink that seems to have committed two sins of greenwash: ‘The Sin of No Proof’ and ‘The Sin of Irrelevance.’ Kim Conte at Cafe Mom had the best analysis:

… there’s no ingredient list on the bottle. Bethany herself has marketed the product as containing “natural flavors, lightly sweetened with agave nectar and made with premium Blue Agave clear tequlia,” but that’s the extent of what we know about its ingredients. Apparently, this wasn’t enough for Whole Foods. The chain allegedly removed the product from its shelves because they discovered that the “natural flavors” weren’t so “natural” (as if that term has any meaning anyway).

A little digging by Absurd2sublime.com, a fan site that follows all things RH, reports that allegedly it was the ‘caramel color’ that did in Skinny Girl. Hmmm…

And while it was laudable that Whole Foods removed the product from its shelves, the whole incident has been kept extremely quiet. The Skinny Girl website makes no mention of the Whole Foods removal nor does the Whole Foods site. And, the cocktails are still are available in hundreds of outlets across America. While Bethenny Frankel may not know about the FTC Green Guide rules on green marketing, brand owners Beam Global Spirits & Wine a unit of Fortune Brands Inc., the makers of Jim Beam, Canadian Club and Courvoisier, should know better.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 15:59:37 GMT",https://eatdrinkbetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-EDB-Logo-32x32.png,"['foods', 'skinny', 'cocktails', 'natural', 'shelves', 'site', 'removed', 'product', 'fortune', 'greenwash', 'drink', 'eat', 'girl', 'pulled', 'sin', 'know']", ,none

Neighbors said they would boycott the bar. Bloggers posted reports of past health violations there. Larry Yang, the Korean-American owner of a hardware store a few doors away, said he resented such a public promotion of same-sex marriage. He said many among the large number of Korean-American Christians in Queens felt similarly but feared that if they spoke out they would be demonized by a liberal majority.

“If that horse-drawn carriage rides by my store, I will make sure my kids do not see it,” Mr. Yang, 45, said. “I am worried about what kind of message gay marriage is sending.”

76,76,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Millions of coconut trees old and dying - Cebu Daily News,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/53037/millions-of-coconut-trees-old-and-dying,"The trees of life are on the brink of death.

Millions of coconut trees in the country are aging and dying, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.

ADVERTISEMENT

The country needs to replant a huge chunk of its coconut plantations as 44.8 million coconut trees are classified as old and senile, according to the PCA. Many are dying due to the stresses of weather and diseases, and should be cut to lumber, it said.

“About 27 percent of the total agricultural lands belong to coconut. We have plenty of senile trees, those over 60 years old. Of the 320 million coconut trees, 14 percent are old,” PCA Administrator Euclides Forbes said in an interview recently.

Mature coconut trees bear very few nuts or none at all, Forbes said. These trees, he said, should be cut and sold as coconut lumber.

The peak years of coconut trees are between seven and 25 years, when they bear between 40 and 65 nuts per year.

Many uses

The coconut is called the tree of life because practically every part of it is useful—from food, beverage and handicrafts to shelter, antisoil erosion technology and medicine.

Aside from copra, the Philippines is a major producer of coconut oil, copra meal, desiccated coconut, coco shell charcoal, activated carbon and coco chemicals.

Forbes said a major replanting of coconut trees was needed to make sure that the Philippines had enough supply to remain as the world’s leading copra producer.

He noted that the industry was still reeling from the effects of El Niño, a weather phenomenon.

ADVERTISEMENT

The drought that the country suffered in 2009 and 2010 due to El Niño put coconut trees under stress and reduced their capacity to bear fruits, he said.

In the Philippines, the onset of El Niño usually means a lack of rainfall and fewer tropical cyclones. The Philippine agriculture sector took a beating during the last El Niño years, with major crops showing declines in production.

Cash incentives

The PCA has established a coconut planting project that gives financial incentives to successful farmers.

Under the scheme, a farmer would get P7 per seed nut sown and would get another P7 for every seed that grows to at least two feet tall within five months.

If the farmer is able to grow the seedling to about a meter high for about five months during the rainy season, he would get another P16.

Forbes said a farmer could earn up to P30 per seedling under the program.

Cash transfer program

The PCA is drafting a memorandum of agreement with the Department of Social Welfare and Development to include coconut farmers in the government’s conditional cash transfer program.

The program envisions to provide coconut farming families an additional income if they are able to grow and maintain coconut trees, Forbes said.

He said the average annual income of a coconut farmer was P30,000, far below the poverty threshold of P98,000.

Export value up

Because of the drought two years ago, yields from the plantations declined, affecting the country’s export volume.

Volume was reduced by 40.20 percent to 895,215.55 metric tons in the first seven months of 2011, according to the PCA.

Despite the drop in volume, the country’s coconut exports totaled $1.22 billion, a 34.74 percent jump compared with the $908.72 million earned in the same period last year.

Forbes said export value soared due to high global demand and prices in 2011. The average price of copra is $1,063.10 per MT, up from $754.79 in the same period last year.

London: Manchester City chief executive Garry Cook resigned on Friday after he was investigated by the Abu Dhabi-owned club for emailing a player's mother ridiculing her cancer.

Defender Nedum Onuoha's mother received a message sent accidentally by Cook which mocked her use of the phrase ""ravaged with it"" in the original email about her cancer treatment.

While Anthonia Onuoha received the reply, it was addressed to ""Brian."" City's football administrator Brian Marwood was also among the recipients of the woman's original email, which dealt with her son's contract.

Cook on Friday acknowledged an ""error of judgment"" and said his resignation was ""in the best interests of the football club.""

Although the email was sent in October 2010, Anthonia Onuoha only complained to City and English footballing authorities early this week.

The Sun newspaper, which received the email exchange from Onuoha, initially reported that Cook denied sending the email and said his email account had been hacked.

But City's board investigated her complaint and found the allegations were with ""foundation,"" a club statement said.

""Garry Cook has offered his resignation, which has been accepted with regret by the board,"" City said on its website.

Cook was president of Nike's Jordan Brand until leaving the sportswear company after 19 years in 2008 to take the top job at Manchester City. Within months, he oversaw the sale of the club by former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra to Abu Dhabi's Sheik Mansour, who has invested more than $1 billion to transform the team.

A 35-year trophy drought ended in May when City won the FA Cup while Roberto Mancini's side qualified for the Champions League for the first time.

""I am privileged to have held my position at Manchester City Football Club and to have experienced the opportunities that it has presented,"" Cook said on City's website. ""The privilege is in part offset however by the significant personal focus which has at times, detracted from the magnificent achievements of those working at the football club.""

""It is that factor, together with my error of judgment in this matter that has prompted me to reach this decision, which I believe is in the best interests of the football club.""

The Story of Economic Genius

Sylvia Nasar

Simon & Schuster: 559 pp., $35

Today’s economy may seem the bleakest in recent memory: plunging consumer confidence, slumping home prices, a stubbornly high unemployment rate. But as Sylvia Nasar reminds us in “Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius,” in 1933 a full 25% of the nation was out of work, suicides were rising sharply, and stocks were trading at one-fifth of their 1929 prices.

Then, as now, public leaders struggled with solving the spiraling economic crisis. In 1934, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt met with John Maynard Keynes, a British economist known for his love of art, his taste in young men and his brilliant if controversial theories. He urged the president to spend more on stimulus programs to shake the country out of its stupor. At a New York dinner the next evening, Keynes told some of his colleagues that every dollar spent by the government — deficit or no — would have a great effect on the nation’s economy.

“Were the seven wonders of the world built by thrift?” he once asked. “I doubt it.”

Keynes and his theory about the benefits of deficit spending still resonate today, as is evident by the debate over the Obama administration’s stimulus program. The exploits of Keynes — he bullied Britain’s National Gallery into buying hundreds of modernist paintings from a fire-sale auction in Paris on the eve of World War I, securing a Cezanne and two Delacroix for himself — would be enough to fill a book. But Keynes is just one of the economists Nasar features in “Grand Pursuit.”

Beginning her book in the era of Charles Dickens, “when the specter of hunger was stalking England,” Nasar takes us through the times that influenced economic thinkers and the theories they put forth. We see Marx — a lazy procrastinator who impregnates his wife and a housekeeper in the same year — walking through the streets of London with his generous, patient sponsor Engels, “their extreme myopia and the sulfurous yellow London fog obscur[ing] everything more than a foot ahead.”

We also see Joseph Schumpeter, who theorized that entrepreneurs were the key to economic progress and who had a habit of challenging university librarians to duels and arriving at lectures in jodhpurs. Beatrice Potter Webb, who advanced the idea of a welfare state and advocated for a government safety net, arrived at that conclusion only after a failed love affair with Joseph Chamberlain, the father of a future British prime minister. Alfred Marshall, a founder of modern economics, wore a handlebar mustache and took up knitting during an illness, and discovered, Nasar writes, that businesses didn’t just exist to produce a profit for their owners. He realized they were also meant to “produce higher living standards for consumers and workers.”

It is the quirks and personalities of these economic thinkers that bring “Grand Pursuit” to life. Nasar argues that the details of their personal successes and failures — along with the weighty history revolving around them — inspired their individual conclusions about how the system works.

But the book can seem at times like just a grab bag of different economists, countries and ideas. In “A Beautiful Mind,” Nasar’s 1998 biography of John Nash Jr. that was made into a movie and nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, the author focused in depth on one man’s theories and personal life. In “Grand Pursuit,” Nasar tries to tackle dozens of men and women, and at times the book gets confusing as different characters — Milton Friedman, for example — wander in and out of chapters. Chapters on Indian economist Amartya Sen and on Joan Robinson’s adulation of the communist governments of Russia and China feel superfluous, making the reader want to jump back to the early 20th century, which Nasar paints more vividly.

Still, through Nasar’s ambitious storytelling, we see Western society evolve from one in which most people live in poverty to one in which government tries to grapple with unemployment and inflation and raise the standard of living for all. If Nasar puts perhaps too much emphasis on the influence of early economic thinkers — who after all were observing conditions rather than creating them — she does show how fully the profession has become entwined with the way governments run. We see the rise of economic forecasting in her pages, as well as the increasing influence of figures like Keynes on leaders like Roosevelt. The number of economists in Washington, D.C., she says, shot up from 100 in 1930 to 5,000 by 1938.

Much of “Grand Pursuit” may be a reminder that as bad as things seem now, they have been worse — much worse — and that those difficult times can shed light on what is happening today. Economists have always tried to come up with theories about how to stimulate flaccid economies. The reader finishes Nasar’s book wondering what brilliant and quirky thinker may fill in the next chapters of our economic history and come up with an idea that shakes our current economy out of its funk.

Oklahoma City set a record for the number of days in a year with temperatures above 100 providing perfect conditions for fires

A wildfire that sparked in a wooded area forced panicked horse owners to turn their livestock loose as they evacuated the area in Oklahoma City yesterday.



Before being contained, the raging fire caused swathes of cedar trees to explode into flame as the wind-whipped blaze reached them in the North-East of the city.



Oklahoma City set a record for the number of days in a year with temperatures above 100 and t he near unrelenting heat wave this summer meant conditions were ideal for grass fires.

Dee Corley, a stable owner in a nearby area, took in horses that had been evacuated while an employee picked up wandering strays to prevent traffic accidents.

She took in 25 horses as well as 11 dogs and two cats before the fire was eventually contained late on last night.

She refused to accept payment but was considering taking hay donations.

She said: 'I'm just glad I can help. That's what it's all about,'



Evacuated: horses from a miniature horse farm were taken away as wildfires spread

Southerly winds gusting up to 25 miles per hour along with low humidity and drought conditions made the wildfire difficult to contain and 15 properties were thought to have been destroyed.

About 200 fire fighters kept the blaze from spreading north to more populated areas while two National Guard helicopters dumped water on the fire.



Neighbouring cities and counties also sent reinforcements.

He said: 'They've got a lot of oil within the tree itself,

Better.,https://eatdrinkbetter.com/articles/hersheys-chocolate/,"Tens of thousands join campaign calling on Hershey’s Chocolate Company to refund fees foreign students paid for cultural exchange program they claim was “captive labor.”

More than 55,000 people from across the U.S. have joined an exploding campaign on Change.org calling on Hershey’s Chocolate Company to refund the program fees of foreign exchange students who claim they were held captive and exploited in sweatshop-like conditions at a Hershey’s factory.

Hundreds of foreign students paid to come to America this summer as part of a cultural exchange program promising opportunities to learn English and experience American culture while working. Instead, the students claim they were forced to work in back-breaking, round-the-clock production lines packing chocolates at the Hershey’s Chocolate Company Packing Plant in Pennsylvania for wages as low as $1/hour after mandatory deductions. When the students complained, they claim factory managers threatened to have them deported.

“We did not plan to become organizers in America,” said Decebal Bilan, an economics student from Romania. “But now it is our responsibility to bring Hershey’s to justice – for ourselves, for future students, and for Pennsylvania.”

The students organized with the help of the National Guestworker Alliance, and on August 17, they staged a sit-in at the plant. The students asked Hershey’s to end the exploitation of student workers at its packing plant, return the money they paid for the cultural exchange program, and make these jobs living wage jobs for local Pennsylvania workers. They also launched a petition on Change.org, the world’s fastest growing social action platform, which has gathered over 55,000 signatures.

“The immense outpouring of support on Change.org has been a tremendous morale boost for the students and an indication of the severity of the injustices they have faced,” said Saket Soni, executive director of the National Guestworker Alliance, which helped the students organize. “We hope the massive public support for these students will demonstrate to Hershey that they must make amends and commit to making these jobs living wage jobs for local workers, with rights.”

Hershey has offered the students free bus tickets and paid vacation time but has yet to respond directly to any of the students’ demands. If you want to let Hershey’s know how you feel, you can sign the Change.org petition demanding that these students get their fees back.

The people in Gaza and the Horn of Africa will not be part of the celebrations — not by choice but by circumstance. Hence, it is important that they receive the maximum support and help that they need.

The facts and figures on the situation in the Horn of Africa are shocking and striking. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that the number of people affected by the food shortages has increased from 10 million to 12.4 million. In addition, children are gravely affected by the situation with about 2.3 million acutely malnourished according to the Unicef.

The situation is in fact bleak, as Unicef says that more than half a million of those children face the risk of death if immediate intervention is not pursued. There is no doubt that the drought seen in Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Ethiopia is the worst that these countries have faced in 60 years. And the prediction is that this situation will not improve any time soon — rather the drought conditions for the next months will take a turn for the worse.

The situation in Gaza is also miserable as Palestinians face daily challenges with their attempts to go on with daily life that is as normal as it could be. But how can this be possible when Israel continues with its iron-fisted rule? Israel conducts on-and-off attacks on Gaza and Palestinians are left to accept living with the minimum of the basic needs that they require. The Eid celebrations will undoubtedly fall very short of being a celebration in full for all Muslims.","Mon, 29 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2011/8/27/1_16a07ffbb56.858040_4229316761_16a07ffbb56_medium.jpg,"['celebrations', 'somalia', 'palestinians', 'gaza', 'horn', 'situation', 'eid', 'face', 'miss', 'muslims', 'israel', 'million']", ,drought
83,83,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Gov't accused GPSU of plot to disrupt country - Stabroek News,https://www.stabroeknews.com/2011/09/11/news/guyana/gov%E2%80%99t-accused-gpsu-of-plot-to-disrupt-country/,"The Government of Guyana in early 2006 believed that the Guyana Public Service Union (GPSU) was planning to disrupt the country with the aid of the “Buxton resistance group” according to former US Ambassador Roland Bullen.

In a February 15, 2006 cable to Washington, titled ‘Labour struggles to unify as GOG seizes initiative,’ Bullen said the information was provided to the embassy by high ranking officials in the Office of the President.

Bullen, describing the prevailing labour issues that existed at that time, said that underlying those issues was a political context of “suspicion and division within the labor movement in Guyana, much of it deeply personal.”

At that time the GPSU was in an ongoing struggle for government salary arbitration, although Bullen noted that government condemned the union’s actions as politically motivated.

“[Name of the official] provided EconOff a briefing paper ostensibly based on information received from dissident members of the GPSU that alleges that union is planning to disrupt the country with the support of ‘the Buxton resistance group’ in the coming months,” Bullen said in the cable.

The statement provided by the official also alleged that the US Diaspora was “financing arrangements in the hopes that the GPSU can act along the lines of the political strikes of the 1960s.”

“While the credibility of such claims is uncertain, this sentiment is indicative of the long history of suspicion that clouds labour unions in Guyana,” Bullen noted.

He said during the meeting with embassy officials, the OP official also insisted that the GPSU missed a “golden opportunity” for compromise 18 months before, when its President Patrick Yarde apparently undermined negotiations with the Office of the President by blasting President Bharrat Jagdeo on an a television talk show.

For his part, Yarde, Bullen said, accused the government of heavy-handedness in its handling of the union’s demonstrations to date. Yarde labeled the heavy police presence along the GPSU’s February 8, 2005 march route as a “blatant act of intimidation” and blamed it for the low turnout. Yarde also insisted that he received word from private sector sources that President Jagdeo had said he would just as soon eliminate the GPSU if he could find a way to do so.

At the time GPSU had announced a second lunchtime march planned for the same route on February 15, 2005. Yarde had stated his commitment to non-violent industrial action, and the prospects of major civil disruption seemed unlikely to Bullen for several reasons.

“First, the low turnout at the previous march, be it due to intimidation or a lack of coordination within the public service union, suggests the mandate for major industrial action on the part of the PSU’s membership is weak,” he said

Bullen felt at the time that the wage increase seemed to have “undercut the union’s efforts to mobilize its sagging membership.”

Yarde had observed that resource constraints may limit the GPSU’s ability to sustain action along the lines of the 57-day strike in 1999, after which the union lost its ability to automatically collect membership dues as an agency shop.","Sun, 11 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png,"['country', 'accused', 'bullen', 'guyana', 'labour', 'disrupt', 'provided', 'yarde', 'union', 'govt', 'gpsu', 'plot', 'official', 'unions', 'president']", ,none
84,84,DR-2011-000121-CHN,The Center of Attention - Golf Course Industry Magazine,https://www.golfcourseindustry.com/gci0911-atlanta-athletic-club-champion-mangum.aspx,"For one week in August, the eyes of the golfing world were set on Ken Mangum, his crew and Atlanta Athletic Club’s Champion Bermudagrass greens.

Interviewing Ken Mangum, especially coming off his great success with Atlanta Athletic Club following the 2011 PGA Championship, has been one of the highlights of my journalistic career.

I was fortunate enough to work with Ken on a variety of GCSAA committees in the 1980s and eventually as fellow board members in the 1990s.

Over that time my appreciation for Ken has grown significantly. He is a soft-spoken giant in the industry who is armed with an infectious smile. Ken is a quiet and gentle fellow, but when he speaks everyone listens.

He is as loyal and dependable as they come in the world of golf. He learned from his mentors and mentors the next generation not only in agronomics, but leadership, as well.

I've been fortunate to have known Ken all these years and honored to interview him after his great success at this year's PGA Championship.

I believe I mirror the views of many of my contemporaries when I say that when I think of professionalism in our business, I think of Ken Mangum.

Now with the big event over, I had an opportunity to sit down with Ken to discuss the days leading up to the championship, the lessons learned both on and off the course and how this experience has impacted him as a turf professional.



How many years has it taken to prepare the course for the tournament?

The preparation started with our first rebuild of the greens and bunkers in 1994-95. The greens we played this week were built and contoured then. The highly successful renovation of the Riverside Course forced us to start planning for Highlands in 2005 and do the work in 2006. All the fairways were laid out then because of the inside-outside irrigation layout. Rees Jones, Kerry Haigh and I worked hard to make sure we had the right widths five years out. Nothing was changed, so I guess we did a good job. The final and most important change was in 2009 when we changed to Champion Ultra Dwarf greens.



What was your staffing during the tournament and leading up to it as compared to previous years?

Our staffing levels peaked from 2001-07 to as many as 77 people. Those numbers were reduced to 68 since 2008 as a result of lower revenues and the loss of members. We get by with fewer people because we mow less with the new grasses.



Many superintendents who have hosted majors have told me that a major is 90 percent preparation and about 10 percent execution. Would you agree with that?

I have not thought about it that way. We had the golf course where we wanted it two weeks out. After that, we just looked for little things to do. Dead branches were removed, limbs trimmed for views, weeds pulled and we also stepped up the mowing frequency. There was plenty of irrigation and utility locating to do for signage and scoreboards. I would say more 50/50 because we still had plenty of execution to do during our front nine/back nine routine that we use all week.



No matter how well we prepare there are always a few things that are surprises. So what were yours during this event?

The first surprise is that we watered every night – greens, tees and fairways ­– to keep the course from becoming unplayable. We could have gone over the top very easily. I did not expect to put down that much water. Kerry Haigh wanted the course to play firm, not hard and fair. The other surprise was just how well the Champion held up and how little we had to do to get the speeds. We single cut greens Monday and Tuesday mornings, Wednesday evening, Thursday and Friday mornings. We did double cut on Saturday and Sunday, but only rolled once on Tuesday night to smooth out spike marks from so much practice-round play. Our biggest challenge was keeping them slowed down. Again, Kerry wanted good speed, but not off the charts because of the loss of hole locations.



How many phones, beepers, radios, etc., do you carry the week of the event?

Too many, but only two radios and a phone. I had to stay on the PGA Rules channel with Kerry to monitor play, rulings and any course issues. Let's just say the first two days... there were many issues with the pace of play. I carried our radio so I could relay information from Kerry to Kasey and Tyler. The iPhone was always there, as well. Fortunately, my younger brother, Randy, spent the week with me to assist with radios and appointments. Randy went back to turf school as a second career and worked with me here from 1990-95. He is in sales now with Howard Fertilizer. He was such a help with monitoring and making calls while I did all the media requests that kept on coming. I am not sure I could have made it through the week without him to drive me to and from work and just keep an eye on me. He was a great sounding board for the press conference and generally encouraged me throughout the week.



I know how close your family is. Hopefully you have had a chance to enjoy a few minutes with them as you smell the roses of such an important event.

We did have a dozen roses for that, but not sure I really got to smell them enough with all the pressure from the predictions for this Championship. Pam came out everyday and spent some time with me, along with my daughter, Miranda, son-in-law, Scott, and their kids, Katie and Evan. My son worked with CBS so I saw him quite a bit. It is always good to have the grand kids around. Katie is 7 months old and I held her a couple of days while doing announcements. Now I get to go back to being ""Papa"" again.



Will there be any letdown after several years of planning and a week of a tournament in which the whole world of golf is focused on the property you manage?

Yes, there will be some. I experienced that a little in 2001. It is something I talked to my staff about, as well. It is a very high pinnacle to reach so you have nowhere to go but down. I will work on through August for restoration and then take a good bit of time off for traveling and fishing with my good friends in September. Fly fishing is the best way for me to unwind and the company of friends like you, Mike Crawford, Gary Grigg, Cal Roth and Darren Davis make it even better. Where are you, Ed Walsh?



What were your greatest challenges during the event?

The high expectations that were the result of Ron Whitten's article, ""The South's Gonna Rise Again."" It is a great article. I just had to make sure he was right. Pat O'Brien has been telling me for two years that this event would change golf in the south, as well. I felt a great deal of pressure having the first Major on the new grasses. I knew they would perform, but needed to see them do it. Now, I believe we exceeded the expectations and we have set a new standard.



Now that the event is in the history books, were there any particular lessons learned during or prior to the event and would you have done anything differently?

Dealing with the media has become a very big part of championship golf. It is an option that can be a huge benefit if you are prepared to handle all of the requests that come your way. I am so glad I had the media training offered by GCSAA while I was on the GCSAA board. I have continued to work with Mike Jousan of Clear Communications over the years. This training helped me get through all the interviews and the press conference on the Golf Channel. I have received as many compliments on my interviews as I have on the condition of the course. It was great to have Jeff Bollig, GCSAA's director of communications, on hand to help with media contacts and issues. I also had Robin Applebaum, of CSE, on hand all week to assist with and set up interviews with local media.



Were you ready and waiting for the playoff?

Yes, we had people in position to go back and check Nos. 16, 17, 18 and 10 if needed. It only took a few minutes and three people. We had a great ending with a champion who I predict will continue to win and go on to have a great career.



How much excitement was there from your team during the event and what did you do to motivate them daily?

It didn't take much to get them going, but I think that is one area I excelled in. I started a couple of weeks out with talks about making history. I challenged them to exceed what was written in the article. I started off Thursday by holding up a copy of the ""South's Gonna Rise Again."" I got a few rebel yells out of that one! The guest that we had each day also played a big part in the motivation. I tried to include as many people as possible in the videos and interviews. Kasey Kauff, Highlands superintendent, and his assistant Tyler Anderson were both very good on camera. Every volunteer — with the exception of a couple of people — had a connection to the club as a former superintendent, assistant, intern or long-time sales and service provider. Newcomers quickly noticed the family atmosphere.



Which golf course superintendents or events did you learn the most from prior to the PGA Championship?

The experience of 2001 was invaluable for routing work and getting around the players. The requirements and chain of commands are very different with each organization. I love the structure of the PGA of America. I have one person to deal with – Kerry Haigh. Since we worked together in 2001, we both knew what to expect. The two of us work on a system of trust and respect. On the flip side, he has one person to work with from the club, as well. We discuss things and make decisions based on how the course is playing and what the forecast is. I know he is ultimately responsible for the outcome of the event, so I try to meet or exceed any request he has for course conditioning – nothing like teamwork. I have always picked up a few gems from friends in the business that have had or been involved in championships. Cal Roth, Collier Miller, Mike Crawford, Mark Kuhns, Jim Nichol, Michael Lee, Steve Cook , Tom Lively, Mark Wilson, Jon Maddern, Mark Woodward, Pat Finlen, Bob Farren, Tim Moraghan, Patrick O'Brien, Chris Hartwiger, Craig Courier, Marsh Benson, Brad Owen, Jim Zimmer, Paul Latshaw Jr. & Sr., Russ Meyers, Matt Schafer, Dave Ward, Gordon Moir, Kenny McKay, Tom Alex and Mark Michaud are some of the people that come to mind. This is quite a list! Now I have to worry who I left off.



What site visits did you make to prepare for this event?

I have been to the Masters every year since 1976. I have attended the PGA since 1995. I don't think I have missed but a couple of US Opens since 1998. You can pick up things every place you go, even though they are all very different venues and grasses.



Tell me a little about your Twitter feeds and blogging for the event.

I find Twitter to be very easy and quick. I would normally tweet on the way in while Randy drove. It is very easy to take a quick picture and send it out with a few words. The blog can be longer and more detailed. It is very quick also. I send the contact information to members so they can follow if they choose to do so. Facebook helps, as well. Kasey and Tyler have set up an AAC Golf Course Management Page. Communication will slow now that the championship is over.



The Champion Bermudagrass greens at AAC have been the buzz of the turf industry. Did they live up to your expectations and do you expect to see a trend for Southeastern courses to switch to improved varieties in the future?

The only reason to change to Champion is if you want great greens to play on all summer.

I could not be happier with the performance during the Championship. It provides us more good months of golf for less money. I don't think the members really care what kind of grass it is as long as it provides a firm, fast surface. As the economy continues to struggle we need to find ways to keep golf sustainable. The money saved on greens alone could be the difference in facilities staying open. More courses will now be advertising ""Ultra Dwarf greens"" instead of the old ads that used ""bentgrass greens"" to draw players.

Another key point is that all of the golf course peaks at one time, which gives us more months that we can hold events. The collars also come out of the winter much better because they have been covered and have had much less traffic on them. Many bentgrass courses suffer from ""ring around the bent"" in the spring. Using the covers allows us to play more golf in the winter since the greens seldom freeze under the cover. We can usually remove the covers in the 9-10 a.m. range for play and the bentgrass greens will still be frozen. Our golfers play more rounds in the winter on the Champion than the bentgrass!

85,85,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Poison in the Park: Plants and trees in Stacy Park began to die after a Parks and Rec volunteer sprayed herbicide - News - Austin Chronicle,https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2011-09-02/poison-in-the-park/,"If there's one thing that the neighbors of Stacy Park, in South Austin's Travis Heights, feel they know for sure, it's that Daniel White really hates poison ivy. What the neighbors say they don't know is why the city's Parks and Recreation Depart­ment would agree to allow White, as a volunteer, to spray herbicide along the mile-and-a-half-long park and up and down sensitive Blunn Creek – an area that the city is working to restore – without notifying neighbors that the spraying would take place. Now, they say, the park is a mess. Trees are dying, and residents are concerned about the possible effects of the chemicals on the area wildlife, as well as on children and pets. ""It's the worst kind of stewardship of watershed and resources,"" says Jeff Kessel, an environmental engineer who lives in the neighborhood.

White, who used to live near the park, says he can document the injury done to people – many of them children – by the unruly and invasive poison ivy that is endemic along Stacy Park and Blunn Creek, which runs through the park. White conducts 90-minute tours of Austin parks that are overrun by the plant and says he's taken many on the tour – including ""all [City] Council staff and other interested parties"" – as a way to explain and document the ongoing problems.

In the Nineties, White's dislike for the plant led him to go to the South River City Citizens Neighborhood Association, which includes Travis Heights, to address the problem; he says they weren't interested in hearing about it – and that the neighborhood association is still deaf to the perils posed by the plant. He's also approached PARD on several occasions with ""information and opinion on maintenance"" in the city's parks, says Kelly Snook, the department's assistant director.

It wasn't until early this year that White's talks with PARD and his dislike of poison ivy coalesced into a plan: White would get a pesticide applicator license from the Texas Department of Agricul­ture and would then provide chemicals (at no cost to the city) and free labor (as a PARD volunteer) to eradicate the poison ivy, along with a short list of other invasive species (including ligustrum, china berry, and nandina). He wrote a one-page proposal in February, explaining that he would work along the creek from Riverside Drive south to Live Oak Street. ""I do not plan on any buffer zone around the creek,"" White wrote in his proposal. ""Operator skill here obviates any requirement for buffer zone as well.""

The neighborhood association knew nothing about the arrangement until mid-June, when neighbors say they first noticed White spraying throughout the park. White told neighbors who inquired that he was authorized to be there by PARD. That alarmed many of them, especially after swaths of vegetation in the park began to die. Moreover, some neighbors say that more plants than just those on the ""approved"" list of species have been damaged – including box elders, cedar elm, and mustang grapes.

Equally disturbing, say some neighbors, have been the responses from PARD. ""Their responses are very confusing; they're hearing what we're saying, but they don't want to talk about it,"" says Kessel. ""They say, 'This is a maintenance project, and we don't usually talk to people about maintenance; we just go and do it.'"" Had it been a construction or other kind of project – like the ongoing restoration along Blunn Creek – the neighbors would have been notified. According to PARD's Snook, this is the first time the department has ever used a volunteer, without oversight, to spray chemicals in a park. ""To put this in the category of maintenance,"" says Kessel, ""it's just bizarre.""

There is little doubt that PARD is perpetually underfunded and understaffed; where the department can get help, it often does. Travis Heights neighbors are passionate about Stacy Park and are among the many residents citywide who pitch in to keep city parks clean and maintained. But it's puzzling why PARD would allow a volunteer to spray herbicide without oversight and without notice to the neighbors.

Snook says the partnership with White was a ""pilot project,"" and that while the city has allowed volunteers to spray chemicals in the past, it has always been during group projects and with PARD supervision. White obtained the necessary license and was bonded and insured, she said, so allowing him to do the job as a volunteer is the same as if the department hired a contractor. What else, she asks, ""would you anticipate"" the city to do to vet White? White was apparently unsupervised at all times – for example, the city never checked that White posted the required signage warning about the spraying. White says he had some ""little flags"" that he posted but that none of the neighbors paid any attention to them; neighbors claim White never posted the signage as he was directed.

""Because he sprayed with no warning,"" says neighbor Teresa Griffin, ""my concern is not only for the wildlife eating the poison, but for the neighbors as well."" For example, neighbors say mustang grapes were sprayed, which they often pick and eat. The situation prompted neighbors to ask PARD for a report on what happened and how the department can create protocols and procedures for using volunteers for these kinds of projects in the future. (White told the Chronicle that he has also sprayed for poison ivy in the BMX section of Duncan Park; PARD's Snook says she was not aware of that and that those actions have never been approved.) The overarching concern isn't about White in particular, say neighbors, but about the department's actions going forward and how it will communicate its activities to neighbors. For example, the city is still in the process of putting together a comprehensive plan for dealing with invasive species, like ligustrum, and should have waited to undertake any spraying until after that plan was complete. ""We're not too fixated on Daniel White,"" says neighbor David Todd, who is an environmental attorney and co-chair of the neighborhood association's Parks, Schools and Environment Committee. The larger question is, ""How should a city agency deal with neighbors?""

The city is still in the process of drafting its report, says Snook, with input from the South River City Citizens Neighborhood Association. Griffin says she wrote a list of recommendations for future volunteer efforts – including emergency response plans if something goes wrong.

Snook says the city has done a walk-through of the park with neighbors to determine the extent of the damage and to identify trees that may need to be removed. Some residents worry that the damage has been extensive and will ultimately be too expensive to mitigate. Having volunteers do this kind of work ""in the name of the city, we need to be very careful about oversight and good notice,"" says Todd. Indeed, says Grif­fin, the neighbors are still interested in working with PARD ""and not have [this] be a public spanking. But there has to be an admission that they did things wrong.""

86,86,DR-2011-000121-CHN,All you need is some salt and chilli powder - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/all-you-need-is-some-salt-and-chilli-powder/article2411321.ece,"The humble guava is a powerhouse of affordable nutrition

The delightful season of guavas is here. The tropical fruit, a powerhouse of nutrition within the reach of the common man, is available at every street side here now. You can have it raw, ripe, plain or with a dash of chilli powder and salt. The more industrious can cook it and can it into jams and jellies.

Though available throughout the year, guavas usually flood the market between July and October. In Karnataka, the most widely cultivated varieties are the Allahabad Safeda and Lucknow 49, also known as Sardar.

The varieties

The Horticulture Department said the Allahabad variety of the fruit is large and round, with skin smooth and yellowish white. Sardar is primrose yellow and is sweet and tasty. Local varieties such as pink-pulped Navalur are, unfortunately, almost extinct.

Bangalore gets the fruit from Hoskote, Yelahanka, Doddaballapur, Devanahalli, Magadi, Nelamangala, and surroundings of Bangalore Rural and Kolar districts.

The fruit is at present seen as commercially unviable as, unlike, say coconut or mango, there is no organised market. So farmers grow it in small land holdings of less than an acre.

The price depends on the size of the fruit, and, yes, location. While right now it sells for Rs. 60 to 70 a kg in K.R. Market, it comes at a steep Rs. 100 a kg in tony neighbourhoods and prime shopping areas such as M.G. Road and Commercial Street.

“I sort the foods according to their size and sell them at Rs. 10, Rs. 5 and Rs 3 each,” says Hanumanthappa, who has positioned himself with a bicycle in front of the Vidhana Soudha. On an average, he takes home Rs. 300 a day.

According to the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, guava is grown in almost all the districts of the State in an estimated 4,240 hectares, though Kolar district alone produces over 30 per cent of the annual 23,000-tonne harvest.

The plant starts bearing within three or four years. On an average, a 10-year-old plant may yield about 1,000 to 1,500 fruits a year.

Being very hardy, the guava can withstand drought conditions, and gives an assured crop even with very little care. Its cost of production is low as it needs very little fertiliser, irrigation and plant protection. It is also grown as a backyard fruit.

Nutritional security

It is an ideal fruit for the nutritional security. A storehouse of vitamin C, the entire fruit, including rind, flesh and seeds, should be eaten for maximum health benefits.

Rafeeq Ahmed of Vijayanagar says he sources the fruit directly from farmers who come to the Housing Board in the wee hours to sell their harvest. “I buy three bags for Rs. 450 and earn a net profit of Rs. 250 a day. There is a lot of demand for it as other fruits like apple, pomegranate and orange are very expensive.”","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article13635613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGP2GUAVA,"['chilli', 'guava', 'powerhouse', 'salt', 'rs', 'size', 'need', 'varieties', 'little', 'sell', 'powder', 'market', 'plant', 'fruit']", ,none

Such is the gusto with which Rossouw has tackled rugby's afterlife - the minefield so many retired players so aimlessly traverse - that his playing career seems a mere by-product of the achievements of a man driven by the belief that horizons are there to be expanded.

Not that his achievements have come without a fight. Rossouw has had to confront life's vicissitudes head on and future challenges are likely to get similar treatment.

He overcame career-threatening injury, beating lymphoma into five-year remission after having had to come to terms with the trauma of his son's bone marrow transplant.

When Rossouw recalls the hardships, he does so matter of factly, as if everybody is afflicted by these tribulations.

""My wife and I have a pretty ordinary family life. We have Chris, 12, Joane, 10, Nicolaas, eight, and the fourth is due in January. Nicolaas had to undergo a bone marrow operation. I was still playing and I had to stop training. I'm thankful I had the means to take him to England for treatment.""

Although he has beaten cancer for now, he is not out of the woods. ""The lymphoma is in remission. It's been for five years. I'm clean and I'm really thankful. I've reached the stage where I can have life insurance again. You can have it when you've been clean for five years and it will be a big milestone for me.""

It's moot whether these events have helped shape him into the single-minded, success-driven man he is, but he is definitely stronger for it.

It has allowed him to reflect but not dwell on a rugby career that spanned two Rugby World Cups with not much before, in-between or after.

He played nine tests according to official records but insists an appearance as a substitute against the Wallabies in 1996 has been overlooked.

""I was injured after the 1995 Word Cup when I had a chance to establish myself as the No1 hooker. We toured Argentina and I picked up an injury. After that I suffered a bit of a drought.

""We had a three-year contract after the World Cup and in a way my body was spared. I was fortunate to get another chance when selected for the 1999 World Cup.

""That was in a way a disappointment because Nick Mallett didn't pick me because John Hart said I broke Bull Allen's jaw in New Zealand. If Nick said it then one could explain it, but I don't want to discredit anybody.""

His transition to rugby's afterlife was almost seamless. ""I started farming but that ran parallel with doing business and playing rugby. I studied at Tuks and I was always exposed to the markets.

""Now we are into combined farming - maize, soya and chickens. In 2007, the Rossgro Group won South Africa's farmer- of-the-year award.

Despite the accolades, Rossouw operates in a testing environment.

""We are a dying breed. The white, Afrikaans-speaking farmer in Africa. We're getting a bit rare but still sought-after.

""I don't know what the hullabaloo about land reform is for farming. Here we have farms and thousands of hectares of farm land of black farmers that is not utilised. I offer mentorship.

""Everybody is screaming for a solution but commercial farmers have so much on their plate just to survive that we don't have time to help our neighbours. I've bought tractors and I'm farming on black-owned land. As a consequence, my interests have trebled.""

He admits to being a Sharks fan because: ""they are more moderate,"" and loves travelling.

""Next, I would like to tackle China. It has opened up nicely. We are over being alarmed by the 'made in China' label. The world is one place. If we want to survive, we must be efficient.""

His views on the Springboks in the World Cup?

88,88,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Batteries that Charge Themselves with Mechanical Energy - CleanTechnica,https://cleantechnica.com/2011/08/31/batteries-that-charge-themselves-with-mechanical-energy/,"MicroGen Systems has been working on electricity-generating chips designed to power wireless sensors like those used to monitor tire pressure and environmental conditions.

These chips convert the mechanical energy of vibrations into electricity, which is then used to charge a small battery, which in turn powers the sensors.

If the chips are capable of generating adequate electrical energy, then they could mostly (or maybe even completely) eliminate the need to replace the batteries.

The core of MicroGen’s chips is a 1 cm2 array of silicon cantilevers that oscillate when the chip is jostled. At the base of the cantilevers is a bit of piezoelectric material: when it’s strained by vibrations, it produces a voltage that can be used to generate electrical current. Voltage is what causes current to flow.

The array of cantilevers is mounted on top of a postage-stamp-sized, thin-film battery that it charges. The current passes from the piezoelectric array through an electrical device that converts the current to an appropriate DC current that is suitable for charging the battery. When the chip is shaken by the vibrations of a rotating tire, for example, it can produce about 200 microwatts of power.

An efficient vibration-energy-harvesting device has the potential to be very beneficial because there are so many vibrating devices, such as mechanical machines, in general, including automobiles, generators, engines in general, and fans, as well as humans walking, arm and hand movements, and much more.

David Culler, chair of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley said: “If you can get it down to a small size, 200 microwatts is potentially quite useful.”

Robert Andosca, the founder and president of MicroGen Systems, said that what sets this technology apart from other piezoelectric generators is the fact that it is made of a non-toxic material known as PZT.

200 microwatts of power might not be much, but if it is small enough, it could be very beneficial to tiny sensors that need to be integrated into small places.

89,89,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Europe key to game's progress in Romania - Southland Times,https://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/sport/rugby-world-cup/5592017/Europe-key-to-games-progress-in-Romania,"POTENTIAL: Romania assistant coach and All Black World Cup title winner Steve McDowall hopes his team can be competitive in the group stages of the World Cup.

Romanian assistant coach Steve McDowall believes his adopted nation has the potential to improve on the world stage in the coming years if they can get more players into the top European leagues.

The former All Black prop, who was part of New Zealand's 1987 World Cup winning team, has been working with the Romanians since 2008 and said the game was slowly developing in the southeastern European country.

Eight members of the Romanian World Cup squad ply their trade professionally in France, with hardnosed prop Paulica Ion also playing abroad with London Irish in the English premiership.

McDowall said for Romania to become more of an international threat in the future they needed to have more players breaking through into the top-level European club competitions, where they would be exposed to tougher competition and a higher level of coaching.

""We've some good young guys. It's about getting them out to play in other teams in France and England at a better level. A lot of the older guys that have been playing in France are now basically finished. We've got two or three guys that are going into France, but we need to have a few more guys going back in there to maintain a certain level.""

McDowall also stressed there needed to be much more of a focus on rugby in the schools and said the country battled from a lack of grass fields to play the game on.

""Just about every school does not have fields. It's all bricks and concrete slabs around. If we can encourage schools to come in and be a part of a sport activity and slowly build the relationship, then hopefully we can grow from Rippa Rugby into the touch and obviously the sevens, leading into the 15s.""

Romania have qualified for every World Cup since 1987 but have never won more than one pool game at any of the tournaments.

The Oaks will be up against it at this year's spectacle, being grouped with England, Argentina, Scotland and Georgia. Their first three opponents should prove too difficult an obstacle to overcome but they will back themselves in their final pool game against the Georgians in Palmerston North.

McDowall said they were aiming to be competitive at the tournament and was confident they could surprise those sceptics who predict they will be the whipping boys of the group.

His contract with the Romanian Rugby Federation expires after the World Cup, but he said his wife and four children were adjusting well to their new life in the Romanian capital of Bucharest, and he was keen to stay on in the job.

McDowall, who played 46 tests for New Zealand between 1985 and 1992, said he would be keeping a close eye on the All Blacks during the World Cup and was optimistic they had the people and the ability to break their 24-year title drought. ""From what I've seen in the past, they do have the ability to go through and win. It's not going to be a given thing. They're going to have to work hard and hopefully the lessons from 2007 give them some direction at this World Cup.""

McDowall hoped the All Black coaching staff had learned from their rotation policy nightmare of 2007 where the team's leading players did not get enough game time in pool play.

He said it was imperative that they had decided on their first-choice starting lineup by the final pool play games so that they were hitting their straps come the knockout rounds.

""The pool is a stepping stone when you're gelling together and developing a strong attitude. You should be playing your No1 team in the last one or two pool games. That should be what's leading them through to the final.""","Mon, 12 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1315786860/317/5608317.jpg,"['romanian', 'rugby', 'cup', 'guys', 'game', 'team', 'france', 'europe', 'key', 'pool', 'progress', 'world', 'games', 'going', 'romania']", ,none
