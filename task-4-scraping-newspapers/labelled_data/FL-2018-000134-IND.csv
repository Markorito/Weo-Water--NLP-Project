Kerala, famed for its pristine palm-lined beaches and tea plantations, is battered by the monsoon every year but the rains have been particularly severe this season.

Those forced from their homes “have moved to 350 relief camps across the state”, said an official at the Kerala State Disaster Management control room.

The army has been roped in for rescue efforts in Kerala after two days of heavy rain drove authorities to open the shutters of 27 reservoirs to drain out the excess water.

One of the five shutters of a large reservoir in the mountainous Idukki district was opened for the first time in 26 years.

“Our state is in the midst of an unprecedented flood havoc,” Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote in a statement posted on Twitter.

“The calamity has caused immeasurable misery and devastation. Many lives were lost. Hundreds of homes were totally destroyed,” he added, lauding the efforts of rescue teams working in the state from across India.

The US embassy advised its citizens to avoid the areas affected and monitor local media for weather updates.

More than a million foreign tourists visited Kerala in 2017, according to official data. The government of Kerala, which has a population of 33 million people, has imposed a ban on the movement of lorries and tourist vehicles in Idukki.","Sat, 11 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d239af3785a8dd24515b54c87a694a4a3c9f113a/0_117_3310_1987/master/3310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ab93aca8a2815c48e40424f3d684e89,"['kerala', 'official', 'idukki', '36000', 'homes', 'rescue', 'state', 'heavy', 'floods', 'million', 'dozens', 'reservoirs', 'evacuated', 'kill', 'shutters']",,flood

As per the latest news reports at 12.50 PM, CM Pinarayi Vijayan has reviewed all the efforts taken to tackle the rain havoc in Kerala and expressed satisfaction with regard to the flood relief efforts undertaken by the Army, Navy and the Air Force, NDRF as well as the Coast Guards. According to the latest tweet from the CM’s office, “As the the water level in Idukki dam continues to rise, more water will have to be released.

The death toll in Kerala has touched 26. Meanwhile, the IMD has predicted more rains across eight districts in Kerala in the next 48 hours and the situation looks grim at the ground level. Kerala rains are lashing down across the state like never before, leaving people in a state of utter helplessness and panic in areas that have been most affected. The latest update has come from the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, which has issued a tweet, announcing that a ban has been imposed on the movement of heavy goods vehicles and tourist vehicles in the high ranges of Idukki on account of the unabated rains in the area. There are also local news reports that drinking water supply was also hit in many places around Malappuram, Palakkad and Ernakulam districts. Today, the US government has also issued a travel advisory asking its citizens to refrain from visiting Kerala at this time.

What happened on Thursday across districts?

On Thursday, the decision to open one of the shutters of the Idukki dam on Thursday on a trial basis for hours led to a sense of foreboding and panic among the public. Following this, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan cautioned people not to panic and he stated that it is a ‘unprecedented situation’ whereby 22 dams had to be opened at one go and in the case of Idukki, dam, it was reopened after 26 years as per local news reports. Trial runs continued throughout the night. Past midnight, the water level mark at Idukki dam had touched 2400.38 ft. This morning, the water level had touched 2401 ft at 7 AM.

District Collectors were given permission to hire the necessary number of bulldozers, generators and lights. They were directed to provide essential supplies such as water, food, clothes and toilet facilities to the people in affected areas and those staying in relief camps. The service of doctors has been ensured in these camps.

Worst hit districts in Kerala?

The worst-hit districts have been Malappuram, Idduki, Wayanad, Kannur and Palakkad. People living near the banks of the Periyar river and other low-lying areas in Ernakulam were asked to stay alert since the time the red alerts have been issued. Already, 57 reliefs camps are functional in Ernakulam, with 1076 families staying there. There is considerable worry about the catchment areas around the Boothanthankettu dam, where the water levels are reportedly increasing and if more shutters of the Idukki dam are opened again, the water levels are bound to rise further.

When the dams were opened on Thursday, the areas around Palakkad and Aluva faced the onslaught of rising water levels. Wayanad and Idukki were badly hit, so was the Nilambur region. Landslides in five locations around Idukki district led to the death of at least 11 people on Thursday, including an entire family of five members and one person went missing. According to local news reports, the situation in Nilambur was grim.

Meanwhile, in Kozhikode district, close to a place called Thamarassery, a river had changed its course, causing the death of one person and destruction of at least twenty houses. On Wednesday night, however, the body of a youth was found three kilometers from the river and it was recovered on Thursday along with a vehicle. Another tragedy has been reported in Ernakulam district, where two Class 12 students died. However, the Cochin International airport had commenced with flight arrivals after a few hours of diverting flights from landing on Thursday afternoon.

In a place called Srikanthapuram in Kannur district, nearly 150 shops faced the onslaught of flash floods on Thursdays and sank in water.

Known for picturesque monsoons in June that entice domestic and international travelers to visit ‘God’s own country’, this year the state has faced rain fury like never before, leading to considerable destruction of property, loss of lives, flash floods and landslides across districts.","Fri, 10 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/08/flood-pti-1.jpg,"['cm', 'palakkad', 'water', 'kerala', 'flood', 'idukki', 'rain', 'dam', 'heavy', 'floods', 'river', 'living', 'areas', 'situation', 'released', 'level', 'times', 'landslides']",,flood

4,4,FL-2018-000134-IND,The Kerala Deluge Brings Back Memories Of 'The Great Flood Of 99' Which Almost Wiped Out Munnar - Indiatimes.com,https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/the-kerala-deluge-brings-back-memories-of-the-great-flood-of-99-which-almost-wiped-out-munnar-351058.html,"Parts of Kerala are witnessing torrential rainfall that has not been experienced in the state in the recent past.

The worst affected is my hometown, Idukki district, known for some of the most sought after tourist destinations including Munnar and Thekkady.

For many, especially those in my generation these are the worst floods that we have seen so far.

Even though they haven't experienced it themselves, people in my father's generation are aware of 'the great flood of 99,' which happened nearly a century ago. None of them that I have spoken to have experienced it themselves, but have heard about it from their parents, an event so chastorphic it still remains the yardstick to measure other floods in the state even now.

Here is the story of the great flood of 99.

To start with the great flood of 99 happened in 1924. So what is this 99 connection? The 99 referred to kollavarsham 1099, (traditional malayalam calendar). As the traditional malayalam calendar was more prevalent, the name 'the great flood of 99' was coined and through the usage of generations it remained the same.

The deluge occurred when Periyar River overflowed in July 1924 because of heavy rainfall that lasted almost three weeks. There is also a theory that the massive flooding was caused by a major breach in the Mullaperiyar Dam which was constructed in 1895 by a British engineer named John Pennycuick.

Although it is not substantiated by historic documents, the fear of five districts being washed away in the case Mullaperiyar Dam, which has outlived its lifespan collapsing seems to have triggered from the great flood. In 1924, the flood waters had submerged Thrissur, Ernakulam, Idukki, Kottayam and Alappuzha.

Just like in the ongoing floods the worst hit was Idukki and especially Munnar, (Old Munnar) the southern summer retreat of the erstwhile British. That July alone, Munnar witnessed around 172 inches of rains. It is said that the weeks of rain brought down an entire hill called Karinthiri Malai and completely destroyed the Ernakulam-Munnar road.

Today Idukki is one of two districts in Kerala which has no railway connectivity, with Wayanad being the other, owing to the hilly nature of the terrin. But it is a forgotten part of history that the first railway lines in Kerala was laid in Munnar.

It was called the Kundala Valley Railway. Established as a monorail in 1902 and upgraded as narrow gauge in 1908, its purpose was to transport the British's main produce form the hills - tea.

The flood of 99 completely destroyed the railway infrastructure in Munnar including tracks and stations. It was never rebuilt. Today all that remains of the Kundala Valley Railway is some broken tracks and bridges.

The old Munnar road which was damaged beyond repair was also abandoned and the present day road from Kothamangalam was constructed.

The tea plantations were also gradually replanted and the old Munnar was eventually rebuilt to the present day Munnar.

While Munnar and Idukki was the worst affected, other districts too had suffered massive damages. It is said that Central Kerala wa submerged upto 20 feets under water for days. The human cost of the flood of 99 still remains an unsolved question as there has been an accurate record of the lives lost in the chastorpy.","Sat, 11 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://im.indiatimes.in/facebook/2018/Aug/great_flood_of_99_1533980988.jpg,"['deluge', 'kerala', 'munnar', 'flood', 'brings', 'idukki', 'great', 'memories', 'wiped', 'railway', 'worst', 'old', 'remains', '99']",,none

In conversation with ANI, he said, “I have been in this profession for the past six years, and as people praised me, I feel my hard work has paid off.”

‘Operation Sahyog'

Under ‘Operation Sahyog’, the Indian Army's Engineer Task Force built a 40-foot bridge in Malappuram district. A traditional bridge was built from fallen trees that will help over 800 people move from the flood-hit area. Personnel from the army, navy, air force and the NDRF are engaged in relief and rescue operations in Kozhikode, Idukki, Malappuram, Kannur and Wayanad.

C4TN

About 55 NGOs from Coimbatore came together to form an initiative ‘C4TN’ and have collected relief material worth Rs 90,000. Originally formed during the Chennai floods, the group used social media to announce a list of 18 items that included water bottles, undergarments, sanitary napkins and sleeping mats to be collected and sent to the state.

Over 10,000 people living on the banks of Periyar river and its tributaries have been shifted to 78 camps opened in Ernakulam district as part of measures taken by it to deal with the threats following release of water from two major dams.

Officials said 10,510 people have been provided shelter at 78 relief camps opened in Paravoor, Aluva, Kanayannur and Kunnathunad taluks in the district.

The district authorities said they have made all necessary preparations for providing food, drinking water and medical facilities to the people shifted in the camps.

People said rise in water level in Periyar river has affected their normal life.

Meanwhile, braving adverse weather conditions, thousands of pilgrims thronged on the bank of Periyar river in Aluva to perform 'Karkkidaka Vavu Bali' at a Lord Shiva temple known for the annual ritual.

The temple situated in the middle of the river remained submerged in gushing waters.

Ernakulam district administration officials said elaborate arrangements were made by the government and temple administration in the unaffected areas on the river bank for the people to perform the 'Vavu Bali', a ritual, performed for the departed souls of their ancestors.

Security was tightened along the shore of the river for ensuring safety of the pilgrims.

Coast Guard and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed to ensure safety and security of the pilgrims.

Police and Fire and Rescue services personnel were also roped in to provide security.

Three boats, 20 lifeboats, 40 life-jackets, special ropes and diving teams were were kept ready to meet any eventuality, authorities said.","Sat, 11 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://c.ndtvimg.com/g9hqrvv8_periyar-river_625x300_11_August_18.jpg,"['relief', 'kerala', 'water', 'tightened', 'shore', 'periyar', 'moved', 'temple', '10000', 'safety', 'shifted', 'vavu', 'camps', 'district', 'river']",,flood

As the death toll climbed to 37 in rain-affected Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday undertook an aerial survey of flood-ravaged districts of the state. More than 11 out of 14 districts in the southern Indian state are under water due to incessant rains in the last three days. NDRF, Army and other forces are working on a war footing to rescue people from flood-affected areas as the overall situation remains grave.

On Saturday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to release sufficient funds to the Kerala Government. Meanwhile, CM Pinarayi Vijayan has also appealed to all to contribute generously to restore life in the state. He has also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the next of kin of deceased and Rs 10 lakh to those who lost their property in the Floods. The CM is visiting the flood-affected areas of Idukki, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Wayanad, Kozhikode & Malappuram districts.

For the first time in the last 26 years, all five shutters of the Cheruthoni dam–a part of Idukki hydel reservoir system– were opened. Idukki dam is one of the largest arch dams in Asia. Besides, more than 24 dams across the state have also been opened to drain out excess water.

A total of 11,713 people have been shifted to 73 relief camps across the state.

“No loss of wildlife has been reported so far. Animals are acquainted with such conditions and they do have natural protection to deal with such situations. But we can say that these situations put extra pressure on them,” said state’s principal conservator of forests PK Kesavan.

Saying many landslides happen in the periphery, not in deep forests, he also termed as “misleading” a video doing rounds on social media depicting the plight of a deer herd facing surging flood waters in Wayanad.

“Black bucks were shown in the video. But in Kerala we don’t have that species of deer. It is a misleading video intended to create a scare,” said Kesavan, adding personnel are keeping a strict vigil in forests.

Idukki, nestled in southern part of Western Ghat mountain ranges, hosts the Periyar Tiger Reserve - which has 35 tigers as per the last census, the Shola National Park, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, the Kurinjimala Sanctuary and Eravikulam National Park, which is home to near-extinct Nilgiri tahr (ibex) as well as rare bird species like Malabar grey hornbill, Nilgiri pipit and Nilgiri wood pigeon.

Kurinji lovers upset

Heavy rains have doused the spirits of ‘neela kurinji’ lovers and they fear large tracts of the plants could have been destroyed in the surging flood waters. Tourism officials who expected a windfall are also concerned.

The floods struck at a time when the neela kurinji (strobilanthes kunthiana) were set to bloom with clock-like precision after 12 years. When it bloomed last in 2006, the state tourism department claimed at least four lakh tourists swarmed the hill destination of Munnar, considered the best spot to watch the spectacle, and this time, it was expecting at least double that number.

“Wet conditions are a threat to kurinji because it needs good sun. Flash floods have affected plants in some areas. Still we expect widespread blooming by next month,” said G Rajkumar, an activist who has been working for the flower’s conservation for the past 40 years.

He attributed the present tragedy to human incursions and unnatural growth plans. “It is a lesson for all. Landslips and flash floods happened in areas that witnessed widespread human incursions. River should be allowed to run their natural course and it is time to rethink about management of dams,” he said.

For local people, kurinji is symbol of plenty and exuberance and for visitors, it is a visual feast. The flowers find abundant mention in both Tamil and Malayalam ballads and are also a favourite subject for modern writers. Tribal people often calculate their age with its blooming season.

Considering the ecological sensitivity of the area, the then VS Achuthanandan-led state government had declared a kurinji national park spread over an area of 32 sq km. His government also carried out a massive demolition drive against land encroachment in Munnar and surrounding areas but later this lost steam following stiff opposition from many, including his own party members.

Later governments scaled the area of the park, citing human settlements while land sharks exploited the situation to the hilt. The result is that the misty getaway of Munnar has turned into a concrete jungle and landslides are common at many places.","Sat, 11 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/08/11/Pictures/_a3fdd4ca-9d64-11e8-9ea4-7619ca404631.jpg,"['wildlife', 'denies', 'floods', 'national', 'blooming', 'forest', 'munnar', 'video', 'nip', 'lovers', 'casualty', 'kerala', 'dept', 'neela', 'human', 'bud', 'kurinji', 'nilgiri', 'park']",,flood

KOCHI: As they returned to their homes to take stock of the situation after three days at various relief camps, the sight that welcomed them is not pretty: refrigerators taken over by African snails, television sets and washing machines water-clogged and the floors that are filled with water and dirt.

""We are here for cleaning the house. We will return back to the relief camp in the evening,"" said Ambika Anandan, who complains that she's yet to get the washing liquid and the bleaching powder from the local authorities.

Her husband T S Anandan, a lottery ticket seller for the last 30 years, says a fortune has been lost in the rains and the consequent opening of the Idamalayar and Idukki dam last week. ""Our washing machine, fridge and several other electric equipments were lost in the flood. We have to rebuild everything from scratch again,"" he says.

The State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) has issued a red alert for eight districts in Kerala following an extremely heavy rainfall warning by the weather office.

The red alert will be in place till August 14 for Wayanad district and August 13 for Idukki, while for Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Palakkad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode it will be till Saturday. An advisory issued by the SDMA directed the public to avoid travel through hilly areas from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. in view of the possibility of landslips.

Citizens have been advised not to venture into the sea as well as rivers, streams and other waterbodies prone to flash floods. They have also been directed not to park vehicles under trees or near waterfalls on ghat roads.

The advisory also calls on citizens to be ready for evacuation on the direction of officials and avoid visiting places where floods and landslips have occurred.

Meanwhile, the midday weather inference issued by the India Met Department (IMD) on Friday indicated that conditions in the Bay of Bengal were becoming favourable to drive the southwest monsoon into an aggressive phase. The cyclonic circulation over North Odisha and neighbourhood and another similar system over West Central Bay of Bengal and adjoining south coastal Andhra Pradesh were likely to be joined by a fresh low pressure area brewing over the northwest Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood around August 13. The cyclonic circulation over the Southeast Arabian sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area, however, has become less marked.

The Met Centre here has warned of strong winds from the westerly direction, speed occasionally reaching 25-35 kmph gusting up to 55 kmph, were likely along and off the Kerala and Karnataka coasts and Lakshadweep areas. Fishermen have be advised to venture out to sea till Saturday evening.

Such is the state of the country today that any praise of administrative efforts in the event of a natural disaster may appear as fortuitous to many. Kerala at present faces an extraordinary flood situation with torrential rainfall over the last couple of weeks, major rivers running in spate and hilly areas prone to landslides. However, a vital overlooked aspect has been the stupendous behind-the-scenes efforts by relief workers, police and panchayat officials in getting people to temporary shelter camps. In the villages of Kozhithuruth and Chenapuram in Ernakulam district, people are united in their praise of the relief efforts and the government intervention as river-waters rose swiftly to enter their homes.

In Kozhithuruth, an island surrounded by water on three sides and connected to the mainland through a decaying stone bridge, waters of the Periyar and the Chalakudy rivers had risen with alacrity last week sending its residents into panic mode. One of the low-lying areas sensitive to sudden floods, timing is very crucial here. Islanders, indianexpress.com spoke to, collectively said if not for the valiant efforts of the local administration and volunteer groups, there could have been casualties.

“On Thursday morning, we realised that water was rising very fast, it had entered our front-yards and kept climbing. We were really scared. By afternoon, our local ward members and police officers came to us begging us to lock our homes and leave for the nearby relief camp. I remember Sub-Inspector Shibu sir in particular who literally swam in waist-deep water to rescue all of us,” said Gowri Dineshan, a resident of the island, on Monday.

Sudden and fast flooding in areas like Kozhithuruth and Chenapuram are interminably linked to the gush of water through the shutters of dams like Peringalkuthu, Sholayar and Idamalayar. Prior warnings are always relayed to the district administrations ahead of opening of shutters. This time too, officials say strict protocol was followed without any space for error. Since the water from the dams always take a minimum of 2-3 hours to reach these areas, local panchayats and district authorities use the time to evacuate those in sensitive areas. In the meantime, the local schools are readied with essential supplies to house those in need.

Shibu EV, the SI in-charge of the Puthenvelikkara police station who led relief efforts within his jurisdiction, is down with a fever at a local hospital after he got drenched in the rains. But he doesn’t give much serious thought to it. He’s rather relieved that he was able to reach out to everyone in need.

“Wherever I am posted, I always have a habit of connecting with the locals, staying in touch and engaging in charity projects. I came here 8-9 months ago, but I udnerstood the geography of the place. We had strict instructions from Superintendent of Police Rahul R Nair to evacuate those in sensitive areas, so we were prepared,” said Shibu EV over phone from a hospital bed.

“We formed groups on WhatsApp and Facebook with resident associations, ward members, church representatives and young volunteer groups. We kept sending them repeated messages that they should shift to the relief camps. Time was of the essence. We had to get in before the water does, otherwise, we can never pull out those people,” he added.

The police officer said they first identified the households that had elderly people, pregnant women and small children. They were pulled out first, followed by big and small families, last those whose homes were situated on higher areas.

“I can understand their mental agony in leaving their homes and go somewhere. But we have to remember that water floods very fast in areas like Kozhithuruth. If we can’t get to them at the right time, we may lose them,” said the police officer.

Jose, the local panchayat member who represents the 8th ward comprising of Kozhithuruth and nearby areas, was active on the phone, answering frantic calls from locals and taking rounds of flood-affected neighbourhoods on his scooter. Wherever he would find people stuck in homes, unable to get out, he would make calls to the police and rescue teams.

“When we heard the dam shutters will have to be thrown open, we convened a meeting of all political parties, trade bodies and religious groups at the panchayat. Responsibilities were delegated to specific groups. People volunteered in different ways. Police officers in uniform waded through waist-deep water to forcibly bring people to relief camps from their inundated homes. It was like a well-oiled machinery, that’s why we were able to save all lives,” said Jose, who’s now going around collecting signatures and identification papers of those who have been promised allowances from the government.

Jose said he was surprised to witness the outpouring of help that came from different corners in the form of essential supplies to the relief camps. Puthenvelikkara village alone had 11 relief camps set up at different schools. Men and women joined hands in cooking food for the inmates, taking care of pregnant women and the elderly.

“We got timely meals and blankets at night. We spent five days eating and sleeping together. We actually didn’t feel like coming back home,” a woman said with a smile.","Tue, 14 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/08/kerala-floods3.jpg,"['groups', 'panchayat', 'kerala', 'water', 'relief', 'kozhithuruth', 'ward', 'homes', 'rescue', 'cheer', 'efforts', 'villages', 'valiant', 'floods', 'areas', 'personnel', 'local', 'collectively']",,flood

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As the state struggles to survive the flood, various non-governmental organisations in the city have stepped in to provide relief to the flood-affected areas. Prominent NGOs and groups in the city such as Prathidhwani, a socio-cultural group of Technopark, Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA), Faith India Welfare Trust, Nemom, and Santhigiri Ashram, Pothencode, have come out with different plans to help people affected by the flood. Some of them have started flood-relief activities in places such as Kochi and Kozhikode.

From the IT hub

The IT hub in the city has also launched a bevy of initiatives to aid the households in areas left devastated by the raging South-West monsoon. The socio-cultural forum of Technopark employees, Prathidhwani, has initiated the ‘ Rice Bucket Challenge 2018’ wherein the employees challenge each other to donate at least 5kgs of rice packets.

“Each person will challenge five other employees. Usually, this is then given to the non-IT employees working in Technopark ahead of Onam. This time the rice packets so collected will be given to people at Kuttanadu,” said Rajeev Krishnan, secretary of the forum. Last year, 6.5 tonnes of rice were collected from Technopark during Onam. “We hope to target around 1,000 households with this. This is in addition to the dress collection initiative we have started for the people at Kuttanad,” he added. “A campaign for Kuttanad flood relief is currently on in Technopark and provisions and other essentials are being collected. Several organisations in Technopark have come together to spearhead the movement,” said Radhika Viswanathan, a member of Prakruthi.

As part of extending a helping hand, the team from Technopark had visited the flood-affected areas. Although the government is providing the people affected by flood in Kuttanad area with food, water and basic necessities, the Technopark team has already given contributions in the form of money in the first phase.

Now in the second phase of the Kuttanad relief initiative, they have already started a cloth collection campaign and have requested to collect old and new clothes for all age groups. The clothes can be handed over to the building coordinators or can be dropped at the designated boxes placed in the buildings.

CloThes and medicinesi

City-based NGO, Faith India Welfare Trust, Nemom, has decided to provide clothes, food and medicines to the affected areas in the coming days. C Ajithkumar, programme co-ordinator of the trust, said that they would tour the places across the affected places within two days and will provide necessary help to them. Faith India, an NGO formed in 2002, had provided help to the affected families of Ockhi cyclone earlier. The Santhigiri Ashram, Pothencode, has sought a report from the ashram branches in the affected districts. The assistance will be given in accordance with the report.

According to Pramod, AGM, Public Relations, they were committed to extending help to all of the affected families and the respective ashram units had been directed to be alert so as to provide the assistance. Other than NGOs, individuals have also come forward to help the flood-affected victims. Kasthurirangan, a Kochi-based philanthropist has informed ‘Express’ that he would donate financial aid to the affected families. He has earlier provided Rs 1 lakh to a family of Poonthura which left orphaned after the sole breadwinner died in the deep sea in Ockhi cyclone. “ I am deeply concerned of the present situation. As a philanthropist, I have to help the affected people”, he said.

Foot soldiers of Sancharii

The members of the travel forum Sanchari are acting as foot soldiers at Ground Zero. As many as ten members of the travel group are assisting the one of the medical camps currently underway at Alappuzha. “Though there were more volunteers, some had to be sent back owing to the ever-worsening climatic conditions,” said Salim Velikkad, panel admin, Sanchari. The travel enthusiasts have joined a floating medical camp at Alappuzha.

The volunteering mission undertaken by Sanchari is in association with NRHM Alappuzha. The Palakkad unit of Sanchari had provided food and provisions last week. The Sanchari team has rented out a boat and equipped with doctors and nurse, the team is traversing the flood-hit areas administering their services. “On enquiring with the district administration, we were informed that help in medical camps and rehabilitation works was required urgently. And that is how we joined in the medical camp. Once the rehabilitation works begin, more members will be volunteering,” Salim added.

Donations from NGOs

Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA) has donated Rs 23, 97,185 to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund on Thursday for the affected people following heavy rain, flood and landslides in five districts. The fund was raised by collecting the contribution from all the school teachers of government and aided schools in the state. Apart from this, the association has also given clothes, food and medicine to Kottayam, Alappuzha, Wayanad, Malappuram and Idukki.

According to KC Harikrishnan, general secretary, KSTA, the relief measures are being extended to the victims in the affected districts.“The relief activities are still on. Medicines, clothes and food are being provided to the respective units in the districts so as to reach it out to the people very soon. More assistance will be given to the families in the coming days”, said Harikrishnan.

Sevabharathi sends medical teami

Sevabharathi, an NGO based in Thiruvananthapuram and Attukal Hospital, is on a mission to ensure relief at flood-affected areas. The team include six doctors and 15 paramedics. Dr Ranjith Hari, district president, Sevabharati, said, “We are going to the flood-affected areas with a team of six doctors and15 paramedics. We are also taking loads of medicines”.

He adds: “The team comprising three doctors from Sevabharati and three doctors from Attukal Hospital are on their way.” The team plans to put up medical camps across the flood-affected areas.

On Friday, when the fifth shutter of the Idukki dam was opened, Kanhaiya Kumar, an NDRF rescue operation officer who hails from Bihar, risked his life as he crossed the Cheruthoni Bridge to rescue a child seconds before the bridge went under water.

In the visuals captured by News18 Kerala’s Kannan Prasannan, Kanhaiya is seen sprinting from one end of the bridge to the other to save the child as waves swept the bridge later.

“I was helping people evacuate from the vicinity of Cheruthoni Bridge, and then I noticed a man with a kid in his hands yelling from the other side of the river for help. In no time, I helped the kid and two others to safety and get primary medical aid,” Kanhaiya Kumar told News18.

Kanhaiya received a wireless message to take the child suffering from high fever to the nearest hospital. Wasting no time, he scurried across the bridge while holding the child in his arms.

“I realised that I can help by taking the child to nearest hospital in a safer place for first-aid and I did exactly that,” Kanhaiya told ANI.

Remember Gulgul, the loyal indie that saved his family from a burglar attack by disarming the robbers putting his own life at risk? Well, another heartwarming canine story comes from Kerala, where the floods have wreaked havoc on people’s lives, killing 37 and forcing 35,000 people into relief camps, according to NDTV.

In Idduki district’s Kanjikuzhy village, Mohanan P and his family were fast asleep in their home, when at 3 am the sound of his dog’s barks woke him up. The man tried ignoring it, but Rocky the dog did not stop.

Instead, he started howling. Recognising this as a distressing, unusual howl, Mr Mohanan realised something was wrong and rushed out of the house.

On exiting the house to check on Rocky, the family immediately noticed the impending disaster. All of them rushed out of the house, just in time, before their home was destroyed by a landslide. The family, including Rocky, have been moved to a government-run relief camp nearby.

Canines are often quicker to spot and react to danger than us, which is what causes them to give off warning or distress signals. In Gujarat, a dog saved his master from being mauled by three lions, when he raised the alarm, attracting a crowd that forced the lions to flee, according to the Times of India.

In yet another heroic incident in Bhubaneshwar, a dog single-handedly killed four poisonous snakes, slithering, trying to sneak into a house, according to Deccan Chronicle.

The courageous dog was trying to kill the snakes, and in the end, even though he was successful, he died because of the multiple snakebites he suffered in the process.

Well, these are just a few of the instances that dogs have saved their humans, often at the cost of their own lives! No wonder they are referred to as “man’s best friends”.

(Express photo by Vishnu Varma) A man sits by the teeming waters of the Chalakudy River which joins the Periyar near the island of Kozhithuruth. (Express photo by Vishnu Varma)

Far, far away from the maddening crowds of Kochi is the island of Kozhithuruth, which literally means ‘chicken island’ in Malayalam. Perched at the confluence of two of Kerala’s life-sustaining rivers – the Periyar and the Chalakudy River – the island’s geographical location is a rarity in itself. The tranquillity and the stillness it offers is unparalleled, perhaps with enough potential to serve the cravings of the average tourist Malayali. And yet, the same geography spells doom, day in and day out, for Kozhithuruth and its 180-odd families. When the rivers overflow, often with the water thrust into them through the shutters of the reservoirs built on them, the hearts of the island’s residents begin to race. They stare with utmost trepidation as the water, inch by inch and brick by brick, closes in on their front yards, their homes and finally their lives.

At a time when Kerala is confronted with an unprecedented monsoon tragedy, it’s perhaps important to understand why islands like Kozhithuruth are a ticking time-bomb. Years of government neglect in strengthening infrastructure, building livelihood opportunities and above all, checking trespassing with nature’s might lays bare the serious fault lines that could one day push the island’s population into an impending tragedy.

Inaugurated in 1989, this stone bridge is the only lifeline for the people of Kozhithuruth. The islanders say it is in a perilous condition.

Tethered by a decaying bridge

The only way to enter the island of Kozhithuruth is through a 30-year-old stone bridge that runs over a stream of the Chalakudy river. The other option, that existed before the bridge came into being, was transportation by wooden canoes (vanchi in Malayalam) which has since been abandoned, especially during the monsoon when rivers are in spate. Thus, for a whole variety of reasons, the island’s residents see the bridge as their ‘lifeline’, the link that tethers them to the mainland.

Follow India weather LIVE updates

For quite sometime now, the islanders have had serious apprehensions about the structural capacity of the bridge, whose pillars, they claim, are crumbling day by day against the flow of rushing water. “The bridge is our lifeline. We have been demanding a stronger bridge for years, but nobody’s listening to us. Bit by bit, it (the bridge) is decomposing. If one day, it collapses, which it will, we will be left isolated and cut-off,” says Natesan, a fisherman whose house stands perpendicularly to the bridge by the side of the stream.

The bridge, inaugurated in 1989, in its present condition is only wide enough for a single vehicle to pass. Designed in a way to withstand small currents, the islanders say the bridge can no longer resist the waters which have gained notoriety in recent years.

“Valare dayaneeyamaya avsthayanu (It’s in an extremely pitiable condition),” Shaiju, who deals with a furniture business, speaks of the stone bridge. “If a strong current comes in, it’s possible that it could lead to an accident. So along with strengthening the bridge, the authorities must raise the height of the road leading up to it so that there are less chances of flooding.”

Gowri Dineshan, another resident, chimed in, “If the bridge goes, our lives go with it. For any medical emergency, to take our children to the doctor, don’t we need the bridge?”

Three dams, two rivers and an island

This year, on an unprecedented scale, shutters of 24 of Kerala’s dams and reservoirs had to be opened to release excess water, which further led to almost all of the state’s perennial water sources flowing in spate, and often above danger limits. That includes both the Periyar and the Chalakudy River. For Kozhithuruth, which witnesses the meeting-point of the two rivers, the opening of reservoirs has far-reaching consequences. Last week, the water level in both the rivers rose gradually and substantially when shutters of the Idamalayar (on the Periyar) and the Sholayar and Peringalkoothu (both on the Chalakudy River) hydel projects were thrown open. On Thursday morning, abetted by heavy showers, the rising river-waters drove the islanders into a state of panic.

“On Wednesday night, we could see the water collecting in our front-yard. It was raining heavily. We couldn’t sleep that night. By morning, we realised something was wrong because the water just kept rising, step by step. It started entering our homes. We piled up appliances like TV and fridge on top to avoid getting wet. By then, police and village officials had come rushing to take us to the relief camp. We didn’t think twice, we just ran,” says Gowri Dineshan, a home-maker.

In fact, at most houses on the island, the water-level markers can be distinctly identified. These markers can be seen on outer walls, inside bedrooms and even on the groundnut trees in the front-yards.

After four days of flooding, the waters finally receded by Sunday evening, prompting the residents to return to their homes from the relief-camp to take stock of damages. But they have newer fears to combat.

An old woman was seen advising her neighbour, “Make sure you sprinkle some kerosene and fog all the rooms. Snakes may have crawled in, along with the water.”

Of rising debts and falling livelihoods

“One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,” counts 51-year-old Pushpa Thambi, pointing to the bricks of her uncemented home.

The height of ten bricks (katta in Malayalam) is how Pushpa alludes to the level of water that entered her modest two-bedroom home on the island from the nearby stream. Even the smallest of water-spurt in either of the two rivers can inundate Pushpa’s home in just a matter of hours. She’s aware of that.

“My life is the hardest on the island. No rescue officer comes to our home. They come to the main road, and then turn away. We are trying to sell this house and move away somewhere else safer. But who would buy our home, located in a marsh like this?,” she asks.

It’s true. A narrow mud trail, passing by the edge of the stream, leads to the homes of Pushpa and her neighbour, Karthu. It’s been two days since it has rained in these parts of Ernakulam district, but grimy water, feeding weeds, surrounds both the houses. Plastic bottles, fallen leaves and pieces of wood float around in the water. A putrid smell hangs heavy in the air.

Families like that of Pushpa, falling below the poverty line, have struggled hard to raise their homes, borrowing cash from money-lenders at exorbitant interest rates. Meeting expenses of their daughters’ weddings or funding their sons’ education are additional challenges. A majority of the island’s men are fishermen who sell their catch to meet daily expenses. But for more than a month, the teeming rains and the rivers flowing in spate have forced them to stay indoors. Daily-wagers like Pushpa’s husband, Thampi, barely get work these days, with the influx of migrant workers and a downward spiral in the construction business in the state.

The rising water has also severely hampered the flourishing banana plantations on the island, especially just days ahead of the harvest festival of Onam. On a walk around the island, acres of banana fields stood in knee-deep water as little kids cycled around them. “Ellam poyi (Everything’s gone),” a villager sighed.

Acres of banana fields inundated by river water. (Express photo by Vishnu Varma) Acres of banana fields inundated by river water. (Express photo by Vishnu Varma)

The better-off islanders have expertly raised their homes on higher land to escape the flood-waters, but women like Pushpa have nothing to show for, except dwindling earnings. Her home has been flooded four times already this year. Every time, she would notice the water rising, she and her husband would gather their belongings to head for the relief camp. But the process is exacting, she admits. All the government has assured her as of now is Rs 3,800 to help clean the home, drain the water out and buy essential supplies.

“Our lives are a tragedy,” she mumbles, before adding, ““Sometimes my son asks me whether we should just drink some poison. What’s the use of living like this?”","Tue, 14 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/08/kerala-river-759.jpg,"['island', 'varma', 'water', 'kerala', 'kozhithuruth', 'lives', 'bridge', 'rivers', 'recedes', 'floods', 'vishnu', 'pushpa', 'crumbling', 'express', 'clings', 'river']",,flood

RAMESWARAM : The Hindu Makkal Katchi (HMK) has kick-started a controversy by linking Kerala floods to women’s entry into Sabarimala temple. They also offered a special prayer at the Ramanathaswamy temple, Rameswaram for the relief of Keralities. The party’s district president Prabhakaran stated that the opinion of the leaders of various political parties and the court supporting the entry of women into Sabarimala temple were the reason for the present situation prevailing in Kerala.

Prabhakaran also urged Kerala government to pass a resolution in the legislative assembly against women’s entry to the temple and update it to the Supreme Court. “We believe that Kerala would not have faced such a devastating situation, if it would have supported the ban on women’s entry into Sabarimala temple as per Devaswom board’s decision,” Prabhakaran added.

Terming the act of Hindu Makkal Katchi functionaries as irrational, Kasinathadurai, the district secretary of CPI (M) said, “Since the functionaries basically follow the ideology of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), they were supporting patriarchal form of society and are opposing the women’s entry into Sabarimala temple. “Whatever happened in Kerala is a natural disaster and it has nothing to do with women’s entry into a temple,” he added.","Wed, 15 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2018/7/30/w600X390/Sabarimala1.jpg,"['hindu', 'situation', 'kerala', 'entry', 'sabarimala', 'flood', 'temple', 'prabhakaran', 'makkal', 'katchi', 'womens', 'express', 'indian', 'supporting']",,none

Thanks to the opening of all shutters at Bhoothathankettu dam, water is flowing down the hilly regions of the district.

“Some of the areas in Neriamangalam were flooded due to the overnight landslide. However, the water level has gone down in the afternoon,” Joseph Cherian, who is residing close to Periyar River near Neriamangalam bridge - the starting point of Ernakulam district- told Express.

“But people are afraid there will be a flood if more shutters of Cheruthoni dam are opened.” People are worried over the water level in the catchment areas of Boothathankettu dam. “Usually, when the shutters of the Boothathankettu are opened, the water recedes in the catchment areas. But this time, the water level is increasing. If more shutters of the Idukki dam are opened, the water level will further rise,” a Revenue Department officer at Inchathotty said.

Police officials are deployed at numerous places close to Periyar dam to prevent drowning in case people venture into the water. Kothamangalam MLA Antony John said all the precautionary measures have been taken.","Fri, 10 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2018/8/10/w600X390/Kerala_Flood.jpg,"['opening', 'kerala', 'tenterhooks', 'water', 'periyar', 'opened', 'regions', 'dam', 'floods', 'hilly', 'ernakulam', 'areas', 'shutters', 'level', 'river']",,flood

Over the last few days, torrential south-west monsoon rains have left a trail of destruction across Kerala. Since Wednesday, as many as 22 people have died and four have gone missing in rain-related incidents. The gates of 22 major reservoirs, including the giant Idukki reservoir that can store up to a height of 2,403 feet, have been opened after water levels threatened to breach the maximum storage capacity.

Floods have drowned hundreds of villages and towns, while landslides have destroyed roads, houses and farms. Personnel from the National Disaster Response Force, Army and Navy are being deployed for rescue operations. The bleak situation may continue for a couple of days as the meteorological department on Thursday issued a red alert to at least five districts for August 10 to August 13. A red alert is issued if heavy rainfall of between 12 cm to 20 cm is expected within a 24-hour period in a particular area. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday described the situation as “grave”.

According to the data from the Indian Meteorological Department, Kerala received 1,739.4 mm rainfall from June 1 to August 8 against the normal of 1,508.2 mm – 15% more than the normal rainfall till Wednesday. All Kerala’s 14 districts, barring Kasargod and Thrissur, received excess rain.While such downpour has been a major cause for the destruction, it is not the only one.

The majority of the human casualties have been caused by landslides. Of the 22 deaths reported on Wednesday, 20 people were crushed to death when boulders from cliffs fell on their homes. Unregulated construction in the guise of development has contributed significantly to the situation. The chance of landslides increases when human intervention such as constructing high rises, stone quarrying and building roads become rampant. The use of explosives to blast through rocks in quarries is another factor. A recent study conducted by scientists TV Sajeev and CJ Alex of the Kerala Forest Research Institute found that there were 5,924 big, medium and small quarries in Kerala.

The state has also witnessed unprecedented flooding thanks to the indiscriminate reclamation of lakes and paddy fields. This had blocked many waterways, preventing water from draining freely into the sea. In the third week of July, flooding drove 170,000 people in Kuttanad in Alappuzha district to government-run relief camps. A report by renowned scientist MS Swaminathan had blamed the floods on unplanned road laying across the region, with no regard to the direction of water flow. The government contributed to an environmental disaster recently when it brought a legislation that made it easier to reclaim land for infrastructure projects that “benefit the public” – a sweeping term open to cynical misinterpretation. Environmentalists claimed the legislation would devastate paddy fields and wetlands.

The monsoon has compounded the miseries of people who live on the sea shore as giant waves battered their villages and homes. The disappearance of beaches is a huge cause of concern in a state where the coast is mainly protected by sea walls, groynes and breakwaters. However, experts have warned that these man-made structures actually exacerbate beach erosion and do not provide a long-term solution for the problem.

Governments always act when disasters strike. But what residents need is long-term plans to reduce quarrying, land reclamation and stopping the construction of man-made structures along the coast to prevent future monsoon miseries.

KOCHI: With the water receding from flood-affected regions and houses, cleaning drive has started in many places. Volunteers from the area committees of different parties and corporation are helping the people in carrying out cleaning and restoration of homes.

“From 11 am, we cleaned around 15 houses. We spotted three snakes in different houses while cleaning. The locals also help us in cleaning activities. It is a collective effort,” said Ashraf, a volunteer who is part of the cleaning initiatives at Chirakkuzhy.

Meanwhile, Deepa Dharmajan, who was bitten by a snake the other day, is recovering at Little Flower Hospital, Angamaly. “Deepa was rushed to the hospital soon after she was bitten by the snake, which crawled up inside their home,” said Yusuf K K, a resident of Chirakkuzhy.

No end to the grievances

The people of Chirakkuzhy ward no. 9 are cut up with the decision of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) to set up a transformer in the vicinity of a pond there.

According to them, the location of the transformer leads to power being switched off whenever the water level in the pond goes up alarmingly. “The KSEB officials switch off the power when the water level in the pond rises, giving us a hard time as we struggle to keep our belongings safe at night,” said Sreedharan, a Chirakkuzhy resident.

Adding to the woes of the residents, there was has been no power in the area for the last two days. The 11 KV lines passing through the compound of houses are also causing difficulties for the people.

KALPETTA: WHEN flash floods began swallowing her house at Vellamunda village in Wayanad on Wednesday, 67-year-old Bharathi could do nothing but scream for help. More than her own safety, she was worried about her bedridden husband. Thanks to a stranger, the couple was rescued and are now at a relief camp in Pulinjammal school. Bharathi, one of the 766 inmates at the camp, recounts with horror the shocking moments when disaster struck. “It was past 6 pm on Wednesday and it was getting dark. As usual, we were busy with routine work when we heard some noise. When we came out, water had almost covered the entire house.

Soon, it started entering the house. Thankfully, a stranger rushed in and saved us,” she said. Like Bharathi, almost all the inmates had similar stories to tell. Stories of how they battled various odds to stay alive. At least 2,000 people, mostly tribals, were rendered homeless in the flood. Fingers are now being pointed at the unscientific manner in which shutters of the 40-year-old Banasura Sagar dam, an earthen reservoir, were lifted without prior warning to the people living downstream.

KSEB, which manages the hydroelectric dam, opened all the shutters within a short time on Wednesday evening, leading to flash floods in the area. As a result, many areas under five panchayats came under water within minutes, forcing people to flee. Latheef, another inmate at the camp, said many families had a miraculous escape. “Usually, people go for work after leaving kids at home and return late. Fortunately, no one went for work on that day due to rain. It helped them save their kids,” he said.","Wed, 15 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2018/8/14/w600X390/kochi011.jpg,"['kids', 'floods', 'indian', 'leave', 'water', 'house', 'shutters', 'stranger', 'bharathi', 'hundreds', 'kerala', 'camp', 'inmates', 'express', 'colony', 'tribal', 'homeless', 'wayanad', 'work']",,flood

The Union government has come to the State’s aid with an immediate relief of Rs 100 crore.

Climate change may be one of the causes for the unprecedented rains causing the worst floods in the State since 1924. The Disaster Management Authority has declared a red alert in Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad and Wayanad districts.

Ten columns of the Army together with the Air Force, Navy and NDRF personnel were assisting in rescue and relief operations. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who accompanied Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas, demanded an immediate relief of Rs 1,200 crore.

He estimated the damage caused at Rs 8,316. Heavy rains and flash floods have damaged crops in thousands of acres. The opening of flood gates of 22 dams on a single day last week added to the misery of the people. The government has opened 1,026 relief camps to provide shelter to those whose houses have been washed away or damaged.

The authorities waited a bit too long to open all the five sluice gates of the Idukki arch dam to conserve as much water as possible.

The State Electricity Board justified the delay stating the purposes of dams were power generation, irrigation, potable water supply and flood management. The Board gave priority to saving maximum water for power generation and ignored the importance of flood management and safety of the dam.

The Kerala government has been remiss, as many other States in the country, in preserving and safeguarding flood plains of the rivers and allowed construction activities. The north-west monsoon is also the landslide season. About 5,600 sq km of the State’s total area is prone to landslides.

Scientists attribute human intervention like building highrises, construction of roads and stone quarrying for causing landslides, especially when there is prolonged heavy rain. The disaster management plan published in 2016 by the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, says construction of highrises and resorts have been on the rise in the vulnerable area.

Those who promote unscientific development activities should be held accountable for the landslides. According to a study, Kerala has about 6,000 quarries. The use of explosives to blast rock in quarries causes rapid landscape changes leading to landsides.

Quarrying and construction should not be allowed in landslide-prone areas. Not only the Western Ghats, but also the estuarine mangroves should be preserved to minimize natural calamities. The weather office has warned of heavy to very heavy rains in the next couple of days. Kerala places its hopes on the Union government to come to its rescue.","Wed, 15 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kerala-Flood-Rain.jpg,"['management', 'kerala', 'relief', 'water', 'flood', 'states', 'state', 'heavy', 'red', 'construction', 'alert', 'union']",,flood

However, as Kerala continues to reel under the devastating floods, a very different kind of scene would have played out, had it not been for the locals, forest officials and wildlife lovers.

On Monday, locals discovered a stranded wild elephant who had presumably been swept away from a different location. The pachyderm had somehow managed to climb on a rocky terrain but was unable to move out as it was engulfed by gushing water from all sides.

They alerted the authorities and thus began a 4-hour effort to save the elephant.

Speaking to Hindustan Times, a senior forest official said, “The elephant was tired, and it seems it was stranded there for more than 24 hours. We found gushing water should be controlled to save it. We immediately approached the officials of Peringalkooth dam, and they agreed to shut three sluice gates for two hours.”

The officer elaborated that once the water receded, crackers were burst to lead the tusker into the forest.

As per reports, over 60,000 people are in relief camps across 14 districts of Kerala presently. Rajnath Singh has assesses the situation and said that the conditions are grave and all help will be provided from the centre.

The Indian Army has reconstructed a road damaged at Kochukodakallu-Machiplavu. They have also distributed food and medicines at a camp at Adimali district. So far, at least 33 people have been killed and 6 remain missing.

The flood situation does not seem to be improving anytime soon despite slight reduction in rains.

Updated on August 11 - Kerala floods: Moderate rain to continue, to intensify by Monday

The flood situation remained grim over the state of Kerala as moderate rains occurred in the last 24 hours. In fact, Punalur recorded 27 mm of rain, followed by Kozhikode 22 mm, Karipur 20 mm, Kannur and Alappuzha 18.

Further also we expect moderate rains to continue and on August 14, rainfall may increase more and may worsen the flood situation in parts of Kerala.

Updated on August 10 - Kerala Floods: Situation worsens as reservoirs continue to swell

Kerala floods refuse to take a backseat as heavy showers continue to lash the state. Heavy rainfall activity was observed during the last 24 hours as well.

The death toll which was at 20 yesterday has risen to a 26. The flood situation has gone grimmer in the past 24 hours and it does not seem like there is any relief likely.

Heavy rains did continue through the night due to which the rescue operation teams inclusive of the Indian Armed Forces, the Indian Air Force, the Indian Naval Forces as well as the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). In fact, 10 NDRF teams have been carrying out the rescue work and along with the Defence forces, the Coast Guard has also been roped in.

As per sources over 240 relief camps have been set up and more than 15 thousand people have been shifted from low-lying areas. 5,500 people from Wayanad district and 3500 from Ernakulum have been moved to relief camps.

Moreover, two more shutters of the Cheruthoni Dam have been opened once again for easing out the pressure of water on the Idukki reservoir.

The shutters opened after water levels reached to a whopping 2401 feet mark, at around 7:00 am in the morning. Due to rising water levels, 22 dams have been opened during the last few days as water levels have been on the rise. This has caused the Periyar River, the longest river in Kerala to swell.

In the last 24 hours from 8:30 am on Thursday, Punalur recorded 48 mm of rain, and Thiruvananthapuram saw 44 mm of rainfall.

Schools as well as colleges will remain shut in parts of Idukki, Wayanad, Palakkad, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Pathanamthitta, Malappuram and Kollam. In fact, due to the possibility of some showers tomorrow as well, annual Nehru boat race in Alappuzha has been postponed.

The Chief Minister of Kerala has imposed a ban on the movement of heavy goods vehicles and tourist vehicles in the high ranges of Idukki taking into account, the heavy rains over the state. PM Modi has also offered assistance to the state.

As per weathermen at Skymet Weather, rainfall activity will continue to occur over the state of Kerala for another 24 hours. However, rains will not be as intense as they were before. Thus, the situation will not see any massive improvement for at least another 24 hours.

38,38,FL-2018-000134-IND,Live in the City but Want to Grow a Mini Forest? This Unique Startup Will Help You! - The Better India,https://www.thebetterindia.com/155524/city-mini-forest-startup-hosachiguru/,"This article has been powered by Hosachiguru

Four years ago, three engineers decided to quit their lucrative jobs at the peak of their careers. The reason? They wanted to undertake scientific and mechanised agriculture.

While the initial idea of the Bengaluru-based trio–Ashok Jayanthi, Sriram Chitlur and Srinath Setty, was to find a piece of land close to the city where they could practice organic farming and grow chemical-free food for their families, little did they know it would culminate into an innovative agri-startup, today known as Hosachiguru.

What is Hosachiguru?

Originating from the Kannada terms ‘hosa’ which means ‘new’ and ‘chiguru’ which means ‘sprout’, Hosachiguru is a leading agricultural asset management startup that is running over 30 sustainable green projects on 800 acres of land.

When you think about investments, you might consider buying a plot of land away from the city where you’d spend more of your savings, perhaps building a home that you may or may not live in for the next decade. But what if we told you, despite living in the city, you could invest and buy a piece of land, which could be transformed into a mini-forest and get you returns ?

And you don’t even have to think about its maintenance. Everything will be done for you! Plus, you’ll have organically grown and pesticide-free produce from this mini-forest delivered at your doorstep weekly.

Sounds utopian?

Well, the Bengaluru-based agricultural asset management startup with its latest Eco-habitat project is doing exactly that!

Speaking to The Better India, the trio explains the inception of the company saying,

“When we decided to take up farming ourselves, and hunted for farmland, we travelled across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. It was during this ground research that we realised that procuring, buying as well as maintaining farmland was no child’s play. Either the cost of the land was too high, or it was too remote to be within our reach. But we were passionate about farming and willing to go the extra mile. As a company, we decided to procure 20-30 acres of farmland. We fenced it, dug borewells, sowed seeds, got farm labour, all by ourselves. But slowly our work started piquing the curiosity of those in our social circles. People started asking us for tips.

Sriram Chitlur shares, “It was at the time we thought, why don’t we sell the pieces of land to these people and manage it on their behalf. That’s how we started getting customers on board and started rolling one project after another.”

Whether it is their retail project that helps investors get long-term income from timber cultivation or their upcoming eco-habitat project, their road to success was full of challenges.

The trio travelled across the globe to understand the best-mechanised farming practices. Despite the massive exposure to a wide range of practices across different countries, they decided to come up with the own techniques to ensure that they brought down the cost without compromising on quality, while also ensuring maximum yield and profit.

Srinath observes, “While the labour costs to maintain an acre or two of land is as high as Rs 30,000 – 40,000 a month, we had to innovate techniques and build operations at a scale to ensure the same piece of land only required a labour cost of Rs 5000 a month thus ensuring better returns for our stakeholders.”

How are their methods different from those used by traditional farmers?

Regular farms are designed by the farmers, based on years of knowledge and experience. But one cannot overlook the fact that if a farmer maintains an acre of land, his primary premise is to rely on rainwater and grow cash crops like pulses and brown rice during the monsoons. Many farmers don’t have the scope nor the resources to scale up their operations or use mechanisation for the small piece of land. Plus, the lack of insurance, marketing challenges and uncertainty of climate, only add to their woes.

With the resources and mechanisation available at their disposal, Hosachiguru follows some sustainable and mechanised practices. A classic example of this is how they dedicate a few acres of farmland and turn it into a catchment area for rainwater harvesting with contour bunds, drenches, compartment bunds, soaking pits, mounds etc.

In 2016 alone, they were able to save a whopping 1.2 crore litres of water on a 35–acre farm during heavy rains that lasted 45 minutes. This water lasted them for seven months until the dry summers. And so, they have successfully built a system where they are not reliant on groundwater for sustenance.

Besides this, Hosachiguru also uses the method of biodiverse farming to replicate the ecosystem of natural forests with zero residue farming methods, bio-fertilisers, bio-pesticides, live mulching, intercropping, integrated pest management and the inclusion of a diverse variety of herbal plants.

“So all you have to do is own or invest in a piece of farmland, and we will manage it for you with the best agricultural practices. You don’t have to worry about the farm operations, labour, power & water availability, soil conditions, sale of produce etc. You can enjoy the true spirit of the farm by getting chemically free produce at your doorstep,” says Sriram Chitlur.

Additionally, you can also visit the land whenever you please, participate in the farm activities, enjoy the hospitality or just bask in the glory of your mini-forest!

Under its latest eco-habitat project which is spread on 16.5 acres and is an hour away from the international airport in Bengaluru, Hosachiguru is selling quarter acre farm plots.

Each of these plots will be demarcated, have road access, water supply through drip irrigation and underground pipes, access to borewell, centralised water distribution and a nursery to grow fruits and vegetable plants.

This project will also have sustainable homes built using compact stabilised earth bricks (CSEB) to serve as weekend getaways or post-retirement dream homes close to nature.

Today, Hosachiguru has over 100 customers who have bought various farmland projects, and the number is only growing. The average investment required for a project is Rs 15-18 lakh per unit. In the next 365 days, the trio envisions to add another 1,000 acres of land to expand their projects.

Today, Hosachiguru works with over 300 farm labourers living in native villages close to their farmlands spread across the three states. Many of these labourers are uneducated and come from impoverished backgrounds. But the team at Hosachiguru has helped them unlearn unscientific agricultural practices and skilled them in sustainable practices.

These farmhands (which include many landless labourers and several others with small but barren pieces of land) are not only successfully maintaining the day-to-day working of Hosachiguru’s extensive agriculture projects spread over 800 acres of land but are also replicating similar sustainable practices like maintaining biodiversity, multi-crop management, bunding etc., on their land to make it agriculturally viable.

What’s better than investing in a property that gives your life a purpose and ensures food security for your future generations besides transforming the lives of the underprivileged?
