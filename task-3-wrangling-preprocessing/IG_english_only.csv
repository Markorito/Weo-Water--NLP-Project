This is Rachel Coleman (st_rachel) the brains behind signing_time . 

On a personal level...I have loved her work since my oldest was tiny (he's 16 now!) 
On a professional level...I appreciate Rachel's dedication to inclusion - this is how you show kids that everyone has a place at the table.

Rachel was kind enough to do a celebrity visit!  The little guy who will get this doll has Hemingway-facial Microsomia, a BAHA hearing aid, and a feeding tube.  He's learning how to sign!
I'm alternating between the cuteness of it all and a bit of jealousy üòÜ. 
Hop over and give signing_time a like....support the organizations that make inclusion and representation a part of their language.

For example, Finn has teeny tiny ear canals, so tiny that no doctor has ever been able to see inside! Because his ear canals are so small, he uses a BAHA (bone-anchored hearing aid) to help the sound travel to his inner ear so he can hear normally.

Finn has teeny tiny tear ducts, so tiny that even after surgery in December, they are still not draining his tears properly. This is why you often see tears in his eyes or running down his cheeks even when he's not crying.

Finny will be getting surgery at the end of July because of these itty bitty passages. He'll be getting stints in his tear ducts to help his eyes drain properly. He'll also have a doctor look into his ears while he's sedated. They'll be checking for fluid and to make sure there is nothing structural obstructing his hearing. We're also hoping to get some scar tissue removed from his g-tube site. Thankfully, Finn does great during surgery and we have no doubt he will again.

[Image description: A toddler boy with tan skin, dark curly hair, and Down syndrome sits on an exam table in a doctor's office. His hands are up in the air excitedly. He is wearing a lime green tie-dye t-shirt, khaki shorts, dark blue tennis shoes, and a blue BAHA.]",English

I bounced around between mottchildren and umichmedicine for appointments today in preparation for my bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) placement surgery in a couple of months. I had a CT scan, an updated hearing test and the BAHA evaluation where I had the opportunity to try the device.

My hearing has gotten a little worse since last time which is a bummer, but it makes me even more grateful for assistive hearing technology. If you‚Äôre new here, my hearing loss is actually not technically related to having Osteogenesis Imperfecta. There is OI-related hearing loss, but it‚Äôs not what I have. I‚Äôve done several IG posts & YT videos about it, if you want to learn more. ü§ó

In this photo Im wearing a band that the device connects to with a magnet. I could just have the device on a band like this so that I wouldn‚Äôt need another surgery, but the band is really tight and uncomfortable (IMO), + the fashion gal in me would not like to wear it all the time. Plus I‚Äôd get makeup all over it üòú I clearly have my priorities straight, right?! üòÇ

And this way, the surgically implanted BAHA, won‚Äôt need to be adjusted all the time because of the band. It‚Äôs just all around the best option *for me* to get it surgically implanted. There are many different types of BAHAs for different circumstances. My surgeon & I decided the best option would be the medel_global BoneBridge. I will actually be the first person at umichmedicine to have this specific one implanted which is so exciting ü§©

Being able to hear is such a gift, & I never realized how much I‚Äôve missed over the years. I cannot wait to experience a whole new world in a few months! üòç",English

Happy Trach Anniversary!

Day to day life with a trach is hard work. It's heart breaking not being able to hear his voice or hear him cry. We have learnt to pay more attention to his gestures and facial expressions.

The trach saved your life and for that I'm forever grateful despite the heartache it often brings. ‚ù§

Lucas is happier at school and can hear his teacher better than ever. Some of the other students have even said they wished they had hearing aids just like Lucas!

To any young people that are going to be fitted with hearing aids and are feeling a bit scared, Lucas says ""It's not that scary and the hearing aids make everything better to hear."" It only took Lucas 10 minutes to learn how to put his hearing aids on himself, and without a mirror ‚Äì thanks for being a hearing superstar, Lucas!",English

after roughly twenty-four years of hearing loss, this mama is getting it back, bionic style!!

in about a month or so i will have a procedure to have a bone anchored hearing aid implanted! this procedure is an outpatient procedure which involves my dr inserting a surgical screw into the bone behind my ear and placing a little device (almost like a bluetooth) on top! 

my dr and several other professionals (a whole panel to be exact) went over my case and determined that i am the perfect candidate for this due to the type of hearing loss i have. during tests, it was discovered that i have greatest hearing results through bone conductivity (vibrations) vs what other traditional hearing aids do, which is amplify noise

it goes without saying that while i‚Äôm pretty excited for this, i am also nervous as all get out!

On the occassion of World day to combat desertification and drought,as the world fights a pandemic and nature tries it's best to heal back to health... join in for the national webinar organized by Regional Museum of Natural History Bhubaneswar over Goto meeting at 10:30 AM. 
The burning issue of land degradation and desertification is bound to touch all our lives sooner.or later. Let's discuss our little roles and contribution we can put in to save the planet from shattering further. For all the wrong already done let's find out how can we help earth heal back to health. It's not our duty only. It's a dire need of the hour. For the fast depleting green cover , more than 20 states in India are already facing land degradation! What doesn't seem to affect us right away is slowing ailing the planet and thus all of us. Time to act!

.
Desertification and land degradation, caused primarily from mining, urbanization, and agriculture, are only worsened by global warming. Especially in dryland areas where agriculture or other land uses are hard on the soil, the ground quickly snowballs to a desert-like state. If plants aren't able to keep the soil together, the soil can degrade further, allowing even less plant life to take hold.
.
It's a slippery situation that could end up affecting hundreds of millions of people. Currently, there are 2 billion people that live in dryland areas that could eventually be at risk of being displaced by desertification. But even by the end of this next decade, 50 million people around the world could be displaced by desertification.
.
Just like with the Paris Climate Agreement, the Convention to Combat Desertification involves 122 countries that have committed to keeping soil arable and managing freshwater supplies. One initiative, the Great Green Wall, aims to restore over 380,000 square miles of African soil by 2030. Another initiative in the Gobi Desert includes planting trees in northern China to stop the desert's spread.

Land degradation is inextricably linked to the fashion industry. From badly managed terrestrial agriculture used to grow materials like cotton and hemp, to mass amounts of water used to process and dye clothing, fashion's exploitation of land and water cannot be understated.

""By 2030, the fashion industry is predicted to use 35 per cent more land ‚Äì over 115 million hectares, equivalent to the size of Colombia."" (UN)

Through our demand for food, materials, and shelter, we have drastically changed the environment around us. Land degradation negatively impacts the lives of more than 3.2 billion people around the world. 

This year's goals outlined by unccd emphasize the need to invest in restoring land as part of a green recovery that has wide-reaching benefits:

üåé Economic resilience by creating jobs & raising incomes 
üåçIncreasing food security
üåèProtecting biodiversity

The restoration of degraded land brings economic resilience, creates jobs, raises incomes and increases food security. 

Restoring degraded land brings economic resilience, creates jobs, raises incomes and increases food security. It helps biodiversity to recover. It locks away the atmospheric carbon warming the Earth, slowing climate change. It can also lessen the impacts of climate change and underpin a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. LAND is part of the solution! Link In Bio to learn more.

Desertification is the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas. It is mainly caused by human activity and climatic variations. This process does not refer to the advancement of existing deserts. Desertification is due to the vulnerability of dry zone ecosystems, which cover a third of the planet's surface, to overexploitation and inappropriate land use. (UN)

Farmers in Rhineland-Palatinate have suffered from drought for the past three years. According to the German Weather Service, March and April 2021 were again too dry. Particularly difficult: Due to the lack of groundwater in the vegetable growing areas of the Vorderpfalz, some streams are literally pumped empty.

But not only here in the Palatinate there has been a drought for several years - Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg are also experiencing the severe drought particularly hard. Many of us certainly still remember the pictures of the fields in Brandenburg that were devastated in the truest sense of the word. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm interested in: How about you guys?

This week, with the stories, we have prepared you for today's theme: Desertification. The ""United Nations International Convention on Combating Drought and Desertification"" defines this phenomenon as ""land degradation in dry, semi-arid and sub-humid dry areas, attributable to various causes, including climatic variations and human activities"".
(Comforting to always be one of the causes of malaise on our planet!) So what is it? It is the decrease and disappearance of the biological productivity and physicochemical properties of the affected soils, leading to the loss of vegetation. The soil, losing its properties, becomes dry, sandy and inhospitable even for the ‚Äústrongest‚Äù plants normally used to drought; and the strong and sudden rains we are used to do not help to contain the gradual disappearance of the vegetation cover. Consequently, the plants grow more and more slowly, making the ""natural barrier"" disappear, and the desert can only advance more and more.
This year's goal of #desertificationanddroughtday is to demonstrate the importance of healthy soil, in both environmental and economic terms, therefore, fighting against this phenomenon and ensuring that the soil is healthy is not only good. to biodiversity and to our Mother Earth (#respectmotherearthbitch), but also for human survival, and of those who, of land and cultivation, live there.

The reforested areas were cleared during the civil war and the trees in these areas were used as firewood. However, ""Magic for the World"" has now made it its goal to restore these areas and therefore plans to plant 50,000 trees this year. üî• üåø üå± 

The seedlings are grown in a local tree nursery and then distributed to farmers and village communities in the region. This not only prevents desertification, but also involves the local population. In addition to the plantations, they can also take part in educational workshops. üë©üèæ‚Äçüéìüßëüèæüë©üèæüè´

Is desertification the world's biggest environmental problem currently?

Desertification should receive immediate attention
Far more of the Earth is covered by semi arid seasonal grasslands than forests, and about two thirds of the worlds grasslands are beginning to show signs of desertification.  Saving this land from total desertification should be the first point of call in tackling climate change, as preserving the fertility of these lands will help to reverse the greenhouse effect.  This is due to the large scale of additional photosynthesis this change could create, the plants of these regions effectively pulling large amounts of additional greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.

This allows us to easily refill pasture holding tanks or pump over whey tanks to the hogs. In a pinch it can double as a portable fire fighting rig.

The barrier will help slow the movement of saltwater into the central Delta and prevent contamination of #water supplies for Delta agriculture and municipal supplies for millions of Californians.

‚ÄúCalifornia is experiencing a second consecutive dry year and snowpack runoff into our state reservoirs has been far less than anticipated, so we are taking emergency actions to protect the state‚Äôs water supply and environment now,‚Äù said DWR Director Karla Nemeth. ‚ÄúDWR along with partner agencies is looking at all options to bolster the state‚Äôs drought response and mitigate drought impacts.‚Äù

The barrier will help prevent saltwater contamination of water supplies used by millions of Californians who rely on Delta-based federal and state water projects for at least some of their supplies. The #emergency barrier will also help conserve critical water supplies in upstream reservoirs for later use by avoiding the need to send large volumes of water into the Delta to repel salinity this summer.

‚ÄúKeeping saltwater from intruding into the central Delta is essential as a large portion of the state‚Äôs fresh water for urban and agricultural use goes through this part of the Delta,‚Äù said Ted Craddock, Deputy Director for the State Water Project.

On June 1, a temporary urgency change petition to modify State Water Project and Central Valley Project water rights conditions was approved by the State Water Resources Control Board, which will allow for water to be conserved for later instream uses and water quality requirements. These modifications are needed to help protect cold water pools for salmon and steelhead and maintain water quality while ensuring some water supplies are maintained if drought conditions persist next year.

this year will be a heated theme.

Without H2O none of us would be here in a physical form. Water carries e~motions and it is interesting to see how the ‚Äòdrought‚Äô may correlate to the ‚Äòinner drought within humanity‚Äô that is needed to be felt, in order to change.

What feelings are we not in touch with? 

What are you using water for?

Growing lawn?
Non native high water usage plants?
Washing your car?

We all have people living ‚Äòdown river‚Äô from us.

Holding a enhanced capacity of ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô into how water nourishes nature closes the gap of receiving and giving.

As much as I love many plants, I support native plants the most. My mullein is thriving for example, with little to no extra water. So do the belly flowers... and my dogwood.

I have fountains and many water bowls for birds and other wildlife: deer, bobcats, bears, snakes, squirrels and chipmunks are frequent visitors to these holy places.

It has become an energetic oasis and sanctuary for them to come and be.

We are being asked to awaken. Ascending into higher planes of consciousness is by becoming aware in a harmonious ways of ALL there is. Being intuitive, having crystals and saying ‚Äòhip new age words‚Äô is not at all enough.

How are you with Mother Earth? 
Do you notice where you step your feet?
Are there little bugs? Or a tiny trying plant üå± on the road?

May your inner ‚Äòwaters‚Äô move you into unity and harmony to create a new balanced way for those of us who choose to live and experience the beauty and love there is.

And in my universe~ bubble it already is... 

With so much gratitude for each living plant and creature, to bless us with their harmonious non -destructive way of being.
May we remember and learn from them.

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar, the Southwest US typically experiences monsoons in July and August. These are big thunder storms that build during summer heat and deposit LOTS of moisture in a short amount of time. The storms are powerful and fierce. Slot canyons and washes fill and flash flood. The last few seasons summers have gotten hotter and we legitimately haven‚Äôt had a monsoon season in years. Last summer we had a grand total of one thunderstorm in St George proper. And in tandem with this we see more frequent and more severe wildfires. Last summer there were at least five significant fires that were very real threats to residential areas in our town. This spring there have been a number of major fires IN town already. So this is all to say this is probably going to keep trending this way and climate change is real. Fight me.

üî• 41 of 58 of California‚Äôs counties are in a state of drought emergency as the state continues to fall deeper into drought. This means more dry land, and potential for more wildfires.
üî• Fire season has already begun. There have already been nearly 2,800 wildfires, with nearly 16,000 acres burned since the first of the year. This is an extremely early start for fire season, as less than 2,400 acres had burned by this time last year. Experts believe that as temperatures continue to rise and droughts sustain, parts of California will be in fire season year-round.
üî• Cal Fire has hired nearly 1,400 new seasonal firefighters to combat the increased demand. Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing an additional $38.9 million to staff current and additional Cal Fire crews.
üî• Newsom also proposed an additional $2 billion to combat the fires this year, which would be the largest wildfire budget ever proposed by a governor, saying ‚ÄúClimate change has created a new wildfire reality in California.‚Äù

We've partnered with the WateReuse Association to make this video highlighting how climate change and drought is threatening California's water supplies. And time is running out to secure a better water future. 

Luckily, communities are hard at work, planning recycled water projects that can transform our state‚Äôs water supply

But we need your help. We‚Äôre asking you to include $750 million for recycled water in the drought package‚Ä¶this will ensure California‚Äôs water future, create jobs, and support our environment and economy‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs only the beginning.

It is time to invest in new drought tolerant water supplies for our State... and the time to address the problem is now.

Furthermore, as total precipitation for the year remains far below seasonal averages, there is growing confidence for drought conditions to persist into the foreseeable future. 

From the air, it is more difficult to see the impacts of drought, especially in its early stages. At the surface, many farmers are beginning to quietly hope and pray for a change in the weather pattern.

‚Äã
1) ‚ÄãStart at home by conserving your water usage... take shorter showers and turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or doing the dishes. ¬†And as much as we like green grass, be aware of how much water is being used outside!
‚Äã
‚Äã2) If you are looking to get out on the water and fish this summer, enact your own hoot owl... get out early and end early. ¬†Our fisheries will be stressed so be extra kind to the fish and #keepthemwet.
‚Äã
‚ÄãMaking small changes can make all the difference for our water systems in Montana!

Using metal boxes to lock themselves down in the middle of the roadway, activists blocked both entrances to the hotly contested logging plan. Loggers arriving in several pickup trucks at 5:45 a.m. to cut down the large second growth redwoods on the 500 acre plan were turned away.
A single CalFire vehicle and one private security guard were the only officials present in the vicinity of Roads 500 and 600 until CHP arrived at 9:00 a.m. and gadvised the protestors they would be arrested and held in the Ukiah jail until next Monday if they stayed. As protestors began to disperse, chainsaws were reported to be heard inside the logging plan causing some activists to go back into the woods.
The previous day, loggers were able to gain access and cut down some seventy trees before being stopped by protestors who confronted them peacefully and engaged in dialogue. Cal Fire was immediately notified of public‚Äôs presence ¬†in forest, including an active tree sit in the well-known Old Growth redwood ¬†‚ÄúMama Tree‚Äù,¬† but did not halt active tree falling, apparently instructing fallers to stop work only if protestors were visible.
CalFire has ‚Äúunmarked‚Äù the Mama Tree and several other large old trees nearby, but activists are asking for a total revision of the JDSF Management Plan that allowed such old and irreplaceable trees to be marked for cut in the first place.
The Coalition to Save Jackson Demonstration Forest is calling for a moratorium on logging in the State-owned forest, citing JDSF‚Äôs outdated Management Plan. Although reviewed in 2016, the Plan relies on a 2007 EIR and does not adequately address climate change, drought conditions or science based fire management. The Coalition‚Äôs many members and supporters believe these trees are worth more standing, for cultural heritage, environmental benefits, and recreation.

So, how does it work?¬†

The principle is simple. A clay pot is buried with only the opening on top visible above the soil surface. It is then filled with water. The porous walls of the clay pot allow water to dissipate into the soil as needed.¬†

If the soil is dry, the water inside will release faster as the soil roots ‚Äúpull‚Äù it out. Likewise, if there is a recent saturating rainfall the water in the olla will remain until the surrounding soil dries.¬†

Check the sheep's eyes. The foxtails and pickers are unusually severe this year, stuck into the skin of their bellies even after the wool is off, making their eyes milky and threatening blindness. One could easily spend as much time tending eyes as shearing. 
FYI. Urgent.
Know and tell the age of the lambs. A ewe with a new lamb on her is the strongest there is, with hormonal changes and stress changing the nature of the wool, but more important still is: I will not advise you to take a newly nursing ewe off food and water for 10-12 hours lest she dry up.

Some early fires are showing signs that those forecasts may be spot on. State Forester Bill Crapser joined us to discuss that and how they are planning to address things.

Bob Beck:¬†We're already starting to see some fires happening across the state. Anything there that gives you cause for concern?

Bill Crapser:¬†Right now we're a little bit ahead of where we were last year. So that's concerning the way last year turned out. Predictive Services, which is the interagency group that looks at fuels, weather, and predicts what they think is going to happen in the summer, they're saying that in June and July, most of the state will be in the high end of a normal fire season. But for August, they have the entire state in an above-average fire season. So we're pretty concerned about where we're going to be going this summer.

Beneath the dome, sinking air is causing temperatures to soar well over 100 degrees in many areas.
Heat alerts have been issued by the National Weather Service for various time periods this week, from parts of the Southwest into the Great Basin and California.

üö© Records have already been broken in this heat wave and more are likely to fall in the days ahead, from the Central Rockies into the Desert Southwest and California.
Salt Lake City tied its all-time record high for any day of the year yesterday when it hit 107 degrees.
That followed daily record highs on Sunday (102 degrees) and Monday (103 degrees).
Denver, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Sacramento are some of the cities that could set at least daily record highs through late this week.

‚ö†Ô∏è Outdoor activities should be limited in these areas because of the possibility of heat-related illnesses.
The core of the heat will be most persistent in the Southwest, but it will also affect parts of the Great Basin and Rockies.
It will spread into California's central valley for the end of the week.
Wildfire concerns will also be elevated this week because of the hot temperatures in combination with long-term drought conditions in place across a large part of the West.

There is a fire restriction across Southwest Utah and Northern Arizona. No campfires are allowed. So far this year there have been 326 wildfires in Utah, of which, 42 started in just the last week. 90% of the fires are human caused, and have lead to 12,000 acres burned. The low humidity in the air and the lack of rain or moisture on the ground makes it easy for wildfires to spread. There is no rain in the forecast. The Southwest relies on 2 major reservoirs on the Colorado River to keep water flowing to Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Temperatures are increasing due to climate change which produces much more evaporation, more loss of water from the reservoirs, a greater demand for water in agricultural systems that use water for crops. Even without factoring in less rain,  you would expect more water scarcity in the future.

usask researchers used the CLS to show that cuticular wax‚Äîa waxy layer that covers exterior surfaces of plants, much like human skin‚Äîprovides a barrier against low temperatures and dehydration.
The ultimate goal of the research is to provide plant breeders with information that enables them to more efficiently select superior #genetic lines and develop more resilient #crops as environmental conditions get more unpredictable, according to Dr. Karen Tanino agbiousask.
The team used our #MidIR beamline to study plant leaves to the depth of two microns (two millionths of a meter), which provided information on the quantity and quality of the surface wax. In a recently published paper, the team argues that the best way to keep #plants from freezing is by selecting waxy varieties. 

This research was funded by nserc_crsng, skgov, and #SaskWheat.

Many species have been under attack, literally, in western State's like Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. But Washington is stepping up and trying to protect their wildlife! Two Spokane-city lawmakers are advocating for a statewide ban on wildlife feeding to help protect the black bears in the State. 

Most of Washington state is currently under a drought advisory, with March and April being the fourth driest period on record for the state since 1895. Kile Westerman, a wildlife conflict specialist for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, said, they believe as a result from this, the food source available to the bears is ""less than ideal"" which means the bears have to go searching farther and are getting into more urban areas. While feeding bears is illegal, feeding deer and other wildlife is allowed in most of Washington. But bears will be bears, and when food is scarce they are opportunistic. As we know, this puts a target on the bears.

Councilwomen Lori Kinnear and Candace Mumm are planning to add a statewide wildlife feeding ban to the city's Washington State Legislative wish list. When the Legislature starts its 2022 session, Spokane's representative will advocate for some sort of wildlife feeding ban. This will eliminate many areas of concern, including human-bear conflict, the spread of chronic waste disease and the habituation of wild animals.

That was then and this is now. 

Now it's hot as hell...apologies to any Mormon, Christian or other conservative groups who take offense to that word. 

Stepping out of one's apartment, you're immediately transported to magically locations such as Beirut, Phoenix, Tel Aviv, Death Valley or the surface of the sun. 

That crispness I eluded to earlier has now been replaced by stifled convection oven breezes that will not only give the allergenic and asthmatic fits but will also motivate an individual to reconsider job opportunities in Alaska. 

And with Summer not even here yet at least according to the Gregorian Calendar, it's gonna be hot, it's gonna be long and it's gonna be rough. 

Summertime and I have never really jived which is much to my chagrin considering most people thrive in the summer and enjoy the leisure lifestyle  of the beach or camping up in the mountains. 

Maybe the 12 Summers I spent in Phoenix ruined the season for me or perhaps even further back, the long August days and nights in New York where central air conditioning had still not been invented yet and you were forced to sweat it out sandwiched between cotton sheets. 

Springtime...I'll miss you and from what I saw this year, you and I will get along just fine here in Salt Lake. 

Summertime...go easy on me man...go easy on us all as pretty much the Western third of the U.S. is experiencing the longest and worst drought conditions ever thanks to your ultraviolet rays and scarce precipitation. 

I'd say you suck and throw more derogatory names at you but I'm sure you would simply come back at me with a 115 degree heat wave. 

Summertime you win...I yield to your will and ask for mercy or at least a drenching thunderstorm.

--->Fire is a beneficial part of many ecosystems, but in recent decades more and more people have moved into the wildland-urban interface, setting the stage for more ‚Äúproblem fires‚Äù that affect the places where many Utahns live, work, and play. We have some choice in how or when wildfires occur, but it‚Äôs counterproductive to remove all fire from the landscape. Adjusting our perception of fire as a natural and necessary tool rather than purely as a threat can help us better manage our landscapes and future fires.<---

Here in the UK we might not be facing a desert but with the combination of an increased population and climate change water companies throughout the UK are predicting a deficit of water in the coming 25 years.*

Below are some water saving suggestions. 

1. If you are lucky enough to have a garden, don‚Äôt use the sprinkler, half and hour of sprinkler use is equivalent to the water use of an average family of 4 in a day. 

2. Reducing your shower time by one minute will save 10 litres of water per wash. 

3. Running a tap can use 6 litres of water a minute - turn it off if you are not using it. 

4. If you have a dual flush loo, using the smaller flush were you can will save 2 litres per flush

5. Change to using water saving products such as a shampoo bar !

* Thames water predicts a deficit of 350 million lites of water a day by 2045 if no action is taken.

Every day we use litres and litres of water without ever reflecting on how much is wasted on futile and unnecessary uses.

Learning to use water correctly is not just a question of economics, but of caring for the planet.

Every day we must do those little things that can save us money: turn off the taps when brushing our teeth, prefer showers to baths and always run washing machines and dishwashers with a full load.

Small steps for a more sustainable future!

This segment was on the state of water in California, big ag, and almonds!  Almond farming takes 80% of the potable water in California, and supplies about the same percentage of the world‚Äôs almond supply. However, almonds ARE grown in other places that HAVE adequate rainfall.

Residents are getting restrictions while almond farming mega corporations, along with Nestle and Coke are stealing the water that is owned by the residents of California, putting it in plastic bottles and selling it back to the residents at an incredible profit. 

Look how much water it takes to grow a pound of strawberries as compared to a pound of almonds.

California is burning while almond growers are continuing to get rich, rape the land, and use tons of pesticides in the process.

Maher says if Coal miners are being forced to retrain into other jobs that won‚Äôt kill people, so can almond farmers be. 

I agree. 

I haven‚Äôt bought almonds in years, but I admit to buying almond butter whenever I see it on sale.  It is anti-inflammatory, and a main ingredient in some of my best selling fermented snacks, but I will no longer buy it from California.  There are other things that are anti-inflammatory and don‚Äôt take such a heavy toll on the the ecosystem.

KNOW BETTER. DO BETTER.

At least 33 wildfires are blazing across ten states even before the start of summer.

With the Ministry of #Agriculture declaring emergencies in over 50 municipalities, the toll is clear, yet the meteorological factors behind the megadrought remain shrouded in mystery. 

So with a little help from luxury watchmaker rolex, insidenatgeo teamed up with Chile‚Äôs Ministry of Public Works on a mission to install a weather station on the highest mountain in the #Andes: the dormant Tupungato Volcano. 

Based on their experience launching similar projects on Mount Everest, the team knew the #weather station had to be durable enough to withstand high winds, but light enough to be carried up the mountain and assembled on site. Deep snow and pandemic protocols presented logistical challenges, but the team pulled it off.

Now it‚Äôs all about collecting #data‚Äîgetting near-real-time reads on temperature, humidity, moisture, barometric pressure and solar radiation. As it‚Äôs collected, data will be transmitted to monitoring facilities, with researchers and Chilean officials aiming to collect data over multiple seasons to understand how glaciers and the snow in water towers like Tupungato respond to #climatechange. And that info, in turn, will help improve forecasting models.

The ultimate goal? ‚ÄúSupport and elevate solutions that can help restore balance to our ecosystems,‚Äù said Nicole Alexiev, vice president, #science and #innovation, National Geographic Society.

drought
/drout/
noun
1. a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water.

South Florida is in a drought. I‚Äôm not sure when it rained last but our ponds are drying up and now have ‚Äúsandbars‚Äù in them. The birds are enjoying the much easier pickings but man can we use some rain.

Good news, rain is in the forecast starting Monday!  Rainy season is here.

In October of 2017 I was hunting near Collins Lake after a major fire in the area. I pulled off the highway near the access point parking lot to one of the wildlife areas. I noticed this burned up remains of a fawn/yearling. This was within 10 to 20 yards of the paved Marysville road. This was the first time I had seen the remains of a deer that obviously had been killed by the wildfire. Many people think wildlife can just sense the fire and outrun it to a safe area. This was a really fast moving fire and obviously the fawn couldn't outrun it.

It is almost June, but dozens of wells in Orland are already dried up, leaving many without water.üí¶

ORLAND, Calif.¬†- Many across Orland are asking one thing: where‚Äôs the water?
For one long-time farming family, they haven‚Äôt seen water levels this low in years.

üëâ‚ÄúOur tank is empty,‚Äù Staci Buttermore said. ‚ÄúAbsolutely done. We are now hauling water.‚Äù
But they are not alone.
Dozens in the area are experiencing the same problem: little to no water.
And many of them are afraid to even turn on their pumps, worrying they might burn them out.
As a result, many people are grabbing water from others, but they don‚Äôt know when that will run out either.
This means no water for showers, no water to drink, but most importantly, no water for the animals and the crop.
Besides being in a drought, Action News Now asked the Buttermore family about why they think this happened this year.üì∞
‚ÄúIt just really caught up with us,‚Äù Kassidi Buttermore explained. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have anything in the reservoirs, and we haven‚Äôt had good recharge for the ground water for each individual piece of property. It was a perfect storm in a way.‚Äùüò≥
And farmers are just hoping to bring more attention to a bigger issue.
‚ÄúI hope people don‚Äôt just think everybody is out for their own pocketbook,‚Äù Staci said. ‚ÄúPeople need to come to the table like adults. We need to have people tell both sides of the story but this state needs storage. I think there are ways parties can come together and keep our state sustainable and hopefully not a dust bowl.‚Äù
Well companies are saying they can‚Äôt come out to drill for months, leaving many not knowing when they will get water again.
üöúFarmers were also saying they are worried the lower levels of water will drive the cost of food up and bring employment in the agriculture industry down.

Photos by Pete McBride pedromcbride / Shortage: Lake Mead, the largest US reservoir, just saw its water level fall below 1075 feet (37% of full capacity) ‚Äî a marker it has only dropped below a couple times since the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s. In the past, the lake recovered quickly after hitting that line. But now, thanks to ongoing drought and hotter and drier weather patterns, it is predicted to keep dropping through 2022, with few signs of recovery ‚Äî triggering the first-ever water shortage declaration on the Colorado River. Years ago, I followed the river source to sea for a book about this over-loved, over-allocated lifeline and was shocked to see the river run dry before reaching the sea. It was a stark reminder of what happens when we ask too much of limited resources: They disappear. Today, this water supply continues to shrink, and yet we keep asking it to provide more.

Separated by a fence, you can see an abundance of grass on the left, compared to a wall of invasive bush species on the right.
 
‚ÄúBush encroachment was a serious problem on our farm. After moving here, we used herbicides on three thousand hectares and are still dealing with the repercussions more than 30 years later. Believe me when I say it‚Äôs a mistake I will never make again. All biodiversity and valuable palatable grasses were replaced by the invasive sickle bush. Now we are left with a total imbalance in biodiversity,‚Äù Koos says.

Dichrostachys cinerea, or more commonly known as ‚Äòsickle bush‚Äô, is a thorny shrub and invasive bush species. It is known for its ability to regenerate from seeds and root buds that result in bush encroachment.
Learning from mistakes made many decades ago, the Briedenhann‚Äôs decided to deal with bush thickening on their farm by removing the matured bushes, utilising the younger bush, and keeping all the big trees for shading, which is especially important in  sunny Namibia.

Farmers' organizations together with the government provide the training. They encourage local communities, particularly women‚Äôs self-help groups, to take up new farming practices that transform the land. The practices make farmers more resilient and able to fight climate change. Only when we invest in green recovery, we can build a sustainable future.

By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl* ever was (Cook et al., 2014). The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China (Romm, 2015). Meaning, the suppliers of much of the world‚Äôs food will not be reliable sources anymore.

Drought and crops go hand in hand. The basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent (Battisti and Naylor, 2009). Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them (Wallace-Wells, 2017).

Theoretically, the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature. But the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature ‚Äî meaning even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity (Battisti and Naylor, 2009).

It is not as easy as simply moving croplands north. Yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there (Wallace-Wells, 2017). It takes about 1,000 years for three centimeters of topsoil to form (FAO, 2019). As professor David Battisti said: ‚ÄúPretty much all the arable land worth farming is already being farmed, so I‚Äôm not sure you can say where to go.‚Äù (Wallace-Wells, 2017)

Each year's global celebration has a unique, novel emphasis that had not been developed previously.This day was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on January 30, 1995, after the day when United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification is drafted. This year's theme is ""Restoration, land and recovery. We build back better with healthy land."" Salanization and desertification of land is happening in India like in Punjab due to over use of water as the excess water tends to bring out the natural salts in the soil to come out to form a layer of salt which prevents the plants grow this making the land barren. Desertification also happens due to excessive deforestation which reduces the humus of the soil and thus leads to decreased fertility of the soil. Agro forestry is the best solution to counter desertification and to protect quality of the soil.

Las inundaciones rel√°mpago o ‚ÄúFlash flood‚Äù (como se conocen en muchos pa√≠ses incluso de habla no inglesa) son inundaciones que ocurren poco despu√©s de una lluvia muy intensa en la cuenca de un r√≠o, rambla o torrente, lo cual significa que el gran aumento de caudal tiene efecto casi inmediatamente despu√©s de esa lluvia muy intensa.

Este fen√≥meno ha ocurrido esta tarde en Palacios sobre las 15:00h cuando tras una intensa tormenta de rayos, granizo y lluvia se han desbordado alcantarillas y se han levantado las tapas de las arquetas en muchos sitios del pueblo. 

Tan pronto como ha ocurrido la descarga de lluvia, se han cubierto varias calles de agua y a los pocos minutos ha vuelto a bajar el nivel e incluso ha terminado el d√≠a soleado de 18:00h de la tarde hasta la puesta de Sol sobre las 22:00 de la noche.

Llevamos una semana de sol y tormentas de verano bastante curiosa.

Las sorprendentes fotograf√≠as son de David Mungu√≠a (davidmunguia7 ) ¬°Muchas gracias por hacerlas porque al poco ya no quedaba agua! ü§ó

It‚Äôs pretty simple to identify when your car‚Äôs wiper blades are past their prime because the signs are hard to ignore. The wipers make scraping noises. They leave streaks on the windshield. Or the rubber on the blades has obvious signs of fraying and cracking.

However, even after noticing these wiper blade problems, many drivers avoid replacing them. Typical wiper blades should be replaced once or twice a year, based on the following factors:

Weather- Extremely sunny conditions can wear down rubber and cause it to crack. Freezing winter temperatures can also age wiper blades, so in cold regions it‚Äôs wise to replace blades in late fall and early spring.
Blade material- Rubber wiper blades are usually the cheapest, but they also wear out fastest. Blades made from stronger materials, such as silicone or halogen-hardened rubber, may last over a year.
Anytime you replace your wiper blades, replace all of them, including rear wiper blades if your car has them. A windshield professional can recommend an optimal blade for your car and install it for you if needed. #rainyday  #flashflood #wipers #wipeitdownchallenge #wiperblades #autorepair #mechanic #staysafe",English

Incessant rain results in multiple landslides & flash floods in districts of Manang & Sindhupalchowk. 

Seven bodies were recovered today by the Nepali Army from Sindhupalchwok. Rescue & search operations continue for dozens missing in the affected areas. 

As the second wave of #COVID_19 continue to hit the rural areas, the early monsoon flash floods have added to the distress.

It was a normal, warm an sunny September day. Suddenly darker clouds started to form and within a short time a heavy thunderstorm came down on us. Luckily we had already fled to the car since the water masses that came down were immense. 
Since the dry desert soil can't take up much water, waterfalls formed all over the flanks of the Zion Valley. Even the streets transformed into streams. It was definitely an experience and we were even rewarded with a double rainbow at the end. 
Anyway, this image was taken about 1-2 hours after. This normally is a small calm creek that you can easily walk through.

As Tropical Depression Claudette travels over the US coastal states on early Sunday, forecasters warned of severe flash flooding in parts of the deep South, especially across central Alabama. These rapidly changing conditions emerged since Claudette began to batter parts of Georgia and the Carolinas early Sunday.

And it appears we could be in for more! The National Weather Service is forecasting a decent chance of thunderstorms for the coming week. 
This photo was taken at the bridge that crosses Tornillo Creek on the road to Rio Grande Village. This normally dry wash was roaring with water after only 1 inch of rainfall. 

Dirt roads, as well as paved roads that cross low drainages, can become impassable after seemingly insignificant amounts of rain. Narrow canyons can quickly flood with water and trap unsuspecting hikers. When visiting the park this time of year, it is important to pay attention to the weather and be prepared to change your plans if storms are in the area. 
Just because it's not raining on your head doesn't mean it isn't raining somewhere upstream from you!

Mesmerizing, isn‚Äôt it? But very dangerous. This amount of water can easily knock someone off their feet, or float a car off the road. It only takes 6‚Äù of flowing water to sweep a car off the pavement.

HQ Staffer Jamie Verzwyvelt took this slo-motion video after the storm at Devil‚Äôs Waterhole

The park received around 2 inches of rain in about an hour!

Many low-lying sections of trails may be underwater, and the rocks are very slippery when wet, so today may be more of a relax-at-camp day, than exploring the hiking trails.

Stay safe and Turn Around, Don‚Äôt Drown!

Although it may not seem like much even a few inches of water can cause serious damage; resulting in thousands of dollars in repair and restoration costs. Homeowners insurance does not cover floods. Purchasing a flood insurance policy through Strong Tie Insurance can protect you.

My first report in 3rd grade was all about the Pueblo flood of 1921. I remember researching and reading through some picture books at the library. One of the books said that after the flood people began to use motorized vehicles and horses were no longer used. 

I took that to mean that horses went extinct...

So yesterday and today my Dad reminded me of this monumental occasion ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

They are NOT re-flooding the streets and horses can still be found ü§£

This week has been chaos with our Town Bridge also sagging & being closed. My partner got stuck on the town side & could'nt get home on Tuesday frm work. Trucks could'nt get through to bring supplies. Work was crazy (I'm a Baker) Tinwald ran out of Bread since there was no trucks so we had to make crazy amounts of stuff.
I read Mt SomersüåÑWhere I always go is also closed & those tracks badly damaged aswell as the access roadüòî

1.) Consider increasing your hurricane and all other claim deductibles 
2.) Maintain a good credit score
3.) Consider a central station fire & burglar alarm as this can sometimes reduce your premium by 10%
4.) Speak to an independent insurance agency as they will have more options with several insurance carriers 

South Shore Insurance is an independent agency and we have many contracts with insurance companies based in Florida and all over the country. 

Call us today to see how we can cut your insurance premium cost!

RutgersU developed a guide, Resilience Planning for Water-Dependent Uses and Working Waterfronts, which walks users through different ways to identify water-dependent businesses, define coastal hazards, and assess exposure to coastal flooding for those businesses. The guide advises communities to use our Economics: National Ocean Watch (ENOW) Explorer tool to help them better understand their water-dependent uses and the Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper as one option to assess the exposure of these assets to coastal flooding. These can be used by communities in planning processes to improve resilience to flood hazards.

International research team have concluded that increases in¬†extreme rainfall¬†and associated flooding are projected to continue as¬†global temperatures¬†continue to rise. Efforts to limit warming to +1.5C will help limit changes in extreme rainfall, though some societal adaptations will still be required.

They found that in small and in urban catchments in many parts of the world extreme rainfall has increased the chance of floods occurring and their magnitude, severely impacting local populations and infrastructure. In larger, rural catchments floods depend on many different factors and flooding is less directly linked with¬†extreme rainfall events.

The study shows that human activity has an impact on increases in extreme daily rainfall, increasing the likelihood of some significant events.

The findings show that the risk of flash flooding on¬†urban areas¬†has likely increased in recent decades, due to the expanding impermeable landscape increasing surface runoff, and increased extreme rainfall, while increases are projected to continue

And BOY has that been tested through the past two days! Our little valley was one of the areas hit by storms and freakish floods, leaving us without power or phones/internet from Wed night til just hours ago. My impeccably timed flat tyre meant I was also without a car. 

Our tireless emergency services have worked their butts off to keep everyone safe while Ausnet worked at restoring power. Hugest thanks to them all üôèüèºAnyone else finding themselves kissing light switches this morning? Just me? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Old Sue would‚Äôve been panicked, anxious and fearful but through the work I‚Äôve been doing, supported by nature, it was so much easier to surrender and trust. Uncomfortable in moments but not anxiety ridden - there‚Äôs a big difference. 

I hope everyone affected is safe and warm and power is returned soon. Good excuse to restock those candles now üòâ

Artist and director #ChrisCunningham also worked closely with the band to create artwork for the album, as well as a forthcoming documentary - nutsack monster was not included.

""I don't know if this is TMI or something,"" Wayman told the Guide, ""but if you really fall into music while you're playing, it's the same space as when you are with a lover. You can see guitar players in the way that they're playing that they're in some ecstatic moment and it could equally be a sexual moment where they're alone with someone. So if I were to actually put it all into a pot and think about it, playing music can take you closer to that same kind of state of ecstacy as an orgasm. Sometimes that can be very alarming if you're onstage.""",English

It literally looks like good old-fashioned camping. 

Some dude yelled at me and Joe as we were passing by and said give me your bike. We just kept going. Didnt want to have break him off some and dish him out some broken bones lol.

It was the deadliest U.S. disaster to date. Bodies were found as far away as Cincinnati. It caused $17 million of damage (about $490 million in 2020 dollars).

Wealthy industrialists, like Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick owned and patronized the resort. They had built cottages and a clubhouse and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, an exclusive and private mountain retreat. They had also lowered the dam to build a road across it and installed a fish screen in the spillway that tended to trap debris. Investigators believe these alterations contributed to the disaster. Yet none of the members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club were found guilty of any crimes. Furthermore, survivors repeatedly lost court cases in their attempts to recover damages due to the club members‚Äô wealth and expensive legal team. However, public outrage did prompt changes in American law leading to one of strict liability in future cases.

You may have heard the term LPWAN before, and you may be wondering: what is LPWAN, and what is its role in IoT?
In short, LPWAN stands for low-power, wide-area network.

It is a type of wireless telecommunication wide area network designed to allow long-range communication at a low bit rate among connected objects, such as sensors -- just like ours!

With the recent price increase of cryptocurrencies, scammers are always looking to do a quick buck, and they have been successful in Spain. One of the biggest scams reported is the one associated with a company named Algorithms Group, which scammed more than 280 million euros from 300+ investors.

The brain behind this scam is a man called Javier Biosca, who acted as a broker buying and selling cryptocurrencies and offering weekly interests of 25% per investment. However, the business went sour quickly and Biosca disappeared with the money of investors. Emilia Zaballos, the lawyer that is representing private investors, states the scam could have affected 4,000 people.

Thank you for trusting our team for protecting your property.

Just one inch of flood water can cause more than $25,000 in damage to your home. Flood insurance is a small price to pay for peace of mind. Learn more about why flood insurance is a good value for your home or business.

Just one inch of flood water can cause more than $25,000 in damage to your home. But most homeowners and renters insurance does not cover flooding. Only flood insurance helps you protect your home and savings.

For the past four years, hurricanes have caused above-average flooding. This year, we expect more of the same. Protect your home or business from unexpected flood damage with flood insurance from the Behar Insurance.

The #weather department has predicted moderate rain or thundershowers in the country's financial capital and surrounding suburbs, with the possibility of heavy, or very heavy, rain, in some places.

Mumbai's #Colaba observatory recorded 77 mm of rain in a 24-hour period ending 8.30 am. Around 60 mm of rain was recorded in #Santacruz in the same period.

According to the #Brihanmumbai #Municipal Corporation, Mumbai and its eastern and western suburbs recorded 48.49 mm, 66.99 mm and 48.99 mm rain, respectively, in 24 hours ending 8 am.

Just one inch of flood water can cause more than $25,000 in damage to your home. But most homeowners and renters insurance does not cover flooding. Only flood insurance helps you protect your home and savings.

For the past four years, hurricanes have caused above-average flooding. This year, we expect more of the same. Protect your home or business from unexpected flood damage with flood insurance from the Behar Insurance.

newsroomgy

The Civil Defence Commission (CDC) is re-emphasizing the responsibility of Neighbourhood Democratic Councils, Community Development Councils, Village Councils and Regional Democratic Councils in conducting assessments and reporting and providing support to residents affected by floods and other natural hazards.

Continuous flooding in communities across Guyana has reinforced the need for these bodies to utilise the training and plans provided by the CDC over the years.

The CDC, with support from the UNDP and IDB was able to improve the National Disaster Risk Management System (DRM) which has the Regional Disaster Risk Management Systems as critical components. This allowed each region to develop its own DRM system in keeping with the wider national mechanism. Plans and systems have been developed and implemented in all ten administrative regions.

There are several things that you can do to prevent major flooding damage from happening so that you do not have to contact a water damage professional. However, sometimes hiring a water damage restoration team can help you determine if there is, in fact, any unseen damage that could have occurred during a water event.

As far as prevention goes, here are a few tips:

Start at the source! If you are building a home in an area prone to flooding, use flood-resistant materials. FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have published lists of flood-resistant materials that can be used. Keep in mind that even flood-resistant materials can become damaged, the damage is usually cosmetic and can be repaired quickly. Flood-resistant materials limit the extent of the damage.

Build at a higher elevation. 

Homes that are built with the bottom floor above flood level are obviously much less likely to experience flood damage.
If you are in an area prone to flooding, levees and floodwalls are good barriers to prevent flooding inside the home. Sealing off areas where water can get into the home is helpful too.

Properly grate your property so that water will drain away from your walls. This is especially helpful if you have a basement as basements are prone to flood damage.

Clear your storm drains.

Keep leaves and debris cleared out of storm drains and gutters. Clogged gutters and storm drains will cause water from heavy rains to puddle. This can cause damage to the outside of your property and let water inside, causing floods.

Check your pipes. 

Pipes that are not properly insulated in the winter or do not receive proper maintenance can become major causes of property damage. Frozen pipes often expand and burst, causing horrendous water damage, and old pipes break open creating more flooding issues.

Sunday, June 6, 2021

‚Ä¢ Current water levels are down from where they were at this time of the year in 2020, 2019 or even 2018, but are still well above average.

‚Ä¢ There is a risk of flooding and shoreline damage along the shorelines of Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair

‚Ä¢ Sustained wind speeds above moderate can create waves that cause flooding, erosion, and shoreline damage.

‚Ä¢ Risk of erosion and damage to shoreline protection works, including erosion along the high bluffs.

When I opened it up and noticed the card was wet. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Just thought it was moisture or something. When I got home, I saw I had over 2000 pictures on my card. After scrolling through the pictures, I thought for sure my camera was ruined, because all the pictures looked the same. Then all of sudden I see why. Haha. My muddyoutdoorsofficial game camera was fully submerged underwater for a couple of days. Keep in mind, my camera is 5 ft off the ground. The camera still worked and took pictures underwater. And when the water receded, it still took pictures of wildlife. You can see that the camera is still working because it took a picture of me walking up to it. I powered it off, changed cards and turned it back on, and it turned on just fine. I‚Äôve had this camera for close to a year & a half with no problems at all. So I‚Äôll see how long it will last after this.

- Non-damaging - but costly: these leaks are inconvenient, but don't cause significant damage to you home. They will cost you more time, energy and money to fix.
- Minimal damage - but will worsen over time: if left unattended to, these will result in more significant damage in the future. They often go unnoticed.
- Significant damage - home is being destroyed - act now: hopefully, you won't be in this category! Easy to identify, as your home is being flooded with water.

Many people have been forced to evacuate their homes and businesses, due to rising water levels and wild species. For example, large Anacondas are found in people's homes and public spaces just outside of Georgetown, Guyana.

The globalpaintforcharity is currently working in partnership with the US Army and other humanitarian organizations to deploy disaster assistance to the victims in #Guyana, #Venezuela, #Honduras, El #Salvador and #Guatemala. 

We hope to soon have additional information, on how best to support the victims in the region. But help is needed, this is a great opportunity to show your support and contributions. 
Please visit www.globalpaints.org/emergency-relief to help us assist families in underserved communities. Our team begins to join efforts and provide brief support and safety but more help is needed.
Thank you so much for your continued support and contributions.

Both things that are incredibly important, especially with the recent flooding we have faced here in the North. I also spoke about privilege and how the government and politicians need to take action. At the end of the event we had two Warrington MP's speak and unsurprisingly they were both disappointing. One said many words without really offering anything other than empty promises and the other made the crisis the responsibility of the general public to fix. I am a strong believer in individual action but me walking more is not going to solve the crisis. The Government taking strong and immediate action could. For reasons I spoke about in my speech I have a level of privilege when it comes to the climate crisis and climate action and therefore I feel I have a duty to take action. But at the same time, I am a teenage student that should not have to spend time writing speeches and organising and attending protests and events to highlight the importance of and demand climate action. The evidence has been there for years, the science has been there for years, the means to solve it has been there for years, but sadly so has our incompetent Governments. I've said it before and I will continue to say it until the people of this planet and this country get what we deserve. We need and deserve climate action. Young people deserve a future. World leaders must do better.

Thank you so much to ceewarrington for having me speak!

-Watch for disaster declarations in the coming days and weeks. If the president proclaims a disaster in your area, FEMA will step in and you may be able to get help rebuilding and replacing property lost in the flood.

Then to top it off we had a small flood in this mudroom and spent time pulling up the LVP flooring and the pad so it could dry out. Luckily no damage came to the subfloor, just a few spots that got wet and we are using this 100¬∞ weather and box fans to dry it out! 
If you watched my stories over the weekend, I shared the great thing about this type of flooring when this happens. So it was quick work to get it pulled out. We did end up cutting it in the doorway and we now have to place a transition piece there. 
We had to pull all baseboards, door trim and move all the heavy freezers, washer&dryer, sink, and the water heater out to get to the flooring but hey, we did it. 
If you were here during our remodel, it kinda looks like we haven't done anything in this room. ü§¶ Back to square one!!

At the time, Las Conchas was the largest fire in New Mexico‚Äôs recorded history. 

Here in New Mexico‚Äîand across the West‚Äîwildfire season is getting longer. Wildfires, bigger. And these trends will continue in our warming world. Between 1970 and 2020, New Mexico‚Äôs average annual temperature has risen by 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit‚Äîand forecasts show we‚Äôre in for more and more warming into the future. 

But wildfires aren‚Äôt the only problem spurred by rising temperatures and drought, which have even more impacts on our forests, including insect infestations. 

On this month‚Äôs episode of Our Land, we look at how climate change is altering New Mexico‚Äôs forests. And what the future holds.

It‚Äôs also important to inspect your properties for potential safety hazards, such as patio furniture not secured, weakened fence boards, or tree branches. Take stock of everything within your home, as well, taking photos or videos to create an ‚Äòinventory‚Äô just in case your property becomes damaged. ‚ÄúPeople should also do a full walk-through of their home and make a video or take photos, understand that flood insurance is different than their insurance, and understand that extra coverage is needed when going up against wind and hail.‚Äù

We are in the middle of a pole shift...

Countless wildlife have already perished because of the electromagnetic anomalies sweeping our skies and oceans...

Birds falling out of the sky in flocks...creatures of the sea beaching themselves for no apparent reason...

I know what is happening...

And so do the elite...

All of this nwo agenda stuff is related to the earth changes that are happening that are beyond our control....

They know crops are failing....they know cold and famine and war are coming...

And they have been preparing to survive underground in their luxury bunkers...

That leaves the protection of the People to us...warriors...

The coasts will be hit the worst...

Get away from major cities...

Sinkholes and earthquakes will be become more rampant...

As volcanic activity across the planet has already dramatically increased...

The signs in the heavens have been many and only the blind cannot see what is at hand...

The Ancients left warnings in stone megaliths that would stand the test of time for a reason...

Our solar system bares the asteroid belts from destroyed planets for a reason...

This knowledge is in your blood no matter how much you try to deny it...

Your ancestors survived the last time this thing came around and so can you...

Trust your intuition...

Gather your tribe...

And you if want to be apart of mine just slide on into my dms...

Most of the 5d people are content dying and ascending or whatever and that's cool...

But that's not me. 

I was born to rebuild the cult of Neith...

The flood situation in Region Nine (Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo) still remains a concern with at least 26,000 people affected.

During a telephone interview with the News Room on Thursday, Regional Chairman, Bryan Allicock, said that the water level has not subsided but would fluctuate; the flooding is also exacerbated by the water flowing from the Amazon River in Brazil and the recent heavy rainfall.

The ongoing nationwide flooding has impacted the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in several regions, and the health authorities in the town of Bartica, Region Seven (Cuyuni- Mazaruni) have begun a house-to-house vaccination campaign, according to Health Minister, Dr. Frank Anthony.

During his daily COVID-19 update on Thursday, Dr. Anthony related that healthcare workers have been persistent in their efforts to get people vaccinated with one of the three COVID-19 vaccines that are used in the COVID-19 immunisation campaign, despite severe flooding in some regions.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts. Some re-strengthening is expected by late today, and #Claudette is expected to become a #tropicalstorm again on Monday over eastern #NorthCarolina. Further strengthening is possible over the western #AtlanticOcean through early Tuesday, then become a post-#tropicalcyclone by late Tuesday.

Claudette is expected to produce additional #rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches across #Alabama, the #FloridaPanhandle, northern and central #Georgia, and Upstate #SouthCarolina through the morning hours. As the system tracks north and east, bands of #heavyrain will occur across portions of central and southern Georgia, central and coastal South Carolina into eastern North Carolina through Monday morning resulting in rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. Considerable flash, urban and small stream #flooding impacts, as well as new and renewed minor to isolated moderate river flooding are possible across these areas. 

The combination of #stormsurge and the #tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.

At the end of March, we basically had a flood upstairs that overflowed into the downstairs. 

Last weekend, the ceiling in the kitchen revealed a leak from the other bathroom upstairs. 

Yesterday, I filed a third insurance claim because my roof has severe damage and needs to be replaced. 

Over the last 4 years, as I‚Äôve remodeled, invested, and made this house my dream home, I‚Äôve told myself over and over again, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just stuff & you can‚Äôt take it with you.‚Äù My goal has been to keep my heart appropriately detached from these earthy things. I asked myself, ‚ÄúLauren, what if you lost it all? What if you had to sell it all? What if‚Ä¶‚Äù 

By God‚Äôs grace, I think I‚Äôve endured enough suffering at this point in life to know my priorities. Therefore, when all of this went down, I lost my junk for a short bit like any normal human would, but I quickly went back to that place in my heart & mind I‚Äôd carefully kept about my home. 

My plants are happily placed in my #wetroom , the dog is at the trainer‚Äôs, the kids are with their dad, and I packed allll of my necessities into my van. 

They‚Äôll be repairing everything over the next 2-3 weeks, and, though I may grow weary of it all, I‚Äôm sure, for now, I‚Äôm open-handed, light-hearted, and peace-minded. Praise Jesus. 

Also, happy Father‚Äôs Day to my amazing dad who was my first-responder the night it all began. He‚Äôs also the person who‚Äôs taught me to have less stuff and live more life. I love him for that and more! üíôüíôüíô",English

newsroomgy

President Irfaan Ali was shocked at the lackadaisical approach by some pump attendants when he assessed several drainage pumps in and outside of Georgetown on Sunday night.

During the late-night inspection, the Head of State discovered that the pumps at Riverview were off, the koker doors were closed and the worker was asleep.

‚ÄúThis is what we are talking about, I came out here myself to verify tonight. The main pump to drain the city is turned off.¬† Up to today, we said that the pumps need to be on 24 hours‚Ä¶While we have to deal with the heavy rainfall we have to deal decisively with the irresponsibility and negligence,‚Äù he said.

On May 27-28, 2021; Reading Fire Department hosted a Water Rescue & Emergency Response (Ops Level) training session. This training session was part of the Reading Fire Academy Recruit Class. WhiteCap Water Rescue Training Staff Instructors, Todd Stahl, Mike Kiefer and Ken McCardell presented this training session. Steve Ginder provided Safety & Support for this training. 

This 16-hour course includes many valuable Swiftwater Rescue techniques. The course provides the base on which all other PA Fish & Boat Commission courses are built. Using both classroom, indoor pool and practical hands-on training, Water Rescue & Emergency Response covers planning, medical considerations, rescue equipment, self-rescue and shore-based rescue techniques. This course meets or exceeds NFPA 1670 Operations Level Guidelines.

The lecture part of the training was held at the berks County Fire Training Center, with the indoor pool sessions taking place at Governor Mifflin Intermediate School. The moving water session of the training was held on the Schuylkill River, at Kelly‚Äôs Lock. Jason Batz, Lieutenant Reading Fire Department scheduled and coordinated this training.

Twelve Fire Academy Recruits in attendance, successfully completed the indoor pool session, passed their written and practical exams for WRER. All students were properly outfitted and inspected their gear prior to arriving at the site. Upon starting the training, the students performed a site assessment and identified all hazards, shoreline conditions and water dynamics. A fantastic job by all! This group of recruits were young, energized and self-motivated.

Reading Fire Department provides Fire/Rescue, Fire Safety Education and Medical Services to the residents of Reading City and neighboring municipalities. 

Thank you to the City of Reading for choosing WhiteCap Water Rescue Training for all your Equipment and Training needs. It has been a pleasure to work with Lieutenant Batz and the Reading Fire Department. We look forward to working with your team in the future. readingfirelocal1640

Cyclone Yaas swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday, triggering storm surges that broke through embankments in West Bengal state, mainly hitting the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans delta that stretches into neighbouring Bangladesh.

The storm has left more than 150,000 people homeless in eastern India and Bangladesh.
With climate change pushing up sea surface temperatures, the cyclonic storms that barrel in from the Bay of Bengal have become more aggressive and frequent, particularly in the last decade, according to researchers.

300 homes had to be evacuated overnight in the province of Canterbury in the country's South Island as this area seems to be the worst hit.

Authorities declared a state of emergency after some places received as much as 40 centimetres (16 inches) of rain over the weekend and on May 31.

The military helped evacuate more than 50 people including several who were airlifted to safety by helicopter.

We have an easy solution for you! 

Downspouts play a key role in diverting precipitation away from your property. Functional downspouts are essential in protecting your property from water damage.

A typical winter problem that affects downspouts is ice accumulation. This happens when there are obstructions in the gutters that slow down the water flow or if the downspout's mouth is blocked by heavy snowfall. 

It is essential to detach the flex spout extensions around all of your downspouts during the winter months. It is common for water to freeze inside the flex, which can cause further damage to the downspouts. If left untreated, this will result in water seepage inside your home.

The year 2020 witnessed the Amphan storm which resulted in major losses in agriculture as well as fisheries and yet again this year's Yass has lead to further losses including devastation of multiple homes in most of the southern districts of Bengal.

These cyclonic storms are but common in these areas , people here experience these almost every year like Aila (2009),Bulbul (2019),etc.

The affects of such storms bring about major changes in the macroenvironments of marine organisms including fishes and thus are directly or indirectly related to their behavioral issues most importantly breeding & mobility .

Climatological studies state the increasing number of storms is due to rising water temperatures that also affect the fish health. It also tends to intensify the cyclonic storms thus increasing risks for the lives of peeople in these regions.

The ‚ÄòShataph‚Äô series are based on the motif of rivers. They are not representations of any specific place although the small waterways which criss cross the landscape around my studio inform and colour my imagination. 

The title has its origins in the Hebrew word ‚ÄòShataph‚Äô meaning river or flood, I like the ambiguity of that, a river contains and directs water whilst a flood meanders according to its will. Cities and settlements have dwelt around rivers in every culture. They are a source of food and the origins of many of our myths. Even in our great cities a walk by the river can bring solace to the weary. In navigation rivers are a guide to the lost and natural boundary between ecosystems and cultures. 

Shataph can also mean to overflow, rinse or wash off, suggesting that the river also has the power for renewal and transformation. 

Thank you to everyone who has bought work and supported me with ASP.

On Friday, June 3rd, 1921, a cloud burst brought torrential rain that swept down the Arkansas River damaging much of the town. The next day more rain came with an even bigger surge that put parts of Pueblo under 17 feet of water. By Sunday, the dam and levee on Beaver Creek, near Florence, burst causing a third surge of water through the town.

Official deaths were counted in the 100-200 person range, but it is estimated that 1500 people perished, as many disappeared, likely swept away and buried by the flood waters and mud. 

One of the hardest hit areas was near the Pueblo Union Station, where the railyards were left in a tangled mess. At the time of one of the surges, a few trains were loaded with passengers as the cars were swept downstream. There are debates in the newspapers from the time, if passengers were able to escape or not. And, if they escaped the car, were they just swept downstream to their deaths. 

Compounding the flood waters, several fires broke out. A lumber yard caught fire, and burning wood was swept downstream which caused fires to many other buildings and homes. The fire department could not help due to the height of the flood.

A year later, it was estimated the floods caused over $20 million in damages ($300 million in todays dollars). A few newspapers compared the destruction of Pueblo to the destruction of San Francisco from the earthquake of 1906.

Over the last year North Korea‚Äôs main agricultural has been badly affected by extreme weather conditions.Hurricane,drought & flood¬†caused massive grain destruction,disrupting the whole agriculture system.
The closing down of borders during the pandemic was also one of the major factors‚Äô. The prevention of exports & imports of food items,fertilisers,agriculture & machinery goods led to scarcity & shortages.
According to World Food Programme & North Korea the population is starving to death. Around 3.5 million died in four years time due to economic & environmental disaster -series of droughts, cyclones ,tropical storms, famine & lack of international support from the traditional allies, specifically Russia.

Every year 5th June is celebrated as World Environment day, which emphasizes the importance of environment conservation. This year's theme for world environment day is ""Ecosystem Restoration"". It can be achieved in many ways like protecting rare species & animals, planting trees, cleaning the rivers, controlling the pollution, and so on.
We all know the importance of the environment in our life. In the last few centuries, the rapid increase in pollution and the decline in ecosystem and biodiversity have disturbed the balance of nature and led to disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and epidemics. Let's stop harming nature and make planet Earth a healthier, greener, and happier place to live.

Tips to Prevent Heat-Related Illness

* Stay hydrated throughout the day by drinking more water than usual. Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre thirsty to drink. Avoid alcohol, caffeine and liquids with large amounts of sugar.
* Schedule outdoor activities for early in the morning or later in the evening. Minimize or avoid physical exertion.
* Pace your activity. Start activities slow and pick up the pace gradually.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored, and loose clothing. Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from UV rays. Wear and reapply sunscreen as indicated on the package.
* Rest in the shade or a cool place every chance you get to protect you from the sun.
* Stay in air-conditioned space.
* If you do not have an air conditioner, use a fan and make sure your windows are open.
* Do not eat heavy or oily foods and avoid cooking with your oven.
* Take a cool shower or bath to cool down.
* Do not sit in a hot car, even if it‚Äôs for a short period of time. Never leave a person or animal alone in a vehicle during high temperatures.
* Check on your friends and neighbors who are elderly or have medical conditions.

Who‚Äôs at Risk?

Older individuals are at higher risk for health problems when it‚Äôs very hot. Please be extra cautious if you:

* Have existing medical conditions
* Take medication for high blood pressure or use IV drugs
* Have mental health conditions
* Have been drinking alcohol
* Have had a previous heat-related illness

üé§ Pass The Mic: G7 Global Rebellion üé§ 

XR Trees Hoima joins the global action to amplify our voices about the Save Bugoma Forest campaign. 5 sq miles of land part of Bugoma tropical forest were given away to Hoima Sugar for sugar cane growing. Activists together with other environmental conservation organisations sued Hoima Sugar and National Environmental Management Authority, NEMA, in the courts of law for issuing a licence to Hoima Sugar which the activists termed as illegal and unlawful action. The activists lost the case to Hoima Sugar, meaning they will go ahead to clear cut the forest and plant sugar cane which still activists are against it.

‚ÄúWe are calling upon the G7 countries to stop supporting the so called investors of Hoima Sugar in terms of loans and put a total ban of their products to be consumed in their countries.

We are working to support community tree planting by giving them quality indigenous tree seedlings for planting in their degraded farm lands as well as raising awareness of the dangers associated with cutting the forest which include among others, wildlife displacement hence conflicts between communities and wildlife, climate change, desertification, etc.‚Äù

We, in the Global South, call on the G7 to take ownership of its immense responsibility for the climate crisis. We are losing our seasonal weather patterns. We are losing our homes and livelihoods to floods, fires, sea-level rise and extreme weather. We did not cause this, G7, you did. Honour the climate debt you owe us. 

The poorest 50% of humanity only accounted for 7% of the cumulative emissions between 1990 and 2015. While 10% of the richest accounted for 52%.

We call on the G7 to take ownership of its immense responsibility for environmental destruction. You let your companies pollute our lands with mining, fracking, forest and ecosystem destruction of all kinds. You even dump your waste in our lands. Our water is undrinkable, our soil unproductive, our air filthy. Honour the debt you owe us for this immense environmental destruction.

Unfortunately, WGR has suffered far worse than we expected - there is significant flood borne debris and floating tree logs wedged against several bridges, with some undermining.
At Thomson Station, the carriage and loco shed has been flooded by a spring behind the building, which has left a muddy mess inside. Outside, there are quite a few areas where the access road has partially collapsed beside the Thomson River. It will be quite a while before the various sites can be properly inspected by engineers and a recovery plan is prepared.

On a brighter note, our hardworking works team have almost completely removed the massive pine tree that smashed down on to the tracks behind the Walhalla loco shed.

Rebels of theoceanrebellion staged a theatrical action on the shores of the Cornish coastal resort Marazion, with the iconic St Michael‚Äôs Mount in the background. 

The action was part of an ongoing series of protests leading up to the G7 summit to be held nearby, featuring Boris Johnson sharing intimate quality-time in Cornwall with an oily Fossil Fuel Buddy. The celebrity pair were seen sitting on deck-chairs as the sun rose and a boat burned in the bay, billowing black smoke, across its sail inscribed ‚ÄòYour Children‚Äôs Future.‚Äô 

The scene represents the UK government‚Äôs total lack of purpose to do anything to combat the catastrophic climate change, ocean acidification and biodiversity loss that will devastate all our futures and leave a dead ocean for future generations. 

theoceanrebellion say the UK government must make the ocean a priority at the G7 summit, and want politicians to distance themselves from the fossil fuel industry. We demand all governments cease subsidies to shipping and begin to tax shipping fuel. We demand the fleet is furloughed until a full and open investigation of world fish stocks is completed, with all fisher folk to receive full pay using a tax on commercial shipping fuel. 

Countless young people have already decided not to have children because the future they will face is simply too hard. With extreme weather already afflicting many people, crop-yields are failing and food shortages are leading to conflict, forced migration and famine. Our disregard of the Ocean has led to a catastrophic decline in fish stocks, with many crucial habitats totally destroyed. 

The UK government must prioritise genuine action on climate and nature at G7. The time for posturing is over.

You must resist this temptation! Skip the DIY cleaning attempt and lean on the experts for a thorough and safe mold removal.

Here are four examples of why you shouldn't handle mold removal yourself: 
1. You might not properly assess the damage
2. Mold might return.
3. It's expensive to remove by yourself.
4. You put your health at risk.

Rivers on the southern and western plains overflowed, inundating low-lying areas and forcing thousands into relief centers. Illegal filling of low-lying lands reserved for stormwater retention is said to have made the flooding worse.

Sri Lanka ranked 6th among the 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2018, in the Global Climate Risk Index. This index analyses to what extent countries and regions have been affected by impacts of weather-related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.)

Each year, the storms seem to get worse, but each year we seem to forget. When rivers run over, swollen by deluges of rain and flash floods affect hundreds of communities - what is our contingency and mitigation plan?

Grasslands at Gippsland, Victoria in Australia, are covered with cobwebs after severe floods hit the area. The nets are spun by the sheet web spiders who couldn't live on the ground anymore and moved to the higher areas after flooding. The phenomenon is known as ballooning and is very common after flooding, according to ecologists.

Don't Panic! We can Solve the Problem! We Have Pollution Liability Insurance! ü§©üíöüëç

1) Pollution liability insurance protects against liability from damage caused by hazardous waste materials. 
2) Pollution liability insurance is needed because it‚Äôs excluded from standard commercial general liability policies. 
3) Business owners that may face hazardous waste exposure and owners of industrial sites should consider pollution liability insurance.

Before the mid-1980s, pollution liability was covered under standard Commercial General Liability policies. 
However, insurance companies began excluding pollution liability under the general liability policy, making it necessary to purchase separate coverage for pollution liability. 
If you are an independent contractor, then you will find that many jobs require you to have pollution liability insurance and you will have to show proof of coverage before beginning a job.

Strange beasties that literally created a buzz. A restless universe tossing rocks at our planet. All with a raging coronavirus afflicting our world population. Fairfield, CT Author Mike Lauterborn has captured these bizarre highlights in his newly released book, ""#because2020"" -- dizzying, dramatic and worrying with regard to the future. Are these splashes a glimpse of more aggressive and violent weather, nature and space occurrences to come? 

#because2020 is a companion read to his ""Pandemonium"" book, about the early months of the Covid pandemic, released last July, which follows on the heels of his American travelogue, ""Chasing Charley"" (2018), which recreated John Steinbeck's ""Travels with Charley"" adventure.

Located in Nakhon Phanom province, northeast of Thailand, this proposal aims to reclaim and preserve Seasonally Flooded Forest that was trespassed and destroyed by charcoal industry and industrial agriculture since 1965. By restoring and conserving the seasonal flooded forest in area of Pak Yam village, a rural landscape is proposed to relink human to seasonally flooded forest which was harmonized between life and nature, to create the space for better quality of life and become Nakorn Panom's provincial tourist attraction, in terms of ecology and cultural landscape. Understanding this dynamic landscape that benefits positive effects toward human beings, Ecological Gateway to seasonally flooded forest, educational space between interface of seasonally flooded forest and Dry evergreen forest have been proposed to the area. Through analysis on seasonally flooded area, landscape character, vegetation, annually activities and site potential, adaptable design is the key for living on this area and symbolizing the awareness to other people.

Floods have become a routine disaster in cities as well as in many rural areas. Encroachments on rivers/ streams have increased the intensity of floods. Losses and damages caused by these are irreversible.

Dates of re-distribution of water from the Melamchi project to Kathmandu have become uncertain after the floods and landslides damaged the tunnel on the same day the tunnel was emptied.

The dam, tunnel, road, the motorable bridge, and the structure of the Melamchi project in Helambu of Sindhupalchowk have been damaged by the floods and landslides last Tuesday. The dam of the Melamchi project has been cut off due to floods.

The last section of the access road connecting the dam of the project has collapsed into the Melamchi River. The project had tested the distribution of water in the Kathmandu Valley through the reserve tank of Sundarijal. The project was currently stopped distribution for the maintenance of the tunnel.

How long do you think it would take to re-distribute water from the Melamchi project to Kathmandu? nonextquestion

In the words of Abdullah,

""The direction of the monsoon has changed ‚Äì it now advances west instead of north across the country. In the northwest, the monsoon failed entirely in 2006, causing severe drought, and 2007 saw a tornado occur months out of season.""

He explains: Floods in South Sudan have triggered an alarm for acute food insecurity across the country, says the international IPC report. Right now, an estimated 6.4 million people in South Sudan face acute food insecurity - more than half of the country's population. About 1.3 million children suffer from acute malnutrition, the deadliest form of hunger, exacerbated by the spread of malaria and unsafe drinking water connected to the floods.
1 million people have been affected since the start of the floods in July; Jonglei State is at the heart of the devastation. The isolated areas in Fangak county are at Emergency (IPC Phase 4) - acute food insecurity. Cut-off by the floods, Old Fangak, a remote town north of South Sudan, will starve by the start of 2021.

Ana di Pangracio, working for farnargentina tells us about climate threats to large wetlands, while these same wetlands are crucial in mitigating global climate change: ""The loss and degradation of wetlands in a climate change scenario that causes more often and heavier rains is a recipe for disaster. Communities are affected by severe floods that alter their daily lives, livelihoods and property.""

During the formation of a new Dutch government after the general elections in March, a group of concerned citizens deklimaatwakers is holding a wake in front of the Prime Minister's residence to remind the political leaders of the climate crisis. On Friday May 28, they paid attention to the international aspect. We added some international messages to their flag line!

We were first required to remove the existing pipework and investigate specific outlet pipes. Once the downstream outlets were confirmed we started the installation of the new Ensign cast iron pipework. All new pipework was suspended from the ceiling level and connected to additional sections downstream to the eventual outlet.

The installation was signed off on completion after an air/water test was passed. We can confirm that we left the site with all pipework in a watertight and free-flowing condition.

Afgelopen week zorgden hoosbuien in Zuid-Nederland voor veel wateroverlast, wat opnieuw het belang aantoont van klimaatadaptieve (her)inrichting van stedelijk gebied. Met de toepassing van Sempergreen Detentiedaken worden hevige piekbuien opgevangen en vertraagd afgevoerd, waardoor de kans op overstromingen worden verminderd.
