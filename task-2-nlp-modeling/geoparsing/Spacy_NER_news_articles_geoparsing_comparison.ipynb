The flood was caused when part of a Himalayan glacier broke off and sent a wall of water and debris down a mountain, sweeping away everything in its path.\\n\\nRescuers on Monday were trying to rescue 37 power plant workers who remained trapped in a tunnel.\\n\\nMore than 2,000 members of the military, paramilitary groups and police have been taking part in search-and-rescue operations in the northern state of Uttarakhand.\\n\\nThe flood was caused when a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier snapped off Sunday morning, releasing water trapped behind it.\\n\\n“Everything was swept away, people, cattle and trees,” Sangram Singh Rawat, a former village council member of Raini, the site closest to the glacier, told local media, according to Reuters.\\n\\nHere's what to know:\\n\\nHow are glaciers formed?\\n\\nGlaciers begin to form when snow remains in the same area year-round, where enough snow accumulates to transform into ice, the National Snow and Ice Data Center said. Each year, new layers of snow bury and compress the previous layers.\\n\\nMost of the world's glacial ice is found in Antarctica and Greenland, but glaciers are found on nearly every continent, even Africa.\\n\\nA large cluster of glaciers is in the Himalayas, which are part of India’s long northern border. Sunday’s disaster occurred in the western part of the Himalayas.\\n\\nMore:2020 falls just short of being Earth's hottest year on record as global warming continues\\n\\nHow does a glacier burst?\\n\\nProglacial lakes, formed after glaciers retreat, are often bound by sediment and boulder formations. Additional water or pressure, or structural weakness, can cause both natural and man-made dams to burst, sending a mass of floodwater surging down the rivers and streams fed by the glacier.\\n\\nIn this case, National Snow and Ice Data Center scientist Bruce Raup told USA TODAY that the cause of this burst appears to be a landslide that...</td>\n",

Another video shows a policeman, steps away from the presidential palace in Cairo's district of Heliopolis, wading into a flooded street to unclog a sewage drain.\\n\\nAuthorities closed schools and universities in the greater Cairo area Wednesday and companies saw only skeletal staff show up at work. Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly said school closures were limited to the greater Cairo area, including Giza and Qalioubia, as more rainfall was expected in the next couple of days, according to the country's weather service.\\n\\nThe mayhem raised questions about Cairo's ability to deal with such heavy rains as the city's infrastructure and sewage and drainage systems have suffered from years of poor maintenance.\\n\\nPeople took to social media to criticize the government's lack of preparedness. Cairo, a city of some 20 million people, has been left for decades in neglect and decay, particularly its overcrowded neighborhoods.\\n\\nHashtags like “(hash)Egypt is sinking” were trending on social media, attracting many videos and pictures of the most affected areas in Cairo and elsewhere.\\n\\nFive deaths occurred in the Nile Delta provinces of Sharqia, Gharbia and Kafr el-Sheikh, according to the Interior Ministry.

       "      <td>MAHASENPURA, Sri Lanka (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In this village in southern Sri Lanka’s Hambantota District, water sales are big business.\\n\\nBeset by a prolonged dry spell and day-time temperatures reaching above 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Farenheit), the village has seen all of its wells run dry.\\n\\nWater arrives once every three days in the form of a free government tanker, but it’s not always enough to last. Buying a tanker of water privately costs 5,000 rupees ($34), more than most people can pay.\\n\\nInstead the village’s farmers and traders buy their water in one-liter bottles from small-scale vendors who charge four to 10 rupees a liter (less than one U.S. cent) for drinking water brought from about 30 kilometers away.\\n\\n“We buy drinking water, and try to use other sources for cooking and washing,” said Sarath Mahanama, one villager. Those other sources include the muddy puddle left in the bottom of a nearly empty nearby water reservoir.\\n\\nMahasenpura is not alone in its shortages. Nine districts in Sri Lanka’s Southern, Northern, North Eastern and southeastern Uva provinces have been hit by drought. According to the national Disaster Management Center, by mid-October over 875,000 people were being provided with government tanker water in these areas.\\n\\nThe worst hit area, where over 160,000 people are currently dependent on water brought in from outside, is north-central Polonnaruwa District.\\n\\n“This is what we undergo every year. After the floods, there will be a drought and we are almost dying of thirst,” said Tissa Poddibanda, a villager from the Lankapura area.\\n\\nLankapura is one of the worst-affected sites in the country, with close to 30,000 persons waiting for transported water.\\n\\nDROUGHT TO FLOODS\\n\\nAs the weather becomes more extreme, Sri Lanka finds itself increasingly in a debilitating pattern of alternating between drought and floods – both of which can lead to shortages of clean water.\\n\\nIn May, large areas of the country w...</td>\n",

       "0  At least 31 people are dead and 165 are missing after a flood hit northern India on Sunday. The flood was caused when part of a Himalayan glacier broke off and sent a wall of water and debris down a mountain, sweeping away everything in its path.\\n\\nRescuers on Monday were trying to rescue 37 power plant workers who remained trapped in a tunnel.\\n\\nMore than 2,000 members of the military, paramilitary groups and police have been taking part in search-and-rescue operations in the northern state of Uttarakhand.\\n\\nThe flood was caused when a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier snapped off Sunday morning, releasing water trapped behind it.\\n\\n“Everything was swept away, people, cattle and trees,” Sangram Singh Rawat, a former village council member of Raini, the site closest to the glacier, told local media, according to Reuters.\\n\\nHere's what to know:\\n\\nHow are glaciers formed?\\n\\nGlaciers begin to form when snow remains in the same area year-round, where enough snow accumulates to transform into ice, the National Snow and Ice Data Center said. Each year, new layers of snow bury and compress the previous layers.\\n\\nMost of the world's glacial ice is found in Antarctica and Greenland, but glaciers are found on nearly every continent, even Africa.\\n\\nA large cluster of glaciers is in the Himalayas, which are part of India’s long northern border. Sunday’s disaster occurred in the western part of the Himalayas.\\n\\nMore:2020 falls just short of being Earth's hottest year on record as global warming continues\\n\\nHow does a glacier burst?\\n\\nProglacial lakes, formed after glaciers retreat, are often bound by sediment and boulder formations. Additional water or pressure, or structural weakness, can cause both natural and man-made dams to burst, sending a mass of floodwater surging down the rivers and streams fed by the glacier.\\n\\nIn this case, National Snow and Ice Data Center scientist Bruce Raup told USA TODAY that the cause of this burst appears to be a landslide that...   \n",

       "4  MAHASENPURA, Sri Lanka (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In this village in southern Sri Lanka’s Hambantota District, water sales are big business.\\n\\nBeset by a prolonged dry spell and day-time temperatures reaching above 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Farenheit), the village has seen all of its wells run dry.\\n\\nWater arrives once every three days in the form of a free government tanker, but it’s not always enough to last. Buying a tanker of water privately costs 5,000 rupees ($34), more than most people can pay.\\n\\nInstead the village’s farmers and traders buy their water in one-liter bottles from small-scale vendors who charge four to 10 rupees a liter (less than one U.S. cent) for drinking water brought from about 30 kilometers away.\\n\\n“We buy drinking water, and try to use other sources for cooking and washing,” said Sarath Mahanama, one villager. Those other sources include the muddy puddle left in the bottom of a nearly empty nearby water reservoir.\\n\\nMahasenpura is not alone in its shortages. Nine districts in Sri Lanka’s Southern, Northern, North Eastern and southeastern Uva provinces have been hit by drought. According to the national Disaster Management Center, by mid-October over 875,000 people were being provided with government tanker water in these areas.\\n\\nThe worst hit area, where over 160,000 people are currently dependent on water brought in from outside, is north-central Polonnaruwa District.\\n\\n“This is what we undergo every year. After the floods, there will be a drought and we are almost dying of thirst,” said Tissa Poddibanda, a villager from the Lankapura area.\\n\\nLankapura is one of the worst-affected sites in the country, with close to 30,000 persons waiting for transported water.\\n\\nDROUGHT TO FLOODS\\n\\nAs the weather becomes more extreme, Sri Lanka finds itself increasingly in a debilitating pattern of alternating between drought and floods – both of which can lead to shortages of clean water.\\n\\nIn May, large areas of the country w...   \n",
