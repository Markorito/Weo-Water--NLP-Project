Flooding caused by heavy rains started spreading on Thursday and left a trail of devastation across seven provinces, said Hasibullah Shir Khani, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s National Disaster Management Authority.

Another 12 people were missing and more than 700 houses were destroyed or severely damaged, he added.

The floods worsen an already desperate situation. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced in the region by last year’s severe drought and the 17-year-long war with the Taliban.

Floods in early March caused further destruction and put this year’s wheat harvest at risk.

“My house and my farmland have been destroyed by floods. If you go and see the destruction it makes you cry,” said Shir Ahmad, who lives in a village in Herat province, which borders Iran.

Children waded through muddy, knee-deep floodwaters that flowed through tent camps for displaced people after the rain stopped. Some families strung salvageable clothes and bedding to dry.

Floods have destroyed hundreds of homes, some historic sites, thousands of acres of farmland, bridges and highways, said Jilani Farhad, a spokesman for the province.

Floods are a common occurrence in Afghanistan, although not usually this severe. The country has little infrastructure, such as ditches and sewers, to manage water run-off from rain or melting snow.

“There is huge destruction caused by floods,” said Ahmad Jawed Nadem, head of refugees and repatriation for Herat. In one area, he said he saw more than 200 destroyed houses.

In Herat alone, eight people were killed, said Dr. Abdul Hakim Tamana, head of public health for the province.

“They had the drought problem, and the floods and the conflict. They are very poor people and they lose all they have,” the Afghan Red Crescent Society’s secretary general Nilab Mobarez said.

“It’s not as simple as they will go on with their lives.”

World Vision said it appeared tens of thousands of Afghans were affected. Some residents of Badghis province were calling it the worst storm in 20 years, it said.

1749,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Record Rains Cause Flash Flooding in Tennessee; 4 Dead - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/usa/record-rains-cause-flash-flooding-tennessee-4-dead,"Torrential rains across Tennessee flooded homes and at least one church and left roads impassable, prompting dozens of people to be rescued in the Nashville area. Authorities said four bodies were found Sunday in the flood's aftermath.

Nashville received more than 7 inches of rain, the second-highest two-day rainfall total ever recorded, Mayor John Cooper said at a news conference Sunday.

Ebony Northern said a normally tame creek running through her Nashville apartment complex swiftly rose after heavy rain started late Saturday night. Within an hour or so, she could see some first-floor units in other parts of the complex being flooded. She said people moved to the second floor and she also heard calls for boats come in over the fire department scanner.

""The units are a mess. Some of the outside air conditioning units have floated off,"" she said Sunday morning.

Severe Weather Causes Damage Across 4 US States Weather service says more severe weather possible Thursday in southeast US

She said the American Red Cross arrived to assist her neighbors.

At least one church canceled in-person Palm Sunday services. The New Tribe Church in Mt. Juliet said on Facebook that knee-deep water flooded the building, broke out the glass of its front entrance and sent chairs through a hallway.

""I am smiling but our hearts are devastated,"" Pastor Jarod Smith said at the start of an online service. ""We are standing in our worship center and there's just not enough words to describe what it actually looks like.""

Nashville Fire Chief William Swann said swift-water teams were placed on standby in anticipation of the storms. At least 130 people were rescued from cars, apartments and homes, while about 40 dogs were moved from a Nashville boarding kennel, Camp Bow Wow, to another location.

Cooper said first responders walked along creek beds Sunday and worked with the Red Cross to canvass affected neighborhoods.

To the south in Williamson County, more than 34 swift water rescues were carried out, according to county Emergency Management Agency Director Todd Horton. As many as 18 homes in one neighborhood had to be evacuated.

A portion of Interstate 40 was temporarily shut down because of high water that stranded a vehicle and its driver. The driver was able to get out of the vehicle and to safety, the Tennessee Highway Patrol in Nashville tweeted. First responders also told drivers to avoid part of I-24 south of Nashville.

Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake said three bodies were found after Seven Mile Creek flooded. The body of a 70-year-old man, a 46-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.

Drake said a 65-year-old man's body was found on a golf course. Police later identified him on Twitter as some who lived nearby and was swept away as he got out of his car after it had become stuck in floodwaters.

Many rivers and creeks were at or near their highest level since 2010, according to the National Weather Service. Floods in May 2010 caused 21 deaths in Tennessee and an estimated $1.5 billion in damage in Nashville.

While there was no longer any precipitation falling, flooding remained a threat, Brittney Whitehead, a weather service meteorologist in Nashville, said Sunday afternoon.

""Over the next couple of days, we'll see some of our rivers continue to rise. And we've got several flood warnings out for those areas that we expect to remain high, at least into Monday,"" she said.

Major flooding was forecast on two rivers. The weather service predicted the Harpeth River near Kingston Springs, west of Nashville, would crest about 20 feet (about 6.1 meters) above flood stage on Sunday night, while the Duck River at Centerville would crest about 17 feet (about 5.2 meters) above flood stage Monday morning.

In Bristol, along the Virginia border, a NASCAR race on a dirt track Sunday was postponed until Monday after torrential rains flooded campgrounds and parking lots surrounding Bristol Motor Speedway.

In Brentwood, eight people and a dog stayed overnight at City Hall after flooding from the Little Harpeth River forced residents from their homes, City Manager Kirk Bednar said. Hotels in the area were booked up, in part because of spring break, he said.

Fifteen people were rescued and two were taken to the hospital at the City View Apartments in south Nashville, where the lower level of the building was flooded in waist-deep water. The fire department responded to reports of a collapse at the building following a mudslide, news outlets reported. The two hospitalized patients had injuries not considered to be life-threatening.

Drake, the Nashville police chief, also said an officer on his way home was hospitalized after his vehicle was caught in floodwaters. The officer got out of the car and was found clinging to a tree when he was rescued.

249,FF-2012-000189-IDN,What to Do About DDoS Attacks - BankInfoSecurity.com,https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ddos-vendor-a-5271,"What to Do About DDoS Attacks

Security Experts Offer Banks Tips

Leaders at four security technology companies say the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that have hit 10 U.S. banks in recent weeks highlight the need for new approaches to preventing and responding to online outages.

See Also: Live Webinar | The Role of Passwords in the Hybrid Workforce

""Attackers have broadened their toolkits, and DDoS is a not just a blunt instrument anymore,"" says Jason Malo, a fraud analyst CEB TowerGroup and former DDoS-prevention expert for domain-naming-system registry operator VeriSign.

These experts advise banking institutions to:

Use appropriate technology, including cloud-based Web servers, which can handle overflow, when high volumes of Web traffic strike;

Assess ongoing DDoS risks, such as through tests that mimic real-world attacks;

Implement online outage mitigation and response strategies before attacks hit;

Train staff to recognize the signs of a DDoS attack.

During a DDoS attack, a website is flooded with what security experts often call ""junk"" traffic - a saturation of requests that overwhelm the site's servers, preventing them from being able to respond to legitimate traffic. In essence, DDoS attacks take websites down because the servers can't handle the traffic.

Security experts interviewed for this story say most banks have failed to address this vulnerability to high volumes of traffic.

DDoS: Banks on Alert

Starting in mid-September, DDoS attacks have resulted in online outages at 10 major U.S. banks.

The hacktivist group Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has taken credit for the hits, saying the attacks are motivated by outrage related to a YouTube movie trailer deemed offensive to Muslims.

But security experts say DDoS attacks are often used as tools of distraction to mask fraud in the background (see DDoS Attacks: First Signs of Fraud?).

To reduce their risk of DDoS takedown, experts say banks need to address three key areas:

Layered user authentication at login, which consumes bandwidth;

at login, which consumes bandwidth; Reliance on Internet service providers not equipped to handle extreme bandwidth demands; and

The internal management of Web servers, which limits banks' ability to hand off traffic overflow when volumes are excessive.

Expert Advice

Fraud should always be an institution's top concern, meaning addressing DDoS threats should be a priority, experts say. ""DDoS protections have quickly become a new industry best practice,"" Malo says.

But DDoS attacks pose unique challenges for banks and credit unions. The additional layers of security institutions already implement, such as enhanced user authentication, transaction verification and device identification, demand more bandwidth. So when a bank is hit by a DDoS attack, bandwidth is strained more than it would be at a non-banking e-commerce site, says Mike Smith, a senior security evangelist at Akamai Technologies, which specializes in Internet traffic monitoring and cloud-based DDoS protections (see New Bank Attacks Expected Today?).

So what protections make sense?

BankInfoSecurity asked security vendors VeriSign, Prolexic, Cisco and Akamai Technologies for their top recommendations. They all stressed that no one-size-fits-all approach to thwarting attacks exists. Nevertheless, they identified several best practices.

Use Appropriate Technology

When it comes to selecting the right technologies to minimize DDoS-related outages, vendors advise:

Rely on the cloud. No internal server could be expected to handle the amount of traffic these recent DDoS attacks have pushed. Akamai's Smith says the average amount of traffic coming in during some of those individual attacks equaled about 65 gigabytes per second.

""Even at the height of the Anonymous attacks, we saw traffic coming in from 7,000 or 8,000 people [at approximately 1 gigabyte per second],"" he says.

By relying on cloud-based servers and systems, banks can expand their bandwidth. ""It's never a good idea to manage everything internally,"" says Joe Dallatore, senior manager of the Cisco Security & Research Information Group, which specializes in security threat monitoring and online event tracking.

Working with a cloud vendor also can help institutions more readily identify a DNS-server attack or other DDoS attack, Dallatore says.

Using DNS providers with the capacity to absorb an attack makes sense, because when DNS fails, all other services fail, says Akamai's Smith. ""This is why almost all the large banks use a DNS provider in some capacity, and it's a proactive defense that is always turned on by default,"" he adds.

Use virtual private networks. VPNs indirectly improve DDoS protections, says Matt Wilson, who oversees strategic technologies at VeriSign. Attackers target publicly available sites because they are public. But a VPN cannot protect an entire infrastructure. For complete protection, banks and businesses must continue to rely on other technologies for firewall management as well as server and router maintenance, he says.

A better solution, Akamai's Smith suggests, is VPN over MPLS [multiprotocol label switching] for critical or business-to-business functions.

Apply challenge-and-response. Malo says banks should encourage vendors to develop DDoS protections that ""challenge"" traffic. These protections, he says, could mirror challenge-and-response options, such as CAPTCHA images, used for online banking. A CAPTCHA image uses distorted letters or numbers that an online user is required to enter at login to help affirm authenticity.

""DDoS mitigation is not just about finding a signature and putting mechanisms in to filter or block traffic,"" Malo says. ""Mitigation also includes introducing challenge-response."" Challenge-and-response options would help banking institutions differentiate legitimate traffic from so-called junk traffic often associated with DDoS attacks, he adds.

But Akamai's Smith warns that challenge-and-response during a large DDoS attack could be dangerous, since challenge-and-response takes one request and turns it into four. ""This does not scale, and it sets you up for additional points of failure."" he says. For smaller attacks, challenge-and-response can be effective, however, ""where we are worried about denying legitimate users because of mega-proxies, corporate Internet access points,"" Smith says.

Don't rely on intrusion detection. Intrusion prevention and detection systems can be effective at picking up on anomalous traffic or behavior associated with a DDoS attack, CEB TowerGroup's Malo says. But that's not what those systems were primarily designed to do. While leaning on those systems can help DDoS detection, and in some cases help institutions thwart online outages, redirecting IPS and IDS can create new vulnerabilities.

""When protection systems are redirected, banking institutions inadvertently create new vulnerabilities,"" he says, because other defenses are weakened.

Scrub. Traffic scrubbing, which clears suspected botnets and junk traffic at the ISP, can be effective, Cisco's Dallatore says. The more bad traffic an institution can block at the outset, the better its chances of limiting an outage.

Assess DDoS Risks

Vendors stress that regularly assessing DDoS risks, such as through tests that mimic real-world attacks, is essential.

""Run periodic table-top exercises to model how an attack could hit and then test the accompanying remediation strategies you've put in place,"" says Stuart Scholly, president of Prolexic, which specializes in cloud-based services for website restoration after a DDoS attack.

To set the stage for remediation plans and testing, vendors recommend banking institutions first:

Know typical traffic patterns. To better assess risk, financial institutions must carefully determine what typical site traffic looks like, Malo says. That way, when a DDoS attack hits, atypical traffic patterns are more obvious.

Understand the infrastructure. Understand the Web applications, online bandwidth limits and any infrastructure elements that could affect site capacity. Akamai's Smith says network segmentation can limit the impact an attack has on other services inside the same infrastructure. ""At a minimum, critical sites should be provisioned onto their own, dedicated network circuits and border devices to limit the impact of both an attack against them and from attacks against other services in the same data center,"" he says. ""Brochureware sites,"" consumer transactional sites and business sites are good candidates to break out into their own infrastructure, Smith says, while redirect, typo and marketing-campaign sites can be run from shared infrastructure.

Mitigation and Response

DDoS mitigation strategies and response plans should be included in disaster recovery and business continuity strategies, Prolexic's Scholly says.

Those strategies also must include definitive communication and action plans, Cisco's Dallatore says. Communicating with employees and the public soon after a DDoS attack is critical for reputational preservation. ""You want to be sure operational people, for instance, can reach the decision makers or have the authority to make decisions when a site goes down,"" Dallatore says.

During the recent wave of attacks, banks' communication with the public varied. Some institutions acknowledged their sites went down because of DDoS attacks, while others only said their sites experienced intermittent outages.

Greg Nowak of the Information Security Forum says most institutions have been too quiet - fueling the public's fears about the outages. ""They seem to be regarding it as a secret,"" Nowak says. ""[The banks] should be taking the opportunity to explain to their customers the difference between a denial-of-service attack and some sort of hacking attack that actually puts information at risk.""

Provide Training

Training staff to recognize the signs of an attack is essential, vendors advise.

Bank and credit union employees must understand what DDoS attack traffic patterns look like, says Prolexic's Scholly. Front-line staff members also need to know how to respond if they start getting calls about a site being down.

BITS, the technology division of the Financial Services Roundtable, says banks and credit unions need to clearly communicate with customers and members that their financial information and accounts are secure.

Among BITS recommendations:

Explain that attacks have not resulted in unauthorized access to customer information;

Reiterate to consumers that banking institutions use sophisticated online security strategies to protect customer accounts;

Let consumers know that institutions continue to invest in technology to defend against potential attacks.

""We want the public to know that institutions are taking steps to address these attacks - with ISPs and other security providers - and there is a fair amount of collaboration going on with regulators and the Department of Homeland Security about the threats and how to address them,"" says John Carlson, executive vice president of BITS.

""You can't underestimate the importance of training, and the role it plays in your business continuity planning,"" Scholly says. ""When you are prepared, it makes a world of difference.""",2012-11-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['security', 'smith', 'traffic', 'attacks', 'institutions', 'banks', 'ddos', 'attack', 'online', 'sites']",India,news article,English
1522,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Climate change could leave millions at risk in Tunisia and Egypt - TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/climate-change-could-leave-millions-at-risk-in-tunisia-and-egypt-43891,"Insight

As the Mediterranean Sea becomes increasingly warm, extreme tropical weather could displace millions, and with that, alter the geography of North African countries.

Rising global temperatures, driven mainly by greenhouse gas emissions, will result in millions being displaced from the coastal cities of North Africa, according to a study published in the Nature Research Journal.

Melting glaciers and sea caps will raise the global sea levels by dangerous margins by the end of this century. This will mean increasingly extreme weather that could have the effect of displacing coastal communities in Tunisia and Egypt in particular.

The report warns that coastal cities in the Gulf of Tunis, which have a population of more than 2 million, are at higher risk from rising sea levels. They are expected to rise more than one metre by the end of the century.

Egypt, which is the Arab world's most populous nation, is another country that the report says is at a “very high risk” from population displacement as a result of rising sea levels.

Almost 40 million of Egypt’s 100 million population live in the Delta Region, where the Nile River, through hundreds of arteries, spills into the Meditterienian Sea.

This low-lying land has over the past few decades seen unplanned urban development with millions of people packed into land that could now be at risk from flooding.

Analysing the physical and social impact on the coastal areas of North Africa “is crucial for facilitating the implementation of flood risk management and protection for highly populated urban areas, as well as agricultural terrain,” the paper concluded.

“It is crucial to forecast these vulnerabilities in light of the predicted rise of sea surface temperatures, which are resulting in increased coastal flooding from severe weather events in the Mediterranean Basin,” the report added.

Tunisia and Egypt have more than a 70 percent chance of being impacted by rising sea levels. In contrast, Libya, which is nestled between the two states, only has a 7 percent chance.

The authors of the report focused on the increasing incidences of changing weather patterns in the region.

In September 2018, the Tunisian coastal governorate of Nabeul saw large flash floods with as much as 1.7 metres of rain, normally expected to fall in a six month period, falling within one day.

Again in October 2019, the coastal region of Ariana saw floods that brought an average of 90 to 220 mm of rainfall in one hour causing widespread material damage and loss of life.

The study at the Nature Research Journal also found that the Egyptian coastal areas in October 2019 were ravaged by “an extremely uncommon “medicane” bringing tropical-like storm-force winds, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding.”

Since the 1980s, the scientists conducting the study warned that the surface temperatures have increased between 1 and 2 degrees.

The rise in the temperatures is likely to act as a catalyst for future storms in the Mediterranean and in the Black Sea.

“As these repeatedly extreme and unusual phenomena are occurring along highly vulnerable coasts, more urban damage and environmental impacts are being sensed,” the report concludes.

Amakhosi have not won any of their opening league matches since being crowned PSL champions at the end of the 2014/15 season

Kaizer Chiefs will look to get their house in order and end their four-year trophy drought as the 2019/20 PSL season gets underway.

But their opening league match results over the past four seasons have not been up to their title-aspiration standards.

Amakhosi last won the PSL title in 2015 under the tutelage of Stuart Baxter, but since then, they have had to get their campaigns underway away from home.

This time around, Chiefs get their season underway with a clash away to Highlands Park at the Makhulong Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

Goal takes a look at their results in their opening matches of the season over the past four seasons of their struggles.

2015/16 season

This was Steve Komphela's first season in charge of the Glamour Boys following Baxter's departure from the club.

Komphela led Amakhosi against Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, but the team failed to find the back of the net let alone win the match.

The match ended in a goalless draw; a disappointing result given that Amakhosi were the defending champions at the time.

Chiefs finished the season in the fifth position at the end of the 2015/16 campaign.

2016/17 season

Amakhosi were pitted against Bidvest Wits in their opening match of the 2016/17 season.

Again, this was an away match for the Soweto giants, and they went down 2-1 to Gavin Hunt's charges.

This was soon after the club had made wholesale changes to their squad and losing a few of their experienced players including the likes of Reneilwe Letsholonyane.

Chiefs had an improved season as they ended up in the fourth position with 50 points after 30 league games.

2017/18 season

The Naturena-based outfit kicked started their campaign away to Bloemfontein Celtic in Komphela's final season.

The two sides played to a 1-1 draw with Amakhosi squandering their lead and allowing Phunya Sele Sele to claw back.

At this stage, it was clear that Amakhosi's problems were deepening, however, they kicked on to end up in position three at the end of the campaign, but with two points less than the previous season.

2018/19 season

An unusual start to a PSL campaign saw Kaizer Chiefs visit Mamelodi Sundowns in their opening league match.

The two rivals settled for a share of the spoils in Tshwane as the game ended in a 1-1 draw.

This was Giovanni Solinas' first match in charge of Amakhosi, taking over from Patrick Mabedi who had been the interim coach.

Ernst Middendorp then replaced Solinas, but the German mentor couldn't help the club make the top eight.",2019-08-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['position', 'psl', 'amakhosi', 'away', 'title', 'kaizer', 'draws', 'loss', 'matches', 'league', 'opening', 'end', 'winless', 'match', 'chiefs', 'season', 'winning']",Ghana,news article,English

1775,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Singapore joins Asia's SPAC race but investors flock to US - Nikkei Asia,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Market-Spotlight/Singapore-joins-Asia-s-SPAC-race-but-investors-flock-to-US,"SINGAPORE/HONG KONG -- Asian exchanges are keen to get in on the boom in ""blank-check"" company initial public offerings, or SPACs, that has swept the U.S. But the region may not generate the same kind of frenzy.

SPACs are shell corporations whose sponsors, or promoters, raise capital via a stock market listing. They then look to acquire or merge with operating companies, which as a result can go public more quickly than through a traditional initial public offering. In other words, SPAC shareholders do not know which business they are investing in until later.

The popularity of such listing vehicles has surged. In the first ten weeks of 2021, global SPAC IPO volumes -- overwhelmingly in the U.S. -- reached $76.7 billion, just $2.5 billion behind the amount for all of 2020, according to data from Refinitiv.

The wave of SPACs includes a number aimed at capturing Asian investment. Six Asia-focused SPACs have raised a total of $2.7 billion so far this year, almost double the entire volume for 2020, according to Dealogic.

And some notable Asian startups are considered to be potential targets for SPACs. They include Singapore super app provider Grab, its Indonesian rival Gojek, and e-commerce giant Tokopedia, also from Indonesia. All are reportedly being circled by SPACs as a vehicle to go public.

But compared with the U.S., Asia is still considered less fertile ground for SPACs. Sponsors say onerous disclosure requirements, long vetting processes by listing committees and a reluctance to relax rules -- after recent clampdowns on backdoor listings -- are among the issues likely to inhibit SPAC takeup in the region.

""Unlike in the U.S., Hong Kong and Singapore undertake a qualitative review of whether a candidate is suitable to be listed, as they focus on shareholder protection,"" said Marcia Ellis, Partner of Morrison & Foerster. ""If there are too many safeguards in place, that decreases the advantages of a listing compared to a traditional IPO and this will dampen the appetite of sponsors and SPAC targets.""

Asia's approach is now becoming clearer. Singapore Exchange last week sought feedback on a new regulatory framework for SPACs that it hopes to finalize midyear. RegCo, SGX's regulatory arm, has proposed a minimum market capitalization of $300 million Singapore dollars ($222.6 million) for SPACs, with up to three years for blank-check companies to combine with a target.

Hong Kong, Singapore's main rival as an Asian financial center outside Japan, is set to unveil its own rules in coming months, people familiar with its plans have said.

In Japan, a government panel suggested in March that authorities consider whether to allow SPACs as a possible way of channeling capital to startups.

South Korea and Malaysia have both dabbled in blank-check companies on their stock exchanges, but have not seen the interest captured by the U.S. Refinitiv's data shows that as of March 30, only four SPAC IPOs in Asia this year have been registered on South Korea's Kosdaq.

""It takes time for investors to understand the product, and for the regulator to improve protection mechanisms for the SPAC investors,"" said Stephanie Tang, head of private equity for greater China at law firm Hogan Lovells.

Flush with cash eagerly seeking returns, Asia's investors are not waiting for Singapore and Hong Kong and are putting money into the U.S., with New York's Nasdaq drawing massive capital flows. For instance, almost half the funding for three of the recent Asia-sponsored SPAC listings in the U.S. came from Asia-based institutions, two people involved said.

""We are seeing and expect to see more activity among Asian SPAC sponsors and investors,"" said Gaurav Maria, Asia-Pacific head of equity-linked and private capital markets business at JPMorgan Chase & Co in Hong Kong.

SoftBank Group's Vision Fund listed three SPACs on the Nasdaq exchange in January and in March. The vehicles raised a total of $1.15 billion, including from the Vision Fund 2, which is so far entirely funded by SoftBank. They are targeting ""IPO-ready technology companies"" as acquisition targets.

Primavera Capital, a top private equity specialist in China, raised $360 million through a SPAC in January and said it will look to acquire a consumer sector company in China. Meanwhile, CITIC Group became the first state-owned Chinese company to do so, setting up a $200 million SPAC this year.

Arrow Capital, an investment advisory company, whose founder Rohit Nanani is Singaporean, and Silicon Valley-based Tribe Capital last month raised $240 million on Nasdaq for a technology SPAC.

""A SPAC is a liquidity driven product,"" said Nanani, in response to Nikkei Asia's queries on why he did not wait for SGX to decide how to handle blank-check companies. ""At this stage, there is a huge appetite and liquidity for this product in the U.S.,"" he said.

Vistas Media Capital, a Singapore-based media holdings company, also looked to New York for a SPAC deal as the parent sponsor for Vistas Media Acquisition Company, a Nasdaq-listed blank-check company. VMAC merged in March with Abu Dhabi-headquartered Anghami, a music streaming platform, at a valuation of $220 million.

Announcing its SPAC proposals, SGX acknowledged such transactions offered ""speed to market and ability to offer price certainty in valuing target companies."" However SGX also noted that risks included excessive dilution of shareholders and the rush to acquire target companies.

""We are therefore proposing measures to address these risks, with the aim of creating credible listing vehicles that will increase investor choice,"" said Tan Boon Gin, CEO of SGX RegCo.

A spokesman for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing said that while the bourse regularly looks at ways to enhance its IPO market, it will also strive to maintain ""market quality.""

Analysts and investors suggest technology companies will continue to prefer to merge with SPACs in the U.S., where they are part of a bigger peer group, while Singapore can aspire to become a hub for Southeast Asia startups, and Hong Kong for greater China targets.

""Ultimately, companies will still choose the SPAC to merge with based on the valuations and liquidity that they get after they become public,"" noted Mak Yuen Teen, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore Business School who specializes in corporate governance.

Craig Coben, co-head of Asia-Pacific global capital markets at Bank of America in Hong Kong, said that regional interest in SPAC deals, whether in the U.S. or locally, will increase.

""We are seeing significant interest from the Asian investor community, as they now understand the full value of the product and the efficient capital recycling it provides,"" Coben said.

Udhay Furtado, co-head of equity capital markets for Citigroup in Asia, said, ""SPACs as a form of capital-raising are here to stay in Asia for quite some time. More and more Asian sponsors getting interested.""

61,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Pick your doomsday: 9 end-of-the-world theories that will haunt your dreams - Salon,https://www.salon.com/2014/08/03/pick_your_doomsday_9_end_of_the_world_theories_that_will_haunt_your_dreams/,"Stephen Hawking once noted that Earth is a ""fragile planet,"" and if humanity does not find an alternative place to live -- somewhere in space -- we could be doomed. It is less of a rapture prediction than a reminder that resources are finite, there are greater forces than ourselves in the universe, and that we as a civilization trend on the self-destructive side of things.

Just this week specific studies about climate change, solar flares and the dinosaurs have been published. The common thread? Past, nearly missed, or future earthly destruction. Each one holds a lesson about Earth's fragility.

The following list is not intended as a scare-tactic lecture, but rather a look at how both we and the universe could shape humanity -- and its potential end.

1) Climate change

A new study published by Nature Climate Change has concluded that due to pollution, a shift to resource-intensive Western diets, and anthropogenic climate change, the Earth will need 50 percent more food by 2050 to feed the population. The problem? Our supply may not be able to meet the demand. As CBS explains, ""as our need for food rises, our ability to produce that food may be lowered by climate and air quality changes.""

The researchers found that global warming could reduce food production by 10 percent. Crop yields won't just be affected by global warming but also by the ozone layer. MIT associate professor and the study's author, Colette Heald, told CBS that crop production is ""very sensitive to ozone pollution."" Using a model that examined four major crops and air-quality projections, the researchers found that malnutrition in developing countries could rise to 27 percent, up from the current 18 percent.

Climate change could, of course, have other dire effects on our food production, including flooding and other extreme weather, like the current drought in California. ""Overall, climate change could make it more difficult to grow crops, raise animals and catch fish in the same ways and same places as we have done in the past,"" the EPA explains. ""The effects of climate change also need to be considered along with other evolving factors that affect agricultural production, such as changes in farming practices and technology.""

Climate change might not fully eradicate humanity, but crunch the numbers and the seriousness of the threat comes into view: Take a massive food shortage and combine that with unpredictable and violent weather patterns, mix in some geopolitical conflict (read: the possibility of all-out war) and you have an all-too-real recipe for global disaster of unprecedented proportions.

2) Pandemic

The most catastrophic pandemic on record was 1918's Spanish influenza. The virus, which at the time could only travel by ship or land, still killed 50 million people. Since then the global population has been hit with a series of contagions that have spread faster than ever before. The most recent was the H1N1 swine flu outbreak of 2009, and while it wasn't the pandemic to end all pandemics that some predicted, it was a wake-up call nonetheless.

Just this year, MERS has killed hundreds in Saudi Arabia, and Ebola has infected thousands across Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and killed more than 600, including top Ebola doctors.

How and why do diseases, particularly viruses, spread? The Guardian reported last year:

Viruses and other pathogens continually flow between species, often with no effects, sometimes mutating, once in a while causing illness. This mixing is known as 'viral chatter' and the more different species come into regular close contact, the higher the chances of a spillover event occurring. 'This is how viruses have always worked, the big change is us,' says Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh. 'The big change happened probably several thousands of years ago when we became a crowd species and that gave these viruses new opportunities which they hadn't had before in humans. Ever since then, from time to time a new virus has come along to take advantage of this new, very densely populated, crowded species – humans – that it can now spread between much more easily. That process is still happening; the viruses are still discovering us. We like to think we discover viruses, but it's also the viruses discovering us.""

3) Nuclear war

The days of Cold War-era ""mutually assured destruction"" might be long gone, but nuclear weapons still pose a grave threat to civilization. In 2012 the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and Physicians for Social Responsibility, who won a Nobel Peace Prize, released a study stating that famine caused by nuclear disaster could kill more than 1 billion people. The group subsequently updated this study a year later, because it underestimated the damage it would unleash on China.

""A billion people dead in the developing world is obviously a catastrophe unparalleled in human history,"" Ira Helfand, the report's author, told the Telegraph. ""But then if you add to that the possibility of another 1.3 billion people in China being at risk, we are entering something that is clearly the end of civilization.""

The above study focused mainly on nuclear war between Pakistan and India, where conflict, tension and nuclear weapons abound. However, Helfand tells the Telegraph that the result could be similar in any nuclear conflict. For example, nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia, he says, ""we are talking about the possible -- not certain, but possible -- extinction of the human race.""

The study found that particles kicked into the atmosphere from the weapons would reduce China's output of rice (10 percent over six years) and wheat (50 percent in the first year), and the U.S. output of corn and soybeans (10 percent in the first decade).

4) Solar flares

It was recently revealed that in 2012, humanity may have had a close brush with doom, all due to solar flares. On July 23, 2012, the sun belched one of the most massive plasma clouds ever detected with a speed of 3,000 km per second, according to the Guardian. That is four times as fast as a typical solar flare. The flare could have caused a massive blackout of satellite communications, power grids and electronic devices. And if the solar storm had occurred a week earlier it would have.

""If it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces,"" University of Colorado's Daniel Baker told the Guardian. Baker is part of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. ""I have come away from our recent studies more convinced than ever that Earth and its inhabitants were incredibly fortunate that the 2012 eruption happened when it did,"" he continued. ""If the eruption had occurred only one week earlier, Earth would have been in the line of fire.""

5) The ""Deep Impact"" scenario

According to the American Museum of Natural History, there are around 1 million ""near-Earth"" asteroids that could do serious damage to the planet if they hit. (Just ask the dinosaurs.) Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the threat and deflection of such a space rock below:

You can read about the threat of space debris in depth at NASA's Asteroid Watch.

6) The robots take over

At first glance the words ""robot apocalypse"" seem far more rooted in sci-fi than reality. However, as technology lurches forward, and artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated -- to the point of actually becoming self-aware and surpassing humans in terms of raw intelligence -- who knows what could happen.

The robot apocalypse might not look like a scene from ""Terminator,"" according to experts interviewed for a recent Business Insider. But they did caution that artificial intelligence was possible, and that we ought to have a plan in place for when it does. As Northwestern University professor John O. McGinnis stated:

Even a non-anthropomorphic human intelligence still could pose threats to mankind, but they are probably manageable threats. The greatest problem is that such artificial intelligence may be indifferent to human welfare. Thus, for instance, unless otherwise programmed, it could solve problems in ways that could lead to harm against humans. But indifference, rather than innate malevolence, is much more easily cured. Artificial intelligence can be programmed to weigh human values in its decision making. The key will be to assure such programming.

7) The ""false vacuum"" theory

Now we're really getting into wacky territory. Imagine a chunk of space that is totally empty, hence a vacuum. There are absolutely no particles, no matter, nothing at all occupying this particular piece of extraterrestrial real estate. You might reasonably assume that it is therefore at what physicists call a ""ground state"" (because there is no energy to disturb it) and that this space is totally stable as a result.

Well, according to one interpretation of quantum theory, this vacuum isn't at a ground state at all. It just seems like it is. Therefore, it is a ""false vacuum."" And the fear is that someday we might find that out the hard way -- with grave repercussions for our universe.

As the website Ask a Mathematician explains:

The “danger” of living in a false vacuum is that, under the proper circumstances the false vacuum can drop into the true vacuum ... If the difference in energy between the false vacuum and true vacuum is large enough, then the surrounding space can likewise be tipped into the lower state. In theory, a “false vacuum collapse” would expand at light speed (or about light speed) from the originating event, and destroy the heck out of everything in the affected, and ever-expanding, region.

Or, to put it another way, imagine you're living inside a bubble (like, a really big bubble) that seems like it's basically in a stable, ground state -- except the air pressure on the outside of the bubble (which you can't see or detect; the bubble is all that you know) is actually much lower than the air pressure within. If the bubble were to pop, you'd quickly find that the new physical conditions you now experience are dramatically different from the ones you had enjoyed within the bubble. Apply that same idea to our universe, and imagine how much it would change if something as fundamental as energy now acted completely different. Life, the universe and everything might just suddenly cease to be.

(It bears mentioning, as Ask a Mathematician does, that ""the idea of a false vacuum is wild speculation and that there is no indication, not even a little, that the vacuum of the universe is a false vacuum and not the true ground state."")

8) The ""gray goo"" theory

This theory is so supremely loopy -- it involves tiny, malevolent robots that assimilate everything in their path -- that we might as well just refer you to the loopy video embedded below:

9) The laws of physics play out exactly as planned

The fact of the matter is this: Someday our sun will burn out and take the Earth with it, effectively ending life as we now know it. Even if we've managed to keep ourselves alive long enough to achieve interstellar travel, and find a new home in the safety of some other solar system, that hypothetical star will also eventually burn out -- as will every other star in our universe.

If prevailing theories are correct, then the cosmos has in store for them a long, protracted demise -- known as ""the heat death of the universe"" -- in which the natural, overwhelming tendency of energy and matter toward greater entropy (i.e., disorder) proceeds to the point where even the atoms that make up matter will eventually break down into basically nothing.

The good news is that this (super-depressing) outcome won't transpire for something like 10^100 years. (That's 10 with 100 zeroes behind it, in case you were wondering, and it's an impossibly long stretch of time.) Plus, if we look even further into the future -- what would feel like actual infinity if there were anyone around at that point to feel anything anymore -- it remains possible that an entirely new universe could still spontaneously pop into existence.",2014-08-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['universe', 'space', 'viruses', 'theories', 'endoftheworld', 'false', 'climate', 'solar', 'nuclear', 'dreams', 'intelligence', 'vacuum', 'pick', 'haunt', 'doomsday', 'change']",China,news article,English

CAIRO - 26 October 2019: Director of the Egyptian Meteorological Authority Mahmoud Shaheen denied on Saturday what NASA had predicted of an ""unusual"" tropical cyclone unprecedentedly hitting some parts of Egypt.



Shaheen said that Egypt will not be hit by hurricanes but exposed to tropical depressions, which can be as violent and in-depth as the depression we are currently experiencing.



NASA published a picture showing block of giant clouds approaching Egypt amid warnings of heavy rain and thunderstorms on Friday and Saturday.



The Washington Post said NASA's image suggested an unusual tropical cyclone in some areas of Egypt and Israel, threatening storms and heavy rains and possibly even coastal flooding.



Risk areas



Shaheen said that the tropical depression between Cyprus and the Egyptian coast affects us with rain and wind, and this is what happened in the province of Alexandria this morning is scheduled to continue on the north of the Delta and the rest of the coast of Egypt Northern «Baltim, Port Said, Damietta, Ismailia, Arish and Rafah Central Sinai», these areas are experiencing rain on Saturday.



Shaheen confirmed that moderate rainfall is expected in Cairo and northern Upper Egypt.



The Egyptian Meteorological Authority (EMA) warned officials in coastal areas, Canal cities, Central and North Sinai to take the necessary measures to face the risks that may arise from floods.



Flights cancelled



The General Authority for Meteorology advised to cancel school and other trips to the governorates of the northern coasts, Delta, Canal cities and north and central Sinai on Saturday.



The authority also demanded the cancellation of safari trips and non-residence in the compounds in these areas in order to ensure the safety of citizens and to prevent traffic jams.



The authority also advise citizens in the governorates of the northern coasts, Delta, Canal cities, North and Central Sinai not to be present in places where there is rain as much as possible, except in case of extreme.



The Meteorological Authority called on the citizens to help the concerned authorities in removing the accumulated quantities of water after the rain falls and advises the Authority not to be present under the metal plates or next to the lighting poles and electricity kiosks.



Date of stabilization of weather conditions



The Egyptian Meteorological Authority (EMA) announces to citizens that as of Sunday, 27 October, the weather conditions will improve with light rainfall on the northern coastal areas and central Sinai.



Ashraf Saber Zaki, Acting Chairman of the Egyptian Meteorological Authority, said that the weather instability is expected to continue from Friday October 25 evening for 24 hours.



Zaki explained that the proliferation of low and medium clouds accompanied by rainfall and heavy and thunder on the northern coasts and Alexandria and Rashid and Baltim and Damietta and Arish and Rafah



Zaki said that the governorates of North Sinai, Delta and the cities of Ismailia Canal, Suez and Port Said reach the limit of floods, which leads to disruption of maritime traffic on the Mediterranean



Not out of homes



The cabinet instructed officials in Mediterranean, Delta, Canal and North and Central Sinai cities to raise the state of emergency to the maximum degree in preparation for instability in weather conditions.



The cabinet appealed to citizens to abide by homes on Saturday and count out except in cases of extreme necessity and commitment to drive vehicles quietly, especially on highways.



The warning concerned the people of the northern coastal governorates, the Delta, the Canal cities, and North and Central Sinai, in order to protect their safety and prevent traffic jams and to allow the concerned authorities to remove the accumulated quantities due to the expected heavy rains.



Flood Forecasting



The flood forecasting center affiliated to the Ministry of Irrigation reported that the maps of rain forecasting throughout the country during the next 72 hours showed the continuation of rainfall and may reach 20 mm on North Sinai and the Gulf of Suez and less severe on the northern and western coasts.",2019-10-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['sinai', 'north', 'egypt', 'central', 'northern', 'cities', 'weather', 'authority', 'rain', 'typhoon', 'meteorological', 'hit', 'official', 'canal', 'delta']",Egypt,news article,English
362,FL-2021-000025-AUS,How a Vet Hospital on Wheels Rescued Australian Wildlife During Floods - Atlas Obscura,https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/wildlife-rescue-australia-floods,"A providence petrel goes onto the X-ray machine. Some traumatized animals, including a tiny Gould’s long-eared microbat, are swaddled in towels. An echidna, or spiny anteater, has a tube attached to its long beaky nose. All these animals injured during the recent historic floods in New South Wales, Australia, and their care was in the hands of an expert veterinarian team at the Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital.



Days of relentless and heavy rains caused the worst flooding in decades on parts of Australia’s eastern coast. It has not only upended the lives of thousands of human residents, but non-human ones as well. “There are the clearly devastating problems for burrowing and ground-dwelling animals like wombats and echidnas that can quickly become trapped by flood waters,” Evan Quartermain, the Australian head of programs and disaster response for the Humane Society International, told The Guardian. “And aquatic animals such as platypus and turtles face major run-off issues and can easily be swept far from their territories.... The wild weather also creates havoc for birds that will struggle for shelter and have nests blown from trees.”

Creatures fleeing the rising waters to seek shelter can also be injured or killed in road accidents. The echidna with the tube “sustained horrific injuries” after being hit by a car along Broken Head Road in the Byron Bay region, according to the hospital’s social media account. Bree Talbot, the leading veterinarian at the mobile hospital at Byron Bay, used ultrasound to assess the condition of the creature, which sustained a wound under its porcupine-like spines.

Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital is not an ordinary vet office—it has a dedicated wildlife urgent care center on wheels. In fact, many wheels: The 22-wheel semi-trailer, more than 60 feet long, is Australia’s largest mobile wildlife hospital. Self-sufficient and furnished with state-of-the-art medical equipment, the trailer can be taken anywhere that Australia’s distinctive fauna need help.

The current crisis has it situated at Australia’s eastern-most point, where the veterinarian team are seeing increasing numbers of animals with injuries from the floods. “Treating injured and traumatized wildlife requires expert knowledge of their anatomy and physiology in order to triage and identify the problem, and provide appropriate treatment,” Talbot writes. “During a disaster like floods or bushfires, demand for services like ours is great, while the resources to source expensive medicines, supplies, and equipment needed to do our job is scarce.” Since the nonprofit hospital opened in October 2020, it has provided care, free of charge, for more than 500 creatures, and this flood will certainly increase that count, especially as clean-up and recovery from the disaster begins. Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital has been asked the public to be vigilant on the road and keep an eye out for injured or shaken wildlife, but “never drive through floodwater and never place yourself at risk or in danger attempting to reach wildlife in distress.” That could mean another rescue.

According to the Director of Meteorological Services Stella Aura, the outlook for May 2021 indicates that several parts of the Lake Victoria Basin region and Western Kenya; Central and Southern Rift Valley are likely to experience slightly enhanced rainfall.

Counties in the southeastern and North-eastern are likely to receive near-average rainfall.

Counties in the Coastal region are likely to experience below-average rainfall.

The distribution of the rain is likely to be poor in the Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, and the Coastal region.

Rainfall is expected to continue during the month of May in the Lake Victoria Basin; Highlands West of the Rift Valley; and Central and South Rift Valley.

However, the rainfall amounts are expected to be above average during the first half of the month and near average during the second half of the month.

The rains will continue into the month of June.

Turkana, West Pokot, and Samburu counties are likely to be characterised by near to slightly above average rainfall during the first half of the month.

Occasional rainfall is likely to occur during the second half of the month. The expected total rainfall amounts are likely to be near the long-term average for the region.

Above-average rainfall is expected during the first half of the month in the Highlands East of the Rift Valley and Central Kenya.

The rain is likely to be conducive for agricultural production, especially in the high-potential counties in the Lake Victoria basin Region, Highlands West of the Rift Valley as well as Central and Southern Rift Valley.

There is a likelihood of flooding in low-lying areas and flood plains especially over the Western parts of Kenya where occasional rainfall is expected.

Cases of lightning strikes are still likely in the Lake Victoria Basin and highlands west of Rift Valley and landslides may occur in the hilly areas of the highlands west and east of the Rift Valley.

Rainfall performance in April

April marks the peak of the Long Rains (March-April-May) season.

The month began with dry weather conditions over several parts of the country except for the Lake basin, highlands west and east of the Rift valley where occasional rainfall was experienced.

The most enhanced rainfall of 337.7mm was recorded at Suba station. This was followed by Kisumu at 276.9mm, Kabete at 272.3mm, and Kakamega at 271.3mm.

Other stations that recorded more than 200 mm include Kericho, Kitui, Kisii, Dagoretti, Kangema, Embu, Thika, Wilson, and Moi Air Base.

Several stations reported rainfall that was less than 100mm with Lodwar recording the lowest amount at 2mm.",2021-05-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['lake', 'west', 'rift', 'rainfall', 'long', 'likely', 'end', 'season', 'month', 'valley', 'weatherman', 'highlands', 'rains', 'expected', 'half']",Kenya,news article,English
677,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"Last place on Earth where tigers, elephants, orangutans and rhinos still live together is being destroyed - The Independent",https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/leuser-sumatra-indonesia-last-earth-place-tigers-elephants-orangutans-rhinos-live-together-deforestation-pollution-ian-singleton-a7677791.html,"It is the last place on Earth where elephants, tigers, rhinos and orangutans still live together.

But the Leuser ecosystem on the island of Sumatra – home to some of the world’s most ancient forests – is gradually being destroyed by giant corporations, a leading conservationist has warned.

A campaign called Love the Leuser has now been launched in an effort to ""save a global treasure"".

In an article for US News & World Report, Dr Ian Singleton painted a picture of the Indonesian area’s extraordinary natural beauty and its importance on a global scale.

“If the Amazon rainforests are the lungs of the Earth, the Leuser is its heart – beating with vitality for us all,” he wrote.

But he also described how “industrial” palm oil plantations, mining, logging, energy projects and new roads and infrastructure were “eating away at every corner of the ecosystem”.

“From its pristine tropical beaches to its rugged high mountaintops, the Leuser ecosystem pulses with life,” Dr Singleton wrote.

“It is the last place on Earth where Southeast Asia's most iconic species – orangutans, tigers, rhinos and elephants – still live side by side in the wild.

Recommended Indonesia could ban new palm oil plantations to stop forest fires

“To step into Leuser's steamy rainforests is to experience a serenade of biodiversity, a cacophony of buzzing insects, singing birds, croaking frogs, and loud-calling primates.”

Leuser, he said, was home to some 382 bird species, at least 105 different mammals and 95 reptiles and amphibians. It helped provide clean water for millions of people and acted as a massive store of carbon.

“But Leuser's forests face a growing threat,” the article continued.

“Despite being protected by Indonesian law, the ecosystem is under siege for short-term profits.

Why: epidemics of the phocine distemper virus are thought to have caused major declines, but the killing of seals in the Moray Firth to protect salmon farms may have an impact. Alamy Animals in decline African lion (Panthera leo) Where: Ghana. What: In Ghana’s Mole National Park, lion numbers have declined by more than 90 per cent in 40 years. Why: local conflicts are thought to have contributed to the slaughter of lions and are a worrying example of the status of the animal in Western and Central Africa. Animals in decline Leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) Where: Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Costa Rica. What: Numbers are down in both the Atlantic and Pacific. It declined by 95 per cent between 1989-2002 in Costa Rica. Why: mainly due to them being caught as bycatch, but they’ve also been affected by local developments. Alamy Animals in decline Wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) Where: South Atlantic. What: A rapid decline. One population, from Bird Island, South Georgia, declined by 50 per cent between 1972-2010, according to the British Antarctic Survey. Why: being caught in various commercial longline fisheries.

Why: Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing and trading of the species

“Corporate interests such as industrial pulp and palm oil plantations, mining and logging operations, energy projects, and all the roads and infrastructure that get built to support them, are eating away at every corner of the ecosystem.

“As the last remaining intact lowland forests and peat lands are being cleared, drained burned and carved up into smaller fragments, all of the region's threatened and endangered species, many of them endemic and found nowhere else in the world, are being pushed closer to the brink of extinction.”

He said the Sumatran orangutan could “easily become the first great ape species to go extinct in the wild if Leuser’s lowland forests and peat lands continue to be destroyed”.

And there were now believed to be just “a few hundred Sumatran tigers” and “even fewer Sumatran rhinos” in the wild.

“For sure, if we lose Leuser we will lose these species and countless others as well, forever,” Dr Singleton argued.

He called for people all over the world to help save the area.

“The ‘Love the Leuser ecosystem’ movement is a global effort to raise the profile of this amazing, unique, and totally irreplaceable place in the imagination of everyone, everywhere – to make it a global household name,” Dr Singleton wrote.

“A gleaming bright international spotlight on Leuser will send a clear signal to political and corporate decision-makers that the world won't tolerate its destruction.

(Photo credit: ANI)

The flood situation in Assam turned serious on Tuesday with over 62,000 people getting affected across eight districts.

The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said 145 villages are under water and 3,435 hectares of crop areas have been damaged.

The situation could turn worse as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast enhanced rain in the northeastern states including Assam in the next few days.

Around 62,400 people are suffering due to flood in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Barpeta, Chirang, Golaghat, Jorhat and Dibrugarh districts.

The ASDMA said authorities are running five relief camps and distribution centres in two districts, where 203 people have taken shelter.

Embankments, roads, bridges, culverts and many other infrastructure have been damaged at various places in Barpeta, Udalguri, Lakhimpur, Sonitpur and Jorhat districts.

Massive erosions have been witnessed at various places of Sonitpur, Udalguri, Jorhat and Barpeta districts.

The Brahmaputra river at Nimatighat in Jorhat, the Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat, the Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur, the Puthimari at NH Road Crossing in Kamrup and the Beki at Road Bridge in Barpeta are flowing above the danger marks, the ASDMA said.

The IMD said the North Eastern states are likely to experience enhanced rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rain in Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura during July 9-12.",2019-07-09 07:00:00+00:00,"['various', 'flood', 'affected', 'jorhat', 'districts', 'udalguri', 'sonitpur', 'assam', '62000', 'serious', 'barpeta', 'road', 'situation', 'asdma', 'districtsthe']",India,news article,English
1087,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Thousands await rescue in Mozambique after tropical cyclone kills hundreds - ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/International/thousands-await-rescue-mozambique-tropical-cyclone-kills-hundreds/story?id=61831507,"LONDON -- Thousands of people, some seen clinging to rooftops and tree branches, still await rescue from rising floodwaters in Mozambique, one week after an intense tropical cyclone walloped the southeast African nation.

Nearly 350,000 others are at risk of becoming trapped in the coming days as remnants of tropical cyclone Idai dump rain over low-lying areas already inundated with swelling rivers and bulging dams.

Some 100,000 people may need to be rescued from the town of Buzi alone, according to a spokesman for Mozambique's Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development.

""We have a critical situation in Buzi,"" the spokesman, who asked not to be named, told ABC News via telephone Thursday. ""If the rainfall increases, then those 100,000 need to be rescued. Levels of the dam are going high.""

The heavy rain let up in Buzi and the hard-hit port city of Beira on Thursday, but showers are expected to return in the coming hours and days. Aid agencies worry additional rainfall will impede rescue missions.

The cyclone made landfall near Beira late last Thursday and slowly moved inland over the weekend, leaving a trail of destruction across central Mozambqiue, southern Malawi and eastern Zimbabwe. The storm brought torrential rain and wind gusts up to 105 mph to the region, where drought conditions allowed for widespread flooding.

An estimated 1.7 million people were in the cyclone's path in Mozambique, which bore the brunt of the storm, while another 920,000 people in Malawi and ""thousands more"" in Zimbabwe were also affected, according to World Food Program spokesperson Herve Verhoosel.

Now, ""the biggest challenge"" is reaching stranded residents and others in need, Verhoosel told reporters Tuesday, especially in areas where overflowing rivers have created ""inland oceans extending for miles and miles.""

Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi declared a national state of emergency and three days of national mourning beginning Wednesday.

The storm has been blamed for the deaths of at least 217 people in Mozambique, according to the spokesman for the country's Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development -- though Nyusi has warned that as many as 1,000 could be dead. Another 1,440 people were injured, according to Mozambique's National Disasters Management Institute.

In Zimbabwe, at least 139 people have died, 144 others were injured, 136 were marooned and 189 were reported missing as of Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the country's Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting.

At least 56 cyclone-related deaths have been reported in Malawi.

Some 400,000 people were internally displaced by the storm in Mozambique, while an estimated 82,500 were displaced in Malawi, according to the United Nations. More than 4,300 were displaced in Zimbabwe, according to the country's Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting.

The United Nations' Central Emergency Response Fund announced Wednesday it has allocated $20 million to ensure aid reaches those most affected.

Jamie LeSueur, who is leading response efforts in Beira for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said while the scale of devastation is still emerging, the situation he's seen on the ground is catastrophic.

""This is the worst humanitarian crisis in Mozambique’s recent history. It is a humanitarian catastrophe for the people of central Mozambique,"" LeSueur said in a statement Tuesday. ""Large parts of Beira have been damaged, entire villages and towns have been completely flooded. Rescuers are scrambling to pull people trapped on rooftops and in trees to safety. Many, many families have lost everything.""",2019-03-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['tropical', 'mozambique', 'rescue', 'thousands', 'cyclone', 'hundreds', 'according', 'national', 'beira', 'storm', 'spokesman', 'zimbabwe', 'ministry', 'need', 'await', 'rain', 'kills']",Mozambique,news article,English
1741,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Act now to protect Indonesia's sinking cities from climate change - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20210329163742-dj8lq/,"* Any views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Heavy groundwater extraction, compounded by worsening floods as the climate warms, raises the prospect of lost land and forced relocation

Last month the Indonesian city of Pekalongan trended in the global media when severe river flooding caused a leak from a textile factory, turning the water a surreal blood red.

Bizarre scenes followed as children and people on motorbikes waded through the crimson waters, like a scene from an apocalyptic horror movie.

Had it not been for the arresting images, this would have been ‘just another’ under-reported local flooding event. But for the people in the area the reality is much starker, more chilling and potentially devastating.

This is because Pekalongan City and Regency, home to 1.2 million people, is sinking; just like the much larger metropolis to the west, Jakarta the capital of Indonesia.

As a result, the Indonesian government is faced with tough choices and in the case of Jakarta has plans to move the capital to the less populated island of Borneo at the cost of tens of billions.

Sinking cities, relocating millions of people and essential infrastructure. These are drastic measures, and at Mercy Corps we’re concerned with what’s causing them to sink.

In Pekalongan at least, excessive ground water extraction has led to rapid land subsidence. We know from our own research that land subsidence is occurring due to poor coastal management planning. The lack of clean water services is driving over-extraction of groundwater by communities and businesses.

The rapid and significant rate of subsidence has led to some areas of the Northern Java coast becoming water basins, with the land below sea level. In turn this has led to chronic and sometimes irreversible impacts of flooding, such as land permanently swamped with water.

Combine this with more intense weather-related hazards like flooding fuelled by the climate emergency and the prospect is permanently lost land as well as ruined lives and livelihoods.

In fact, since 2011, nearly 700 hectares of land in Pekalongan City and Regency previously used for farming and aquaculture is now permanently inundated. And as we reveal, by 2035, 90% of the city will be covered by water.

As land is lost, demand for fresh drinking water and food will increase, not least because the local population is growing by about 1% a year.

Villages in Pekalongan Regency have already been partially lost, too.

In one village called Semut, a total of 15 hectares is water-covered due to tidal flooding. The villagers wrestle daily with tidal floods and during peak season the water reaches 5 metres above sea level, forcing people to evacuate.

As you’d expect, this makes life for these people unbearable. It causes economic and non-economic losses, for example biodiversity, assets, cultural heritage, and health.

STARK CHOICES

Something must be done and we’re acting.

Through the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance program, Mercy Corps Indonesia works with the Pekalongan City and Regency governments to promote evidence-based policy making and program development.

Together we provide insight into how poorly planned development activities, like groundwater dependence for water supply in downstream areas, exacerbates flood impacts.

We also shed light on how current development practices in the downstream and coastal areas intensify the impact of city flooding.

All of this has serious implications for people’s lives and livelihoods. We expect to see a 100-fold increase in residential areas flooded in Pekalongan City and Regency in the next 15 years.

These alarming predictions leave the Pekalongan governments with some stark choices on how to deal with the loss of productive land and assets.

At a minimum they need a water resource strategy to reduce the rate of land subsidence; as well as plans to limit the impact of destructive water force in downstream and coastal areas and adapt to irreversible losses.

In addition, an environmental health strategy is needed to improve the quality of city-wide sanitation; not to mention social and economic blueprints to coastal communities and the fisheries sector. What’s also needed is a plan to promote better water and disaster management.

The severe flooding and loss of valuable land in Pekalongan should alarm the authorities of other coastal cities globally. They face uncertain and unpredictable futures due to climate change, too.

Assessments like our climate risk and impact analysis can provide evidence for decision-makers to better understand current and future risks. It can enable evidence-based policy and program development that sees climate financing (which is massively under-funded and not invested where it’s needed most, our research revealed) as an investment for sustainable solutions.

Communities face a difficult decision – to transform their livelihoods to continue living in flooded areas, or to relocate. Moving away from homelands with deep cultural and socio-economic ties is not a preferred decision for many. Decisions on who will be relocated, when and how will require evidence, cooperation, and transparency in decision-making and planning.

For communities to adapt to the environment, local officials and national-level governments need to make hard choices about how and where to invest in technology and nature-based solutions to protect people and the environment from more intense and severe flood events.

Will we rise to this challenge before rising sea-levels swallow coastal cities? Only time will tell.

CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday exchanged views on the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).

During a phone conversation, Shoukry voiced his concern over the stalled African Union-led negotiations on filling and operating the GERD, according to a statement.

Shoukry reviewed elements of Sudan's recent proposal, which was backed by Egypt, to develop the negotiation mechanism through forming an international quartet led by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the current chair of the African Union.

Under the Sudanese proposal, the international quartet will also comprise the United Nations, the European Union and the United States.

The Egyptian diplomat stressed the need to launch a serious and effective negotiation process that will result in a fair, balanced and legally binding agreement on filling and operating the dam.

He emphasized that the deal should be reached before the next flood season when Ethiopia will start the second phase of filling the mega dam's reservoir.

During the phone call, Guterres confirmed that the United Nations is available to support and participate in the African Union-led negotiation process on the dam, according to Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Guterres.

The UN chief expressed the hope that the process will count on the full engagement of the parties in a serious negotiation, said the spokesman.

Ethiopia started building the GERD in 2011, while Egypt is concerned that the dam might affect its 55.5-billion-cubic-meter annual share of the Nile water. Sudan has recently been raising similar concerns over the 4-billion-U.S.-dollar dam.

Over the past few years, tripartite talks on the rules of filling and operating the GERD, with a total capacity of 74 billion cubic meters, have been fruitless.

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Vietnam and local peoples generosity. Luu Thi Phuong , 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children, she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDPs 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet. UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam, she said.However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last years floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life, he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households, said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing.

733,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Missed Expectations and Disorder: The Dilemma of Political Response to Disasters - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/missed-expectations-and-disorder-dilemma-political-response-disasters,"Natural disasters — such as hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis — are often used as an impetus for massive policy shifts and redistribution of state resources. Often, sudden changes of government expenditure may contribute to public frustration, particularly when a state’s response to an emergency is seen as ineffective. Indeed, a commonly cited cause for public protest activity is poor state response to natural disasters. However, analysis demonstrates that even far-reaching political responses to natural disasters often provoke violent demonstrations, indicating that promises made during high-level visits in affected areas raise expectations among natural disaster victims. If those expectations are not then met, discontent can trigger episodes of riots and protest – regardless of the rapidity or quality of the response. Thus, ‘band-aid’ policy fixes are not enough to reduce riot and protest events in the aftermath of natural disasters: consistently inclusive and sustainable policies are required to effectively reduce those events.

This thesis is suggested by a larger qualitative comparative analysis study (Plänitz, forthcoming) which examines the level of demonstration events following 26 cases of flooding across the African continent: while ten of these disasters were followed by high levels of protest and riot events, the others were not (see map). In an attempt to examine these differences, a set of conditions and models are tested (see Plänitz, forthcoming for more information). The results suggest that in the ten cases with significant post-flood riot and protest events, high-level state institutions were quick to respond and pledge support. In cases without significant demonstration events, the response was considered more reserved, and high-level officials refrained from making financial pledges. Contrary to popular belief, the study suggests that prompt and substantial policy responses to flooding and other natural disasters may in fact provoke increased political disorder if not followed by action.

Flooding in the Ghanaian capital of Accra serves as a prime example of this phenomenon. The city experiences yearly flooding, leading to several affected communities within the metropolis. ACLED data and climate information gathered from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and the African Drought and Flood Monitor indicate levels of riot and protest events in Accra trend higher in times of abundant rainfall _(see graph below). _This phenomenon can be observed for the summers of 2014 and 2017, where above-average levels of public unrest occurred in the form of demonstration events during periods of high precipitation, even absent flooding. Figures on rainfall are given as 6-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is one of the most common climatological precipitation indices for the identification of precipitation surpluses and deficits. It serves to evaluate and characterize the precipitation ratios of a month, quarter or half-year in relation to the respective normal values. However, precipitation levels and even natural disasters do not result in increased protest and riot events. People do not protest natural disasters; they march to express their discontent with policies and actions taken by state institutions around the event.

Therefore, in examining the relationship between natural disasters and demonstration levels, policy responses – rather than the flooding itself – must be examined. Differences are evident when examining demonstration levels surrounding two floods in Accra – one of which is linked to increased demonstration levels, and one which is not. While in the case of the 2011 flood, administrative responses did not lead to civic unrest, there were higher-than-average levels of protest events in the aftermath of the Accra flood of 2015.

Due to heavy rain, large parts of Greater Accra and Eastern parts of Ghana suffered inundation in October 2011. Within Greater Accra, floods impacted residential and low-income neighborhoods from the East (e.g. Tema, Osu Klottey) to the West (e.g. Ablekuma) (NADMO, 2011). According to figures published by National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO), a total of 43,098 people were directly affected by flooding in the capital region in 2011(NADMO, 2011). In an effort to prevent future flooding, the national government made an appeal to the international community to refurbish Accra’s storm drains (Government of Ghana, 2011). President Mills visited flooded parts of Accra but refrained from making concrete statements on state support or relief funds. In the aftermath of the flooding, no incidents of riots and protest were reported to have occurred (see graph above).

Almost four years later, a period of rain in June 2015 submerged parts of Greater Accra near the Odaw drain (see map below). Among those badly hit areas that are marked on the map (see map below) were Kaneshie, Circle and Old Fadama (IRIN, 2015_; _UNCT, 2015). The Red Cross estimated that up to 46,370 people were affected in some way (IFRC, 2015). According to the Inter-Agency Working Group for Emergencies, 9,255 were displaced (IFRC, 2015) and 175 people were killed when a gas station, submerged in the flood waters, detonated. As a response to the flood, President Mahama promised 60 million Ghana Cedi (about 11 million USD) for relief operations and repair of infrastructure for flood prevention (Graphic, 2018). Later in June, a demolition exercise in Old Fadama initiated by the Accra city authorities to remove structures in flood-prone areas sparked clashes between police and demonstrators. Many of the residents did not receive financial compensation and were confronted with the decision taken by the administration. On June 22, riot police used tear gas and arrested 20 people (see graph above) in Accra.

The two episodes of flooding led to displacements and devastated communities in Accra but are different in a critical point – the nature of the political response. While many conditions in 2011 and 2015 were comparable – such as the presence of youth, political representation, or socio-economic inequality – it was the political response that differed. In 2011, President Mills avoided mentioning relief funds or concrete amounts of money dispersed to victims. During his tour to affected neighborhoods, President Mahama in 2016 promised 60 million Ghana Cedi and raised expectations among the affected citizens. This case study is one of 24 outlined in the larger research project (Plänitz, forthcoming), suggesting that protest and riots seem to channel anger resulting from missed expectations and discontent that were seeded by presidential visits and their unfulfilled promises. While it is certainly positive for administrative government to provide rapid and effective relief to communities victimized by natural disasters, the work does not stop there: the only real solution to prevent discontent, especially in the form of violent rioting, is administrative follow-through. Once promises are not transformed into a sustainable policy that improves the livelihoods of affected citizens, or once decisions around post-flood policy are neither based on inclusive processes nor designed in cooperation with local communities, the risk of protest and riot events prevails.",2019-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['dilemma', 'world', 'political', 'disorder', 'missed', 'events', 'expectations', 'riot', 'response', 'accra', 'natural', 'levels', 'protest', 'flooding', 'precipitation', 'disasters']",Ghana,news article,English
2183,FL-2017-000155-VNM,How flood protection can paradoxically put people at risk - Horizon,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/how-flood-protection-can-paradoxically-put-people-risk.html,"Professor Jeroen Aerts, a hydrologist at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in The Netherlands, says that when a city builds a defensive wall or dyke, it can make its citizens feel so secure that they actually flock to live or to develop businesses in the protected area. Whats more, they dont bother to install their own flood protection.

This means that when rare  but inevitable  extreme flooding occurs the damage can be colossal.

It is just one way in which flood protection modellers may be underestimating  and sometimes overestimating  the true consequences of sea level rise, says Prof. Aerts. And it is happening because physical scientists are failing to integrate human behaviour into their models.

Prof. Aerts leads a team that is trying to change this using the technique of agent-based modelling which attempts to reproduce complex phenomena like human behaviour. They use software that creates autonomous decision-making entities called agents, each of which assesses its situation and makes a decision based on a set of rules that have been drawn from survey data and decision theory.

Last year, they published a paper that underlined the problem of the safe development paradox. By modelling what is known about how humans behave when governments install flood protection where they live and work, the team demonstrated that the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas.

But the study went on to show that governments could largely counteract this effect if they simultaneously promoted policies that encourage people to flood-proof their buildings.

Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it. Prof. Jeroen Aerts, Vrije University, The Netherlands

Migration

Prof. Aerts believes that the failure of physical scientists to take human behaviour into account may also have led them to misjudge the degree to which flooding will drive migration. Whats more, it means they are not identifying precisely where it would be best to target help, because the models dont distinguish adequately between those who will manage to look after themselves and those who wont.

Sea level rise will, it is commonly predicted, displace 187 million people by 2100. But the figure, which comes from a 2011 study, is controversial.

Most modelling studies that deal with flooding risk or sea level rise use a top-down approach, said Prof. Aerts. You have long-term scenarios  like how many centimetres is sea level going to rise, and what will the exposed population be  and you try to estimate the impact. Then, he said, the models are rerun to include the effects of various adaptation measures, such as dykes or managed retreat, after which researchers do a cost-benefit analysis.

But, Prof. Aerts said, they forget about (asking) what is the probability that this dyke will be built? Or what is the probability that people will retreat? So they do not take into account the human behavioural factor which determines whether or not this measure will be implemented.

Natural scientists forget about the whole social science aspect of it.

Factors that get ignored include evidence that peoples decisions to migrate, or to stay and defend their land, vary with their wealth, age, risk perception, trust of government and attitudes to individual freedom.

Social scientists

Prof. Aerts says that his team is now turning the models on their head, in a new project known as COASTMOVE. They are integrating a global coastal flood risk model with an agent-based model to simulate how governments, private sector actors such as insurance companies, and individuals act and influence each other.

Another difference is that social scientists are feeding data into the project.

They provide me with the information about under what conditions are people going to implement a certain measure, from the individual level to the higher aggregate government level, said Prof. Aerts.

Some of this information is from pre-existing surveys on what drives people to migrate or otherwise respond to floods. The rest will be gathered from new surveys in six coastal areas in France, Ghana, the Marshall Islands, the United States, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Other, less traditional sources of information will come from data already collected via mobile phones, Twitter posts and even tax returns.

They will use data from Bangladesh, for example, where other researchers have been able to discover, from anonymised mobile phone data, how many people have fled from floods, where they travelled, and how soon they returned. They will also use data that Prof. Aerts has gathered over the last six years using algorithms to monitor tweets that mention the word flood, in 20 different languages. This provides daily flood maps that give a pretty good idea of where we can expect most of the problems, he said.

More data is coming from the United States where it has been possible to draw conclusions about migration after flooding from the location from which people have filed their annual tax returns.

Vulnerabilities

By simulating adaptive behaviour, the team hopes to provide more refined predictions about the degree to which sea level rise will cause migration  in the form of 1x1km2 global migration maps.

Dr Bina Desai, head of policy and research at the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, says that sea level rise will bring a variety of direct and indirect impacts, which will affect people differently depending on factors such as inequality and poverty, that are not adequately reflected in models.

Whats needed, if we think about risk of migration and displacement, is modelling with a less strong focus on the hazard and a stronger focus on underlying vulnerabilities and what exacerbates them, she said.

In principle, its the only way to do it, Dr Desai said of COASTMOVEs approach. Even as a conceptual model, she adds, it will help to work out how the many factors interrelate.

The downside is to move beyond the conceptual model, she added. If you want to translate that into numbers then (when we have tried it) we found we failed because all the inputs could not be populated with data.

But if they can find a way of doing it by (collecting enough data), using proxies and making assumptions and somehow modelling it out then I think thats great.

Just how are our seas changing and rising with climate change and the melting of Earths ice caps? This is the final story in a three-part series looking at the past, present and future of extreme sea level rise. In part one, we looked at what the last interglacial can tell us about extreme sea level rise and in part two we looked at rise of atmospheric meteotsunamis.

1997,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"As parts of Pakistan ban water-guzzling paddy, one farmer has a solution - Scroll.in",https://scroll.in/article/994235/as-parts-of-pakistan-ban-water-guzzling-paddy-one-farmer-has-a-solution,"The season for sowing paddy is about to kick off in Sindh. But the province in southeast Pakistan has banned rice cultivation in 10 districts on the left bank of the Indus river.

This ban is announced every year at the end of April or early May to limit the waterlogging, salinity and drought-like conditions caused by successive rice farming. By some accounts, rice cultivation has been banned in these areas for over 90 years. Similarly, the Indian government bans paddy cultivation in dark zones to help water aquifers.

Dark zones are areas of acute overexploitation of groundwater, due to the use of water exceeding its recharge. But these orders fall on deaf ears, as rice cultivation continues in large swathes of farmland in both countries.

Rasheed Channa, the spokesperson for Sindhs chief minister, said this time will be different. The government is dead serious about penalising those who violate the ban, Channa said. District administrations have already been told to be on the lookout for nurseries and raze the seedlings before they can be transplanted to flooded fields.

The news sparked considerable anger within the farming community, with farmers saying the governments timing and thought process were poor.

The growers were informed just a month before sowing that paddy will not be allowed, said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, senior vice-president of the Sindh Abadgar Board, an organisation formed to protect the rights of farmers in the province. They had not prepared land or bought seeds to grow an alternative crop.

Policymakers must realise that switching crops on more than 40,000 hectares after the season for other crops has passed is almost impossible, he added.

Even if 20,000 acres [8,000 hectares] are suddenly cultivated for other crops, where will we get buyers from? The prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits will fall, he pointed out.

Rice and water

While fears for livelihoods are valid, the ban underscores the governments growing concerns about water scarcity. The chief minister, who is a progressive farmer himself, said one kilogramme of rice requires up to 3,000 litres of water. Officials said water standing in rice farms for long periods of time has caused waterlogging, and that the high-delta crop also uses up other crops share of water for irrigation. Low-delta crops need comparatively less water.

As Pakistan grapples with increased glacial melt and erratic rainfall, managing the canal-fed, water-intensive rice crop is yet another problem. The issue is exacerbated by high demand and the fact that rice generates 8% of Pakistans income from exports.

Zahid Bhurgri, general secretary of the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture, a lobbying group for farmers, agrees that rice causes waterlogging and soil destruction. But he also said it is safe.

It is considered a safer bet, especially as we confront climate change [because of which] too much or too little water can destroy other delicate crops, like cotton, Bhurgri said. He added that rice is an easier crop to grow as it requires nothing but to be submerged in three to four inches of water.

Justifying rice ban

There will be 30% less water this year, said Sindhs agriculture minister, Ismail Rahu, to The Third Pole, justifying the ban on the water guzzler.

Though Rahu acknowledges that rice is the bread and butter of hundreds of farmers, he suggested they cultivate low-delta crops, such as beans, melon and vegetables, as they are less water-intensive and detrimental to the soil.

In many of these districts, the water that is available is of poor quality.

Zarif Khero, the chief engineer at Sindhs Irrigation Department, said the most important consideration is soil fertility, which is spoilt by rice.

The way [rice cultivation] is done by flooding the fields causes waterlogging, which will eventually turn the soil into wasteland, he said.

Finding alternatives

Rafique Suleman, a spokesperson for trade body the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan, sees the ban as nothing short of an atrocity.

Instead of providing incentives to grow more, the government is taking away our livelihood, he said. He pointed out that rice, Pakistans second-biggest export after textiles, annually brings in around $2.5 billion into the country.

There is similar resistance in India. Despite depleting groundwater in paddy farming areas, farmers do not give up rice because of assured buying from the states of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana.

The only way out, some say, is to give farmers incentives to grow something else.

Farmer with solution

This is where Asif Sharif, a progressive farmer from Pakpattan in Pakistans Punjab province, comes in. Sharif, an online sensation within the South Asian farming community, has a solution: if the rice has to be grown, it should happen without flood irrigation. According to him, the rice plant uses 70% of its energy just to survive the inundation.

Rice can be grown with minimal water, said the 70-year-old. He added that the ban in parts of Sindh is unnecessary.

Give it less water and the yield will be three to four times more, he said, adding that the soil should be kept reasonably moist.

Sharif grows a variety of crops on his 200 hectares of land and has thousands of farmers listening to his every word. He engages with the virtual community and gives advice to people from across the globe.

He has more than 24,000 followers, mostly farmers, including quite a few from Punjab on the Indian side. They share videos on his Facebook page, titled Pedaver, showing how well their crops are doing after they follow his tips.

Sharif said, everything can be grown anywhere.

He advocates for farmers to return to doing cultivation on raised beds, without tilling and using organic mulch. Paradoxical agriculture, or paedar qudrati nizam kashtkari as he calls it, is a comprehensive climate-smart production process total solution.

The process took several years to develop and mature, said Sharif. I started with the System of Rice Intensification in 2008. Then merged the crop system of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Conservation Agriculture by 2011. This is how the process evolved by 2014.

The results are impressive. In Punjab, we have reduced the production cost of wheat from 1,500 Pakistani rupees to 400 Pakistani rupees per 40 kg, he claimed.

And yet, he has been unable to bring about a revolution. He faults the farm munshi or manager for thwarting development. They get huge kickbacks by creating demand for each input that increases the cost of production, he said.

Farmers with huge landholdings are also to blame, he said. In connivance with corporations and businesses, they keep the rural population deprived of knowledge and therefore, prosperity, he said.

He talked of the need for a crop production management company that travels to different farmlands, teaching farmers how to grow certified crops that are exportable.

Zarif Khero from Sindhs Irrigation Department supported the idea of training. Farmers should engage with students from agricultural universities so they can transition to modern methods of sustainable farming which can result in better yields, he suggested.

Pakistan Should Replicate And Implement China Sponge City Model To Combat The Recurring Floods, Said Khansa Gulshad, A Second-Year Pakistani Phd Student In Flood Control And Management At Graduate School Of China Institute Of Water Resources And Hydropower Research (Iwhr) On Friday.

The sponge city project, also known as green development interventions and green infrastructure in other countries, is a new urban construction model for flood management, strengthening ecological infrastructure and drainage systems. The model has the advantages of alleviating urban flooding and water resources shortage, two chronic ills in Pakistan, Khansa Gulshad told CEN.

The heart of the sponge city construction lies in flood mapping. According to Khansa Gulshad, the purpose of the mapping is to locate the hazard- and flood-prone areas and find the proper site based on rainfall data, information of lakes and rivers and street views. Drawing on flood mapping data, different infrastructures such as wetlands, woodlands and permeable pavements are constructed accordingly which can absorb the water during rainy days and release water in case of drought.

The model holds great potential to ease Pakistan increasingly common urban flooding, such as the Karachi floods in August 2020, which took a heavy toll on people security and property. Khansa Gulshad emphasised the need for Pakistan to draw lessons and learn the latest technologies from China. With rich experience in flood control and management, China can help Pakistan develop the monitoring system to get rainfall data and river flow data to better harness floods.

She also expected more cooperation between Chinese and Pakistani universities in this regard to enhance Pakistan research prowess and help raise awareness of the sustainable green management of floods.

Khansa Gulshad obtained her master degree in geographic information engineering at Wuhan University. Her interest in flood control was spurred by her internship at the Pakistan Meteorological Department, where she acquired first-hand experience in flood projects. After graduation from IWHR, Khansa Gulshad aims to join an organisation such as the disaster management authority or the meteorological department to combat floods along with research.

KALPETTA: WHEN flash floods began swallowing her house at Vellamunda village in Wayanad on Wednesday, 67-year-old Bharathi could do nothing but scream for help. More than her own safety, she was worried about her bedridden husband. Thanks to a stranger, the couple was rescued and are now at a relief camp in Pulinjammal school. Bharathi, one of the 766 inmates at the camp, recounts with horror the shocking moments when disaster struck. “It was past 6 pm on Wednesday and it was getting dark. As usual, we were busy with routine work when we heard some noise. When we came out, water had almost covered the entire house.

Soon, it started entering the house. Thankfully, a stranger rushed in and saved us,” she said. Like Bharathi, almost all the inmates had similar stories to tell. Stories of how they battled various odds to stay alive. At least 2,000 people, mostly tribals, were rendered homeless in the flood. Fingers are now being pointed at the unscientific manner in which shutters of the 40-year-old Banasura Sagar dam, an earthen reservoir, were lifted without prior warning to the people living downstream.

KSEB, which manages the hydroelectric dam, opened all the shutters within a short time on Wednesday evening, leading to flash floods in the area. As a result, many areas under five panchayats came under water within minutes, forcing people to flee. Latheef, another inmate at the camp, said many families had a miraculous escape. “Usually, people go for work after leaving kids at home and return late. Fortunately, no one went for work on that day due to rain. It helped them save their kids,” he said.",2018-08-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['kids', 'floods', 'indian', 'leave', 'water', 'house', 'shutters', 'stranger', 'bharathi', 'hundreds', 'kerala', 'camp', 'inmates', 'express', 'colony', 'tribal', 'homeless', 'wayanad', 'work']",India,news article,English
1862,FL-2021-000038-KEN,The ties that bind a nation: Unifying narratives to the rescue? - The Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2021/0415/The-ties-that-bind-a-nation-Unifying-narratives-to-the-rescue,"Political leaders around the world, pressed by a pandemic that demands people think of each other, not just of themselves, are seeing to shore up the old unifying bonds, or to forge new ones. President Joe Biden looks to America’s history to foster a unified national spirit. His challenge is to root that spirit in today’s world.

Those bonds have been fraying for several decades. They have grown thinner, faster, as the internet, smartphones, and social media have nibbled away at shared narratives and created a more atomized landscape where we can each create our individual narratives.

The traditional shared narratives and institutions that used to bind societies together are losing their luster. Prompted by the pandemic, world leaders are seeking to engender a new sense of common purpose.

But Britons switched off in droves. One hundred thousand of them even complained to the BBC. Not because they didn’t like Philip, but because he was just the sort of old-style symbol that used to bind people together, but which no longer play that role.

Once upon a time, it would have raised no eyebrows. When Prince Philip, the Queen of England’s husband, died last week, the airwaves were filled for 36 hours with news coverage and admiring tributes.

It must have seemed simply the right thing to do. When Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died last Friday shortly before his 100th birthday, Britain’s broadcasters tore up their usual schedules. For 36 hours, they filled the airwaves with tributes, special news coverage, and a train of admiring retrospectives.

Yet a huge number of Britons turned off or tuned out. More than a hundred thousand went so far as to contact the BBC to complain.

This wasn’t out of personal animus toward Philip. Something deeper was at work, a trend that’s been developing for decades, not just in Britain, but in America and other countries. It has accelerated in recent years, and has now, with the pandemic, assumed critical importance.

Why We Wrote This The traditional shared narratives and institutions that used to bind societies together are losing their luster. Prompted by the pandemic, world leaders are seeking to engender a new sense of common purpose.

It’s the weakening hold of many of the old institutions, symbols, and traditions – and the shared narratives – that have helped bind people and nations together.

With the pandemic magnifying the need for individuals to care not just for themselves and their families, but for their fellow countrymen and women, political leaders are seeking to shore up these unifying bonds or to forge new ones.

In Britain, Elizabeth still enjoys enormous popular affection. Last spring, when Britain was under lockdown, COVID-19 cases were surging, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson had the virus, it was the queen to whom he turned to bring the nation together. In a rare televised address, she praised frontline workers, comforted the isolated and bereaved, and said, “I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.”

In the island nation of New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern drew on the pandemic challenge itself to forge a similar sense of unity, describing her country as a “team of 5 million.”

In the U.S., an early thrust of President Joe Biden’s has been to try to bridge the partisan divide with unifying themes: shared mourning for lives lost, for instance, and a message that harks back to an earlier era in American politics, that “there is nothing we can’t do if we do it together.”

Still, the old bonds have been fraying for a long time.

As news broke of Philip’s death, I was deep into a remarkable 750-page tome on America in the 1950s, the decade in which Elizabeth ascended to the throne.

The book is called “The Fifties.” Written by Pulitzer-winning journalist David Halberstam, it’s full of wonderful pen portraits of figures redolent of that era, from Richard Nixon and Joe McCarthy to Elvis Presley and Hugh Hefner. But the wider story is of a decade very different than it seemed.

Carolyn Kaster/AP/FILE A group of friends play music for passersby under cherry blossoms in Bethesda, Maryland. Shared values and narratives have been losing their influence over society, and in the face of the pandemic, world leaders are seeking to restore frayed bonds.

Yes, he writes, it was a time of growing affluence, a rising middle class, in which “few Americans doubted the essential goodness of their society.”

But not least because of the new impact of television – which initially reinforced a new, suburban vision of the American dream, but soon allowed more discordant narratives to emerge – there were the unmistakable rumblings of the wholesale challenge to accepted verities that would erupt in the ’60s. Also, the first stirrings of dissent and protest around a group then largely excluded from the national narrative: African Americans.

The centrifugal forces have only intensified since. If TV played a key role in the American ’50s, it was a minor tremor compared to the impact in our own century of the internet, smartphones, video streaming, and social media.

Like television, all these were initially expected to bring us closer together. They still can, and in some ways still do. But the shared narrative, the agreed story that we once told ourselves about one another as a community or country, has given way to a more atomized landscape in which we can each create individualized narratives of our own.

All that’s here to stay. But the pandemic has provided a powerful reminder of the importance of a shared story. Those countries that did best at containing the pandemic, such as New Zealand, galvanized a sense of common cause against a common challenge.

In those places that have done worst, like the U.S., appeals to citizens to protect one another as well as themselves by taking precautions such as wearing masks and social distancing have often fallen on deaf ears, with many individuals deciding to chart their own course instead.

Whether a new sense of common purpose will emerge – and if so, whether it lasts – is not yet clear. It’s telling, perhaps, that the most eloquent voices championing that cause have sought inspiration less in the future than the past. In her national TV address Elizabeth recalled how, as a young child, she had delivered a similar message to children separated from their parents by war in 1940.

President Biden, too, has looked to history for examples of a unified nationwide spirit. A few days ago, my old high-school friend David Ignatius wrote about Mr. Biden’s foreign policy in The Washington Post. His words could equally have applied to the president’s broader domestic message. He portrayed the president as “a genial, white-haired guy driving a Ferrari” whose ideas about the world were “rooted in the past.”

But he added, more hopefully, that this attitude was tempered by “a very modern view of the art of the possible.”",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['old', 'narratives', 'sense', 'world', 'unifying', 'ties', 'common', 'seeking', 'philip', 'rescue', 'nation', 'bind', 'pandemic', 'shared', 'leaders']",Kenya,news article,English
83,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"The swimming pool, symbol of Southern California, takes a dip - Los Angeles Times",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-social-pool-southern-california-20140731-column.html,"A couple of weeks ago, I hiked into a remote patch of the Mojave Desert hoping to experience a newly installed piece of experimental art.

Instead, I met a pool guy named Robert.

To be fair, I’d been warned that Robert might be there. (And the hike was very short.) My destination was “Social Pool,” an installation in the form of a white, covered swimming pool by an artist named Alfredo Barsuglia. Sunk into the desert floor in the southern Mojave, it’s 5 feet deep and measures a modest 11 feet by 5 feet.

Reaching “Social Pool” requires some of the map-tending detective work that is central to much of the land art that inspired it, including influential (and remote) pieces from the 1970s by Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, Nancy Holt and Walter de Maria.

First, you visit the MAK Center in West Hollywood, which sponsored the piece. There you pick up both a key to the pool’s cover and instructions, complete with GPS coordinates, about how to find it.

Officially, there is only one key in circulation at any time, and it can be checked out for a maximum of 24 hours. Since I was headed with some friends and family on a road trip that would take me through the Mojave (and ultimately to Heizer’s “Double Negative,” outside Las Vegas, and Smithson’s “Spiral Jetty,” on the northern lip of the Great Salt Lake, on the way to Wyoming), I asked the MAK staff if there were any way we could visit “Social Pool” even though I wouldn’t be able to return the key right away.

In the end they kindly lent me one of their spare keys, along with a caveat: On the morning I hoped to visit and swim in the pool, there was a chance somebody from a local pool-supply company would be there draining and refilling it.

I thanked them for the extra key, and I said I’d take my chances.

The ripples of a dream

For every family a house, with every house a garden, and in every garden a swimming pool: This was the postwar L.A. Dream reduced to its essence. What made the pool so powerful in the iconography of modern L.A. architecture is that it somehow managed to be both ubiquitous and exotic.

Think of the pool that Pierre Koenig hung from the hillside edge of the 1960 Stahl House, otherwise known as Case Study #22. Or the one Richard Neutra designed for his 1946 Kaufmann House in Palm Springs. Or pools behind ranch houses set into gardens designed by Thomas Church.

Often charismatically photographed by Maynard Parker or Julius Shulman, these pools were perfectly designed as aspirational features — glamorous but attainable — of Southern California domestic life.

Like the pools in paintings of Los Angeles by David Hockney, they belonged neither to plutocrats (like Julia Morgan’s ornate pools for William Randolph Hearst on the hill at San Simeon) nor to the city as a whole (like the images of Sutro Baths, the huge San Francisco public pool that burned to the ground in 1966, that hung in so many Bay Area houses of my childhood). They belonged to homeowners who were pretty much like you, except maybe a bit more stylish or luckier in career or real estate.

Still, the optimism inherent in that imagery has always been undercut by a different kind of L.A. pool. There is, of course, the life-size rubber horse, designed to look dead and bloated, that Tod Hackett sees submerged in a pool in the Nathanael West novel “The Day of the Locust.” (Instead of the elephant in the room, L.A. has the horse in the swimming pool.) And fetid or drained pools behind foreclosed houses. And the unpeopled blue ovals in Ed Ruscha’s “Nine Swimming Pools” from 1968. And the dead body in the pool at the start of Billy Wilder’s “Sunset Boulevard” (1950).

This darker, noirish view of the pool is ascendant again, helped along by worries about the environmental costs of private swimming pools in an era of drought and climate change.

The average L.A. pool, if left uncovered, loses roughly 20,000 gallons of water a year to evaporation; on an annual basis that’s far, far less than Angelenos spend watering their lawns, but hardly negligible either. As UC Santa Barbara media studies professor Dick Hebdige puts it in the catalog for “Backyard Oasis,” a 2012 photography show at the Palm Springs Art Museum, the swimming pool’s bright symbolism has dramatically faded thanks to “a growing awareness of the finite nature of water as a natural resource.”

“The private pool,” he writes, “is well on its way to outré.”

The California pools that have the most cultural power now are the ones that recapture some sense of public space or shared resources, like the restored Morgan pool at architect Frederick Fisher’s Annenberg Community Beach House in Santa Monica.

All of which leaves us to wonder: If we’ve run out of room, money or inclination to build new houses with pools out back, what becomes of the pools we already have? What’s the relationship between the backyard pool and the larger issue of how we use, waste, move or store water in Southern California?

Those questions help animate a sharp pair of shows organized by the Los Angeles Forum for Architecture and Urban Design and running through Sunday at WUHO Gallery on Hollywood Boulevard.

On one side of the long, narrow gallery are aerial photographs by Lane Barden of the Los Angeles River, the port and the full length of Wilshire Boulevard, collected under the title “Linear City.” The surprisingly intimate pictures of the river, in particular, suggest just how much our attitude toward it and toward the private pool have in common.

We wrapped the river in concrete in the 1930s. The backyard swimming pool, especially in a city facing the Pacific, is a similarly brash 20th century effort to cleave the metropolis tidily from the natural world, though at a domestic scale instead of an infrastructural one.

Increasingly that brashness looks misplaced or antique; instead we seem at the mercy of forces beyond our control when it comes to water, whether the result is prolonged drought or — as happened last week at UCLA — Pauley Pavilion flooded and looking quite a bit like a giant indoor pool.

On the opposite wall is “The Big Atlas of L.A. Pools,” a project by Benedikt Gross, a graphic designer, and Joseph K. Lee, a geographer, who decided a couple of years ago they wanted to document every pool in the L.A. Basin. They began by sending satellite photos of the area to an outfit in India, which for $300 mapped more than 43,000 L.A. County pools.

The strongest curatorial gesture in the “Big Atlas” is among the subtlest. Running along the wall are books filled with aerial photographs of pools: One book for each city. The cities with the most pools (Long Beach, Beverly Hills) are at the end farthest from the door, and as you move toward the front of the gallery the books get progressively slimmer. By the end they are more like pamphlets.

The way the books threaten to disappear matches the way that the swimming pool — like the surface parking lot, the freeway, the lawn and the single-family house — is rapidly fading as a symbolic and cultural marker of Los Angeles.

A pool runs dry

Robert was wearing a baseball cap, T-shirt, jeans, boots and sunglasses. He was standing right at the edge of Barsuglia’s “Social Pool,” next to an admonition in red letters reading, “Please respect and preserve the artwork.”

I introduced myself and the three people I was traveling with to Wyoming: my 10-year-old daughter, my friend Bill and his 9-year-old son. Robert’s presence, of course, meant that we wouldn’t be able to take a dip, which is the central attraction of this suburban pool in desert exile.

The kids were disappointed — they’d just changed into their bathing suits, and the temperature, at 9 in the morning, was nearing 90 — but contented themselves splashing in the inch or two of water that was left in the bottom of the pool.

Robert, good-natured about this interruption, explained that he worked for a pool-supply company in Joshua Tree, about an hour’s drive away. He said he came out once a week or so to clean “Social Pool,” which will be open through the end of September.

He was a perfect advertisement for the installation’s guiding themes, a walking symbol of the labor and energy required to keep pools full of pristine water in a climate like ours — and of the lengths we’ll go to swim in solitude.

Barsuglia asks each group of visitors to “Social Pool” to bring a gallon of water, to replace roughly what’s lost to evaporation while the pool is uncovered. I had that gallon jug in my hand when I met Robert.

Since he was working when we arrived I didn’t get to pour it in, a gesture, in this summer of severe drought, that must feel to other visitors to “Social Pool” like some kind of ceremonial apology to the watershed on behalf of 20 million Southern Californians.

But I did think, later on, of the famous lines from “Sunset Boulevard” about Joe Gillis, the screenwriter played by William Holden seen floating face-down in the opening scene: “The poor dope. He always wanted a pool. Well, in the end he got himself a pool. Only the price turned out to be a little high.”

Continuous heavy rainfall since July reached its peak in late September, causing severe and extensive flooding in 34 out of 36 states in Nigeria. Two major rivers, the Niger River and Benue River overflowed into the surrounding communities resulting in widespread destruction. The Nigerian government has declared a state of emergencies in nine states. The floods have affected 1.9 million people, destroyed 82,000 houses, displaced 210,000 people and devastated crops and livestock. Though flood water has receded in some communities, many people still do not have homes, businesses and farms to return to. They continue to seek refuge in schools and other public buildings where conditions are extremely poor. Fear of health outbreaks including malaria, cholera and typhoid remain high, as sanitary conditions have deteriorated especially in the temporary shelters.

Red Cross Actions

The International Red Cross has mobilized HKD 2 million from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to support the Nigerian Red Cross Societys immediate relief activities. An emergency appeal was launched on 21 September 2018 seeking HKD 43.7 million globally targeting to assist 300,000 people for nine months in 10 states.

Since the onset of the floods the Nigerian Red Cross Society has mobilized over 2,000 volunteers and supported affected communities with evacuations, search and rescue, distribution of food and essential household items, provided first aid, psychosocial support and sensitized communities on good hygiene practices.

2414,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Better planning might have limited flood damage in Brazil. But would it have been enough? - News@Northeastern,https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/01/31/better-planning-mightve-limited-brazils-flood-damage-would-that-have-been-enough/,"Historic rainfall in southeastern Brazil has created deadly floods and widespread destruction in a region that was experimenting with “more progressive” planning and zoning policies than most, says Northeastern political science professor Thomas Vicino, who studies metropolitan development and housing in Brazil.

Had they been fully realized, could those policies have reduced some of the destruction in Belo Horizonte wrought by the storms?

“Many people—and we see this in India as well as Brazil—live in informal settlements that are often built in precarious places, like mountainsides” Vicino says.

These communities are typically not zoned or overseen by any government agency, and they crop up as piecemeal settlements as a result of people moving from rural areas of the country closer to urban areas for work, he says.

“They are very susceptible to natural disasters,” says Vicino, who is a professor of political science, public policy, and urban affairs at Northeastern. In 2013, he led a Dialogue of Civilizations program in Belo Horizonte.

“Resilient, sustainable regional planning and approaches to development certainly help,” says Vicino, who spent a year in Belo Horizonte as a United States Fulbright Core Scholar, where he contributed to research on urban planning. “But the core issue is a political question: Does society have the political will to confront the realities of climate change?”

It’s been raining in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais for nearly a month, and Belo Horizonte, its capital, registered last week the heaviest rainfall in the city since it started measuring 110 years ago.

Cities and towns in the region have been washed out by landslides and floods, and thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.

Brazilian officials blame inadequate housing policies in part for the storm’s particularly high death toll, they told The New York Times.

The destruction underscores the need for cities around the world to implement “more resilient policies and more resilient [neighborhood] planning,” Vicino says—policies with which Belo Horizonte was in the early stages of exploring.

City officials had created a number of programs to bring those informal housing settlements (called favelas) into the fold by applying appropriate zoning regulations and adding municipal sewer systems, roads, and public services such as police and schools, Vicino says.

“This makes them more sustainable places to live,” he says.

But it’s not just these communities that are susceptible, Vicino says.

He says that “resilient planning” also involves officials creating fixed boundaries around development zones to protect open space and natural land. Paving over too much of the landscape or burying rivers and creeks in order to build over them, means that these natural water collection systems—soil and rivers—cannot do their jobs, Vicino says.

“It makes an acute event, like the storms we are seeing in Brazil, even more acute,” he says.

The sorts of long-term planning policies that Belo Horizonte and other parts of Brazil are implementing require support and funding that spans elected officials and administrations, Vicino says—support that can be difficult to achieve.

Any interruption to the process, including natural disasters, political upheaval, economic downturn, and social unrest, can derail it, he says.

“What we know is that we need more resilient policies, and more resilient planning for all types of neighborhoods and all types of people,” Vicino says.

1204,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Would flooding the deserts help stop global warming? - NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/would-flooding-deserts-help-stop-global-warming-n934551,"Imagine flooding a desert half the size of the Sahara. Using 238 trillion gallons of desalinated ocean water to do the job. Creating millions of 1-acre-square micro-reservoirs to grow enough algae to gobble up all of Earth’s climate-changing carbon dioxide. For an encore: How about spreading the water and fertilizer (the dead algae) to grow a vast new forest of oxygen-producing trees?

A Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Y Combinator, unveiled the radical desert flooding plan as one of four “moonshot” scenarios that it hopes innovators will explore as potential remedies to catastrophic global warming.

But would it work? And should it even be tried?

With unlimited capital and political will — both far from given — experts said the scheme would stand a chance of reducing dangerous greenhouse gas levels. But while they generally believe the climate crisis has become severe enough to push even extreme options onto the table, the experts cautioned against interventions that might create as many problems as they solve.

“We do not want to have this be purely profit driven,” said Greg Rau, a University of California, Santa Cruz climate scientist and part of the team that helped Y Combinator craft the request for proposals. “We are trying to benefit the planet, not just make money. So we need this kind of research and development first, but then oversight and governance over how any of this is deployed.”

The Y Combinator proposal grows out of what is now the consensus of climate scientists — that humanity needs to move beyond slowing the production of carbon dioxide and begin removing excess levels of the gas already straining Earth’s atmosphere.

The startup accelerator that helped finance Airbnb, Dropbox and Reddit asked innovators last month to come forward with specific proposals on desert flooding and three other extreme plans for reducing greenhouse gas concentrations. The existential threat posed by climate change requires research into solutions that the investment firm itself conceded could be “risky, unproven, even unlikely to work.”

Y Combinator said it had a rush of interest in its challenge. It declined to say how many took up the desert flooding option. But Sam Altman, Y Combinator's president, predicted that in 2019 his firm will fund three companies to pursue the “Plan B” climate solutions.

A host of scientists who have studied Earth’s ecosystems, climate change and bio-engineering said further exploration might be warranted. But they were quick to cite many reasons that desert flooding is not likely to succeed.

Massive size

Y Combinator called filling 1.7 million acres of arid land with 2-meter-deep pools of water “the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken.” Just to pump ocean water inland and desalinate it would require an electrical grid far greater than the one Earth now devotes to all other uses.

“It’s a desert for a reason,” said Lynn Fenstermaker, a research professor at Nevada’s Desert Research Institute. “Flooding the desert and then keeping the water there, in an already water-poor area with all the evaporation, is hard to imagine.”

Y Combinator doesn’t deny the magnitude of the challenge. “Economies of scale as well as breakthroughs in material science and construction technology will all be necessary for success,” its proposal says.

Unprecedented cost

Y Combinator pegs the price tag at $50 trillion. That’s roughly half the entire globe’s economic productivity for a year. Altman said in an interview that the cost for any solution will need to drop into the billions to become more realistic. “You can do a lot of things that require spending more money than you will ever be able to get,” Altman said, “and it just doesn’t come.” Brought to a more realistic price, he believes that governments will pay.

Destruction of unique ecosystems

Many species would be wiped out by massive man-made flooding of deserts. “People think there is nothing valuable in the deserts, but that is far from the truth,” said Henry Sun, a microbiologist and research professor at the Desert Research Center. “These diverse species deserve, and need, the desert to survive.” Most of the world’s countries would set a high bar, Sun said, before destroying habitat.

Potential for making things worse

Interfering with nature can have unexpected consequences. Katherine Mackey, a University of California, Irvine climate scientist, noted how Australia has long tried, and failed, to combat overpopulation of native species by introducing non-native creatures. Famous case in point: toads were introduced in 1935 to tame sugar cane-eating beetles. But the toads couldn’t climb sugar cane. So the beetles thrived, alongside their new neighbors — an out-of-control toad population.

“Saying that we intervened and created a problem with global warming, so let’s further intervene, that’s not the thing to do,” Mackey said. “That’s not how you fix the problem, by replacing it with another problem.”

Distracting from more workable solutions

Climate scientists believe that most, if not all, the needed solutions for limiting new greenhouse gas emissions and reducing current CO2 concentrations already exist. Environmentalist Paul Hawken has catalogued solutions in his Project Drawdown. Taken in total, Hawken has said, they would reduce emissions and sequester enough carbon to more than meet the goals laid out by world leaders in the 2015 Paris climate accord.

Among the carbon-sinking projects that would require little or no new technology: creating new forests in degraded pasture, farm and other land; criss-crossing fields with trees to create so-called silvopastures, which absorb far more carbon than open fields; and preserving and restoring peatlands, the boggy wetlands that store carbon at twice the rate of the world’s oceans.

“I think it’s far easier to, for instance, make our houses better insulated and solar powered, than to flood deserts. Also, from a timescale perspective, how quickly will this technology be available at scale?” said Mathis Wackernagel, president of the Global Footprint Network, an Oakland, California-based sustainability think tank. “If we want to solve climate, why not bet on the easy stuff?”

The case for a moonshot

Altman’s answer is that he and Y Combinator already support, and fund, pragmatic green energy companies. But big reductions in greenhouses gases are still needed and don’t appear to be coming quickly enough, the firm said.

Y Combinator suggests that flooding the deserts may be less risky than another solution on its list — fertilizing the oceans with massive amounts of iron or other nutrients to spur the growth of CO2-gobbling phytoplankton. Compared to ocean phytoplankton seeding, “doing so in desert reservoirs reduces systemic risk and exposure of the marine ecosystem to our widespread meddling,” Y Combinator’s request for proposals says.

“The window for easy solutions is already closed. Doing nothing is guaranteed suicide,” the firm said. Altman, 33, added: “All of this stuff is scary. However, runaway global warming where we all die is also quite scary. ...None of this is where we would like to be. But here we are.”

Activists and scientists interviewed by NBC News said exploration of far-out solutions is warranted — as long as researchers, governments and funders don’t lose focus on other fixes.

“The concern I have is that Silicon Valley seems very excited about these moonshots, when maybe what we need is a bunch of Boeing 737s,” said Armond Cohen, executive director of the Clean Air Task Force, a clean energy think tank and lobbying organization. “And to do it on a 10- to 15-year development cycle, not one that takes 30 years.”",2018-11-11 08:00:00+00:00,"['stop', 'desert', 'solutions', 'water', 'global', 'flooding', 'research', 'help', 'deserts', 'climate', 'far', 'firm', 'y', 'combinator', 'warming']",Egypt,news article,English

832,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Teenage Pregnancy On Decline in Central Region - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907100494.html,"Cape Coast — THE Central Region is making progress in its fight against teenage pregnancy as a trend analysis indicates that the prevalence has reduced by nearly 2,000 over the last five years.

From 13,355 cases recorded in 2014, it reduced to 13,014 in 2015, plummeted to 12,404 in 2016, declined further to 11,474 in 2017 and to 11,386 last year, per the Ghana Health Service (GHS) Antenatal Care (ANC) records.

Albeit the rate is still high, the gains being made helped the region drop from its long held apex position on the teenage pregnancy 'league table' to second place in the Ghana Maternal Health Survey ,2017.

Mrs Thywill Kpe, the Regional Director of the Department of Gender disclosed this in a presentation in Cape Coast on Monday during a field tour by a delegation from UNICEF, UNFPA and their partners to the region.

The three-day tour of the region, which started on Monday, is to assess the progress of a joint programme dubbed, 'Empowering Adolescent Girls through Improved Access to Comprehensive Sexual Education (CSE) and Rights-Based Quality Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) Services in Ghana' funded by Canada Global Affairs.

Began last year and running in 36 districts in eight regions, the three-year programme, is expected to improve access of adolescent girls, in and out of school, to gender-sensitive CSEs and SRH and help reduce adolescent pregnancy

The gains, according to Mrs Kpe were as a result of diverse factors including increased public education by the department, GHS, and other stakeholders in the region including programmes and interventions being implemented by UNICEF, UNFPA and other development partners.

Delving into the district breakdown of last year's figures, she said Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa had the highest cases of 18.23 per cent among the 22 districts, followed by Assin South with 17.99 and Agona East with 17.08, Awutu Senya recorded the least of 7.84 trailed by regional capital, Cape Coast with 8.12 per cent.

Mrs Kpe said in 2017, the GHS as part of efforts to get data on persons responsible for pregnancies introduced a data gathering initiative called, 'Who makes the adolescent pregnant' which revealed age, profession and marital status.

She said that year, 1,859 electricians were responsible for teenage pregnancy in the region, followed by small scale farmers (1,733); drivers (1,476); fishermen (696); masons (638); traders (493); unemployed (491); students( 319); with others including motor riders, small scale miners and tailors.

Mrs Kpe also touched on domestic violence, revealing that reported cases shot up from 2,666 in 2016 to 3,409 in 2017 and increased minimally to 3419 with non-maintenance and assault cases leading the charts over the three years.

On challenges being faced, Mrs Kpe mentioned inadequate logistics for programmes monitoring, non-availability of Police Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) offices in some districts, charges for endorsing medical forms for rape and defilement victims.

1871,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Judge instructs jury ahead of closing arguments in Derek Chauvin murder trial - Nasdaq,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/judge-instructs-jury-ahead-of-closing-arguments-in-derek-chauvin-murder-trial-2021-04-19,"By Jonathan Allen

MINNEAPOLIS, April 19 (Reuters) - Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill began instructing jurors on Monday before they heard closing arguments and begin deliberating on whether the way former Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin knelt on the neck of a dying George Floyd in last year's arrest was murder.

Prosecutors have told the jury they are weighing the guilt of only one man, but their verdict will nonetheless be widely seen as a reckoning in the way the United States polices Black people.

Chauvin, who is white, pushed his knee into the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old handcuffed Black man, for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020, outside the grocery store that had accused Floyd of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.

A bystander's video of Floyd begging for his life before falling limp scandalized people around the world. An image of Floyd's face has since been elevated to an icon for the largest protest movement in the United States in decades.

The Hennepin County chief medical examiner ruled Floyd's death a homicide at the hands of the police.

Prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general's office say Chauvin used unreasonable, and therefore illegal, force in compressing Floyd's neck and torso against the road in a way that starved him of oxygen.

Chauvin's lawyers argued that he correctly followed the training he received over 19 years with the Minneapolis Police Department, which fired him the day after Floyd's arrest, and sought to raise doubts about the cause of Floyd's death.

The judge defined some important terms for the jurors in the charges before them, such as ""great bodily harm"" and ""cause of death.""

""The fact that other causes contributed to the death does not relieve the defendant of criminal liability,"" Cahill said, reading from written jury instructions, copies of which were also provided to jurors.

National news networks carried live broadcasts of much of the testimony after the first of more than 40 witnesses took the stand three weeks ago, though the coverage was sometimes interrupted by fresh episodes of police violence caught on camera.

The closest instance occurred just a few miles from the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis when a white police officer fatally shot a Black motorist, Daunte Wright, on April 11 in the suburb of Brooklyn Center after trying to arrest him on the belief he had missed a court appearance. The officer, Kimberly Potter, had meant to use her Taser to stop him driving away but pulled out the wrong weapon, police say. She has been charged with manslaughter.

As angry protests swelled, Minneapolis and state officials have ramped up security precautions in the city. The tower in which the courtroom sits is ringed by barbed wire, high barriers and armed soldiers from the National Guard, and nearby businesses have boarded up their windows. Giant drab-colored military vehicles have become a common sight in city streets.

Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree ""depraved mind"" murder and second-degree manslaughter. He waived his right to testify before the jurors.

For the second-degree murder charge, 12 jurors will have to agree that prosecutors proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Chauvin committed a felony, in this case assault, that was a substantial cause in Floyd's death. They do not have to find that Chauvin intended to kill Floyd.

That crime carries a punishment of up to 40 years in prison, although Minnesota sentencing guidelines call for a shorter sentence of up to 15 years for someone such as Chauvin with no prior convictions.

Prosecutors have asked Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill to depart from those guidelines and give Chauvin more time if convicted.

If the jury delivers a guilty verdict, they will then be asked whether they agree with prosecutors that there were so-called aggravating factors in the crime, including the fact that it unfolded in view of several children on the sidewalk, including a 9-year-old girl who was the youngest witness to testify.

The jury, along with two alternates, is comprised of six white women, two white men, three Black men, one Black woman and two multiracial women, according to court records. Once they receive the case, they will be sequestered in a hotel outside of deliberation hours.

Stemming the tide

The federal Refugee Act of 1980 grants the president authority to admit refugees who face persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a certain social group.

The recent executive orders from President Donald Trump, aimed at temporarily halting immigration from several Muslim-majority nations, have focused attention on the tide of refugees to the U.S. The orders, challenged in the courts, are on hold.

The nations targeted in the orders — Iran, Iraq (which Trump removed from his second order), Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — account for some of the highest numbers of refugee and immigrant entries to the U.S. between 2007 and 2017.

PennLive looked at how many refugees, from those nations and others, came to Pennsylvania between 2000 and 2015. The numbers are based on those provided by the U.S. State Department and an analysis by The Associated Press of data from the State Department's Bureau of Population Refugees and Migration.

Refugee law

The 1980 act giving the president power to admit refugees also created the Federal Refugee Resettlement Program, a federally funded program that helps refugees become self-sufficient.

Once a refugee is vetted and cleared to enter the United States, the U.S. Department of State works with the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Pennsylvania Refugee Resettlement Program and local nonprofits designated as Voluntary Resettlement Organizations.

Between 2000 to 2015, Pennsylvania witnessed a migration of refugees from all over the world. Here are a look at the countries from which those refugees have come, and the conditions in their homelands that brought them here.

Bhutan, a small, impoverished country in south Asia along the eastern edge of the Himalayas, has over the past 15 years accounted for 9,447 refugees who have settled in Pennsylvania. While more than 2,600 refugees from Bhutan have settled in Erie, thousands have also made a new home in Harrisburg (1,097) and Lancaster (1,379).

South Sudan is now Africa's largest migrant crisis as more than 3 million people have either fled the country or become internally displaced.

Refugees to Pennsylvania - a total of 705 - have opted to live in Erie and Philadelphia for the most part. This many have opted for homes in:

Dangerous journey

Refugees from sub-Saharan nations - such as Somalia and Sudan - continue to face dangerous journeys as they flee famine and war. Erie, in particular, has seen an influx of refugees from Somalia, particularly in 2015 and 2016, with close to 400 refugees resettling there. Lancaster last year saw 103 Somalians choose to settle there. Camp Hill and Mechanicsburg counted a handful of refugees from Somalia.

Syrian surge

Last year 43,259 refugees from the countries named in Trump's orders arrived in the U.S. More than a third of them were Syrian. The number of Syrian refugees nationally increased dramatically in recent years: from 26 in 2007, to 247 in 2014, to 15,479 in 2016.

In December, government forces captured all parts of eastern Aleppo, bringing Syria's largest city to full control of Syrian authorities for the first time since July 2012.

With few exceptions, nearly all the Syrian refugees were fleeing a civil war that in some cases - like eastern Aleppo shown here, brought parts of the country to ruin. Russia and Turkey are largely leading peace efforts, but with the world remaining reluctant to donate the billions needed to rebuild, a political settlement in the war still uncertain and far off.

Syrian refugees in Pennsylvania

From 2015 to the present, approximately 1,204 Syrians have sought refuge in Pennsylvania. Some of the refugees have settled in the Harrisburg (68) and Lancaster (91) areas, but the most have settled in:

Erie: 363

Philadelphia: 289

Pittsburgh: 222

Allentown: 104

Displaced Iraqis

In the past two decades, millions of Iraqis have fled their homes, fleeing war, persecution and occupation. The latest wave of displaced Iraqis have fled the fighting between Iraqi security forces and Islamic State militants.

Relatively speaking, the tide of Iraqi refugees to Pennsylvania has been low, although in total, 2,749 refugees have resettled here.

Iraqi Christians

U.S. immigration authorities put the number of Iraqi refugees in the U.S. at 58,000 since 2007. When Trump signed his executive order, 25,000 Iraqis who had been approved to enter the U.S., were affected.

A total of 38,901 Muslim refugees entered the U.S. in 2016, making up almost half (46 percent) of the nearly 85,000 refugees who entered the country in that period, according to the Pew Research Center. That means the U.S. has admitted the highest number of Muslim refugees of any year since self-reported religious data became publicly available in 2002. Almost the same number of Christian (37,521) as Muslim refugees were admitted in 2016.

Busy year

Analysis by The Associated Press found that 2016 was the busiest year in the past decade for refugee arrivals from the seven countries originally included in Trump's executive order.

Egyptian swimmer Omar Sayed Shaaban soared to success when he set a new record for the highest jump out of water while wearing a monofin.

The 21-year-old from Ismailia reached the unusual event’s new best height when he made a spectacular leap of 7 feet 11 inches (2.3 meters), according to Guinness World Records.

A monofin is a single fin that fits over both feet.

Guinness World Records showcased Shaaban’s achievement Thursday in a TikTok post.

Shaaban powered past a record held since 2011 by three men, Italy’s Cesare Fumarola and Stefano Figini and Egypt’s Soliman Sayed, who each managed jumps of 6 feet 6 inches (2 meters).

Shaaban’s jump took place at an Egyptian Diving and Lifesaving Federation event in Cairo in November.

In a report published by the Guinness World Records, Shaaban explained the workout routine that gives him his merman-like abilities.

“Bigger muscles make it hard to sprint in water, so I work out to … increase flexibility, enhance muscle reflexes and of course build stronger legs,” he said.

Shaaban is also one of the world’s fastest underwater sprinters, the report said.

“Swimming is peaceful. A rush of unexplainable thoughts crosses your mind underwater, but it’s certainly different and healing,” Shaaban told Guinness World Records.

“As a sprinter, I understand that even thinking burns oxygen so I tend to focus on the present moment. Part of our training is to learn how to be extremely relaxed inside the water.”",2021-03-07 08:00:00+00:00,"['records', 'world', 'heights', 'water', 'egyptian', 'shaaban', 'report', 'swimmer', 'jump', 'underwater', 'sayed', 'guinness', 'takes', 'art', 'record', 'leaping']",Egypt,news article,English
1394,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Flooding in 4 provinces sparks evacuations - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/flooding-in-4-provinces-sparks-evacuations-1.4397911,"Flood-weary communities in Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec are preparing for a critical weekend as rising water levels force thousands to evacuate their homes.

Rain is expected in Ontario’s cottage country, stretching east into Quebec and Atlantic Canada.

Montreal, Ottawa and many smaller communities have declared states of emergency, prompting the federal government to deploy hundreds of soldiers to help with sandbagging and other relief operations.

“We’re all just putting our shoulder to the wheel in the most effective way, to make sure that the personnel and the resources are available to fight the immediate disaster,” Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said.

But worried residents are watching as water levels rise fast, with little respite in sight.

“We are watching the next system, possibly Wednesday into Thursday another huge system that will be sweeping across southern and central Ontario and southern Quebec,” Gerald Cheng from Environment Canada told CTV Toronto.

Ontario

The worst is yet to come for Ottawa according to Patrick Nadeau, executive director of Ottawa Riverkeeper, which works to protect the Ottawa River and its tributaries.

“What we’re seeing for the Ottawa area right now is that the peak is set to come around Monday or Tuesday,” he told CTV News Channel. The city issued a state of emergency on Thursday.

“Those levels could be over half a metre from what we’re seeing right now.”

Despite a night that gave Ottawa a break from rain, water levels around the capital region are expected to rise half a metre higher than they did during a 2017 flood that was thought to have been a once-in-a-century event.

Brian Streatton, engineering manager at the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority, told CTV News Channel that the river is the highest it’s ever been.

“People that live along the Ottawa River from Ottawa down to Montreal are getting flooding at the highest level we’ve ever seen,” he said.

“There was a high snow pack this year throughout the entire Ottawa River watershed and we’ve had some major precipitation events over the last couple of weeks.”

Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement forecasting up to 35 millimetres of rain in the Ottawa region.

Four hundred soldiers have been deployed to help battle the flood water. A large focus is being put on the Constance Bay area, which is considered one of the worst hit areas.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Constance Bay on Saturday morning, where he spoke with local volunteers. Trudeau and his two sons helped with sandbagging.

Dozens of volunteers, including players from the Ottawa 67’s hockey team, also helped with the flood relief. Others donated food to help those in need.

A morning report from the board that monitors levels in the Ottawa River near Constance Bay says water levels are just shy of their 2017 levels and are forecast to rise another 47 centimetres.

At a measuring spot near Parliament Hill, where paths and parking lots along the river are already underwater, the board forecasts a rise of another 75 centimetres before water levels peak on May 1.

Nadeau says flooding like this is becoming the new normal, adding that better coordination is needed.

“We need sustained investment in our conservation authorities that help to plan for these disasters.”

Increased winds also hampered sandbagging efforts, causing waves to crash over walls protecting homes. Ontario Provincial Police arediscouraging motor boats from goingclose to shore, after reports of wake causing additional damage to nearby homes.

Officials announced Saturday night that the Chaudiere Bridge over the Ottawa River would be closed as of 6 a.m. on Sunday,due to flooding and high waters. The Ottawa River is expected to rise another 55 centimeters by Tuesday.

Efforts are also underway to protect the Britannia Water Treatment plant, which purifies water for more than half of Ottawa. Ifflood waters block the road leading to the plantdeliveries of purifying chemicals will be haltedthreatening safe water supplies, officials said.

There are also flood warnings in several other areas of Ontario, which includes the province’s cottage country.

Bracebridge Mayor Graydon Smith asked cottage owners not to come to their properties to check for damage this weekend because there are a lot of roads closed.

""Don't try and be a hero,"" he said.

Bracebridge saw some snow overnight and about 34 mm of rain at nearby Muskoka airport.

Smith said the late-season snow is a welcome sight as it acts as a ""sponge"" for rising floodwaters that now mark a ""historical event.""

Property owners have been advised to wait until the emergency passes before checking on cottages.

Quebec

Rainfall warnings have been issued for the southern half of Quebec, with some areas expected to see another 60 mm of rain.

Water at the Chute-Bell dam, built in 1915, has reached levels expected once every 1,000 years, but Hydro-Quebec said it's confident the structure is solid.

Provincial police were patrolling homes and cottages along the Rouge River, about 140 kilometres west of Montreal, where 75 people were forced to evacuate over fears the flood waters could overwhelm the dam.

Meanwhile, soldiers with the Canadian Armed Forces were dispatched to reinforce a dike in Pointe-Calumet, northwest of Montreal, that was threatening to give way.

Quebec authorities said that as of Saturday morning, 3,056 homes across the province were flooded and 2,736 were surrounded by water.

About 2,000 people have so far been forced from their homes.

Just in the city of Rigaud, near the Ontario border, 685 people have left their houses where a mandatory evacuation order is in place.

Officials say by Sunday, water levels could surpass those seen two years ago.

Montreal and 13 others municipalities have declared states of emergency in Quebec.

Flood waters in Gatineau are expected to take weeks to recede.

Some 1,800 homes there are in the flood zone, with about 4,000 people at risk. Around 750 have asked for help.

Quebec's Public Security Minister Genevieve Guilbault said Saturday about 50 landslides have been reported across the province.

“The situation is changing hour by hour,” Stephanie Picard, spokesperson for Canadian Red Cross, told CTV News Channel.

The Red Cross has 10 centres across Quebec to help those affected by the floods, she said.

“Last night (Friday) we provided safe shelter for close to 500 people who had no other option but to turn to the Red Cross to have a safe place to sleep,” she said.

In Montreal, the Galipeault Bridge, which connects Ile-Perrot to Montreal’s West Island, is closed until further notice due to rising water.

In Rigaud and Point-Fortune, residents have been defying mandatory evacuation orders. According to Rigaud Fire Chief Daniel Boyer, only 10 out of 170 homes had been evacuated as of Saturday.

New Brunswick

Meanwhile, the Saint John River has been receding in Fredericton, where parts of the downtown core were underwater this week.

Geoffrey Downey, a spokesperson for New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization, said while it's raining across much of the province on Saturday, officials aren't expecting a lot of precipitation.

The Red Cross has registered 940 evacuees from 330 households in New Brunswick as of Friday afternoon.

Red Cross officials in New Brunswick said Friday 70 per cent of the people asking for flood assistance this year also asked last year.

Premier Blaine Higgs told reporters that with two floods in as many years it’s clear climate change is affecting flooding frequency, and his new Conservative government will take this into account in future planning.

The latest forecast predicts waters will slowly recede in most areas over the next five days.

Manitoba

In southern Manitoba, the rising Red River has forced some road closures and a small number of evacuations near St. Jean Baptiste but earlier predictions for major flooding between the U.S. border and Winnipeg haven't come to pass.

2202,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Guy Carpenter Launches Probabilistic Vietnam Flood Model - GC Capital Ideas,https://www.gccapitalideas.com/2020/11/09/guy-carpenter-launches-probabilistic-vietnam-flood-model/,"Guy Carpenter today announced the launch of its new Vietnam Flood Model. The fully probabilistic model provides countrywide coverage and enables insurers to assess their exposure to floods, which affect 70 percent of the countrys population.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue simulating both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding. The fluvial component of the hazard was developed using state-of-the-art hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate rainfall and river discharges across the river network in the country. Pluvial flooding is simulated using a proprietary, in-house methodology accounting for local climate conditions, soil type, land use and topography.

Offering enhanced flexibility, the model can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves, and average annual losses at virtually any level of aggregation. The model outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenters MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood, said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenters Asia-Pacific region. The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon. These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.

846,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Michael Pavitt: Can Lima 2019 help end Peru's Olympic medal drought? - Insidethegames.biz,https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1082773/lima-2019-end-peru-olympic-medal-wait,"Panam Sports officials have spent the majority of the week sounding relieved that despite significant issues in Lima 2019’s preparations for the Games, it looks as if the continental event will turn out all right in the end.

The impression appeared to be backed up yesterday when a Lima 2019 weakness looked to have contributed to the host nation enjoying double gold on the first morning of the Games.

Both the men’s and women’s marathons, it has been suggested, were moved from the end of the Games to the start to coincide with national holidays when the normally gridlocked roads of the capital might prove quieter and more manageable.

The result was an immediate boost for organisers, with Gladys Tejeda and Cristhian Pacheco’s victories in the two distance races giving the host nation gold medals.

The triumphs for Peru appear to have given the Games early momentum among the local population.

Another benefit was that Tejeda’s victory was a good story in itself, given that she saw her Toronto 2015 gold taken away over a positive drug test.

Whether you take the controversial view or the local Peruvian angle that Tejeda had gained revenge for being stripped of the title four years ago for an allegedly inadvertent case, it is clearly a positive for Lima 2019 that people are talking, writing and reading about the Pan American Games.

Pacheco certainly played his part by completing the marathon double, leading to front page spreads of the Peruvian runners standing next to the country’s President Martín Vizcarra on the podium, hoisting their nation’s flag.

The distance runner then gave further promotion to the Games today, when he suggested the event could have a lasting effect. Pacheco insisted success at a home Games would show that Peruvian athletes could compete for and win Olympic medals.

Following his comments and the subsequent standing ovation from local journalists, I was surprised to discover that Peru, remarkably, have only won four Olympic medals. Shooter Edwin Vásquez, who died in 1993, remains their only Olympic champion, his triumph coming at London 1948.

The other medals were a women's volleyball silver at Seoul 1988, along with shooting silvers at Los Angeles 1984 and Barcelona 1992.

I wonder whether Lima 2019 could help to end this drought.

You suspect the home Games could lead to a greater number of Peruvian athletes locking up Tokyo 2020 qualification places due to the benefit of competing in front of a home crowd.

After all, the early indicators are that the host nation will vastly surpass the three gold, three silver and six bronze they earned four years ago in Toronto, given the Peruvian team matched the achievement on the first day here.

Panam Sports Coordination Commission head Keith Joseph earlier this week did what sporting officials do regularly, as he suggested the Games would deliver a great future for young people.

“Our projects are meaningful, impactful and sustainable,” he said. “What we have here is a milestone that will impact the lives of Peruvians, impact the lives of the people of Lima and impact the youth of the Americas.”

The President of Lima 2019, Carlos Neuhaus, went a little further.

""Lima 2019 has consolidated a new generation of Peruvians with new facilities,” he said. “Let's take this opportunity to make sport the centre of our lives. Peru has as its new standard ambitious projects made according to our needs.

“We did it together, the success belongs to everyone, together we are achieving the most spectacular event in our history. We win together, united.""

Cristhian Pacheco claimed success at the Games showed Peru could produce Olympic medallists ©Getty Images

This is a topic that is contentious and used regularly by opponents to multi-sport events.

Events like the London 2012 Olympic Games have promised to inspire millions to get off the couch and become more active. But they have repeatedly been found to have had limited or no impact on participation levels.

Personally, I am unconvinced that the Peruvian population will suddenly take up sports like rugby sevens having had the opportunity to watch them at the Games.

I suspect the sports that were popular prior to the Games, such as football, will remain that way in two weeks’ time when the event draws to a close.

But if we focus entirely on a high-performance perspective, it seems possible that the Games could help Peru.

Neuhaus pointed out at the Panam Sports General Assembly that the Games had led to legislation being introduced to boost the provision of sport in schools in Peru.

While it might not necessarily lead to medal success in Japan’s capital city next year, you wonder whether it could lead to greater talent-spotting with potential stars of the future being found.

If we are to believe the hype from Lima 2019 and Panam Sports, the new venues are the best in the region.

Why then shouldn’t the facilities built for the Pan American Games here ultimately help to deliver long-term medal success for Peru at both Pan American and Olympic Games level?

This will undoubtedly be the long-term task for Peruvian sporting bodies, who will hope to utilise the facilities to bring back Olympic medals to Lima.

It will be interesting to see over the next couple of weeks whether Peru’s staging of the Pan American Games has led to new talent emerging with the potential of securing podium finishes at Tokyo 2020.",2019-07-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['drought', 'olympic', 'michael', 'pan', 'success', '2019', 'help', 'end', 'medal', 'lima', 'peruvian', 'peru', 'games', 'pavitt', 'impact', 'perus', 'gold']",Ghana,news article,English

With prices for top Bordeaux and Burgundy becoming prohibitive, investors should cast their eyes a little further north.

Investors looking for a more affordable way to get into wine should be looking at Champagne rather than Bordeaux or Burgundy, according to a London-based wine merchant.

Woolf Sung founder Sebastian Woolf says vintage Champagne currently presents the best value for money in the fine wine investment market, with a further 10 percent growth expected over the next 12 months.

""The world's top Champagne vintages, 1988, 1996, and 2002 have consistently shown great appreciation and continued steady growth over the years. Over a two year period to August 2014, these vintages have collectively risen 10.2 percent,"" he said.

With the investment market looking for alternatives to Bordeaux and increasingly unaffordable Burgundy, vintage Champagne offers volume production, worldwide distribution and prestige. According to fine wine exchange Liv-Ex, the Champagne index increased 11.9 percent between 2011 and 2013 and its share of trade increase from 1 percent to 2.3 percent.

Champagne is relatively affordable when compared to equivalent quality Bordeaux or Burgundy, with the average case price of top vintage Champagnes costing $2500 compared with Bordeaux First Growths and Domaine de la Romanée-Conti reaching $10,000 and $165,000 respectively.

""Champagne offers first time investors a lower entry point and seasoned investors value for money when diversifying their portfolios,"" Woolf said.

""Champagne is released when it is ready for drinking and is therefore rarely stored for long in cellars, vintages then become scarce and prices rise.""

He said Woolf Sung is focusing on sourcing and procuring these old, scarce vintages which present a 3-5 year investment; these bottles are being drunk now, so scarcity and – in turn – prices are ever increasing.

""1999 Pommery Cuvée Louise Brut Millésime, 2002 Salon Cuvée 'S' Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs, 2002 Dom Pérignon Rosé, 2006 Louis Roederer Cristal Brut are our top suggestions to look out for. A six-bottle case of the 2002 Salon is currently worth $2750, a low investment threshold, and we are predicting a 10 percent growth in the next 12 months.""

The Champagne market is quickly expanding beyond the traditional favorites, he added, and as the growing Asian markets increase their education in fine wine and look for further prestige, Champagne's appeal will broaden eastwards.

""With restricted production and increased consumption from growing markets, Champagne's consistent returns will continue and are likely to increase. We are focusing our efforts on sourcing rare and scarce bottles for our customers; these bottles are almost impossible to source directly from the houses or in perfect condition. The increasing interest in Champagne will ensure these bottles are more sought-after, inevitably increasing their value.""",2014-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['investors', 'burgundy', 'woolf', 'vintage', 'bordeaux', '2002', 'champagne', 'investment', 'bottles', 'wine', 'vintages', 'target']",China,news article,English

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Nigerien student Hachimou Abdou has had to catch a boat to classes since river water swamped his route to university in the capital Niamey - one of about 760,000 people hit by severe flooding in recent weeks in parts of West and Central Africa.

Floods are common during the rainy season, but in recent years climate change, land degradation and poor urban planning have led to more frequent disasters as rapidly-growing cities struggle with heavier-than-normal rainfall.

Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Congo Republic and Senegal are among those worst-hit this year, with at least 111 people killed, according to latest figures from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Waters have yet to recede in parts of Niamey since torrential rains in August caused rivers to burst their banks, destroying nearly 32,000 houses and 5,768 hectares of farmland across Niger.

I have to get to university - either I take a boat or I walk in the water, Abdou said, before settling into a traditional wooden pirogue to travel up the flooded highway.

Flooding across landlocked Niger alone has so far impacted nearly 333,000 people. Over 188,000 people have been affected in neighbouring Chad, with OCHA warning of potential food shortages due to inundated land.

With further rain expected, particularly in Central Africa, the situation is expected to worsen, said OCHAs director for West and Central Africa, Julie Belanger.

Communities ability to cope with natural disasters has been eroded by instability, food shortages and mass displacement in some areas. Over 25 million people are in need of humanitarian aid in the violence-plagued Sahel area, which includes Niger, Chad and Mali.

Many of those populations live in flood-prone areas. Its just a matter of time for them to be at risk of epidemics, Belanger said, describing how quickly diseases can spread once floods wipe out access to clean water and sanitation.",2020-09-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['recent', '760000', 'water', 'chad', 'university', 'central', 'floods', 'west', 'hit', 'parts', 'niger', 'severe', 'niamey', 'africa', 'shortages']",Nigeria,news article,English

More than a million people have been affected by flooding in northeastern India, where the death toll over the past week rose to 13, authorities said on Monday.

Flooding is an annual phenomenon in India's northeast, claiming hundreds of lives each year.

""The flood situation is grim in Assam. More than a million people have been hit by this year's"" rising waters, Assam Disaster Management Authority's state project coordinator, Pankaj Chakravarty, told AFP.

The state was first hit in mid-May when pre-monsoon rains arrived, causing floods that killed 11 people. Another 20 died in landslides caused by days of incessant downpours.

The floodwaters receded after a few weeks, only to rise again on June 22 at the start of the annual monsoon season.

Almost 29,000 people, mostly in rural regions, have been evacuated from their homes and brought to relief camps, officials said.

About 70 percent of Assam's World Heritage-listed Kaziranga National Park—home to two-thirds of the world's remaining one-horned rhinos—was submerged by the floods.

Park director P. Sivakumar said three hog deer died when they were hit by vehicles while trying to escape the inundation.

""With the water level rising, the animals are rushing to higher areas. Many of these animals cross the highway,"" Sivakumar told AFP.

The monsoon is crucial to replenishing water supplies in South Asia, but also causes widespread death and destruction across the region each year.

1969,FL-2020-000207-NGA,An Inland Delta Flooded - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147692/an-inland-delta-flooded,"Drought is a perennial problem in the semi-arid Sahel region of Africa. But in 2020, in Mali and other countries in West Africa, excessive rainfall has been the problem at times. Exceptionally heavy summer rains pushed seasonal floods on the Niger River and its inland delta to destructive levels.

After intense rains fell in July and August in the Guinea Highlands and overloaded many streams and rivers, it took several weeks for flood waters to work their way through the vast inland delta in central Mali. When the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite captured a natural-color image on October 29, 2020, water had spread widely across the nearly flat delta, which was once a lake bottom. Standing water appears black. Many flooded areas appear green because bourgou grass, rice, and other plants grow in the shallow flood waters. For comparison, the other image shows the dry landscape in May 2020, before the rains.

In late October, floodwaters reached their peak height at Mopti, a town at the confluence of the Niger and Bani Rivers. Water levels in the delta were recorded at 670 centimeters (22 feet) on October 26 and remained at that level until November 2, according to Malis National Directorate of Water Resources. That tied the peak water levels from 2018, the highest since 1969.

After November 2, waters receded at Mopti even as they continued to rise at points downstream such as Akka and Dir. It typically takes water a full six months from falling in the Guinea Highlands to reach the ocean at the Niger Delta in Nigeria. People watch the timing of flooding closely because it affects when rice can be grown, when fish will be available to catch, and when pastures can be ready for grazing. Water levels were expected to be low enough in mid-December 2020 for the annual cattle crossing on the Niger River at Diafarab. In the much anticipated event, nomadic herders drive cattle across the river toward rich grazing lands in the inland delta and are reunited with their families after months apart.

While seasonal floods are common in Mali, the severity of the floods this year caused widespread damage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 1,160 homes were destroyed by flooding.

Is the Bovespa – trading at record highs – an accurate picture of the country’s financial health? Or is it the currency that is the real indicator – languishing as it is north of $5.50 – a warning that the share prices have dislocated from their economic fundamentals?

Perhaps the country’s deeply real negative interest rates – inflation is over 5% and the Selic is just 2.75% – might be the biggest fraud, artificially pushing stocks higher and the real lower.

This banker inevitably went on to talk about Brazil’s gushing pipeline of equity issuance – R$100 billion is poised to be issued in the country.

Unless something happens to make markets snap shut soon, 2021 will be another record year – showing that companies are rushing to make hay while the sun shines.

So far, investors remain hungry, though there are early signs of flagging appetite as they demand discounts to participate in the latest wave of IPOs. The proportion of deals that are closing below the bookrunners’ pricing range is rising.

CNN is acknowledging it was ""inappropriate"" for its anchor Chris Cuomo to advise his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), on how to handle his sexual harassment scandal. The CNN host took part in a series of strategy calls earlier this year focused on how to respond after the New York governor faced allegations of sexual harassment, The Washington Post revealed on Thursday. These calls reportedly included the governor's top aide, communications team, lawyers, and advisers, and the CNN anchor urged his brother not to resign while citing ""cancel culture,"" the Post says. Chris Cuomo hosts a nightly show on CNN, and he said in March he could ""obviously"" not cover his brother's scandal on the air, though CNN would continue to do so. But Cuomo taking part in these advisory calls ""cuts against the widely accepted norm in journalism that those reporting the news should not be involved in politics,"" the Post wrote, with Columbia Journalism School professor Nicholas Lemann saying, ""If you are actively advising a politician in trouble while being an on-air host on a news network, that's not okay."" CNN in a statement to the Post confirmed that Cuomo, who ""often serves as a sounding board for his brother,"" participated in these calls and said doing so was ""inappropriate"" but that he won't be disciplined. ""It was inappropriate to engage in conversations that included members of the governor's staff, which Chris acknowledges,"" CNN said. ""He will not participate in such conversations going forward."" CNN previously faced criticism for allowing Chris Cuomo to interview his brother numerous times on the air early on during the COVID-19 pandemic last year. The network has said it ""made an exception to a rule that we have had in place since 2013 which prevents Chris from interviewing his brother"" during this time but that this rule has since been reimposed.

1417,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Back-to-back historic floods in Atlantic Canada force a climate reckoning - The Narwhal,https://thenarwhal.ca/back-to-back-historic-floods-in-atlantic-canada-force-a-climate-reckoning/,"There are no buildings left on the road to Darlings Island, a low-lying strip of asphalt that curves gently along the Hammond River in southern New Brunswick. The demolition crews may have knocked them down, but it was the floods that did them in.

In the aftermath of another spring of extreme flooding in Atlantic Canada, few places have been as physically changed as this roadway in Nauwigewauk, a rural community on the front lines of Canada’s changing climate.

“It looks like a nuclear blast site,” Paul Thompson, a retired firefighter who was one of the residents who lost their homes, told The Narwhal.

Where his house once stood, there’s a pile of gravel, surrounded by debris left behind when the water receded. His neighbours’ homes are gone, too. Most notably, the volunteer fire hall across the road and the Nauwigewauk Community Centre ⁠— a local social hub that had hosted countless kindergarten classes, dances, variety shows, Halloween parties, Beaver Scouts meetings and strawberry-shortcake socials since 1948 ⁠— have also been demolished.

After back-to-back historic floods along the St. John River watershed, this community and others like it in New Brunswick are being redrawn by backhoes, demolition equipment and government officials — who are now enforcing flood-plain building restrictions that went ignored for decades.

In Thompson’s case, the province bought his house, which he’d spent years building up to withstand floods, and sold it to the highest bidder for $5,000 — provided they moved it to higher ground. In its place, there are plans for a new road that would be raised 1.5 metres above the existing road.

People in the province are talking about climate change in a way they never would have a few years ago. For the second straight year, hundreds of homes were evacuated and long stretches of the Trans-Canada Highway were underwater. Even officials who manage flood response seemed surprised at the level of destruction this spring.

Many in the province say New Brunswick needs to start making hard choices about how to adapt.

‘Not even peaked yet’

“The world is changing. I see it every year,” Taya Wallace, president of the Nauwigewauk Community Club, told The Narwhal. “You see how it’s affecting things. It’s right in front of us here.”

In May, Wallace and her neighbours watched as heavy equipment knocked down their community centre. It was an emotional moment for some, including Wallace, who had her wedding reception and many family reunions there.

The decision to demolish the hall was made prior to this spring’s flooding that once again left the building half-submerged — something that only confirmed it was the right choice.

“It was devastating,” she said. “But we didn’t really have a choice.”

The building’s fate was sealed the previous spring, when Wallace watched as the river rose higher and higher over the covered bridge by her house. That wooden span, the postcard-esque entryway to Darlings Island since 1914, has long been a measuring stick for the annual spring thaw.

The last time the river was that swollen, Pierre Trudeau was in his second term as prime minister. Residents had to strap the historic bridge down to keep it from floating away. More than 45 years later, Trudeau’s son was calling that kind of extreme weather “the new reality.”

Residents on Darlings Island have grown used to becoming stranded from the mainland for days, their road vanishing under flood waters. When Wallace’s husband arrived by boat to report the community centre was also under water, she sensed that something serious — and unprecedented — was happening to her community.

“I remember Brent coming home and saying, ‘The flood, it’s in the hall, and it’s not even peaked yet,’ ” she said. “I just had this overwhelming feeling that we were up against something we’d never dealt with before.”

Average temperatures could increase by five degrees by 2100

New Brunswick, with its sprawling network of rivers, wetlands and low-lying communities, is grappling with an increasingly expensive flooding problem. The Insurance Bureau of Canada says flood claims paid out by insurance companies in New Brunswick grew from $59 million in 1996 to $144.3 million in 2015. That’s larger than the average annual flood payout for all of Canada between 1990 and the early 2000s.

For people who live in the province’s flood-prone communities, climate change has sparked a debate over costly mitigation projects, such as diverting water channels, building dikes or raising highways. Premier Blaine Higgs, a vocal opponent of the federal carbon tax, believes permanent fixes are needed — fixes like changes to building patterns and regulations around how close people can build to rivers.

Some argue the federal government should require homeowners move out of areas with repeated floods if they want to receive disaster relief funding. Critics say New Brunswick needs to become more proactive when it comes to climate change, instead of reacting once disasters hit.

The floods are only expected to get worse. The province’s legislative committee on climate change has computer models that predict New Brunswick’s average annual temperature could increase by as much as five degrees within 80 years. That means more intense rain and snowfalls, exacerbating the spring runoff.

Some residents are choosing to adjust the way they live, raising their homes up above high water marks. Others are simply leaving. In some rural communities, volunteer fire departments are offering to torch flood-ravaged properties to save on demolition costs.

Thompson believes homeowners should be allowed to build in flood plains, as long as they’re prepared for recurring flood waters. He believes the government’s response to chronic flooding, by expanding restrictions on building near water, is an over-reaction.

“Common sense has to prevail,” he said. “Look at Vancouver. They have houses on piers. Down in Louisiana, they have houses on piers. Our house was built on concrete, with blocks all around it. We felt we were protected.”

‘We’ve had water pretty much every year’

Nauwigewauk has always existed on a floodplain, but the severity and frequency of the flooding here is literally reshaping the community. Flooding that used to happen every few decades has become an annual event. That concern, for future floods, was a big factor in the decision to demolish the community hall.

“We moved here in 1974, and for 30 years we never had a problem. The last ten years, we’ve had water pretty much every year,” Nancy Thorpe, a Darlings Island resident and longtime volunteer with the community club, told The Narwhal.

“There were quite a few people who thought we could save the hall, and continue. But there was so much we had to mitigate and do to handle the next flood. Here was two years in a row,” Thorpe said.

“Whatever we would have done last year, we would have to do again this year.”

Thorpe points out life was already changing in Nauwigewauk long before the flooding. It’s been harder and harder to get volunteers for community events, and the club’s directors were already pondering a future without their landmark hall. But the flooding forced their hand.

In a province where one out of every six homes is built in a flood-prone area, thousands of homes and businesses have been affected.

As the waters receded from the recent floods, the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization warned cleanup efforts could be hampered by contaminated water that posed serious health risks. From plunging property values to depleted disaster-relief programs, the economic impact is significant.

“I feel bad for people who can’t sell their homes because of all the flooding,” Catherine White, who has lived on Darlings Island for 48 years, told The Narwhal.

“It’s just one of the things with where we live… When the flooding starts, you have to decide if you’re going to stock up on groceries and stay, or you find somewhere to live off the island for a while.”

Climate change increases risk of flooding, scientists say

Chronic flooding has people paying more attention to sudden flips in the weather here, such as some wild swings seen last April when the temperature soared from snowstorms to 26 C in a matter of days.

The rising waters can’t entirely be blamed on climate change, but climatologists say higher seasonal temperatures and precipitation certainly increase the risk of flooding. In Nauwigewauk, Darlings Island and many other New Brunswick communities, people say life is already changing, and fast.

“In 2018, everyone said it’s a once-in-a-century flood. It’ll never happen again. And sure enough, it did happen again. The very next spring,” White said.

“If you don’t think global warming is happening now, you’ve got your head buried in the sand.”

The UN World Food Program (WFP) reports that Mozambique is highly susceptible to environmental shocks, including droughts, cyclones and floods, which undermine economic development and damage livelihoods and infrastructure.

Furthermore, approximately 46 percent of Mozambicans subsist under the national poverty line, according to the World Bank.

￼Two consecutive years of El Niño-related drought in southern Africa ￼severely disrupted crop production and income-generating activities in many ￼regions of Mozambique; the crisis peaked in early 2017, when more than 2 ￼million Mozambicans were acutely food insecure.

￼- Although many households are recovering, food insecurity remains a ￼significant problem in Mozambique. Above-average harvests in mid-2017 will ￼allow most

*The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a standardized tool that aims to classify the severity and magnitude of food insecurity. The IPC scale, which is comparable across countries, ranges from Minimal (IPC 1) to Famine (IPC 5).

1286,FL-2019-000022-IRN,The unexpected cruelty of sanctions - The Week Magazine,https://theweek.com/articles/832533/unexpected-cruelty-sanctions,"Sometimes, as the leader of a global superpower, you very much want to coerce the behavior of another government, only to find your tedious public is not enthusiastic about the prospect of military intervention, probably because of the seven or so wars you're already fighting. A quandary!

Luckily for you, sanctions are a politically viable option instead. Especially when targeted at specific industries, state agencies, or officials, sanctions are cast as a shrewd and humane alternative to open conflict. We can make life difficult for corrupt politicians or halt oil sales or limit military build-up without hurting ordinary people, who likely have little control over their leaders' choices. All the coercion, none of the humanitarian consequences.

It sounds good in theory. It sounds clean and altruistic, foreign policy without the bloodshed. And though it's obviously true that sanctions do not mete out the direct damage of airstrikes or invasion, they are not the humanitarian alternative they're often made out to be. Even targeted sanctions can have grave unintended consequences for innocent civilians, as present circumstances in Iran and Venezuela reveal.

Drenched in heavy rains and spring snow melt, Iran is flooding. The country has suffered three major floods in the past two weeks, with 23 of 31 provinces affected as of this writing. Hundreds of villages and several cities are submerged. ""In [the provincial capital city of] Khorramabad the water has risen by as much as three meters in parts,"" state media reported Monday, and some areas are ""completely submerged with residents stranded on their rooftops."" Tens of thousands of people have been displaced, and dozens have died.

The death toll could well grow, partly because international aid has been limited. ""Two weeks into devastating floods that have caused tremendous losses and damages across Iran, there is still no report about other countries extending help,"" reports Radio Farda, a Persian-language subsidiary of the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. To all appearances, ""European states as well as Iran's neighbors, particularly the wealthy Persian Gulf states, have also not made any official offers of help,"" the story says, some Turkish charities excepted.

More help is not forthcoming, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, because ""challenges caused by unilateral sanctions will affect the U.N. response and the accountability of the U.N. to deliver the appropriate support."" The unilateral sanctions in question are those imposed by the Trump administration following President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.

In a tweeted statement, Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, made the same charge more bluntly: Trump's sanctions are ""impeding aid efforts by #IranianRedCrescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods,"" he said, an account the Red Crescent has confirmed, specifically pointing to limitations on Iranian access to the SWIFT banking system, through which the charity was previously transferring aid money to Iran. (Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said support could be directed to Iran's Red Crescent through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, but it is not clear how the transfer would happen in practice.) Zarif also claimed rescue helicopters are unable to reach flooding victims because sanctions have left Tehran's fleet in disrepair.

Half a world away, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela are indirectly worsening the chronic food shortages that are already starving Venezuelan children to death. ""Though the United States was not responsible for the collapse of Venezuela's economy — that was a pure product of Hugo Chávez's potted version of socialism — the sanctions it imposed on Venezuelan oil in late January could compound the humanitarian crisis,"" explains The Washington Post's Jackson Diehl. Oil exports are Venezuela's ""only significant source of hard currency,"" so as U.S. sanctions push export levels down, ""Venezuelan imports of food and medicine, already disastrously insufficient, will drop off a cliff.""

Removing these sanctions wouldn't magically restore Venezuela to abundance and stability — but neither will imposing them. Historically, sanctions have a pretty poor record of effectiveness. One study of 85 sanctions systems published in International Security identified just four successes. Sanctions are ""not likely to achieve major foreign policy goals,"" the survey concluded, but they reliably ""inflict significant human costs on the populations of target states, including on innocent civilians who have little influence on their government's behavior.""

U.S. sanctions on Iran never forced Tehran to democratize, but they did prove deadly for Iranian innocents long before this spring's floods. And in Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro has used U.S. pressure as propaganda to shore up his own power, depicting himself as a bulwark against the ""imperialist"" ""gringos."" What if the sanctions ""plan doesn't work? Suppose the [Maduro] government holds on, and then you've duplicated the suffering and you haven't solved the problem,"" Crisis Group analyst Phil Gunson, who is based in Caracas, told the Miami Herald. ""The prospect that it can be apocalyptic but not produce an outcome can be quite scary.""

Sanctioning Venezuela's nationalized oil industry, which supports the Maduro regime, or limiting Iran's access to international financial institutions to discourage nuclear weapons development may sound like straightforward ways to coerce bad actors in these two countries without harming civilians. But the reality of sanctions isn't that simple. They're often unintentionally inhumane and rarely effective.

Sanctions may be a lesser evil than war, but that does not mean they cannot be cruel.",2019-04-03 09:50:01+00:00,"['venezuela', 'floods', 'sanctions', 'red', 'cruelty', 'iran', 'oil', 'international', 'states', 'unexpected', 'humanitarian', 'irans']",Iran,news article,English
147,Drought Sri Lanka,National Strategic Review on Food Security and Nutrition – Towards Zero Hunger - Sri Lanka - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/national-strategic-review-food-security-and-nutrition-towards-zero-hunger,"Sri Lanka Government Prioritises Achieving Zero Hunger And Zero Undernutrition

COLOMBO – Concluding a three-day mission to Sri Lanka, the Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), Ertharin Cousin, joined government, civil society, the private sector, academia and the UN community in the launch of the National Strategic Review on Food Security and Nutrition – Towards Zero Hunger. Cousin praised the efforts of the Government to place food and nutrition security at the core of the country’s development agenda.

“This Strategic Review offers concrete short and long term recommendations for achieving zero hunger. The Sri Lankan Government has embraced the recommendations for addressing the food security and nutrition challenges created by recurrent droughts and floods,” said Cousin.

“Every Government official with whom I met welcomed the offer of assistance from WFP for meeting the needs of those affected by the most recent drought while also acknowledging the assistance and value of the Strategic Review in fulfilling the country’s potential to feed its own people. The Sri Lankan leaders I met are clearly committed to developing sustainable food systems,” said Cousin, after her meeting yesterday with President Maithripala Sirisena.

WFP and the Government are planning to expand existing cash and food for work programmes to support farmers and rural communities who risk falling deeper into food insecurity because of the current drought, which means the upcoming Maha harvest could be the worst main agricultural harvest in decades.

Latest estimates indicate that already around one million people across the country have been affected by the drought in the form of lost crops or income and restricted access to water. The Government currently estimates that some 480,000 food-insecure people will need assistance to prevent them spiralling deeper into debt, hunger and hardship.

Cousin attended the launch on Monday of Sri Lanka’s National Strategic Review on Food Security and Nutrition, the blueprint for the country’s ongoing efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2; end hunger, achieve improved food security and nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. The exceptional research effort was led by former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, chairperson of the South Asia Policy and Research Institute, and involved consultation with a wide range of stakeholders.

“This strategic review provides a framework for the partnerships across sectors that are vital to translate global aims into local actions. The Government has shown strong leadership in the review process but addressing the ambitious recommendations in the report will also require partnerships with private sector, civil society, academia, NGOs and the UN.

“WFP is also changing the way it works, and through its five-year Country Strategic Plan will seek to ensure its activities are closely aligned with the priorities set by the Government,” added Cousin

In her meetings with the president and cabinet ministers, Cousin discussed how WFP could support Sri Lanka’s efforts to create more robust, resilient food systems, to overcome climate-induced shocks that are increasingly frequent.

Cousin also traveled to Monaragala, one of the country’s poorest districts, to view WFP’s work to boost the resilience of vulnerable communities. She visited cash for work programmes involving organic home and community gardens and elephant fencing, designed to prevent the loss of lives homes and farms due to elephant-human conflict, which is likely to be exacerbated by the current drought.

The setup up steering so much rain into New South Wales is getting a fresh blast of moisture from the north, ensuring heavy rains continue. What’s worse, the area of rainfall is expanding and areas previously spared from the worst of the wild weather will now be in the target. The Bureau of Meteorology is calling for inland locations to receive up to a month of rain over the next 48 hours.

The agency is warning residents living in these inland parts of New South Wales that shifting rainfall patterns could create “life-threatening” conditions. Areas along the border with Queensland to the north will also see up to 7.9 inches (200 millimeters) of rainfall, and the agency has issued rainfall warnings for that state as well as the state of Victoria.

And, because, again, Australia can’t catch a break, there are spiders. The Guardian reported that residents of New South Wales have spotted droves of spiders and other insects fleeing en masse from the rising floodwaters.

The Buccaneers boss believes the standards set by the management will enable his troops to lift trophies this season

Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic believes the club’s solid leadership will pave the way to securing trophies ahead of the new 2019/20 Premier Soccer League (PSL) season.

The Serbian boss is yet to lift a trophy since taking over the coaching reigns at Mayfair two seasons ago, but he is confident his troops will finally bring a smile to their supporters.

“When I turn behind, there are things that are called trophies and there are some that are invisible and will leave a legacy even when I vacate my post from this great club,” Sredojevic said as quoted by Independent Media .

The Sea Robbers narrowly missed out on lifting the Telkom Knockout Cup title last season, where they marched to the final but lost to eventual champions Baroka FC on penalties.

“We are not thinking about anything that’s left behind, but we are fully thinking about the season that’s in front of us,” he added.

In addition, the former Uganda national team boss has been praised for reviving Pirates since taking over two seasons ago and helped the club to finish as runners-up to reigning PSL champions Mamelodi Sundowns.

After winning the CBL Cup by beating rivals Kaizer Chiefs last weekend, the Soweto giants are expected to challenge for trophies whilst looking to dethrone the Brazilians as PSL title holders.

""We have a leadership that’s pushing us to reach the criteria and standards, and once we do that, trophies will come,” continued the manager.

“It is there we shall then see what football will repay us with for the sleepless nights and enormous working days.

Their numbers are spectacular, at the height of their history, but we have the goal of always: make a great match, regardless of the stage. It will be difficult”. The coach did not want to analyze the situation of the possible sanctioning of Neymar and expressed his confidence in the squad: “We are more than capable to supply Busquets, it is normal for a player to see cards”

“Sergio Busquets is a crucial player for us; just look at his statistics and you will understand how important he is. However, suspensions are normal in a competition like this and we must be ready to replace him in the best possible way”. Enrique explained.

Regarding the final of Berlin, he has warned that “it is a positive memory, but it will have nothing to do with the final” and considers that the defeat of Malaga does not have to be a spur: “At this point the player already Is more than attentive. It’s very attractive the competition, and more face the semifinals, I do not think I have to see what happened before. ” He also believes that 6-1 has little to do now: “Notros we have no previous results, eight teams are in quarters and it will depend on who develops a better game, which is more successful in the areas … Of many details.

I have watched many Juve matches and they are always trying to impose their own game in every part of the pitch. They will do the same tomorrow, but you must put that question to Allegri. I can only tell you what we will do. We will try to win, as we always do. I have only good memories of my experience in Italy. I had the chance to experience a new culture which I enjoyed a lot.

There are a few different players compared to the Berlin final. Juve are still a great team, but I cannot say if they are better or worse than two years ago. I have great memories of that final, but this game is completely different. Both sides are definitely confident about their chances. I certainly don’t need to motivate players for a quarter-final against a team like Juventus.

He has defended André Gomes and does not think it fair to blame him.For him Barça played well against Sevilla and also in Malaga: “Both games were good matches. In Malaga we were higher and penalized a play in particular. The result was unfair. We can not go crazy when a defeat comes or when we win with clarity. ”

Although he must have a forecast that keeps for himself, he has not externalized what Juventus expects: “I have seen him press high, I have seen him withdraw .. dominate all records. I can tell you what we will do; Make our game, looking for victory from the beginning. “

On Sunday 26th July-2020 weather system brought heavy rains in Karachi. According to data provided by the MET Office, the highest rainfall was recorded in Gulistan-e-Johar, at 66 millimeters (mm), while 55 mm was registered at Old Airport, 55 mm in Pehlwan Goth, 42 mm in Malir, Saddar 43 millimeters (mm), while 26 mm was registered at Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Faisal Base, 22mm in Nazimabad, 12mm at PAF Masroor Base, 8.8mm at Karachis Jinnah International Airport, 3.1mm in Landhi, and 1.2mm in Surjani Town.

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), city received more than 80 mm rainfall in the third spell of the monsoon and more rain is expected in this season. The heavy to moderate rainfall caused flooding in low lying areas of the city and inundated several key roads, causing problems for the commuters as administration remained helpless and even absent at some locations despite a prior warning from the met officials. Nipa Chowrangi, Gurumandir Chowrangi, Shahrai-e-Faisal, Hassan Square turned into large water pools, as motorcyclists and four-wheelers could be witnessed trapped in water high up to knee-level. According to the initial reports from media and local communities, in many areas there is still stagnant water in streets and houses that overflowed from Nullahs. Those areas included Orangi Town, Khairabad Police Ground area, Ali Garh Market, Disco Morr, Islam Chowk, Bangla Bazar, Neepa Chowrangi, Gulshan-e- Iqbal, and Hyderi in North Nazimabad.

Root causes for the urban flooding in Karachi

In the last fourty years, Karachi city has been facings severe problems due to heavy rains in monsoon season as there are serious issues with the drainage system in Karachi. Despite accepting the brutal reality of the situation, one can not blame any institution but the responsibility lied with the Provincial government, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and District Munciple Corporations (DMCs) and private housing societies to keep clean the drains of Karachi and to drain out all the rainwater from the city.

In the city, as visible to all, width of many rain water drains and Nullah have been reduced, on many construcuton have been done, and most of them are choked with garbage. Information collected through different sources revealed that there are many structures and building have been constructed over the drain of Soldier bazar incuding two banks, gold shops / market, one section of girls high school, Shaheen complex, car parking area of supreme court, district NAB office, KMC market and Aurganzeb market. In Lyari, on Muhammad Shah road, part of Kakri ground, meat market and two masjids are constructed on one of the drain.

The width of the drainage of Manzoor colony on Korangi road has been reduced and near Qayoomabad, Defence Housing Authority (DHA) has constructed bungalows over the same drainage. Drain that starts from Cantt station to Clifton has a 50 feet width but due to construction of Jamat Khana, its width has been reduced to 36 ft, which drain out in Nahar e Khayam. Drain of Madina colony and Singer chowrangi are also in the same condition.

Width of the largest drain Nullah of Oragni town, has been reduced due to encroachment on both sides, thats why there was a flood in recent days because of heavy rains of monsoon. Width of Mianwali drainage has been reduced by soil pipe instaltions by KDA into it and now very little amount of rain water flows through it.",2020-08-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['mm', 'city', 'pakistan', 'need', 'assessment', '2020', 'water', 'drain', 'flooding', 'rapid', 'karachi', 'urban', 'market', 'width', 'reduced', 'drainage', 'heavy']",Pakistan,news article,English
1426,FL-2019-000179-CAN,How climate change gave added urgency to a $1.25B project to prevent flooding in Toronto - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-flooding-climate-change-1.5290037,"In May 2017, record-breaking levels in Lake Ontario left much of the Toronto islands underwater throughout the summer.

The following year, a powerful storm hit the city in August, dropping more than 64 millimetres of rain in just a two-hour span.

The rising water washed out roadways, backed up sewage, submerged vehicles, flooded basements, and trapped two men in a north-end elevator filled with six feet of water — leaving them only a foot of air to breathe when they were finally rescued by police.

Before many residents had finished clearing liquid muck from their homes, another round of torrential rain flooded buildings and basements all over again a week later.

Is this the new normal for residents in Canada's largest city?

""We know that storms are getting stronger. They're becoming more frequent,"" said David Kusturin, chief project officer for Waterfront Toronto, the organization tasked with revitalizing the city's waterfront area.

'We know that storms are getting stronger. They're becoming more frequent,' says David Kusturin, chief project officer for Waterfront Toronto. For Kusturin, bracing for the next crisis is top of mind as he leads a $1.25-billion flood-protection project in Toronto's Port Lands area. (Lauren Pelley/CBC News)

For Kusturin, bracing for the next crisis is top of mind as he leads a $1.25-billion flood-protection project in Toronto's Port Lands district, a man-made, 100-hectare contaminated chunk of waterfront property.

The massive, years-long effort will create a new river system capable of preventing catastrophic flooding in the surrounding area. And the project becomes increasingly important as the city keeps experiencing record-breaking lake levels and powerful storm systems, which city officials warn could get worse thanks to climate change.

For Toronto, preventing the next potentially disastrous flood is increasingly urgent. And it's a reality facing many Canadian communities as they try to brace for the impacts of a changing climate in the years ahead.

A city on alert

Three months after last year's double whammy of storms, flooding was on city officials' minds yet again as representatives from all three levels of government attended the groundbreaking for the Port Lands flood-protection project in November.

The project aims to prevent flooding throughout a nearly 300-hectare chunk of land surrounding the mouth of the Don River — a flood plain that's around the same size as the downtown core — while allowing for new development.

Dubbed ""one of the most ambitious construction programs in Toronto's history"" by Waterfront Toronto, the effort was more than a decade in the making.

""It was being developed for the 100-year storm,"" explained Coun. Paula Fletcher, whose riding includes the Port Lands. ""But we are certainly having storms that are very big, more often.""

There's growing concern among municipal officials that one-in-a-century rainfall events, such as Hurricane Hazel in 1954, could happen more often.

(CBC) The two graphs above are based on what the Climate Atlas of Canada calls a high-carbon scenario, which assumes that world greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase at current rates through the end of the century. (CBC)

Research, including a 2011 city report, suggests mid-latitude cities such as Toronto could experience fewer storms in the future overall, but those that hit could be more extreme.

""This may result in more severe weather occurrences, including extreme rain and snowfall events, as well as damaging winds,"" the report said.

This expanse, currently filled with heavy machinery, will one day be the site of a one-kilometre river valley in the Port Lands. The new river will connect with the Don River. (Lauren Pelley/CBC News)

Data from the city's resilience strategy, released earlier this year, also suggests the annual precipitation is expected to jump from around 790 millimetres to more than 850 millimetres by the year 2051.

And when it comes to heavy precipitation days — where more than 20 millimetres falls in one go — the number each year could jump from just over 6½ days to close to eight in the same period.

That's a particularly concerning trend for the Port Lands. The area is a huge expanse of concrete, built overtop wetlands once forming the natural mouth of the powerful, 38-kilometre-long Don River, which weaves through the city from the north.

During a major storm, water rushes down the river, and when it hits the Port Lands, an industrial area now mostly known for crumbling roads and dilapidated buildings, the water has nowhere to go, forcing it to surge into homes and businesses to the north and east.

""As soon as the first few drops of rain fall on the Don River watershed, it's like turning a tap on — the river starts flowing right away,"" said river science specialist Joe Desloges, a professor of geography and earth sciences at the University of Toronto.

""It's not just the fact you have an urban river that's very responsive to any weather event,"" he said. ""Now you've added the extreme event of climate change on top of that.""

Preventing disaster

To prevent a future disaster, hundreds of workers are spending roughly six years creating a new river valley.

""We are extending the Don River and creating new areas for the flood waters,"" Kusturin said.

Decked out in a hard hat and reflective vest, he's standing on ground that didn't exist this time last year.

The rocky area on the northwestern edge of the Port Lands was created by shipping in around 240,000 cubic metres of shale bedrock from other construction sites.

Along one stretch of the rebuilt shoreline, water flows from Lake Ontario through a grate — designed to keep out invasive fish species — and into a manufactured pond filled with dead trees, which will slowly decompose and create a new aquatic environment.

This area of the development will provide five hectares of land and shoreline, which will one day feature park spaces and wetlands — returning the area to its natural state while creating an elevated, protected area for new homes and businesses.

The project's goal is to protect a huge chunk of land from flooding by transforming the Port Lands from a concrete jungle to a river valley. On the northwestern edge, new land is being created by shipping in around 240,000 cubic metres of shale bedrock from other construction sites. Workers are also building a river to stretch across the area and collect surging storm water from the mouth of the Don River to the north.

Further east, an expanse currently filled with heavy machinery will be the site of the one-kilometre river valley.

The winding route will start at the mouth of the Don River at the north end of the Port Lands and stretch west, creating a new island ecosystem to the south.

What that means is river water will gain another entry point to Lake Ontario alongside the man-made Keating Channel, which requires water to make an unnatural, hard right turn before it reaches the lake.

Set to open in 2024, the river valley will allow flood waters to take a meandering course through a natural environment — and the banks will be reinforced to withstand fast-flowing waters if there's a big storm.

Workers using massive drill rigs are building the concrete supports for the river.

""We've been under construction on this part of the project for about 12 months ... the work that's happening all around us is constructing cut-off walls to act as structure when we excavate the river,"" Kusturin said.

That excavation will involve moving more than a million cubic metres of soil to build up the valley walls, elevate the land, and create wide swaths of parkland, he said.

When the project is finished, those involved hope the Port Lands will be transformed from a concrete wasteland to a new community, balancing natural and urban environments, providing a new space for living and leisure — and, most crucially, keeping the water at bay.

While there are years of work ahead, one climate change expert says Toronto's billion-dollar effort could inspire other cities.

Canada is warming at two to three times the rate of the rest of the world, said international climate change specialist Elliott Cappell, Toronto's former chief resilience officer, which means regions across the country need to be bracing for the impact of rising temperatures.

But the specific approach depends on the area, he said.

Most of the country's population lives in major cities, which could face issues like basement flooding and dangerously high summer heat in older apartment towers. In the coastal regions, rising sea levels pose a threat. In the North, the big concern is permafrost melting.

For Toronto, Cappell said, a single waterfront project won't change the grim reality — in the decades ahead, the city is going to get ""hotter, wetter and wilder.""

""We need to make climate change part of everything we do,"" he said. ""It has to be part of how we maintain our roads, how we plan our city blocks and buildings, how we maintain parks.""",2019-09-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['added', 'project', 'port', 'flooding', '125b', 'torontos', 'lands', 'waterfront', 'change', 'water', 'climate', 'toronto', 'city', 'gave', 'area', 'river', 'prevent', 'urgency', 'don']",Canada,news article,English
1698,FL-2021-000021-IND,Rescuers search for 171 missing people after Indian glacier causes devastating flood - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/08/rescuers-search-for-missing-dead-glacier-dam-india-north,"Twenty six bodies have been recovered in the Indian Himalayas and scores more people are still missing after a second day of rescue efforts after a glacier break that caused an avalanche of water and debris to engulf a river valley and demolish two dams.

A surge of water, thought to be triggered when a glacier broke off from Nanda Devi mountain in the state of Uttarakhand, left a trail of devastation when it hit on Sunday morning.

Authorities have said 171 people are still missing.

The force of the fast-moving flood waters obliterated two hydropower dams located along the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga rivers, where hundreds of personnel had been working. Several bridges, roads, homes and hundreds of grazing sheep, cattle and goats were also swept away in the deluge and two other hydropower projects were damaged.

Hundreds of troops, paramilitary and rescue operatives were brought to Chamoli district to recover bodies from the muddy aftermath. Much of Monday’s rescue operation focused on a 1.5-mile (2.4km) tunnel beneath the Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower dam, which suffered severe damage in the flash flood.

About 39 workers were believed to be trapped inside the 3-metre-high tunnel, which had become blocked with mud and rocks when the floods hit. Heavy machinery was brought in to try to dig out the entrance of the tunnel, working alongside rescuers digging manually with shovels. But as darkness fell, they had still not had any contact with those trapped in the runnel.

Vivek Pandey, spokesperson for the Indo-Tibetan border police, who are overseeing the rescue operation, said: “About 100 metres inside the tunnel is cleared and accessible, and it looks like about 100 metres of debris more will have to be cleared. This will take a few more hours.”

Earlier, 12 workers were rescued from a smaller tunnel beneath the Tapovan-Vishnugad dam. Lal Bahadur, one of the dam workers who was left trapped in the tunnel for almost eight hours, described the scenes when the flood water hit: “We heard people screaming at us to come out of the tunnel but before we could react, a sudden gush of water and heavy silt swamped upon us,” he said.

At least nine villages in the impacted Chamoli valley were cut off after several bridges were destroyed and supplies had to be dropped from the air.

Scientists and researchers were also airlifted to the site to determine the exact cause of the flash flood. LK Sinha of the Defence Research and Development Organisation told Indian media his team had done an aerial survey of the mountain area where the incident took place.

He said: “Prima facie it looks that a hanging glacier broke away from the main glacier and came down in the narrow valley. In the valley it formed a lake which burst later and caused the damage.”

Scientists said it was highly unusual for a glacier to break off during the winter months. But experts had previously said glacial melting because of global heating was expected to become a huge problem for the region in the next few years. A survey from 2019 found that glaciers in the Himalayas have been melting at double the speed since 2000, losing nearly a vertical 50cm of ice each year.

Dr AP Dimri, a professor at the School of Environmental Science at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said: “The Himalayas are a water tower. With increasing global warming, the upper reaches of the Himalayas are warming faster, leading to more rapid melting of the glaciers.”

On Monday, RK Singh, the minister for power and renewable energy, said a remote warning system would be set up to monitor glaciers in the region.

Activists and locals said the incident also demonstrated the risk being taken when building huge dam projects in the increasingly ecologically fragile Himalayan region. The state government is involved in a mammoth development push along Uttarakhand’s rivers to met the growing demand for hydropower in India, and there are more than 500 hydropower projects in the state.

Uma Bharti, India’s former water resources minister and a senior member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party, was among those who said they had warned against the building of dams in this area.

Manju Menon, senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, said: “One of the most unfortunate outcomes of the climate policy discourses globally has been a reacceptance of large dams by governments as a viable non-fossil fuel source of energy.”

She added.“This reacceptance is ironic because climate change has also made hydrological flows in the Himalayas erratic and unpredictable, in terms of the impacts on glaciers and monsoon patterns. Therefore, planning and implementing large engineering projects on himalayan rivers is fraught with great risks. Most scholars of Himalayan rivers have been warning about these risks for decades.”",2021-02-07 08:00:00+00:00,"['causes', 'glacier', 'flood', 'rescuers', 'devastating', 'himalayas', 'water', 'indian', 'missing', 'dam', '171', 'rivers', 'search', 'hydropower', 'projects', 'tunnel', 'rescue', 'valley']",India,news article,English
1100,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Nearly 2 Million Cyclone Survivors in Mozambique at Risk of Severe Food Shortages - VOA News,https://www.voanews.com/africa/nearly-2-million-cyclone-survivors-mozambique-risk-severe-food-shortages,"GENEVA - The World Food Program warns 1.9 million Mozambicans battered by two devastating cyclones earlier this year are at risk of severe food shortages without urgent international assistance.

Hundreds of people were killed, tens of thousands made homeless and livelihoods lost when Cyclones Idai and Kenneth hit Mozambique with devastating force in March and April. The destructive power of the two storms has wreaked havoc on the country’s infrastructure and agriculture.

Many crops that were about to be harvested and farm infrastructure were destroyed. The impact of these two disasters lingers on, threatening widespread hunger among survivors of these twin disasters.

World Food Program spokesman Herve Verhoosel says more than 1.6 million people are suffering from acute food insecurity and the worst is yet to come.

“It is expected that the upcoming lean season it will be very difficult in Mozambique with just below 2 million people projected to be in crisis situation if there is no humanitarian intervention before,"" Verhoosel said. ""The lean season is the period from October this year until the next harvest season in March 2020.”

Verhoosel says WFP is planning to assist more than 560,000 people every month through October in both cyclone and drought affected areas. He says his agency hopes to scale up its humanitarian operation when the lean season kicks in in October.

If the money is available, he says WFP will provide food rations to one-and-one quarter million people every month until March when the next harvest season begins. He says WFP will need slightly more than $100 million to implement its recovery plan over the next six months.",2019-07-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'nearly', 'cyclone', 'program', 'month', 'survivors', 'season', 'wfp', 'food', 'verhoosel', 'lean', 'million', 'risk', 'shortages', 'severe']",Mozambique,news article,English
