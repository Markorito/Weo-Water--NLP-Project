1186,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Measuring the Nile - EgyptToday - Egypttoday,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/15/16993/Measuring-the-Nile,"Nilometers were used in Egypt, particularly during the Pharaonic, Roman and medieval periods, to measure the Nile’s water level during the annual summer flood. Essentially, apart from such ritual functions they may have served in ancient Egypt, nilometers worked on the Goldilocks principle as far as the rulers of Egypt were concerned. If the water level in August–September was too high, the effects on the narrow band of fields either side of the river, and the surrounding infrastructure, would be devastating and there was no point sending out the tax collectors. If the water level was too low, the population would starve, and there was also no point sending out the tax collectors. If the water level was just right, a rich layer of alluvial silt would be deposited as the flood subsided, crops would grow, and off would go the tax collectors, no doubt singing merrily to themselves.The structures were of three types: a simple vertical column in the water (as in the medieval example in central Cairo, the modern ornate housing of which is pictured above); a well with a culvert to the Nile (as, supposedly, at Kom Ombo temple, although this may simply be a well rather than a measuring device); or a set of steps cut into the bank (as at Elephantine Island, Aswan). Each was calibrated in Egyptian cubits (roughly 54 centimeters or 21 inches) subdivided into seven palms, and then into four fingers.The medieval nilometer at the end of Roda Island in Cairo—though of the simplest type—is particularly beautiful with its nineteenth-century Turkish conical roof, though, as a rather small uninteresting building from the outside, it is often overlooked even by those who have lived in Cairo all their lives.Standing on the site of an older building (destroyed in AD 850, ironically enough, by the Nile’s flood) from AD 715, and probably on the site of a Pharaonic nilometer, the current structure dates to 861, when it was ordered to be built by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil under the direction of Ahmad ibn Muhammad Al-Hasib. It was restored by Ibn Tulun in 872–73, and again in 1092 by the Fatimid caliph Al-Mustansir.The architect of the existing structure, Abu’l ‘Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathir Al-Farghani—rather more pithily known in the west as the astronomer Alfraganus—was a native of Farghana, in West Turkistan (now Uzbekistan), an important staging post on the North Silk Road from Xi’an. There is a statue dedicated to him at the entrance to the Roda Island site.Alfraganus’s design was quite straightforward. Three tunnels at different heights lead in from the river to the east into a stone-lined pit around a central marble column, resting on a large millstone and capped with a Corinthian capital, marked in 19 cubits. Thus, the nilometer was capable of measuring a flood of 9.2 meters. If the flood measured much below 16 cubits, it was too low, and if it measured above 19, it was too high.In the days immediately preceding the maximum flood, the column was anointed with saffron and musk in order to help induce the most beneficial water level.In addition, around the top of the pit are talismanic Qur’anic inscriptions in Kufic script (said to be the earliest surviving examples of architectural epigraphy in Egypt):“We sent down water from heaven as a blessing, causing gardens to grow, and grain for harvest” (50:9).“See you not how God sends down water from heaven so that the earth becomes green?” (22:63).At one time, a short dedicatory inscription, indicating that the nilometer was built in 861, completed the frieze. This was removed in 872 and replaced by more Qur’an inscriptions, probably by Ibn Tulun as a means of asserting his independence from Abbasid Baghdad.The stone-lined pit—circular at the bottom and rectangular at the top—is accessed by a staircase hugging the interior wall. At one level the walls have recesses on each side with pointed arches and framed by thin columns, decorated with zig-zag patterns. These ‘tiers-point’ arches are, remarkably, of the same type that would characterize Gothic architecture in Europe some three hundred years later than their appearance here.In the medieval period, and possibly before, the moment the Nile flood reached 16 measured cubits along the vertical central column was a key moment for celebration. This was the signal for the Festival of the Opening of the Canal at Fumm Al-Khalig (the mouth of the canal). The Khalig lay along modern Port Said Street and consisted of a narrow waterway that bisected Cairo from south to north until it was finally paved over in 1898.The Khalig was dry for most of the year, and, certainly in its later years, widely considered a health hazard. Cesspit workers were employed to clean the canal every year by hand, and as late as 1870 a petition was presented to the Ottoman authorities urging them to do something about the awful stench and “forestall the possibility of an epidemic.”Nonetheless, John Gardner Wilkinson (1797–1875), considered by many to be the father of British Egyptology—he first numbered known tombs in the Valley of the Kings from KV1 to KV21, among other achievements—wrote extensively about the Festival in the 1847 Handbook for Travellers in Egypt, published as part of the well-respected John Murray handbooks for travelers (a series which eventually mutated into my all-time favorite set of guidebooks, the Blue Guides).On the night before the festival, according to Wilkinson, thousands of Cairenes crowded booths on the shore or boats on the river where they were suitably entertained. Marquees were also pitched along the north bank of the canal for the Governor of Cairo and other dignitaries.At about 8 am on the morning of the festival, the governor would arrive with his troops and attendants, and upon a signal, men would cut the dam holding back the Nile with hoes. A pillar of earth, ‘Arousat al-Nil’ or ‘The Bride of the Nile,’ would be left in the middle of the dam which, tradition held, was a substitute for a human sacrifice to the river gods in Pharaonic times.While the flood rushed into the canal, the governor would throw silver coins, and the men who had cut the dam would dive into the rapidly swirling water to retrieve them, with the occasional unfortunate result.As soon as sufficient water had entered the Khalig, boats full of Cairenes would pass through the canal.This no-doubt colorful spectacle came to an abrupt end, of course, when the Khalig—which was a particularly noisome ditch running through the center of the city for most of the months of the year—was paved over (and became the first tram line in Cairo).After the initial damming of the Nile at Aswan in the early twentieth century, nilometersalso began to fall out of use, and, indeed, the fine example on the end of Roda Island no longer connects to the river at all, though it may have done so as late as 1970.",2017-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'nilometer', 'water', 'level', 'medieval', 'measuring', 'nile', 'ibn', 'island', 'river', 'canal']",Egypt,news article,English
1798,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Madagascar: Businesses drive disappearance of a wetland 'reed forest' - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2021/03/madagascar-businesses-drive-disappearance-of-a-wetland-reed-forest/,"Lake Alaotra and its surrounding marshes are Madagascar’s largest wetland, a Ramsar Site that is home to globally significant biodiversity.

Despite layers of legal protection and conservation programming, around 850 hectares (2,100 acres) of marsh disappear each year to make way for rice cultivation, much of it perpetrated by businesses.

Local people are keenly feeling the lake’s decline, though, and a commitment to protecting it, along with some success stories, persist in pockets around its shores.

The government is implementing a zero-tolerance campaign against illegal environmental destruction, but it remains to be seen whether this can reduce the lawlessness and impunity enough to safeguard the lake.

LAKE ALAOTRA, Madagascar — Madagascar’s environment minister, Baomiavotse Vahinala Raharinirina, celebrated World Wetlands Day last month by planting native reeds and sedges along the shore of sprawling Lake Alaotra in the country’s central highlands. The plants’ tufted tops waved high above the heads of students, officials and local residents as they carried them across the marsh and joined the minister in settling them, one by one, into the mucky ground.

The planting on Feb. 2, which covered 4 hectares (10 acres), was an attempt to revitalize a tiny portion of the lake’s marshland that people call the “reed forest” in Malagasy. Rice agriculture, overfishing, introduced species and siltation due to upland deforestation have all contributed to the striking decline of a wetland the minister described in a Facebook post the next day as being among the largest and most ecologically important not just in Madagascar, but in all of Africa.

“Unfortunately, this marsh is now completely destroyed and Lake Alaotra is drying up,” she wrote. “Many species of Alaotra are endangered.”

Despite layers of legal protection and conservation programming, sources say much of the destruction is being perpetuated by businesses involved in rice growing and fishing and by widespread defiance of protective laws. Local people are keenly feeling the lake’s decline, though, and a commitment to protecting it, along with some success stories, persist in pockets around its shores.

A natural jewel

With 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) of open water surrounded by an equal area of marsh, Lake Alaotra is a natural jewel. It is home to globally significant biodiversity, including several endemic species of fish and birds and unusual mammals, such as the mongoose-like carnivore Durrell’s vontsira (Salanoia durrelli), which scientists only described in 2010, and the critically endangered bandro or Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis).

With some 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) of rice fields surrounding the lake, the vast Alaotra wetland is Madagascar’s main rice bowl, yielding an average of 360,000 tons of rice annually, or around 10% of the nation’s annual yield.

The lake was also once the country’s biggest inland fish supplier. But annual catches have declined precipitously, from around 2,400 tons in 2000 to barely 330 tons in 2020, according to the regional fishing department. Locals feel the loss acutely.

“I was 10 years old in 1973. We just spent a half-hour to harvest about 100 kilos [220 pounds] of quality fishes at the time,” said Randriamatsarasoa, a fisher and head of the fishers’ community association in Vohitsivalana, a village in the commune of Imerimandroso on the lake’s northeastern shore. “Nowadays, we struggle to bring home 5 to 12 kilos [11-26 pounds] after working hard from the morning to the evening.”

Such a significant shift in resource availability has resulted in fierce competition among residents that only exacerbates the ecosystem’s decline.

“These marshes represent the remaining history of the Alaotra region,” said Honoré Randriangalisa, the mayor of Imerimandroso and a deputy president of Alaotra Rano Soa, a regional body that facilitates communities’ management of the lake and marshes. “Their existence will be only a legend for the next generations if we are unable to put a stop to their destruction right now.”

Due to its importance for biodiversity and Madagascar’s agro-economy, Alaotra’s 722,500-hectare (1.78-million-acre) watershed was inscribed as a Ramsar Site under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance in 2003. The Madagascar government designated a temporary new protected area there in 2007 and granted 46,000 hectares (114,000 acres) permanent protection in 2015.

The transformation of marshland into new rice fields is the main threat to the marshes and the lake’s health. In recent years, rice farmers have been planting vary jeby, or flood recession rice, pushing into flood-prone areas that are now often farmable during the dry season, which has become elongated by climate change. They may farm a plot for a few years then leave it fallow when conditions aren’t ideal.

“The rising trend in the reliance on the flood recession rice is a very big issue,” said Miora Ratsimanohatra, chief of the agricultural engineering division for the wider Alaotra-Mangoro region, where Lake Alaotra is located. “People clear the temporarily dried up marshes and set them on fire to cultivate them. They even go beyond the protected area’s boundaries. This is illegal.”

Compounding the problems, centuries of deforestation have eliminated the tropical forest that once encircled the lake. Annual rains now carry tons of red earth from the surrounding terrain via deep, eroded gullies to submerge the lowlands, rivers and the lake itself. Moreover, the extended dry seasons, now lasting from June to November or December, have diminished the lake’s water. Today, the lake has a maximum depth during the dry season of just 2.5 meters (8 feet).

Last year, the extended dry season and higher temperatures than usual resulted in widespread and devastating bushfires that began in July and continued to late December, according to Fidimalala Bruno Ralainasolo, the conservation biologist who runs the Alaotra program of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT). The Jersey Island-based NGO has been active at the lake since 1996.

Altogether, around 850 hectares (2,100 acres) of marsh are lost every year, reducing their total cover by as much as 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres) since 2005, to the present 20,000-hectare extent, according to Ralainasolo. “Only around 20% of this inland ecosystem remains untapped,” he said.

Contrasting conservation

In 2015, as part of the government’s designation of the Alaotra protected area, DWCT started a conservation program in collaboration with Alaotra Rano Soa. The regional body, established as part of the lake’s Ramsar designation, helps oversee activities relating to the lake, such as rice growing, fishing, aquaculture, goose and cattle husbandry, water management, tourism, crafts, and transportation, at the community level. Alaotra Rano Soa manages the sprawling Ramsar site while DWCT manages the smaller protected area within it.

DWCT and Alaotra Rano Soa established four activity sectors to provide a forum for local people to manage the Ramsar site: 45 commune-level federations that collectively involve 333 village-level community associations, each one active in either watershed protection, water-resource management, fisheries management or marsh conservation. The program employs 96 polisin-jetra, or marsh police agents, as its ambassadors in the protected area. They report any environmental violations to DWCT, but can’t make arrests.

In 2017, DWCT, Alaotra Rano Soa and government authorities publicly marked the limits of the protected area. Parcels totaling nearly 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of marshland were set aside for the use of local communities, who rely on the lake’s resources for foods and income. However, with some exceptions, this area has largely succumbed to commercial rice planting, forcing subsistence farmers into protected marshland to meet their needs.

“The biggest issue we were facing was the fact that local businesses managed to control 90% of the set-aside 7,000 hectares, instead of the community members,” said Ralainasolo, the DWCT conservation biologist.

Two of the lake’s rural communes offer a study in contrasts when it comes to managing their slices of set-aside marsh. Imerimandroso’s marsh cover is on the verge of disappearance, whereas its neighbor on the northeastern lake shore, Andrebakely Avaratra, has retained most of its marsh. Like the dozens of communes around the wetland, Imerimandroso and Andrebakely Avaratra, with respective populations of around 16,000 and 19,900, rely on rice growing, farming, fishing and crafting for their food and income. For centuries, the lake has provided people’s daily needs.

Of the 400 or so hectares (about 1,000 acres) the marsh community association in Imerimandroso is responsible for, scarcely a dozen persist, and the local businesses and subsistence farmers who grow vary jeby are clamoring for access even to these.

“Little by little, they invaded the protected area as of 2008,” Dauphin Andriakotoarivony, deputy mayor of Imerimandroso and a deputy president of Alaotra Rano Soa, said. “Hardly 7 hectares [17 acres] of the initial 209 [516 acres] we have secured where I am [in Marovato sector] has been left. Practically 99% of the protected area is ruined. Also, the rest is already prone to invasion. The encouraging thing is that the community association has never abandoned the fight.”

Randriamatsarasoa, the fisher from Imerimandroso, is very concerned with the eventual exhaustion of the fish stocks. According to him, the introduced tilapia (several species in the family Cichlidae) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) that were once abundant in Lake Alaotra and are the main source of income for local fishers have declined precipitously, having long since displaced native fish species. He attributes the disappearance of the fish to people using insecticide-laced mosquito nets with small meshes that scoop up juveniles, and clearing marshes where fish and other aquatic animals reproduce.

“When the water is well managed, I can tell you that fishing is more profitable than rice growing,” he said. A kilo of freshwater fish now costs seven or eight times more than a kilo of rice.

The failure of the marsh conservation project in Imerimandroso was attributable to political leadership, according to Ralainasolo of DWCT. He said the commune’s previous mayor was under a great deal of pressure from local powerbrokers to permit illegal marsh clearing.

The current mayor, Randriangalisa, elected in December 2019, professed his commitment to turning things around. “We will be standing up as long as we can to conserve the little left. We will keep silent only when our voice is heard,” Randriangalisa said.

By contrast, the people of Andrebakely Avaratra have been “stricter” than their neighbors about protecting the marshes, José Ramaninjatovo, the commune’s mayor, told Mongabay. “As meadow, they are the zebus’ larder,” he said, referring to Malagasy cattle. “They supply us with fishes. They protect the rice fields from alluvial deposits from the hills.”

The previous mayor of Andrebakely Avaratra showed strong leadership and the population appreciated the importance of the marshes, according to Ralainasolo.

The current mayor, Ramaninjatovo, said he intends to carry on that commitment. He said 19 people were caught destroying the marshes in mid-February, and the environment ministry’s local offices made them replant the areas with reeds and sign a letter promising never to harm the marsh. “We will never allow such a violation to happen again,” he said.

Thanks to Andrebakely Avaratra’s enduring marsh, the commune has become one of the main suppliers of dried reed to Imerimandroso, where women use it to weave baskets, hats, bags and other crafts for income.

Everyone seems to comply with the rules in Andrebakely Avaratra. Two fishermen sailing back from the open lake on an afternoon in late October each had a pile of locally made basketry fish traps called vovos. “We have removed them from the water to the village as the water is now closed,” one of them told Mongabay, referring to the lake’s annual fishing closure. It had started the day before and would last eight weeks to allow the fish to reproduce. “We take our fishing tools into water again when the water reopens.”

That kind of compliance with protective rules is typical in Andrebakely Avaratra, regardless of whether people belong to the community association or not, according to a marsh police agent named Gabriel Ralijaona in the commune’s main village. “We are very strict with the protection of the 658 hectares [1,626 acres] of marshes inside our common land,” he said. “An array of endemic birds, countless animal species including four specimens of bandro — three adults and one baby — live there. We never let anyone disturb these places.”

The bandro is the emblematic species of Lake Alaotra. With a population of less than 3,000, down from the first estimate of between 7,000 and 11,000 in 1990, the lemurs are among the world’s most endangered primates. The adults in Andrebakely Avaratra were former pets reintroduced into the wild in 2015. Andrebakely Avaratra’s marsh was chosen to host them because it was in good shape after the community had nursed it back from being “totally broken down” in the 1990s, according to Ralainasolo of DWCT. Of the five animals released in the area, two disappeared and were thought to have been hunted. But one female appeared with a newborn soon after.

Businesses behind the destruction

Around the lake, however, Ralainasolo pointed out that the bandro’s unmistakable population decline closely tracks the loss of marsh habitat. And most of the time, he said, businesses are behind the clearing. His team estimates it costs an average of 1 million ariary ($254) to clear one hectare of marsh. If so, the average destruction of around 850 hectares annually would theoretically require around 850 million ariary, or $216,000.

That kind of money, even to clear a single hectare, is out of reach for most residents. Instead, powerbrokers and banks finance the marsh’s destruction, paying poor locals to do the clearing, according to local public servants who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. Mayor Randriangalisa of Imerimandroso said he had experienced pressure tactics. “After a TV station broadcast my criticism of the marsh destruction, high-placed people and one bank officer called me and asked me to stop questioning their business,” he said.

It’s a similar story when it comes to fishing. According to an anonymous source at the regional fishing department, local businesses fund the fabrication of nets up to a kilometer long that cost 6 million to 8 million ariary (up to $2,033). Businesses deploy around 30 of these killing machines in Lake Alaotra, plus another 50 smaller ones. “They are illegal and their use not only endangers stock availability in the future but also harms aquatic species,” the source said.

Over the years, marsh restoration projects on the banks of the lake, like the one the environment minister attended in February, have been successful. Experts say that if the reeds are left to regrow in peace they can recover in a few years’ time. But against the backdrop of pervasive lawlessness, the outlook for Lake Alaotra’s marshes remains uncertain.

Like many other people weary of the impunity, Randriangalisa calls for exemplary sanctions for the marshes’ destroyers. Meanwhile, the environment ministry is implementing a zero-tolerance policy against any illegal environmental destruction across the country.

According to sources interviewed for this story, eight powerbrokers residing in the area’s main city of Ambatondrazaka are suspected of funding illegal activities imperiling the wetland, including marsh clearance and fishing with large mosquito bed nets. They were summoned to appear in court in December, but the court date was postponed and a new one has yet to be made public. The outcome of the case could be a bellwether for Lake Alaotra’s future.

Clarification 4/8/21: The story has been updated to clarify that the forum that DWCT and Alaotra Rano Soa established, comprising commune-level federations and village-level community associations, manages the Lake Alaotra Ramsar Site, and not just the lake itself.

1193,FL-2016-000114-EGY,"Flash flooding kills 19, injures more than 100 in southwest Iran - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent",https://egyptindependent.com/flash-flooding-kills-19-injures-more-than-100-in-southwest-iran/,"(CNN) — Flash flooding in Iran has killed at least 19 people and injured 119 in the city of Shiraz in Fars province, according to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim News Agency.

Fars Gov. Enayatollah Rahimi said a short but intense rainfall caused sudden flash flooding that inundated a main highway between Shiraz and Esfahan, trapping many travelers leaving the city. City officials did not have enough time to warn people in the area ahead of the deadly weather conditions.

The heavy storm system over the region delivered a month’s worth of rainfall in only a few hours, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. Coupled with the terrain in the area, this may have caused a funneling effect, which is not uncommon to see in some extreme flash flooding episodes. “With the arrival of new precipitation into the country, more than 13 provinces of the country are involved in severe rainfall, snow and blizzard in a way that 22 communications routes of the country have been completely blocked,” semi-official Mehr News Agency said. Emergency and rescue organizations are on full alert in Esfahan and Tehran as the heavy rain is predicted to continue to fall in much of the country, especially in southwest to central Iran. The storm will continue to impact Iran Monday night and into early Tuesday morning before the weather system begins to ease late Tuesday.

Its Plan: Flood Africa With Plastic. - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/climate/oil-kenya-africa-plastics-trade.html,"Confronting a climate crisis that threatens the fossil fuel industry, oil companies are racing to make more plastic. But they face two problems: Many markets are already awash with plastic, and few countries are willing to be dumping grounds for the worldâ??s plastic waste.

The industry thinks it has found a solution to both problems in Africa.

According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, an industry group representing the worldâ??s largest chemical makers and fossil fuel companies is lobbying to influence United States trade negotiations with Kenya, one of Africaâ??s biggest economies, to reverse its strict limits on plastics â?? including a tough plastic-bag ban. It is also pressing for Kenya to continue importing foreign plastic garbage, a practice it has pledged to limit.

Plastics makers are looking well beyond Kenyaâ??s borders. â??We anticipate that Kenya could serve in the future as a hub for supplying U.S.-made chemicals and plastics to other markets in Africa through this trade agreement,â? Ed Brzytwa, the director of international trade for the American Chemistry Council, wrote in an April 28 letter to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.

The United States and Kenya are in the midst of trade negotiations and the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has made clear he is eager to strike a deal. But the behind-the-scenes lobbying by the petroleum companies has spread concern among environmental groups in Kenya and beyond that have been working to reduce both plastic use and waste.",2020-08-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['big', 'united', 'oil', 'industry', 'trade', 'companies', 'states', 'problems', 'plastics', 'trouble', 'plan', 'kenya', 'worlds', 'africa', 'flood', 'plastic']",Kenya,news article,English
1329,FL-2019-000084-IND,Assam Flood Creates Havoc: 40K Crore Express Highway Project Gets Stuck - The Logical Indian,https://thelogicalindian.com/news/assam-flood-results-havoc/,"In the year 2017, the central government announced the first-ever express highway project in the northeast region to be built along the Brahmaputra River in Assam at an estimated investment of Rs 40,000 crore.

“Northeast is our priority. We are going to develop the first express highway of the North East in Assam along the banks of Brahmaputra. This 1,300 km-long express highway is likely to incur an investment of Rs 40,000 crore,” Nitin Gadkari had said while announcing the project.

He further said,” The land acquisition has to be done by the state. The sand the soil coming from the dredging of Brahmaputra will be utilized for construction of the road. The express highway will be axis-controlled and vehicles will be able to ply at very high speed. The Centre will dredge a stretch of 891km of the Brahmaputra River from Sadia in Upper Assam to increase navigational channels up to Chittagong port in Bangladesh.”

The Assam government had finalized the tenders for the project to execute the plan from this year. However, that was stalled due to incessant and devastating floods that caused 75 deaths and affected 39 lakh people in the 20 districts of Assam. According to the reports, the damage was caused as the water in the dams uphills was released. The encroachment of forest lands and water bodies are said to be other reasons behind the floods that ravage the state almost every year.

People of Assam are upset as the problem of the flood is an annual occurrence, yet it is being neglected by both the central and the state government from many years. This time the locals of the affected districts came out asking the government to bring long term solution.

According to an analysis by the Rashtriya Barh Ayog (RBA), 39.58 per cent of the total land area of Assam is flood-prone as the state and the other parts of the North-Eastern region fall in a seismic zone. Frequent earthquakes and landslides carry debris into the rivers which in turn rise riverbeds.

During this period, thundershowers and lighting accompanied with heavy rains is expected in the districts of Mon, Mokokchung, Longleng, Tuensang, Peren, Phek, Kiphire and Zunheboto. State Capital Kohima is likely to have moderate to heavy rains from July 7 to 10, it said.



It also advised citizens to take necessary precautionary measures during this time as most rivers of the state may overflow because of intense rains in the catchment areas.



It further urged the public to be vigilant and not to shelter under large trees and near the river banks to prevent unnecessary risk to life from lightning and flash floods. It also requested all the DDMAs and other line departments who are responsible to attend to any emergencies caused by natural calamities, to be on alert to save lives and properties during this monsoon period.

489,DR-2021-000054-SOM,African Risk Capacity targets addition of Somalia to parametric risk pool - Artemis.bm,https://www.artemis.bm/news/african-risk-capacity-targets-addition-of-somalia-to-parametric-risk-pool/,"The African Risk Capacity (ARC), a provider of parametric disaster insurance products to countries and now other entities in Africa, is targeting adding Somalia to its risk pool, signing an MoU with the Government to help it work through the onboarding process.



The Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia has signed a Treaty and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the African Risk Capacity (ARC), with the organisation set to help the country better prepare, plan and respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters.

Somalia is exposed to a range of severe weather and natural disaster risks, making the use of planning and resilience tools vital, but also financial preparation, with the use of parametric disaster insurance likely an ultimate goal of the signing.

Hon. Khadija M Diriye, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Federal Republic of Somalia, commented, “Somalia’s hazard profile is dominated by droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, desert locust, diseases (epidemic/pandemic), and terrorism that disrupt people’s livelihoods, destroy the infrastructure, divert planned use of resources, interrupt economic activities and retard development.

“The impacts of natural hazards do not occur in isolation; but recognition of such cause and effect on a national scale has encouraged the Government of Somalia in taking on a paradigm shift from crisis management to risk management. This will enable us to utilise our finite resources in a more efficient and timely manner towards assisting the vulnerable populations in the event of disasters. Therefore, we are proud to sign the ARC Establishment Agreement,asits35th Member,as well as the MoU, with a strong commitment to taking the necessary steps to ensure that the collaboration leads to building of our national response capacities against the adverse impacts of natural disasters.”

UN-ASG and ARC Group-Director General, Ibrahima Cheikh Diong also said, “As the nature and intensity of natural catastrophes evolve across the region, we maintain that the continent will be better protected through a pooled-risk approach bringing together countries and leveraging smart partnerships. Today, the ARC Group proudly welcomes the Federal Republic of Somalia as its 35th Member State. By simultaneously signing the ARC Treaty and MoU, the Government (of Somalia) has demonstrated a clear commitment to strengthening the country’s disaster risk reduction capacities; and thereby joining a growing number of African Union Member States that are accessing our tools to create coordinated contingency plans before catastrophes strike.

“We would like to particularly convey our readiness to work with the (Somalian) Authorities in accurately profiling their natural disaster risks and designing quantified response plans to better secure the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable populations in the event of a peril.”

A framework will be developed to facilitate cooperation between African Risk Capacity (ARC) and the Somali Government to address the impact of extreme weather events.

This will include provision of training to support Government personnel, as well as preparing Somalia’s potential participation in future parametric (drought/flood/tropical cyclone) insurance risk pools operated by ARC.

Since 2014, 65 policies have been signed by African countries, providing cumulative parametric insurance coverage of US $719 million.

ARC relies on efficient access to global reinsurance markets to underpin its ability to pay claims against the growing risk pool, meaning that expansion and diversification of the risk pool are both key to recognise economies of scale.

Recent developments at ARC add diversification to the risk pool, such as plans to expand into flood risk, an expansion of the ARC client base to include non-sovereign actors, ARC’s recent plan to further expand its risk pool by underwriting inwards reinsurance, and the writing of its first parametric tropical cyclone cover.

These efforts and continued work to ready other countries in Africa, such as Somalia, to take up parametric disaster insurance promise to further expand ARC’s risk pool and therefore its ability to access reinsurance markets more efficiently.",2021-05-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['risk', 'disaster', 'pool', 'mou', 'targets', 'natural', 'addition', 'arc', 'african', 'insurance', 'capacity', 'parametric', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English

More than 500 residents of Nambieso and Chawente Sub County in Kwania district who were displaced by floods are starving.



The residents who live along the shores of Lake Kwania have remained homeless and their gardens of crops submerged after the Lake burst its banks last month.



Jimmy Emmanuel Okello Ecun, the Nambieso Sub County Male Councillor expressed fear that the affected communities will suffer severe famine since they mainly depend on subsistence farming.



He argued that it is the responsibility of the government to protect its citizen and their property.



Okello wants the government to provide relief food and compensate the flood-affected persons for losses incurred as well as temporal structures for their shelter.

As of 23 October, flooding has affected 2.2 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is double last years, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Nigeria, Togo and the Central African Republic, and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million. Humanitarian teams respond to the acute needs of the most vulnerable and displaced people, and help communities to bounce back faster.",2020-10-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['situation', 'regions', 'flooding', 'central', '2020', 'west', 'vulnerable', '23', 'million', 'response', 'impact', 'rains', 'niger', 'affected', 'countries', 'africa']",Nigeria,news article,English

Since the beginning of October, central Vietnam has been pounded by consecutive tropical storms and typhoons, which have brought widespread flooding and landslides to the region.

At least 1.5 million people have been affected by flooding and 235 people have died or are missing, according to the Vietnamese government.

On October 15, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink declared a national disaster for the Central Vietnam region as a result of the widespread devastation caused by flooding and landslides. This flooding has disrupted electricity and telecommunication networks, as well as destroying infrastructure, houses, livestock, and crops.

On October 28, Typhoon Molave made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Vietnam. It was the worst typhoon to hit the country in the last two decades.

Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are the two of the five central provinces that have been hardest hit by the recent flooding and landslides. The other three provinces that have been severely affected are Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, and Hue.

To make matters worse, the monsoon season is still ongoing and another powerful storm, Typhoon Vamco, made landfall last Sunday morning in central Vietnam, causing even greater damage. This is the third storm system to pummel Vietnam in November and the 13th to hit the country this year. The economic damage is now estimated to be close to $1 billion, according to the Vietnamese government.

International donations are starting to come in from various countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Japan. To date, the U.S. has donated $2.1 million toward the humanitarian relief effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Vietnam Red Cross Society to assist during the ongoing recovery period.

The financial backing also focuses on USAIDs longstanding investments in Vietnam to help minimize loss and destruction caused by natural disasters. Although the Vietnamese government has been quick to allocate disaster relief funds, its efforts and capacities have been strained also by the coronavirus pandemic. Donations from the outside world will be certainly needed and appreciated.

Local NGOs have been working tirelessly alongside the government to deliver aid to those who have been most affected by the catastrophic storms and their results. Pacific Links Foundation is an NGO that currently supports disadvantaged families in central Vietnam and it has been vigorously fundraising to support families in flood-affected Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Hue provinces.

Our volunteers on the ground have delivered emergency packages, which included rice, food, life jackets, and flashlights, to students and their families, said Hong Nguyen, the deputy director for SEEDS, a Pacific Links Foundation scholarship program which currently supports over 2,500 students.

SEEDS and the Pacific Links Foundation are now working on another round of support that will focus specifically on long-term recovery, allowing school children in all eight central Provinces to return to school and provide support for the families that suffered the most during the recent typhoons and floods.

We will provide packages which will include books and school supplies, as well as computer tablets for students to continue learning through our online learning platform, especially when schooling is being disrupted, said Nguyen.

Another non-profit charitable organization focused on philanthropic activities to benefit Vietnamese people in need throughout the Central Vietnam region is Da Nang Go. The organization uses fundraising events and direct donations to address the specific needs of Vietnamese people affected by natural disasters, poverty, and hunger.

Presently, the group consists of about 20 local and international volunteers who have been doing regular relief trips to some of the harder hit flood and landslide zones across the region. The NGO recently took a convoy of trucks and cars to Tay Giang district in Quang Nam province to provide much-needed supplies.

Tay Giang experienced heavy flooding and deadly landslides in October and November and is generally considered to be one of the more economically disadvantaged areas of Central Vietnam. The majority of the people who live there are from the Co Tu ethnic minority, a patriarchal rural society whose men raise livestock and whose women are well known for making high-quality traditional handicrafts.

The Co Tu live in small stilt huts which can be easily damaged by storms and landslides. At least 30 families had previously been evacuated from one village in Tay Giang due to the recent landslides.

Before the last storm came, the government wanted to move them to a safer place but the problem is they dont want to move anywhere because they are scared and if they die then they want to die in their hometown. They are used to yearly storms but they didnt know this years storms would be so bad, said Hannah Bui, one of the main directors of Da Nang Go and owner of Hannahs Restaurant in Da Nang.

I wish I had more money so I could do more to help these people, she said.

Recently, the Da Nang Go team assembled 250 aid packages for children and 750 for adults in Tay Giang, as well as presenting some cash donations in envelopes at Hannahs Restaurant.

The aid packages consisted of water, milk, noodles, dry food, oil, fish sauce, salt, blankets, and notebooks. The money was raised through a recent fundraising event and from various donations by local and expat members of the Da Nang community.

The aid was greeted with smiles by the local villagers and government officials. The team also delivered supplies to two elementary schools and to adults in the neediest villages of Tay Giang. In one of the poorest schools, students are so impoverished that they cant afford basic school uniforms and some students walk up to four kilometers per day to attend classes.

When I do charity and I do small things like give candy to poor kids they are happy and smile, and when I give old people clothes and they say thank you, it warms my heart and makes me feel good knowing Ive brightened their day, said Bui.

Da Nang Go will continue its ongoing fundraising and aid missions to help people around central Vietnam affected by these historically devastating storms and typhoons. Both Pacific Links Foundation and Da Nang Go are continuing to deliver aid packages and funds in the aftermath of Typhoon Vamco.

As much as these local charities and NGOs have brought much-needed relief for affected communities, in terms of food, clothing, school supplies, and direct funding, what is really needed now in terms of the recovery effort is the rebuilding of infrastructure, houses, and technological networks, and a re-supply of livestock to get things back to normal.

501,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Muslim women are using Sharia to push for gender equality - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/muslim-women-are-using-sharia-to-push-for-gender-equality-158371,"Sharia is often portrayed as barbaric and particularly regressive in terms of women’s rights. Citing Sharia, lawmakers in some Muslim-majority countries have punished theft with amputation, and sex outside of marriage with stoning. Women have been also forced to stay in abusive marriages and flogged for defying Sharia because they were wearing trousers.

Commonly translated as Islamic law, Sharia is a broad set of ethical principles found in the Quran, Islam’s holy book, and in the teachings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad. It is not a strict legal code, leaving it open to varying interpretations by governments and religious leaders.

Public outcry over Sharia has led to more than 200 anti-Sharia bills being introduced across the United States. The European Court of Human Rights has twice ruled Sharia incompatible with human rights. Conservative analysts have called Sharia the world’s “other pandemic,” a comparison to COVID-19.

However, many Muslim women do not regard Sharia as being incompatible with their rights. My research shows how women – typically small activist groups in many countries – are using Sharia to fight against oppressive practices.

Sharia and women’s rights

I interviewed nearly 150 women’s rights activists, religious leaders, officials and aid workers over the past decade in Somalia and Somaliland, where more than 99% of the population is Muslim.

The region has suffered cycles of famine and drought, as well as a brutal dictatorship and civil war that led to the collapse of Somalia’s government 30 years ago and the split between Somalia and Somaliland.

I wanted to learn why women were demanding Sharia and whether Sharia could help rebuild societies after war. My book, “Shari‘a, Inshallah: Finding God in Somali Legal Politics,” tells the story of peace builders and peacemakers oriented toward, rather than away from, Sharia.

Because Sharia encourages a diversity of interpretations, there is no right or wrong way to interpret it.

Women activists I met saw an inherent feminism in Sharia. Muslims “can find support for almost everything” in Sharia, a Somali activist reminded me. It’s just that women “have to know their rights in the Quran,” she added.

These activists help their local communities understand women’s rights in Islam. For example, one activist fighting for girls’ education explained to local parents how Sharia demands that both “boys and girls have the right to education.” Billboards put up by human rights groups referred to the Islamic teaching that to educate a girl is to educate a nation. They emphasized that Prophet Muhammad himself taught women and men and encouraged his followers to do the same.

Another activist I talked with invoked Sharia to explain that girls should be allowed to play sports. She explained to parents that not allowing their daughters to play goes against Sharia, which “gives rights to human beings.”

Yet another called the Quran – one of the sources of Sharia – her guide to persuade women to run for public office. Allowing women to stand for election, she publicly insisted, “is Islamic.”

Patriarchy and interpretations

Part of the problem with the often brutal interpretation of Sharia has been that men have been aligning it with their political views. “The custodians of law are men,” an aid worker told me.

Indeed, some religious leaders insist that Sharia allows child marriage and female genital mutilation to preserve women’s premarital virginity and prevent women from experiencing sexual pleasure.

Activists I met tried to put an end to these harmful practices by sharing harrowing stories in workshops with religious leaders. One activist told me that in one such workshop she had related the tragic story of a young girl whose pelvis shattered during childbirth. Another shared the story of a child who drank bleach to avoid a forced marriage.

These women wanted religious leaders to share these stories with others. They argued that Sharia could not be used to permit child marriage and female genital mutilation. Protecting women “is so clearly written in the Quran,” said one activist who added that “Islam always promotes the person, health, and dignity.”

[This Week in Religion, a global roundup email newsletter each Thursday. Sign up.]

Reclaiming women’s power

Religious leaders in these countries have, however, been reluctant to speak publicly on these issues. But many of the Somali women I met were reviving a centuries-old tradition – of women teaching and interpreting Sharia. In the seventh century, Aisha, the Prophet Muhammad’s surviving spouse, was among the first Muslim authorities to render decisions on sacred law that men had to follow.

Not just in Somalia and Somaliland, but in many parts of the world, Muslim women are reclaiming their rights by studying and sharing Quranic verses and prophetic teachings. In Malaysia, for example, groups like Sisters in Islam and Musawah have been publicly putting forward feminist interpretations of Quranic verses to teach women about gender equality and inheritance rights.

In Egypt, women have invoked Sharia to expand access to divorce.

In my research in Sudan, I saw women lawyers teach women displaced by civil war that their rights come from God. On the Day of Judgment, these women said to one another, God will judge those who tried to take away women’s God-given rights.

And in Los Angeles, California, a women’s mosque offers women-led sermons, classes and events.

By interpreting theological and legal texts in less patriarchal ways, these women, as I found, are shattering age-old sexist interpretations of Sharia.",2021-05-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['quran', 'rights', 'womens', 'equality', 'muslim', 'push', 'using', 'religious', 'women', 'leaders', 'gender', 'activist', 'men', 'sharia', 'interpretations']",Somalia,news article,English

In a statement, Meteorological Services Director Stella Aura said it is as a result of the expected heavy rainfall of more than 50mm/24hrs over the Ethiopian highlands.

Counties expected to be affected by the flash floods include Mandera, Marsabit, and Wajir.

Residents in the mentioned areas are alerted to be on the lookout for potential flash floods that may occur in places where heavy rainfall has not been received and especially in areas that are known to be water paths from neighboring Ethiopia.

According to the Assistant Director of Meteorological Services Dr. Richard Mwita, some of the unsafe areas are the flood plains where water may have receded during the dry weather and attracted people to set up homes or started farming activities on the fertile alluvial soils.

The weatherman is also attributing the heavy rainfall to the presence of a low-pressure belt, the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the East African region that is then attracting rain-bearing clouds into the region and resulting in heavy rainfall or storms.

The region is also still within the March, April to May long rains season.

This notice by MET comes a few days after Port users were advised to be cautious of bad weather along the coastline as a tropical cyclone named Jobo was expected to hit the Tanzanian coast.

In a statement released Saturday, Kenya Ports Authority said that due to low-pressure systems that developed in the South Western Indian Ocean, the cyclone was moving towards the East African coastline.

The statement which was signed by Head of Marine Operations Capt. Moses Muthama also advised that all ships in the harbor lookout for imminent bad weather and take every necessary action to secure vessels against strong winds including doubling of mooring lines.

Capt. Muthama stated that all ships at anchorage and moored to buoys should have main engines and crew on standby at short notice during this period.

He added that all ships drifting outside port limits should maintain not less than 15 nautical miles from the nearest point of land and keep crew and engines on standby.",2021-04-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['met', 'rainfall', 'weather', 'heavy', 'wajir', 'marsabit', 'ships', 'region', 'areas', 'flash', 'mandera', 'meteorological', 'kbc', 'warns', 'floods', 'statement']",Kenya,news article,English

Around 18,000 people had been evacuated from flooding in New South Wales by Monday and emergency services feared up to 54,000 people could be displaced with rain forecast to continue until Wednesday.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Parliament that 35 communities in northern New South Wales had been isolated and emergency services had conducted more than 700 flood rescues.

“We are grateful at this point that no lives have been lost so far,” Morrison said. “But weakened foundations for buildings, for roads and trees, they all create risk, as do downed power lines and rising water levels.”

A year ago, vast swathes of New South Wales had been charred by unprecedented wildfires following years of drought that gripped most of the state.

Some of the same areas were now being by inundated by one-in-50-year and one-in-100-year rain events.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said up to 38 parts of the state had been declared natural disaster areas.

“I don’t know any time in our state’s history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic,” Berejiklian told reporters. “So, they are challenging times for New South Wales.”

Thousands of people have been affected with 40 flood warnings and 20 evacuation orders along the state’s Mid North Coast, and in western Sydney. Houses had been submerged and destroyed while several communities had lost power.

Heavy rain will remain a serious risk on Tuesday for the Mid North Coast, where communities are facing the worst flooding conditions since 1929.

Communities along the Hawkesbury River were also bracing for the worst flooding in the area since 1961.

Bureau of Meteorology national flood services manager Justin Robinson described the rainfall as a “very significant flood event for New South Wales.”

“I’ve been a flood forecaster with the bureau for 20 years and this is probably the worst flooding that I’ve experienced,” Robinson said.

Nepean River levels at Penrith on Sydney western outskirts had peaked late Sunday at a higher level than the 1961 record and the Hawkesbury River flood waters at Windsor, northwest of Sydney, were expected to peak late Monday around a 1988 record level, Robinson said.

Kayong was a member of the opposition PartiKeadilan Rakyat (People's Justice Party) and had run for a Sarawak state assembly seat in elections held on May 7.

Dev Kumar, the head of criminal investigations for Sarawak, which lies along the northern portion of huge Borneo Island, said in a statement that Kayong was ""shot dead by an unknown person using a shotgun.""

He urged the public not to speculate on possible motives for the killing, promising a thorough investigation.

Kayong is a member of one of Sarawak's many indigenous tribes and was active in fighting on behalf of indigenous peoples, especially on land-rights issues, Steve Teo, Keadilan's local youth-wing chief, told AFP.

Teo said he knew of no specific possible motive for the killing.

Sarawak is known for its once-towering rainforests and its powerful rivers.

Tribal groups have for years resisted logging, the expansion of palm-oil estates, and the building of hydroelectric dams that have flooded large areas inhabited for generations by tribespeople.

Tribal activists say their land rights have in many cases been stolen, with the collusion of the state government and well-connected companies.

Malaysia's ruling coalition won a landslide victory in last month's state polls, which the opposition and independent analysts said was marred by blatant government handouts to voters and other ""money politics"", as well as gerrymandering that favoured the coalition.

While it's clearly an oversimplification, we couldn't allow this anniversary to pass without offering our own list of ""winners & losers"" in the decade since 9/11 and the accompanying ""war on terror.""The years since 9/11 have witnessed the biggest expansion of the U.S. national-security state since the Cold War. Over the course of the decade, Washington has spent well over $7 trillion on the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. (The U.S. intelligence budget alone, for example, has doubled over the past 10 years.) The creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the establishment of a new Director of National Intelligence amounted to the largest reorganization of the federal government since World War II.Many of the details remain obscure, however, thanks to a corresponding widening of the culture of official secrecy. In its expose "","" ""The Washington Post"" revealed that 854,000 people now hold top-secret security clearances, and that 33 building complexes had been built for top-secret intelligence work in Washington and the surrounding area since 9/11. ""Together they occupy the equivalent of almost three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings -- about 17 million square feet of space.""During their fight to establish control over Afghanistan in the 1990s, the overwhelmingly Sunni Taliban massacred Afghan Shi'a and killed 10 Iranian diplomats stationed in the north of the country. So Tehran was only too happy to see the Americans wipe out the Taliban government in autumn 2001. Iran's leaders were even happier when the new government of President Hamid Karzai turned out to include leading members of the Northern Alliance (including many Persian-speaking Tajiks who had benefited from Iranian support during their long years of resisting the Taliban). In 2003, when U.S. troops invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein, the Iranian government had reason to rejoice again. Hussein, the man who unleashed the eight-year Iran-Iraq War in 1981, was Iran's bitterest enemy, and his Ba'athist government was replaced by leading members of Iraq's majority Shi'ite community. Many of them had lived in Iran or otherwise enjoyed Iranian sponsorship for decades before the U.S. invasion.All this has considerably boosted Iran's regional influence even as the country continues to develop its nuclear program.Before 9/11 there were just a few private security companies in the world, usually operating well outside the limelight. But over the past decade the business has. That growth has spurred concerns about the wisdom of empowering private companies to carry out many of the functions once performed by the official military. During the war in Iraq the name of the company Blackwater became such a synonym for gun-toting irresponsibility that it was forced to rebrand itself. (Now it calls itself, rather mysteriously, ""Xe."") Next year, the U.S. State Department is actually set to double the number of private security contractors working for it in Iraq (from 2,700 to 5,500).Of course, 9/11 has been a boon to the broader private security industry as well. Everyone from the manufacturers of airport scanners to those little bottles for getting your shampoo past security have seen a windfall as well.Ex-KGB man Vladimir Putin rose to the presidency on the back of his prosecution of Russia's second war against Islamist rebels in the breakaway North Caucasus republic of Chechnya. Before 9/11, many Western governments criticized Russia for its attack on the separatists, which included indiscriminate use of bombing and artillery and the ""disappearing"" of large numbers of young Chechen men. Ties between some of the separatists and Al-Qaeda received considerably less attention. But in the wake of the attacks in New York and Washington, only the latter point seemed to matter any more. The Kremlin and the White House agreed to share intelligence and cooperate in Afghanistan, and U.S. criticism of Russia's human rights record suddenly quieted dramatically.Other dictators in the post-Soviet Union -- especially in Afghanistan's Central Asian neighbors -- were also happy to play up the terrorist threat in return for U.S. support. All too often the need to keep supply lines to the war effort in Afghanistan trumped human rights concerns.During the Cold War, the West's communist opponents prided themselves on their atheism, which made professing the creed of nonbelief somewhat complicated. Not so in the 21st century. The spectacle of religiously motivated aggression presented by the September 11 attacks has provided a powerful argument to those who dismiss faith as mere superstition. Philosopher Daniel Dennett, physicist Stephen Hawking, and journalist Christopher Hitchens have all figured prominently in the attack on organized religion. Prominent atheist Richard Dawkins sold 2 million copies of his 2006 book ""The God Delusion"" --before the start of the ""war on terror.""Atheists still face something of an uphill climb, though: Islam remains the world's fastest-growing religion, and an overwhelming majority of Americans continue to profess belief in God.By the end of the last century, the U.S. aerospace industry had developed remote-controlled unmanned aircraft that used advanced communications and information technology to spy on hard-to-reach targets in far-away places. Then someone got the idea of putting missiles on the drones. Ten years later, the military robotics industry is. The U.S. Air Force now trains more operators for ""remotely piloted vehicles"" than it does pilots. The success of U.S. drone warfare is driving a global boom in military robotics that is transforming the nature of war itself.Even though Turkey has had a few scattered problem with Islamists of its own, the decade since 9/11 has been mostly the story of a steady uphill climb. The government of moderate Islamist Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who came to power in 2003, has overseen a period of strong economic growth that it has used to bolster its credentials as the one country in the greater Middle East that has managed to embrace progress even as it stresses its Islamic roots. Erdogan has managed to maintain Turkey's NATO membership even while the Turks have defied the United States on some issues (such as denying access to U.S. troops on their way to invade Iraq in 2003). Turkey has also boosted ties with countries like Iran and Syria at the same time as it has pursued improved relations with the European Union and Russia. The post-9/11 dysfunction of places like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia has helped Turkey to burnish its credentialsIn the weeks following September 11, Congress passed two laws that gave the White House far-reaching powers for prosecuting the war against Al-Qaeda. The first, the Authorization for Use of Military Force, granted the president the authority ""to use all necessary and appropriate force"" against the terrorists -- essentially carte blanche for the president to do whatever he deemed worth doing. The second, the USA Patriot Act, gave the federal government broad scope for conducting surveillance against its own citizens with the aim of preventing future attacks.Over the past 10 years the Supreme Court and Congress have curtailed much of the power that the executive branch accrued during the opening phases of the ""war on terror"" -- but not all of it. Though the Obama administration has put an end to some of its predecessor's policies, including the approval of some forms of torture in interrogations, President Barack Obama has also extended some parts of the Patriot Act. He is holding to aand he has continued the CIA's drone campaign against targets in Pakistan with minimal public accountability. But then, don't wars always end up giving more power to presidents?The antisecrecy website's greatest scoops -- hundreds of thousands of declassified cables on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- would have had far less oomph with no ""war on terror"" to illuminate. WikiLeaks impresario Julian Assange likes to compare himself with Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, whom he credits with singlehandedly ending the Vietnam War. (Didn't the Viet Cong have something to do with it? Never mind.) Let's face it, revelations about trade negotiations just aren't as sexy.Thirty years of war have not helped Afghanistan's environment, which is also bedeviled by drought, deforestation and the plundering of resources. But one ray of light shone through this summer when the country's national environmental protection agency approved protection for 33 endangered species in the country, including the(panthera uncia). There's little the government can do to enforce its laws, but every little bit helps; the Taliban would have never gone to the trouble. The recent creation of a national park in Bamiyan Province also raises hopes that Afghanistan's nature can finally catch a break.2,996 people lost their lives in the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and in the aircraft that crashed into them. 1,300 orphans were created that day. In the 10 years since, the New York City coroners' office-- just under 60 percent of the total. The rest remain unofficially accounted for. The terrorist attacks of September 2001 tore a hole in the lives of thousands of people that can never be filled.Small wonder that 500 relatives of the 9/11 victims are suing the bin Laden family company and Saudi princes for $1 trillion. The aim: to prevent future financing of similar attacks.Yes, Al-Qaeda succeeded in striking a huge blow at the United States and its economy. Yet the organizers of the attack clearly did not foresee what they were unleashing. In his statements during the 1990s, Osama bin Laden referenced the 1983 suicide bombing in Lebanon that spurred Ronald Reagan to remove U.S. Marines from that country as well as the 1993 Mogadishu battle that led the U.S. to abandon its Somalian peacekeeping operation. Bin Laden believed that the Americans were too cowardly to retaliate on a grand scale. As a result, the full-blown U.S. assault on Afghanistan in the weeks after 9/11 clearly caught him off-guard, and the main Al Qaeda organization never really managed to recover its balance. Osama bin Laden is dead. The planner of the 9/11 attack, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is in U.S. captivity. Countless other Al-Qaeda operatives have been killed or captured, reducing the organization to a shadow of its former self. Unfortunately, the ideas that fueled it live on.The political and religious tensions fueled by the 9/11 attacks and the U.S. response to them have affected no country more dramatically than Pakistan. Over the past 10 years more than 30,000 Pakistanis have died as the result of terrorist attacks -- including Benazir Bhutto, the country's former prime minister, and a number of other leading cultural and political figures. U.S. attacks on jihadi safe havens in the Pakistani tribal areas have fueled an anti-Western backlash among many people in the country and exacerbated an already severe jihadi threat. The spiral of radicalization threatens the very integrity of the country.The overwhelming majority of Pakistanis are likely more concerned about development than politics. But they have seen little benefit from the billions of dollars the United States has transferred to Islamabad in the years since 9/11, most of which has gone straight to the military.Just over 6,000 U.S. service members have lost their lives in the U.S. ""war on terror,"" and another 43,000 have suffered injuries. The second number might not seem so daunting until you realize that a large percentage of those wounds involve severe brain trauma and the loss of one or more limbs as the result of hugely destructive roadside bombs favored by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. The flood of casualties has overtaxed the health system for veterans.The brunt of the vast overseas military commitments assumed by the United States since 9/11 has been born disproportionately by the relatively small number of Americans who serve in the armed forces and their families. Many regular soldiers and Marines have spent multiple tours of duty overseas -- creating enormous burdens for their families at home. Civilian America, by contrast, has made few comparable sacrifices for the war effort.2,753 of the nearly 3,000 people lost on 9/11 died in the World Trade Center. Among them were 343 firefighters and 60 police officers. People from some 70 countries were among the dead, reflecting New York City's vaunted multicultural character. Another 422,000 New Yorkers have displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder since the attacks. And thousands of first responders -- firefighters, medical emergency personnel, and others who participated in the rescue effort at Ground Zero -- appear to be suffering from lung disease and cancer as a result of inhaling toxic fumes and dust from the collapsed towers. Hundreds of them have died since the attacks, though it is hard to be sure just how many of those deaths can be attributed directly to the aftereffects of 9/11.The city. It was compelled to accept billions of dollars in emergency aid from the federal government in the two years after the attacks. It is estimated that New York City has lost a net total of 100,000 jobs in the decade since 9/11. And that's not even to mention the invisible hole in a majestic skyline.Rank-and-file Muslims in the United States and Great Britain had to cope with a flurry of hate crimes and angry incriminations in the aftermath of 9/11 attacks. Though many Muslim organizations publicly distanced themselves from Al-Qaeda and its actions, Western public opinion tended to focus instead on indications of strong anti-Western sentiment in many Islamic countries -- especially in reaction to America's military and political interventions in the Middle East and South Asia.In fact, though, there is plenty of evidence that Muslims' revulsion toward Al-Qaeda and its allies has steadily grown over the years -- not least because it is mainly Muslims who have died in the countless suicide bombings in Iraq and Afghanistan. (Indeed, Al-Qaeda's No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahiri, once famously chided Iraqi Al-Qaeda operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi for unnecessarily stoking sectarian warfare.) Nowadays jihadi websites tend to spend lots of time complaining about their inability to find recruits.The polarizing effect of 9/11 and America's response to it long overshadowed theuntil the 2009 Green Revolution in Iran and the more recent Arab Spring, which have shown that many young Muslims around the world reject violence and terrorism and aspire instead to peaceful political change.Before 9/11 only 10 percent of bags checked on flights in the United States were screened for weapons or explosives. Five weeks after the attacks, President George W. Bush signed a law mandating that all bags be screened. U.S. airline passengers, previously accustomed to only cursory checks, now had to get used to arriving at airports hours in advance, removing shoes, belts, and water bottles before submitting themselves to elaborate checks. As the U.S. authorities demanded comparable scrutiny on flights coming into the country, these innovations have rippled out through the international aviation system.On the planes themselves, a new era of vigilance and paranoia kicked in -- sometimes justifiably, as shown in the case of the ""underwear bomber"" thwarted by passengers in December 2009. Back on the ground, though, the effects are debatable. Recent tests of airport security systems by enterprising journalists have shown that determined smugglers can still get plenty of dubious articles through the checks.The informal and anonymous networks used for financial transactions in much of the Middle East and South Asia. But the revelation that Al-Qaeda sometimes used hawalas to transfer the funds for their operations triggered a backlash. In Afghanistan, U.S. task forces have cracked down on leading hawalas to curtail financial flows of drug lords and insurgents. The U.S. Treasury Department has pressured Dubai and other Persian Gulf banking centers to implement tough money-laundering laws. And U.S. intelligence agencies have used electronic-surveillance techniques to ensure that the money changing hands through hawalas is clean. Hawalas may never be the same.Pacifists are still around, but arguing the case has certainly become harder in an age when terrorist groups explicitly embrace suicide-bombing attacks on defenseless civilians. (""Where Have All the Pacifists Gone?"" ran the plaintive title of one 2003 essay.) In the United States, a wave of patriotic sentiment in the wake of the attacks inspired thousands of college-age Americans to sign up for military service rather than antiwar demonstrations.The peaceniks who remain earn respect precisely for their noble persistence in the face of overwhelming odds. The name of one group formed by family members who lost loved ones in the 2001 attacks says it all: "".""Osama bin Laden made sure that most of the hijackers on the 9/11 planes were Saudi citizens -- knowing that the resulting revelation would complicate the kingdom's relationship with the United States. It worked, at least in part. While Washington and Riyadh have more or less managed to carry on as before, U.S. public opinion toward Sauid Arabia has taken a nosedive. 9/11 threw a harsh spotlight on Saudi financial support for many extremist groups around the world as well as the Neanderthal doctrines of the Wahhabi Islam practiced inside the kingdom. No one in the outside world cared much about Saudi women being denied the right to drive until after 9/11.And even as the longing for reform seems to have gained strength in the wake of the Arab Spring, Al-Qaeda-style radicals who decry the royal family's decadent habits are still finding plenty of traction. The monarchy's future does not look promising.",2011-09-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['afghanistan', 'united', 'attacks', 'security', 'alqaeda', 'losers', 'states', '911', 'war', 'iraq', 'winners', 'president']",China,news article,English

Flood rescue workers are coming across residents who are not ready to be evacuated until they have their documents safe in hand, reports say.

The final National Register of Citizens will be published on July 31. Nearly 42 lakh people were excluded in earlier drafts, and this is presumably their last chance. If they are left out of the final list, they will have to face foreigners’ tribunals, quasi-judicial bodies while rule on matters of nationality. Those declared foreigners by the tribunals will be stripped of the rights and privileges of citizenship, and risk being detained or deported.

State officials were in the final stages of hearing claims and objections to earlier drafts when floods struck.

“There is huge flood water and strong current in the Brahmaputra,” Parvesh Kumar, a National Disaster Response Force worker in Morigaon district, told NDTV. “Water is entering the villages first and we are tasked with this challenging operation to evacuate people. When we go to bring them, almost everyone carries a bunch of papers: their NRC documents. People are ready to leave everything but not their NRC file.”

At least 17 people have died so far due to the floods, with 30 of 33 districts of Assam submerged, PTI reported. More than 45 lakh people from 4,620 villages were affected, and around 1.01 lakh people were taking refuge at 226 relief camps. Morigaon is among the worst-hit districts.

According to rescue worker Kailash Sharma, a villager in Laharighat began “crying inconsolably” as he had left behind his NRC documents while being evacuated. “We sent our diver and he got the bunch of documents which was in the plastic pouch,” Sharma told NDTV.

Some flood-hit families are reluctant to even move out. According to The Indian Express, home and land will prove to be tangible markers of identity while proving citizenship. “This could be one of the reasons that they feel so scared to leave their homes,” an unidentified official from the local administration said.

Parvesh Kumar told The Indian Express that the families who agree to be rescued ensure that their documents are safe with them. “So many times, we brought them to safety, only to go back again because they realise they have forgotten their documents,” he said.

Samsul Alam of Mahmari village in Morigaon was rescued along with his 100-year-old mother, wife and children – along with his NRC documents. He told NDTV: “We somehow survived, we kept floating on a banana trunk, [didn’t] have anything to eat for two days. This flood has taken away my home, my land and my livelihood, but I am happy I have the most precious [things] with me – my mother, wife and children and NRC document. Without them, I would be stateless.”

Authorities conducting the claims and objections are also facing problems. “The overflowing rivers have submerged the low-lying areas and it has become difficult for us to communicate with those villages,” Satyali Biswas, assistant circle officer in Bhuragaon, told Time8. “The NRC Seva Kendras, hearing centres and documents are safe. It is the claimants’ villages which are reeling under flood waters.”

The stated aim of the National Register of Citizens is to distinguish genuine Indian citizens from undocumented immigrants living in the state. According to the terms, anyone who cannot prove that they or their ancestors entered Assam before midnight on March 24, 1971, will be declared a foreigner.

918,DR-2011-000121-CHN,What Afghans think of the war: 'Why are you Americans here?' - Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2011/0909/What-Afghans-think-of-the-war-Why-are-you-Americans-here,"Stacks of folded carpets line every wall of Haji Mohammad Qul's rug shop on Chicken Street, Kabul's shopping destination for foreigners in search of Afghan souvenirs.

Though Mr. Qul sells predominately traditional Persian carpets, like most Chicken Street venders he offers a small selection of Sept. 11-themed rugs. These commemorative carpets are about the size of a doormat and feature crude, hand-woven images of planes striking the World Trade Center.

Despite selling several of these rugs each month, Qul says he doesn't really know where the image on them comes from or what Sept. 11 is.

""It's just an item in our shop that we sell to Americans and Europeans,"" he says with a shrug.

When pressed on what, if anything, he knows about the events of Sept. 11, 2001, he changes the subject to a drought in northwest Afghanistan. Asked again, his teenage son, who everyone says is the most educated person in the family, reminds him about Osama bin Laden.

Qul continues: ""Yes, I think it's from bin Laden. We were refugees in Pakistan at that time, and I had to take care of my family.... I was too busy to pay attention to the political events in the news.""

A decade after Sept. 11, Qul is just one of many Afghans who say they have heard almost nothing about the attacks that led to the fall of the Taliban government and an ongoing, 10-year foreign military presence in his country.

As US policymakers debate keeping troops in Afghanistan as far out as 2024, the void of information among large swaths of the Afghan population this deep into the war may cast doubt on the ability of the United States to effectively accomplish its goals here in the coming years.

""The foreigners absolutely did not communicate.... They only spoke with bombs and guns,"" says Najib Mamalai, an independent political analyst in Kabul. ""They alienated every single human body in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq to their causes. Nobody believes in their cause now.""

Following the Sept. 11 attacks, the US invaded Afghanistan in order to eliminate it as a terrorist haven and to install a government capable of creating the stability required to support this goal. The US has spent an estimated $450 billion on the war in Afghanistan, including more than $70 billion on development projects. Additionally, more than 1,750 US soldiers and almost 950 soldiers from allied nations have lost their lives here. More than 13,000 US soldiers have been wounded.

Have the Soviets left?

Although there has been significant development in Afghanistan during the past 10 years, much of the country remains cut off from the recent wave of progress.

""They know why they are here. I don't know the reason why they are here. You should ask them why they are here, to make peace or to destroy Afghanistan. I don't know why,"" says Momin, who sells tailoring supplies in Jalalabad and, like many Afghans, only has one name. He also has no idea what occurred on Sept. 11. ""Something happened in Pakistan on this day, but I don't remember exactly what. I don't have details about it – maybe they had a fight with India,"" he speculates, adding that he is certain nothing happened in America on that day.

About 72 percent of the country is illiterate, and in some remote areas of the country there are small pockets of people who are unaware that the Soviet war ended – some 22 years ago. In rural areas that now have cellphone service, there remain Afghans who've never used a telephone and say they have no need for one.

During the Taliban regime, television was banned. Only a very small group of people had access to sets they'd managed to hide. Mohammad Kabir Raufi, another carpet vendor in Kabul, had managed to keep one hidden in his house despite the prohibition. He remembers watching the events unfold on Sept. 11.

""It's just the educated people who work and have knowledge who will recognize [images of 9/11],"" says Mr. Raufi. ""The ordinary people will not. They don't know where the twin towers were or what happened to them and what was the result of the attack.""

More common are Afghans who heard of the attacks and sensed the inevitability of yet another war in their country. As US and NATO forces began pouring into the nation, though, the attacks in New York and Washington and the crash in Pennsylvania became an afterthought for Afghans who were understandably more focused on the troops in their own country.

Even among educated Afghans who know what happened on Sept. 11, there are still many who strongly doubt what they saw or heard and earnestly believe readily disprovable conspiracy theories.

Habibullah Rafi is a respected historian who specializes in Kabul history at the Afghanistan Academy of Sciences, an academic research institute. On the morning of the attacks, he was with his family in Calgary, Alberta. Today he says that he believes America planned the attacks so it could invade Afghanistan and Iraq.

""After Russia was destroyed in Afghan­is­tan, America needed a way to sneak in here,"" he says, echoing a popular theory.

Among his reasons that the US remains here, he lists America's plan to ""steal Afghanistan's resources."" Although the country could be sitting on considerable mineral deposits, the scope of these deposits is still debated, and many experts speculate that the cost of extracting them could severely diminish returns on the minerals. So far, China is the only nation conducting major mining operations here.

Though concerns about Israel are predominately confined to the Arab world and not a major topic of conversation in Afghanistan, Mr. Rafi also accuses the US of wanting to pave the way for an Israeli occupation here.

The most popular conspiracy theory for Israeli regional domination, based on a fraudulent document, says that Israeli territorial ambitions extend to the Euphrates River in Iraq, about 1,000 miles from Afghanistan's western border. There is presently only one known Jewish man living in all of Afghanistan: Zablon Simintov. His family frequently urges him to move to Israel.

US reassurances that troops are in Afghanistan to eliminate terrorist havens seem increasingly suspect to Afghans after Mr. bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in May, and even more so now that Al Qaeda's No. 2 was killed there in late August.

Even for those who've heard America's message about why the US must stay in Afghanistan, strong indications that Al Qaeda has relocated to Pakistan – combined with a civilian death toll that has risen with each new year – help fuel suspicion and misinformation.

""After Osama and a lot of other Al Qaeda leaders were killed [in Pakistan], still America is here in Afghanistan,"" says Saleh Mohammed Saleh, a member of the Afghan parliament from Kunar. ""This makes the Afghans not trust anyone and be suspicious of the activities of America.""

Living in a nation transformed

Today, the actual causes of the war are largely irrelevant to many Afghans who now live in a nation that has been completely transformed by the US presence.

""At the beginning, it had a very positive effect for our business and it was a shining moment for us,"" says Majeed Uzbek, who sells handicrafts in Kabul. ""They came because the Taliban did this attack and they've done a lot of rebuilding. This was 100 percent good for Afghanistan.""

Indeed, foreign aid in Afghanistan has had such a massive impact that the World Bank now estimates that international military and donor spending accounts for 97 percent of the country's gross domestic product. This estimate has triggered concerns among US policymakers that the Afghan economy might collapse as foreign spending decreases in Afghanistan.

But many Afghans complain that only a select few actually see any monetary benefit from the war.

1694,FL-2021-000021-IND,13 of 486 Uttarakhand glacial lakes vulnerable: GSI - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/13-of-486-uttarakhand-glacial-lakes-vulnerable-gsi/article33782869.ece,"Team of experts will assess damage and trigger factor responsible for Sunday outburst, says official

The Geological Survey of India has through remote sensing and multispectral data found 13 of 486 glacial lakes in Uttarakhand to be vulnerable.

A glacial lake can breach causing outburst flood like the one in Chamoli on Sunday due to avalanche or landslip in its periphery, cloudburst in the catchment, a major quake and other geological factors, GSI’s Director-General Ranjit Rath said in New Delhi on Monday.

“The glaciers in the Himalayas are retreating under climate change scenario. This is a global phenomenon,” Dr. Rath said, adding that glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) can result in the discharge of a huge volume of water leading to severe damage downstream.

“With the passage of time, some of the glacial lakes near the terminus often coalesce and form large glacial lakes dammed by glacial moraines. The moraines comprising loose boulders, gravels and sand admixture often containing dead ice impart inherent weakness to these dams.”

These lakes are quite common on the debris-covered Himalayan glaciers with their lower part moving very slowly and at times remaining almost stationary. Sudden triggering mechanisms make them burst out, he said.

Dr. Rath said the GSI had during 2014-16 undertaken the compilation of an inventory of glacial lakes of the Uttarakhand Himalaya to identify high-risk areas for GLOF. This was done as a follow-up of the Kedarnath tragedy in June 2013.

“We identified 486 glacial lakes excluding the supra-glacial lakes and 13 of these were found to be vulnerable,” he said.

According to the GSI’s inventory, 71 lakes of different sizes and types are in the upper reaches of Rishiganga and Dhauliganga valley.

“The GSI is in the process of finding out the focal point of this unfortunate flash flood event. Right now, it is not clear whether the flood is a typical GLOF or some temporary damming due to a landslip and avalanche that might have blocked the mainstream to form a temporary lake which got burst.”

He said a team of experts will assess the damage and the trigger factor responsible for the outburst once the water level recedes.

“The floodwater and mudflow will lose steam and cause less harm to life and property in the lower reaches. However, people living close to the river should be properly alerted,” Dr. Rath said.",2021-02-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'lakes', 'glof', 'water', 'glacial', 'rath', 'lake', 'vulnerable', '486', 'gsi', 'uttarakhand', 'outburst', 'damage', '13']",India,news article,English
73,DR-2014-000109-CHN,The Most Violent Era In America Was Before Europeans Arrived - Science 2.0,https://www.science20.com/news_articles/the_most_violent_era_in_america_was_before_europeans_arrived-141847,"There's a mythology about the native Americans, that they were all peaceful and in harmony with nature - it's easy to create narratives when there is no written record.

But archeology keeps its own history and a new paper finds that the 20th century, with its hundreds of millions dead in wars and, in the case of Germany, China, Russia and other dictatorships, genocide, was not the most violent - on a per-capita basis that honor may belong to the central Mesa Verde of southwest Colorado and the Pueblo Indians.

Writing in the journal American Antiquity, Washington State University archaeologist Tim Kohler and colleagues document how nearly 90 percent of human remains from that period had trauma from blows to either their heads or parts of their arms.

""If we're identifying that much trauma, many were dying a violent death,"" said Kohler. The study also offers new clues to the mysterious depopulation of the northern Southwest, from a population of about 40,000 people in the mid-1200s to 0 in 30 years.

From the days they first arrived in the Southwest in the 1800s, most anthropologists and archaeologists have downplayed evidence of violent conflict among native Americans.

""Archaeologists with one or two exceptions have not tried to develop an objective metric of levels of violence through time,"" said Kohler. ""They've looked at a mix of various things like burned structures, defensive site locations and so forth, but it's very difficult to distill an estimate of levels of violence from such things. We've concentrated on one thing, and that is trauma, especially to the head and portions of the arms. That's allowed us to look at levels of violence through time in a comparative way.""

It wasn't just violent deaths that poke holes in the harmony with the land and each other myth. A paper in June in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the Southwest also had a baby boom between 500 and 1300 that likely exceeded any population spurt on earth today. The northern Rio Grande also experienced population booms but the central Mesa Verde got more violent while the northern Rio Grande was less so.

Kohler has conjectures on why. Social structures among people in the northern Rio Grande changed so that they identified less with their kin and more with the larger pueblo and specific organizations that span many pueblos, such as medicine societies. The Rio Grande also had more commercial exchanges where craft specialists provided people both in the pueblo, and outsiders, specific things they needed, such as obsidian arrow points.

But in the central Mesa Verde, there was less specialization.

""When you don't have specialization in societies, there's a sense in which everybody is a competitor because everybody is doing the same thing,"" said Kohler. But with specialization, people are more dependent on each other and more reluctant to do harm.

If that sounds like rationalization based on Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, it is.

""Pinker thought that what he called 'gentle commerce' was very important in the pacification of the world over the last 5,000 years,"" said Kohler. ""That seems to work pretty well in our record as well.""

The episode of conflict in Southwest Colorado seems to have begun when people in the Chaco culture, halfway between central Mesa Verde and northern Rio Grande, attempted to spread into Southwest Colorado.

From 1080 to 1130, the Chaco-influenced people in Southwest Colorado did well. In the mid-1100s, there was a severe drought and the core of Chaco culture fell apart. Much of the area around Chaco lost population, and in 1160, violence in the central Mesa Verde peaked. Slightly more than a century later, everyone left that area, too.

""In the Mesa Verde there could be a haves-versus-have-nots dynamic towards the very end,"" said Kohler. ""The people who stayed the longest were probably the people who were located in the very best spots. But those pueblos too were likely losing population. And it might have been the older folks who stuck around, who weren't so anxious to move as the young folks who thought, 'We could make a better living elsewhere.'"" Older, or with too few people to marshal a good defense, the remaining people in the Mesa Verde pueblos were particularly vulnerable to raids.

At least two of the last-surviving large pueblos in the central Mesa Verde were attacked as the region was being abandoned. Some of their inhabitants probably made it out alive, but, says Kohler, ""Many did not.""",2014-08-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['central', 'verde', 'violent', 'era', 'europeans', 'kohler', 'rio', 'northern', 'america', 'arrived', 'violence', 'southwest', 'population', 'mesa']",China,news article,English

2039,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"Himalayan glacier bursts in India, over 100 feared dead in floods - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1606018,"As many as 150 people were feared dead in northern India after a Himalayan glacier broke and crashed into a dam early on Sunday, with floods forcing the evacuation of villages downstream.

The actual number has not been confirmed yet, but 100 to 150 people were feared dead, Om Prakash, chief secretary of Uttarakhand state where the incident occurred, told Reuters.

A witness reported a wall of dust, rock and water as an avalanche roared down a river valley.

It came very fast, there was no time to alert anyone, Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of Raini village, told Reuters by phone. I felt that even we would be swept away.

Locals fear that people working at a nearby hydro-power project had been swept away, as well as villagers roaming near the river looking for firewood or grazing their cattle, Rana said. We have no idea how many people are missing.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was closely monitoring the situation.

India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyones safety there, he said on Twitter after speaking with the state chief minister.

Indias air force was being readied to help with rescue operations, the federal government said, while Home Minister Amit Shah said disaster-response teams were being airlifted in to help with relief and rescue.

All the concerned officers are working on a war footing, Shah said on Twitter, referring to Uttarakhand by its nickname, the Hindi term for land of the gods  due to the numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres located across the state.

The neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous, also put its riverside areas on high alert.

Footage shared by locals showed the water washing away parts of the dam as well as whatever else was in its path.

Videos on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed water surging through a small dam site, washing away construction equipment.

The flow of the Alaknanda River beyond Nandprayag [stretch] has become normal, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Twitter.

The water level of the river is now one metre above normal but the flow is decreasing.

Meanwhile, Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry, the spokesperson for Pakistan's foreign ministry, also expressed sorrow over the ""loss of precious lives due to flash floods caused by glacier break-off in Uttarakhand"".

Uttarakhand in the Himalayas is prone to flash floods and landslides. In June 2013, record rainfall caused devastating floods that claimed close to 6,000 lives.

That disaster was dubbed the Himalayan tsunami by the media due to the torrents of water unleashed in the mountainous area, which sent mud and rocks crashing down, burying homes, sweeping away buildings, roads and bridges.

Uma Bharti, Indias former water resources minister and a senior leader of Modis party, criticised the construction of a power project in the area.

When I was a minister I had requested that Himalaya is a very sensitive place, so power projects should not be built on Ganga and its main tributaries, she said on Twitter, referring to the main river that flows from the mountain.",2021-02-07 08:00:00+00:00,"['100', 'minister', 'chief', 'uttarakhand', 'glacier', 'feared', 'water', 'away', 'state', 'himalayan', 'floods', 'india', 'bursts', 'dam', 'river', 'twitter', 'dead']",Pakistan,news article,English

(Representational) Further, nearly 100 talukas have already recorded rainfall between 126-250 mm (nearly 5-10 inch) during this monsoon season, the highest in the last five years. (Representational)

Two weeks since the south west monsoon arrived in Gujarat, Kutch and Saurashtra regions have received around 25 per cent of the average rainfall witnessed during this period. The southwest monsoon officially arrived Gujarat on June 14 covering districts of Valsad, Navsari, Tapi, Dang and Surat.

Kutch district has already received 25 per cent of the average rainfall during monsoon, which is the highest in the last five years – in 2017 it had received 15 per cent of the average rainfall. The Saurashtra region has received 22 per cent of its season’s share.

Further, nearly 100 talukas have already recorded rainfall between 126-250 mm (nearly 5-10 inch) during this monsoon season, the highest in the last five years.

Subsequently, comparing the rainfall data till June 30 for the last five years, this year the least number of talukas – 32 — received 0-50 mm rainfall, which is the lowest rainfall bracket. While 172 talukas received 0-50 mm rainfall in 2016, the highest in last five years, it was 116 in 2018.

Attributing the early rains in Kutch and Saurashtra regions to the Cyclone Nisarga witnessed in the first week of June, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said that it was also conducive for the entire state.

“Due to the Cyclone Nisarga, a lot of moisture could come to the state and especially to the Saurashtra and arid Kutch regions, which are bereft of moisture. Also, due to this, Gujarat was quite conducive and thus rainfall was active in most parts of the state,” said Manorama Mohanty Additional Director of IMD’s Ahmedabad region.

Kutch and Saurashtra regions that cover almost half of the state geographically are expected to continue to add to its receipt of rainfall as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts rainfall for these regions, throughout this week.

“Due to a cyclonic circulation over south Gujarat now and neig-hbourhood between 1.5 km and 4.5 km above mean sea level tilting towards the southwest with height is expected to bring moderate rainfall with thunderstorm in the districts of Saurashtra, Kutch along with north and central districts,” Mohanty added on the forecast for this week.

On Tuesday, the 131 talukas that received rainfall included almost all districts of Saurashtra and Kutch. Kalavad taluka in Jamnagar district recorded the highest in the state (till 4 pm) — 73 mm in barely two hours from 12 pm till 2 pm.

Among the five regions the state has been divided into, the South Gujarat has received the lowest rainfall this season — 9.01 per cent. This is the region’s second lowest share in the last five years — in the monsoon of 2016, it barely received 4 per cent of the average rainfall.

The North Gujarat region has received 10.50 per cent of its monsoon share while the East Central region 14.15 per cent, which is also its highest share in last five years.

The state has recorded 122.24 mm, an average of 14.71 per cent rainfall till June 30, second highest after 2017, the year when the state witnessed one of its worst floods, devastating the North Gujarat districts of Banaskantha and Patan. In 2017, the average rainfall received till June 30 was 15.43 per cent.

The IMD has issued a heavy rainfall warning for districts of North Gujarat including Banask-antha and Patan, South Gujarat including Valsad, Navsari and Surat and in Saurashtra region namely Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Porbandar till July 5.",2020-07-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['average', '25', 'cent', 'saurashtra', 'regions', 'state', 'highest', 'monsoon', 'gujarat', 'mm', 'kutch', 'rainfall', 'received']",India,news article,English
34,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Eight reasons why New Yorkers should stop complaining about how hard life is in New York - Quartz,https://qz.com/245847/eight-reasons-why-new-york-is-the-unhappiest-city-in-the-us/,"If you have ever been to New York, read anything about it, or listened to Frank Sinatra, you know the two most important things about the Big Apple are that it’s the best city on earth and an incredibly tough place to live.

Busy, expensive, dirty, too hot or too cold, New York is a giant rat race—and full of actual rats—with a challenging scarcity of real estate, eligible bachelors, and large sodas (no, just kidding, the soda ban was banned). New York is so tough that a recent study found it to be America’s unhappiest city.

Detroit went bankrupt; Toledo, Ohio has an ongoing drinking-water emergency; Santa Cruz, California was hit by a drought—but New York is unhappier?

New Yorkers have elevated grousing to an art form, so of course a study that takes into account their self-assessment of happiness will find them miserable.

In an attempt to make New Yorkers feel better about themselves, here is some context to their commonest complaints.

1. The rent is too damn high

True. The rent is high. The rent in most of Manhattan (and some of Brooklyn) is offensively high.

Perhaps New Yorkers would be happier in Monte Carlo, where renting a 1,300 sq ft (120 sq m) apartment costs $10,099 (versus New York’s $6,553), or in Willston, North Dakota, where the shale oil boom means the average rent is about $800 more than New York’s (and people can’t even line up downstairs to get a cronut).

Also, what about the price to income ratio?

2. Apartments are too small

It’s not just the price of homes that makes New Yorkers unhappy. It’s the size.

The city’s minimum size for a unit of living space is 400 sq ft (41 sq m), although there are plans to begin building 300 sq feet micro-units at the end of the year. Now that’s small—as in, a small building in Hong Kong.

3. It’s too competitive

A study was published by the Economist Intelligence Unit last year labeling New York “the world’s most competitive city.” Promptly, publications including the New York Times chimed in to prove New Yorkers right, noting that “anyone who has tried to park a car on a Manhattan street may already have deemed New York the world’s most competitive city.”

The study actually looked at how competitive New York is compared to other cities, not at the city’s own competitiveness.

But it sure is hard to make it. For instance, trying to get a job:

4. Winters are too cold

New York winters are rather brutal. But have you ever spent a winter in Montreal? And when’s the last time you heard someone from Ulan Bator (where the temperature gets to -49°C) go on a rant about the freezing weather?

5. Summers? Too hot

Unless you compare them with the high temperatures of places where it actually is too hot.

no-caption

6. Traffic’s terrible

Most New Yorkers don’t drive. But they take taxis and sometimes those taxis get stuck in traffic. It’s awful, which is why New Yorkers always know what route the taxi should take to avoid ending up in a jam. Such routes also often fail because—see?—traffic is everywhere.

And while traffic is everywhere—parking? None in sight. Except for the 4.4 million free parking spaces (and 81,875 metered ones) around town.

7. It’s too crowded

If you had to pick only one word about New York to carry with you on a desert island, “busy” would be it. People are busy. Places are busy. Train cars are busy.

Because there are just too many people in New York.

no-caption

8. And tourists are everywhere

In 2012, 52.7 million tourists (both domestic and international) visited New York. That’s about 6.5 tourists a year for every New Yorker.

But it could be a lot worse. It could be Venice, where there are 50,000 residents and 22 million tourists a year.

That’s 440 tourists per person.",2014-08-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['hard', 'complaining', 'million', 'busy', 'reasons', 'life', 'sq', 'study', 'rent', 'tourists', 'competitive', 'yorkers', 'yorks', 'york', 'stop']",China,news article,English

335,FL-2021-000025-AUS,"Australia flood loss hits A$438m, to drive higher reinsurance costs - Artemis.bm",https://www.artemis.bm/news/australia-flood-loss-hits-a438m-to-drive-higher-reinsurance-costs/,"The severe flooding and storms that affected parts of east and southeastern Australia recently are expected to add to reinsurance pricing pressure for the major insurance carriers operating in the country.



Insurance claims from the flooding are now estimated to have driven a loss of A$438 million, according to the latest figures from the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA).

The ICA’s tally of claims filed due to the flooding and severe weather catastrophe across parts of New South Wales and Queensland is now approaching 30,000 and this figure is expected to continue rising over the coming days.

Australia’s largest primary insurance carriers are expected to exceed their catastrophe budgets for the latest fiscal year, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, with reinsurance recoveries expected through their quota shares and potentially their excess-of-loss towers.

As we explained Friday, IAG estimated the net cost of the floods and weather at approximately A$135 million after its quota share reinsurance, but A$200 million pre-quota share.

IAG’s net costs from the flood event will be capped at A$169 million, which is its maximum retention per-event, for a first event, under its 2021 catastrophe reinsurance program. So if the claims situation deteriorates IAG could certainly see a recovery under this tower.

In addition, the company said that it expects the heavy rain and flooding event will erode around $150 million of the $400 million deductible on this aggregate reinsurance tower.

Morgan Stanley’s analyst team believe that Suncorp is likely to similarly exceed its catastrophe budget for the period as a result of the flooding and rains, which could again mean the pair of insurers are required to increase these budgets for next year.

Australia’s insurers have steadily been increasing their catastrophe budgets and strengthening their reinsurance provisions in recent years, as weather and climate related catastrophe events have hit their businesses hard.

Favourable pricing on the inwards sides of their businesses will help to offset higher catastrophe budgets and costs somewhat, but there are also expected to be higher cost burdens on the other side, in their reinsurance purchases, Morgan Stanley’s analysts said.

The analysts report that feedback from reinsurance firms suggests these Australian insurers recent years of catastrophe losses and resulting loss-making are seen as an issue.

As a result, the cost of reinsurance protection is expected to rise further for them at the next renewals and increasingly, the Australian carriers are seen as sensitive to these higher costs.

However, lowering the volatility in their businesses is seen as key and of course reinsurance is one way to achieve that.

Both of these insurers catastrophe budgets are rising as a percentage of net earned premiums and have been on an upwards trajectory for well over a decade now.

It’s no surprise we’ve seen the introduction of stop-loss layers in their reinsurance programs, nor that aggregate reinsurance has proven so important to them and seen them sharing a large proportion of their losses with global reinsurers and also ILS funds in recent years.

Reinsurance capital is only going to become more important for these companies, as they deal with the rising costs of frequent and severe weather and catastrophe losses.

But they will pay more for access to it, which could make looking at how they can lock-in protection over multiple years increasingly attractive and may result in them looking to reinsurance from the capital markets, potentially even through catastrophe bonds.

As rapid Covid-19 vaccine campaigns in the U.S. and some other rich countries hold the promise of a return to more normal life for their citizens, some countries, particularly poor ones, face a starkly different reality: soaring coronavirus cases, including new highs, more than a year into the pandemic.

Public health experts have for months warned that uneven vaccine distribution would leave swaths of the world exposed to fresh waves of infection, economically devastating lockdowns and potentially new virus strains. That divide—between rapidly vaccinating nations poised for an economic revival and those still trapped in the throes of the pandemic—is beginning to emerge.

The schism is particularly pronounced between rich countries such as the U.S. and the U.K and developing nations.

In the Philippines—a nation of 110 million people that has received around 1.5 million vaccine doses so far—daily caseloads since mid-March have regularly exceeded last year’s peak. The U.K. and South Africa variants of the virus, associated with infection spikes in those places, are spreading in the Philippines, health authorities say. The Catholic-majority country has banned religious gatherings in the capital of Manila and its surrounding areas ahead of the Easter holiday and curbed travel.

The surge is mirrored in other largely unvaccinated countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Brazil. In Brazil, Covid-19 has killed more than 300,000 people, and about 3,000 people are dying a day now.

By contrast, in the U.S., where more than a quarter of the population has received at least one dose, around 15% are fully vaccinated and the Biden administration aims to hit 200 million doses during its first 100 days in office, schools and businesses are reopening and restrictions are being lifted in many places.

Similarly, fast-moving vaccination drives in the U.K. and Israel have prompted officials there to ease some restrictions. The U.K. has administered at least one shot to roughly 40% of its population and plans to offer vaccination to all adults by the end of July. More than 55% of Israelis have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Instead, in the Philippines, with cases rising fast, the government is enacting new rounds of curbs. For the two weeks leading up to Easter on April 4, residents of Manila and some surrounding areas are barred from going to other parts of the country except for essential travel. As infections climbed this past weekend, the Philippines government tightened restrictions further, imposing a 6 p.m. curfew and ordering companies to strictly limit on-site staff.

For a second year in a row, Easter festivities will be muted. Mario Panaligan, a doctor in the capital, would typically travel to his family village for Maundy Thursday, a holiday that precedes Easter Sunday. Instead, he will tune into online mass this year. “It’s definitely a sad reality,” he said of the Philippines’ difficulties in acquiring vaccines.

The pandemic has already upended livelihoods, with workers bringing in nearly 10% less income than they had before Covid-19, according to the World Bank, which predicts that the Southeast Asian country’s economic output won’t return to pre-pandemic levels before mid-2022. The economic contraction was due in part to strict nationwide lockdowns and mobility restrictions, the bank said.

Limited global supply of vaccines and large orders by rich countries have made it harder for developing nations to secure deals. The Philippines has so far received around 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca PLC’s shot from a World Health Organization program for poorer countries and a million doses of Chinese company Sinovac’s vaccine, donated by Beijing. Moderna Inc. said last week it would begin supplying the Philippines with 20 million doses of its vaccine by the middle of the year.

“We would like to have done vaccination in the areas with an uptick in cases, but the world does not function that way,” said Cynthia Saloma, executive director of the Philippine Genome Center, which analyzes Covid-19 samples to determine which variants are circulating. “Countries which are not vaccinated will become…new ground for more variants coming out.”

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom last week described inequitable vaccine distribution as a moral outrage. The gap between shots administered in rich countries and through the Covax program for poorer countries was “becoming more grotesque every day,” he said. Although some wealthy European countries like France and Germany have been slower to vaccinate than the U.S. or Israel, they still have immunized a higher share than poorer countries like Mexico, Philippines and Bangladesh.

Scientists in the Philippines blame the new wave in part on loosened restrictions to boost the economy and pandemic fatigue. In addition to the U.K. and South Africa variants now circulating in the country, recent genomic sampling uncovered a new strain called P.3, first discovered in the Philippines. Health authorities say they don’t yet know if it is more transmissible or dangerous and are studying it.

The emergency room at metro Manila’s St. Luke’s Medical Center is at full capacity, with Covid-19 patients waiting to be admitted. Despite an increase in critical care beds, a post on its Facebook page said that its Covid wards were occupied and those needing immediate treatment for Covid-19 should head to other institutions.

“It’s really stressful,” said Kristine Gregorio, a nurse at St. Luke’s who is working 12-hour shifts. “If we move [a recovering] patient outside of the ICU another very sick patient will replace [them].”

2248,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Anguish as Mekong Deltas annual floods continue to dry up - VnExpress International,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/anguish-as-mekong-delta-s-annual-floods-continue-to-dry-up-4171382.html,"It is time for the annual floods in the Mekong Delta, but the flooding season these days is more a cherished memory than a practical phenomenon.

One day in mid-September Cao Van Bi, 50, was rowing a boat with his wife across a paddy field that had been partially flooded.

All over the field, in Phu Hoi, a rural commune in An Giang Provinces An Phu District, traps had been set up to catch fish.

That morning the catch was 2.5 kilograms of carp and five kilograms of other fish and shrimp.

In previous years, during the flooding season, Bi would have got dozens of kilograms worth of fish every day, but these days it never exceeds 10 kg.

Cao Van Bi and his wife collect the fish they catch in one morning in mid September, 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Nam.

The reason is that the annual flooding of Vietnam's Mekong Delta from the upstream Mekong before reaching the sea no longer occurs.

Not far away, in Vinh Hoi Dong Commune in An Phu, Phan Van Lang, 54, was standing in front of his house.

Since they live in an area hit by annual flooding, Lang and his neighbors have their houses built well above the ground. His house is nearly three meters in the air with a flight of the stairs leading up from the road. In 2000, for instance, the floodwater almost reached the house. But ever since the flooding levels have kept decreasing.

Pointing at the road in front of his house, he says the entire road would have been under one meter of water at this time of the year but this year, the water has not even reached the road.

Hung Dien Commune in Long An Province's Tan Hung District, 80 km (50 miles) away, has been witnessing the clearest change.

In the past its paddy fields would have waters reaching waist high and be filled with water lilies and boats would be the only means of getting around.

That scene now exists only in the memories of seniors.

Bay De, 53, who has been fishing for more than 30 years, recalls floods when catching up to 200 kg of various kinds of fish every day and earning a million dong ($40) was a ""piece of cake.""

For several weeks now he has not caught any fish. He spends almost every day drinking tea and chatting with neighbors in his thatched house.

Fifty kilometers away, Tran Van Thanh, 58, of Tan Lap Commune in Moc Hoa District is fixing traps for catching crabs.

He has been doing this for dozens of years, a job that has ensured a decent livelihood, but that has changed.

""I used to set up more than 600 traps during the flood season, but only a few tens of them these days because the flood waters are way too low and there are no crabs to catch.""

In the neighboring province of Dong Thap, Nguyen Van Phuong, 42, of Tan Thanh A Commune in Tan Hong District is watching the news on TV for possible information about the floods, something he has been looking forward to for several weeks now.

He has an eight-hectare rice field and has been waiting for the floods to come so that he could start sowing the winter-spring crop.

There was heavy rain a few weeks ago, and water had filled up canals and then reached the fields. Phuong, thinking the floods had finally arrived, hired people to till the soil.

But soon a scorching sun replaced the rains and water dropped, leaving the field dry and cracked once again.

He says: ""I had spent VND750,000 ($32.44) per hectare, but that has been a wasted effort. Now I have to wait for the floodwaters to come and do that all over again.""

In his neighborhood, farmers are now worried that if the floods do not come or are low, they would have to shell out money to pump water from canals into their fields.

Rice farmers in the delta have for generations depended on the floodwaters to come and inundate their fields before sow seeds directly.

The Plain of Reeds, a wetland straddling Long An and Dong Thap provinces, produces more than two million tons of rice a year.

The floods usually start coming in late July or early August and remain until November or even later to bless the region with extraordinary fertility as they typically deposit silt from upstream areas.

When they do not come or arrive late, cropping and fishing activities are disrupted.

For several years now they have been late or deficient, and experts have been blaming this on climate change and the construction of a series of dams in the upstream area.

According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, this years floodwater level in the delta will be only 55 percent of the long-term average, which translates into a shortfall of 130 billion cubic meters.

It will be 15 percent lower than last years level and the lowest in a decade, it has warned.

Late last year the highest water levels in the upstream areas of the delta were 1.12-2 meters lower than the long-term average and 1-1.65 meters lower than in the previous year.

The delta suffered the worst salinity levels and resultant freshwater shortage in 100 years but meteorologists warn things could get worse.

Tran Tan Tai, deputy head of the agriculture department of Long Ans Tan Hung District, says the water level in his hometown is currently 1.4 meters, or 80 centimeters lower than a year ago.

""If there are no floods, the fields will lack silt, and pathogens and wild grass seeds will not be washed away, and farmers will have to spend more on pesticide and fertilizers.""

Meteorologists expect the floods to come around the middle of this month, stay low and ebb away quickly.

Those were the days

Early one morning in late September, Muoi, 64, of Tan Lap rides a motorbike to a wet market two kilometers away from home. He returned after a while with a bag of barb.

""All my life I have seen fish all over the place every time it is the flooding season, but now I have to go buy them... Isnt it weird?""

Not far from his home a neighbor had set up a lift net the previous night, but until around noon the next day, when Muoi returned from the market, it had only around two kilograms of fish.

Muoi can never forget what it was like one or two decades ago: Every year when the flood season arrived, water would be everywhere, covering the fields and even the streets. People would be rowing boats, picking water lilies and river hemp, both used to make specialty dishes of the region.

In the water, there would be so much fish that anyone could become a fisherman without having to learn any skills.

""Back then people did not weigh fish in kilograms but in a unit of around 20 kilograms. Normally, in one night a family could catch at least five to seven of that unit. Some would even feed the fish to their pigs.""

In years of heavy flooding fish moving down stream into the delta would breed along the way, and it would be extremely rare to see a field or waterway without fish in it.

Fishermen would enlarge the holes in their net to only catch adult fish, leaving the young ones untouched.

When the floods retreated, mud, algae and water lilies would be left in the paddy fields. The fields mud would be silt while the algae and flowers served as organic fertilizers, leaving the fields with all the nutrition they needed.

Besides, the floods would wash away the pathogens and wild grass seeds, and it was not common for farmers to use fertilizers or pesticides.

A kilometer away from Muois place, Danh Van Minh, 62, asks his son to take him by motorbike to a house nearby. The house stands along a canal and in front is a concrete road around three meters wide.

""This used to be a small dirt road, and every year during this season it would be two or three meters under water,"" Minh says.

""The house used to be just a hut beside which I would anchor my boat after fishing.""

Minhs life has been filled with tragedy. He lost his first wife and two of his children during two different flood seasons.

In the middle of the 1991 season his wife had twins, but both died at birth due to lack of medical care in that rural area.

Worse still the floods covered every inch of land that they could not find a place to bury the children. All he could do was put their bodies in a coffin, stick a bamboo pole in the water and hang the coffin up that.

Only a month after they passed away could he give them a proper burial.

Five years after they lost the twins, Minhs wife suddenly fell sick and died. Once again he could not bury her immediately, and had to leave her body inside a coffin on the family boat and leave it anchored next to the hut.

In the past 20 years the delta has witnessed several floods that left a significant impact on its residents, especially in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2011.

The 2000 floods were the most severe in 70 years, with the water rising to 4.78 meters. They claimed 481 lives and caused losses of nearly VND4 trillion.

As told by Le Thanh Tam, party chief of Long An Province in 1999-2005, 20 years ago and further, the Plain of Reeds had heavy floods almost every year.

The region had not yet got an embankment system, and every time it flooded there was no way to tell where the road was and where the canal was. The only way people could move around was by boat.

""Back then we always had fish, shrimps and crabs in abundance, but we would lose lives every year, and of children in most cases.

""When the floods retreated, we had to expend a lot of effort to rebuild houses and roads.""

But a 2017 study by the Mekong River Commission estimated that the flooding provides $8-10 billion in annual economic benefits while causing losses of just $60-70 million.

The Mekong River flows through six countries, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before reaching the sea.

Many parts of the Mekong Delta were formed by sedimentation over eons.

When the Vietnamese expanded their nation to the south, they began to conquer the delta in the 18th century. For generations, no other place in the nation could compare with it as a agriculture and aquaculture hub.

In his book Last days of the Mighty Mekong published in February last year, Brian Eyler, director of the Asia Program at U.S. think tank Stimson Center, writes: ""For the past 3,000 years, the Mekong carried about 150 million tons of sediment in its system to the delta each year.""

Without the sedimentation, the deltas land would fall apart under natural conditions, which are worsened by intense groundwater extraction and sea level rise, he says.

He strongly condemns Chinas dam building in the upstream areas of the Mekong for holding back floodwaters and, along with them, sediments.

Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent researcher into the ecology of the Mekong Delta, says the main cause of the low floods this year is the El Nino phenomenon that lasted from the years beginning to the end of August, resulting in scanty rain fall in the region.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the rainy season arrived late last year and was shorter than usual, with the result that rainfall was 8 percent below normal at 1,240 mm.

Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of Can Tho Universitys Research Institute of Climate Change, says the calamity faced by the delta cannot be blamed just on nature or Chinese dams.

""Sea levels rise and the Earth gets warmer. Yes. But that happens just a little each year and it needs a long period for dramatic changes. It is humans who have accelerated that process.""

He cites one example of human action that changed the deltas hydrological profile. Ever since the delta was formed, it has had several low-lying areas like the Long Xuyen quadrilateral in Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and Can Tho City and the Plain of Reeds that worked as natural reservoirs to store the seasonal floodwaters, he explains.

For generations farmers did not use them for cultivation, but due to the wars, the nation had to consider food security, and built embankments to keep the seasonal floodwaters from flowing into them and directed the water toward the sea, he says.

""Now in peace time, we still have the mindset of growing as much rice as we can, and many have treated the seasonal floods as a disaster for their paddy fields while in fact it is a blessing.

""With that thinking, many have continued to keep out the floods, going against nature, thus intensifying the lack of water once it took hold in the region.""

Minh, who has been a poor farmer his entire life and is haunted by a tragic past related to the floods, does not care much for the explanations experts like Tuan have to offer.

After his wifes death, he took his son to another village, remarried and built a new life.

He now owns a 6,000 sq.m rice field and both his home and field are surrounded by embankments, allowing him and others in his neighborhood to go against nature and cultivate three instead of just two rice crops as in the past.

The field does not have any time to recover, and instead of getting floodwaters that wash it clean and deposit sediments, it has to do with plant protection chemicals instead.

With this method of growing rice, farmers remain mired in poverty since they have to spend money on fertilizers and pesticides for every crop and also lose out on an abundant source of fish, shrimp and crab and the plants that always grow in the flood season.

""My children and grandchildren have all taken turns to leave,"" Minh says, reflecting the trend of delta dwellers abandoning their hometown for Ho Chi Minh City and other industrial areas, where they work in factories or the service sector.",2020-10-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['continue', 'annual', 'field', 'water', 'dry', 'flooding', 'floods', 'delta', 'anguish', 'mekong', 'fields', 'season', 'away', 'fish', 'deltas']",Vietnam,news article,English
544,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Security Council Press Statement on Situation in Somalia (23 April 2021) - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/security-council-press-statement-situation-somalia-23-april-2021,"The following Security Council press statement was issued today by Council President Dinh Quy Dang (Viet Nam):

The members of the Security Council expressed their deep concern about the continued political impasse and disagreement among Somalia’s political leaders on the model for elections.

The members of the Security Council recalled the significant progress made during the past decade in Somalia, including in terms of security provision, democracy, political reforms and economic development, in particular debt relief. They commended the Somali people, the Somali authorities, the African Union, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and its troop‑contributing countries, the United Nations and Somalia’s other international partners for their role in this endeavour.

The members of the Security Council emphasized that ongoing disagreement over the electoral model is not only undoing this hard-earned progress, but is also diverting attention from pressing problems, such as floods, drought, desert locusts, the COVID-19 pandemic and combating the terrorist threat of Al-Shabaab. They stressed that reaching consensus on elections would support and facilitate the continued development and progress of Somalia and its people.

The members of the Security Council underscored that consensus would be vital for any electoral model to be successfully delivered. They noted the 17 September 2020 agreement has remained the only basis so far endorsed by the Federal Government of Somalia and all Federal Member States.

The members of the Security Council therefore called on all parties to reject violence and resume dialogue as a matter of urgency and without precondition. They called on Somalia’s leaders to recognize and build upon the many areas of agreement already reached, to resolve their remaining differences and to put the interests of the people of Somalia first, within a Somali-owned, Somali-led electoral process, and with an agreed timetable, as soon as possible. They reiterated that, through the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) and in conjunction with AMISOM, the African Union, European Union, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and international partners, they stand ready to assist.

The members of the Security Council took note of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmaajo’s talks with the Democratic Republic of the Congo President and Chairperson of the African Union, Félix Tshisekedi, in Kinshasa on 19 April. They expressed their support for and encouraged regionally led international efforts to help bring the parties back to the table and facilitate inclusive negotiations.

The members of the Security Council took note of the IGAD statement of 21 April and the African Union Peace and Security Council communiqué of 22 April. They expressed their support for the Special Representative of the Secretary‑General, James Swan, and for African Union and IGAD efforts to help resolve the current impasse.

The members of the Security Council condemned all terrorist attacks in Somalia and the region and reaffirmed their respect for the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Somalia.

1709,FL-2021-000021-IND,‘Run!’: India’s glacier disaster survivors recount tunnel escape - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/9/run-indias-glacier-disaster-survivors-recount-tunnel-escape,"Survivors say they clung to scaffolding rods in a tunnel for four hours, keeping their heads above water and debris.

A whistle turned into a roar of water that trapped a dozen men in a Himalayan tunnel after a glacier burst in northern India but Rajesh Kumar lived to tell the tale.

Twenty-six people were confirmed dead but at least 170 others remained missing on Monday after the glacier broke off a mountainside, triggering a flash flood through a valley in Uttarakhand state.

On Sunday, floodwaters swamped a nearby hydroelectric power complex where Kumar and his colleagues were working 300 metres (nearly 1,000 feet) inside a tunnel.

Locals look on the damaged Dhauliganga hydropower project at Reni village in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India [Rajat Gupta/EPA] “We didn’t think we were going to make it,” the 28-year-old told the AFP news agency from his hospital bed.

“Suddenly there was a sound of whistling … there was shouting, people were telling us to come out. We thought it was a fire. We started running but the water gushed in. It was like a Hollywood movie.”

The men clung to scaffolding rods in the tunnel for four hours, keeping their heads above water and debris, trying to reassure each other.

“We just kept telling each other – come what may, we must not let go of the rods. Thank god our hands did not lose their grip,” said Kumar.

As the flood coursed down the valley, the water started to recede in the tunnel, leaving it filled with more than 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) of debris and mud.

“We climbed across the rock debris and forced our way to the mouth of the tunnel,” said Kumar.

There they found a small opening but they were not sure where it led.

“All we knew was that we could feel some air.”

Eventually, they saw some light coming through and one of the men got a phone signal and called for help.

There were emotional scenes as Kumar and his colleagues were pulled out of a tiny hole at the surface.

Some punched the air in joy as they saw daylight, some were put straight onto stretchers and carried away. One man put his arms in the air and then fell face-first into the mud.

Despite their hours-long ordeal, they miraculously managed to escape with just minor injuries.

Indian rescue team members carry a body recovered near Reni village in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India [Rajat Gupta/EPA] Shopkeeper Ramesh Negi from Raini village was basking in the Sunday morning sun at his home overlooking the plant when he heard a loud roar and saw a huge wall of water smash into and sweep away a bridge that led to the Chinese border.

Dozens of workers building a concrete dam on the Dhouli Ganga river bed and shepherds leading their cattle along the mountain slopes disappeared beneath the sudden deluge, leaving behind a wasteland of grey and brown sludge.

“There was dust and screams all over,” the 36-year-old Negi told AFP.

“We tried to alert the grazers but they were blown away by the wind pressure before being consumed by the water and slush. We can only guess what happened.”

Mangra, another tunnel survivor, still cannot sleep.

On Sunday, he heard a loud, rumbling sound and the screams of other colleagues: “Run, run, run!”

The 28-year-old from Lakhimpur Kheri in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state scrambled out of the tunnel.

But six of his friends and neighbours from his village remain trapped, and Mangra cannot stop thinking and praying for them.

“The moment the water came close, it felt like the mountain was crashing and the earth was moving,” Mangra, who goes by one name, told AFP outside the tunnel, cuts and scrapes on his hands and legs.

“Once the deluge of water rushed past me, there was dust and fear left behind.”

The glacier broke away as the power complex was in full operation, leaving dozens of workers at two power plants missing. About three dozen were feared trapped in the U-shaped tunnel.

Late Monday, giant floodlights lit up a tunnel entrance as teams of rescuers carefully searched through the debris with the help of an excavator for signs of life – and human remains.

Hundreds of paramilitary and emergency service workers were also scouring the valley for other survivors.",2021-02-09 08:00:00+00:00,"['glacier', 'away', 'workers', 'village', 'run', 'disaster', 'told', 'water', 'uttarakhand', 'survivors', 'trapped', 'indias', 'debris', 'escape', 'tunnel', 'recount', 'valley']",India,news article,English
1978,FL-2020-000196-NGA,"Nearly 80% of Nigerian farmers affected by floods, drought in 2020  Report - Premium Times",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/agriculture/agric-news/436380-nearly-80-of-nigerian-farmers-affected-by-floods-drought-in-2020-report.html,"About 79 per cent of Nigerian farmers were estimated to have been affected by the ravaging effects of drought and flooding in 2020, a survey conducted in seven states of the country has shown.

The analysis by SBMIntel, an Africa focused research firm, revealed that the harvests of 26.3 per cent of Nigerian farmers were greatly affected by extreme weather conditions.

It said 52.60 per cent were somewhat affected and a fifth (21.1 per cent) were not affected by drought and flooding in the year under review.

The survey, titled: Nigerians just want to eat and published this month, chronicled the major challenges bedevilling Nigerian farmers and food transporters which are capable of impeding national food security.

Survey

Data for the survey were sampled from seven Nigerian states, namely; Nasarawa, Osun, Benue, Oyo, Katsina, Ogun and Lagos.

Of the seven states surveyed, the report noted that the majority of the respondents (farmers) had their farms in the South-west States (73.7 per cent)Lagos (36.8 per cent ), Oyo (21.1 per cent ) and Ogun (15.8 per cent ) .

Meanwhile, 10.5 per cent of the respondents had their farms in Benue and the remaining 15.9 per cent were equally distributed between Nasarawa, Osun and Katsina states respectively.

The farmers surveyed were mostly crop farmers who grew a wide range of staples with fruits, vegetables, cassava and maize farmers in the majority, the report noted.

Scourge

According to the survey, extreme climatic events such as flooding and drought witnessed in some states within the country triggered the negative effects being noticed on the prices of staple foods.

It said flooding in Nigeria was experienced in the north, mostly in states like Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara, and some parts of Kwara.

In fact, in Kebbi alone, 500,000 hectares of farmland were destroyed by flooding, with the cost being upward of N5 billion, the report said.

Also, it stated that the problem that faced farmers in the South-western region was the lack of rainfall experienced during the mid-planting season last year.

Last year, the August break actually began in early July and lasted through till the end of August. This prevented the planting of maize, cassava and cash crops like cocoa, the survey added.

According to the survey, more than half of the farmers engaged had no irrigation system, even when they believed that it will help greatly in their farming endeavours.

It said 57.90 per cent of the respondents said they do not own any irrigation system that could help complement the absence of rainfall when asked if they have, only 42.10 per cent had.

However, about 94.7 per cent of the respondents agreed to a large extent that an irrigation system would help their farming system while 10.5 per cent said it would only help to a small extent and 5.3 per cent said to no extent, it added.

The survey said most farmers are getting discouraged over their inability to own irrigation systems or the technology of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) to support crops during adverse weather conditions.

Recommendations

In order to mitigate the challenges being faced by these farmers and food transporters, the report recommends that both state and federal governments adopt wider irrigation systems and as well facilitate the provision of early maturing and drought-resistant crop varieties.

ADVERTISEMENT

Switching to climate-smart agriculture is the best way to guard against crop failure and poor yields, the survey reads in part.

The report said respondents asked the government to fix access roads and provide adequate transportation that is cheap, effective and efficient.

An efficient rail system will reduce the cost of transporting farm produce to the markets and improve food security. Security remains paramount followed by access to land and irrigation infrastructure, the report quoted the farmers to have said.",2021-01-12 08:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'flooding', 'survey', '2020', 'floods', 'cent', 'states', 'irrigation', 'respondents', 'system', '80', 'nigerian', 'affected', 'nearly', 'report', 'drought']",Nigeria,news article,English

Paul Chapman reports.

The bereaved widower of an Indonesian woman who was allegedly poisoned with cyanide-laced coffee by a friend from her student days in Australia has called for justice to be served, revealing the couple had planned to start a family by the end of the year.

Jessica Kumala Wongso has been accused of the premeditated murder of Wayan Mirna Salihin, with whom she studied at the Billy Blue College of Design in Sydney.

""I want justice to be served in accordance with the law,"" Salihin's husband, Arief Soemarko, said at Wongso's trial at the Central Jakarta District Court.

FACEBOOK The victim, Wayan Mirna Salihin.

Soemarko, who married Salihin in Bali in November last year, said the couple had planned to honeymoon in Korea in April and start a family by the end of this year.

The furore surrounding the death of Salihin on January 6 has played out like a soap opera in Indonesia with febrile speculation over a possible motive for the alleged murder.

TATAN SYUFLANA/FAIRFAX The accused: Jessica Wongso leaves Central Jakarta Court after the first day of her trial.

The scene of her poisoning - Olivier, a restaurant in the glitzy Grand Indonesia shopping mall in central Jakarta - has become an improbable tourist attraction, with a non-toxic version of the Vietnamese iced coffee that killed Salihin a macabrely popular choice.

According to the indictment read in court, Salihin had criticised Wongso's boyfriend in Australia, whom she claimed was rude and a drug user.

""The words of Mirna made the defendant angry and hurt and the defendant decided to cut communication with Mirna,"" the indictment said.

TWITTER The scene of the crime: Jessica Wongso takes part in a police-organised re-enactment at the Olivier Cafe.

It said Wongso subsequently broke up with her boyfriend and had some legal problems in Australia.

A Fairfax Media investigation revealed Wongso was listed to appear before a Sydney magistrate on a high range drink driving charge on February 26 but was already in custody in Indonesia.

""To avenge her anger, the defendant planned to take away Mirna's life,"" the indictment read before the court said.

JEWEL TOPSFIELD/FAIRFAX The husband: ""I want justice,"" says Wyan Mirna Salihin's widower, Arief Soemarko.

It said Wongso, who worked for Ambulance NSW until late last year, re-established contact with Salihin and it was arranged they would meet at Olivier Cafe on January 6 with another friend, Hani.

According to the indictment Wongso arrived early, ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee and two cocktails and added cyanide to the coffee.

""Jessica said: 'This is for you Mir, you said you want Vietnamese Iced Coffee',"" the court heard. ""Then Mirna drank it and said: 'It's not tasty, it's awful', waving her hands in front of her mouth due to the hot flavour it made. Two minutes later Mirna fell unconscious.""

TATAN SYUFLANA/FAIRFAX NZ Jessica Wongso fronts Central Jakarta Court accused of the murder of her friend.

Salihin died on the way to hospital.

Wongso's lawyer, Otto Hasibuan, questioned why Wongso would travel all the way from Australia to Indonesia to kill Salihin just because she was hurt about what her friend had said about her ex-boyfriend.

He also said the indictment did not elaborate on when or how the cyanide was purchased.

But the prosecution insisted in court on Tuesday that it had strong evidence of Wongso's guilt.

Asked what the prosecution had told the court to counter the defence argument that the indictment was absurd, Chief Prosecutor Ardito Muwadi said the important element of premeditated murder was the intention in the defendant's heart and how calm they were in carrying out their plan.

The trial has implications for Australia because the Australian Federal Police (AFP) agreed to assist with investigating the case after the Indonesian government provided written assurance that Wongso would not face the death penalty if found guilty.

Although Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly has confirmed this, Indonesia' chief security minister, Luhut Panjaitan, appeared to equivocate during a trip to Sydney earlier this month, saying: ""Well, I think we leave it to the judge, the court, but I believe we work it out (the) Indonesian way.""

Salihin's father, Dermawan Salihin, said he did not believe the agreement with the AFP should be upheld if Wongso is convicted on the basis of evidence from Indonesia.

""Secondly, Jessica is not Australian, she is just a permanent resident,"" he said.

Salihin said cyanide was readily and cheaply available in Indonesia as pest control for farmers.",2016-06-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['coffee', 'mirna', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', 'planning', 'woman', 'killed', 'jakarta', 'cyanide', 'court', 'indictment', 'wongso', 'start', 'australia', 'jessica', 'family', 'salihin']",India,news article,English
2315,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Flooded lakes make communities landless in Kenya's Rift Valley - Africanews English,https://www.africanews.com/2021/02/08/flooded-lakes-make-communities-landless-in-kenya-s-rift-valley/,"For over a decade, the lakes of Rift Valley have been swelling, swallowing land and villages.

Villages are sinking, schools, places of worship, highways, and farms.

Hundreds of families and thousands of wildlife are under threat as water levels of lakes along the Rift Valley basin continuously increase.

Most vulnerable of all is the El Molo ethnic group, one of the smallest in Kenya, living on islands in Lake Turkana, a lake on the northern side of Rift Valley.

Since Lake Turkana's waters started rising, they have moved to higher grounds, mixing with other communities, explains James Emose, an El Molo community elder.

""Our home in Choro, Namukuse and Longech Islands are now underwater. We don't have a place to stay right now. We were rescued by well-wishers in boats to the shores of Kalokol. Our home is in the middle of the lake,"" he says.

According to a 2019 census, there are only 1,104 El Molo residents.

The region has always been unstable geologically, its name refers to the fracturing of the Earth's crust, where two tectonic plates collide.

But now, deforestation in the highlands has decreased the permeability of the soil and recent heavy rainfall has swamped much of the low-lying land.

Scientists say heavy rains in East Africa made 2019 one of the region's wettest years on record, the water drains into the lakes.

Without the forests, the rain erodes the land, washing tones and tones of silt into lakes.

This clogs the underground drainage fault lines that means water cannot drain out of the lakes, causing water levels to rise dramatically following the 2019 rainfall.

""The Rift Valley lakes have underground drainage which is basically because of normal faults. These normal faults have actually been buried by the siltation. Now when they are buried by the siltation, the permeability is reduced. And that is why you see the high water levels within the lakes,"" explains geologist and government consultant, Bernard Limo.

""One of the communities that has been 'impactly' affected is the El Molo community which has lived within Lake Turkana and has existed there depending on the lake and even the Island around there. Currently the Island has been submerged by water and the community is displaced and we don't know whether this community will be able to survive or cope up with the new ecosystem,"" he says.

Wild animals

Lake Naivasha waters, for instance, have claimed more than one kilometre inland since 2019, according to the Kenyan Ministry of Water and Fisheries.

This animated map shows the increase in water levels at Lake Naivasha Crescent Island between 2001-2021.

Limo is surveying the flooding in Lake Naivasha with local Stephen Kuria.

Lake Naivasha resident Kuria describes how people were caught off guard by rising waters.

""The water was filling in slowly such that nobody thought it was that serious. So, people were not cautious that these waters will one day flood their houses and businesses. So, they were not careful to stow away their wares. So, after one month is when water got into those houses over there and that's when people started demolishing and rebuilding on this upper side,"" he says.

Hippos and other wild animals have invaded the area and can pose a danger to people.

Kuria says locals need help moving away to safer land.

""This water can retract, but future rains might bring it back there and find people and displace them again. So, if they can be compensated and go a little further from the lake. Because now wild animals have invaded the area, there are buffaloes, there are hippopotamus which may attack the people. So even if water will go back, people can be attacked by animals, and even snakes, because snakes have also come and can attack them,"" he says.

""These losses are basically because of the losses in terms of the schools, displacement of human beings, and also loss in terms of capital, that is the construction of buildings within here, and even indirect losses as a result of businesses that have been lost around the lakes."" says Limo.

All that can be seen are submerged homes.

Owners are making do with makeshift tents, hoping nature will have mercy and retract the waters back to their original levels.",2021-02-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['lake', 'lakes', 'el', 'rift', 'kenyas', 'levels', 'naivasha', 'community', 'valley', 'landless', 'water', 'molo', 'waters', 'flooded', 'communities']",Kenya,news article,English
671,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Ghana Chalks Success In Fight Against NTDs - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/ghana-chalks-success-in-fight-against-ntds/,"Ghana has been described as one of the countries in Africa that has successfully eradicated Guinea worm and Trachomaas, which are part of the fight against Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).

Ghana has therefore been certified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) since July 2014, whilst the elimination of Trachoma has been achieved since 2016 with the dossier preparation for verification of elimination ongoing.

Ghana’s Deputy Minister of Health, Mr Kingsley Aboagye-Gyedu who made this known at the on-going global summit on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) when he shared some of the success Ghana has chalked out in the area, said 3.8 million people in Upper West and Northern Regions have been freed from trachoma.

The five-day Summit, marks the fifth anniversary of the London Declaration, a historic document signed by leaders from diverse sectors committed to controlling, eliminating or eradicating 10 tropical NTDs by 2020.

Since the London Declaration, fewer people are suffering from these disabling diseases and many countries are eliminating them entirely.

NTDs are a group of debilitating infectious diseases such as elephantiasis, river blindness and trachoma that affect the world’s poorest communities.

These gains, have made possible by strong global partnerships, country leadership and investments in innovation and technology.

The 2017 summit marks the 5th anniversary of the WHO’s roadmap on NTDs and the London Declaration and to celebrate the milestone: “Uniting to Combat NTDs.”

Representatives of Member States, donor agencies, foundations, the private sector, academia and stakeholders and pharmaceutical companies are participating in the summit.

Mr Aboagye-Gyedu said government would rollout and intensify the deworming exercise of children for at least once a year to protect them from schistosomiasis, which made them vulnerable due to their play habits.

He said morbidity or complications had greatly reduced, high-risk districts changed from 47 down to three, moderate risk districts also changed from 138 to 54 and low risk districts also increased from 31 to 159.

The disease could cause mental debilitation, thus, reducing the child’s ability to learn.

The government he said would be investing in the use of technology to distribute drugs to the regions and communities who would be needing them and “this will be done with just by a press of a button, it will tell what kind of medicine is out of stock at which particular facility”.

The Deputy Minister pledged the commitment of the government in ensuring that the remaining NTDs were tackled with all seriousness to ensure their total elimination.

In an interview with Ghana’s NTDs Programme Manager Dr Nana Kwadwo Birituwm, on the NTD situation in Ghana, he explained that transmission has been broken in 81 out of 98 endemic districts for Lymphatic Filariasis, also known as Elephantiasis

He noted that 12.8 million at-risk population have been freed out of 14.2 million at-risk or endemic population, adding that no new cases of elephantiasis or hydrocoeles have been reported.

Elephantiasis is a worm disease which is usually acquired in childhood and could cause the scrotum and breasts to swell to the size of a watermelon often leading to deformity, social stigma and isolation.

Dr Biritwum said no new cases of onchocerciasis blindness had been recorded for years, no new cases of onchocerciasis skin nodules or onchocerciasis dermatitis or skin changes, whilst transmission was markedly reduced (no hyper (high) or meso (medium) areas of endemicity but all moved to hypo (low endemicity).”

He explained that 85 hyper and meso- endemic districts for onchocerciasis, had moved to make now make 85 hypo endemic districts with an endemic population of about 4million.

“This indicates control to elimination for this disease is ongoing and very soon it would be eliminated from Ghana.”

Flooded roads created violent rapids, sweeping up victims, cars and other debris.

Those evacuated were being housed in makeshift shelters in churches, schools and fire stations. Local authorities have asked for donations of clothes, sheets and mattresses for the victims.

In Minas Gerais, 15,000 people were evacuated and in Espírito Santo nearly 10,000 more, according to local rescue efforts. In Rio, at least 6,000 were evacuated, according to local news media, citing figures from various municipalities. Rio state authorities didn’t immediately respond to a request for official data.

Local authorities warned that the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area, home to nearly 6 million people, could see up to 100 millimeters (4in) of rain in the next three days.

The city had 171 millimeters (6.7in) over one 24-hour period from Thursday to Friday, the highest rainfall in 110 years.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As the state struggles to survive the flood, various non-governmental organisations in the city have stepped in to provide relief to the flood-affected areas. Prominent NGOs and groups in the city such as Prathidhwani, a socio-cultural group of Technopark, Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA), Faith India Welfare Trust, Nemom, and Santhigiri Ashram, Pothencode, have come out with different plans to help people affected by the flood. Some of them have started flood-relief activities in places such as Kochi and Kozhikode.

From the IT hub

The IT hub in the city has also launched a bevy of initiatives to aid the households in areas left devastated by the raging South-West monsoon. The socio-cultural forum of Technopark employees, Prathidhwani, has initiated the ‘ Rice Bucket Challenge 2018’ wherein the employees challenge each other to donate at least 5kgs of rice packets.

“Each person will challenge five other employees. Usually, this is then given to the non-IT employees working in Technopark ahead of Onam. This time the rice packets so collected will be given to people at Kuttanadu,” said Rajeev Krishnan, secretary of the forum. Last year, 6.5 tonnes of rice were collected from Technopark during Onam. “We hope to target around 1,000 households with this. This is in addition to the dress collection initiative we have started for the people at Kuttanad,” he added. “A campaign for Kuttanad flood relief is currently on in Technopark and provisions and other essentials are being collected. Several organisations in Technopark have come together to spearhead the movement,” said Radhika Viswanathan, a member of Prakruthi.

As part of extending a helping hand, the team from Technopark had visited the flood-affected areas. Although the government is providing the people affected by flood in Kuttanad area with food, water and basic necessities, the Technopark team has already given contributions in the form of money in the first phase.

Now in the second phase of the Kuttanad relief initiative, they have already started a cloth collection campaign and have requested to collect old and new clothes for all age groups. The clothes can be handed over to the building coordinators or can be dropped at the designated boxes placed in the buildings.

CloThes and medicinesi

City-based NGO, Faith India Welfare Trust, Nemom, has decided to provide clothes, food and medicines to the affected areas in the coming days. C Ajithkumar, programme co-ordinator of the trust, said that they would tour the places across the affected places within two days and will provide necessary help to them. Faith India, an NGO formed in 2002, had provided help to the affected families of Ockhi cyclone earlier. The Santhigiri Ashram, Pothencode, has sought a report from the ashram branches in the affected districts. The assistance will be given in accordance with the report.

According to Pramod, AGM, Public Relations, they were committed to extending help to all of the affected families and the respective ashram units had been directed to be alert so as to provide the assistance. Other than NGOs, individuals have also come forward to help the flood-affected victims. Kasthurirangan, a Kochi-based philanthropist has informed ‘Express’ that he would donate financial aid to the affected families. He has earlier provided Rs 1 lakh to a family of Poonthura which left orphaned after the sole breadwinner died in the deep sea in Ockhi cyclone. “ I am deeply concerned of the present situation. As a philanthropist, I have to help the affected people”, he said.

Foot soldiers of Sancharii

The members of the travel forum Sanchari are acting as foot soldiers at Ground Zero. As many as ten members of the travel group are assisting the one of the medical camps currently underway at Alappuzha. “Though there were more volunteers, some had to be sent back owing to the ever-worsening climatic conditions,” said Salim Velikkad, panel admin, Sanchari. The travel enthusiasts have joined a floating medical camp at Alappuzha.

The volunteering mission undertaken by Sanchari is in association with NRHM Alappuzha. The Palakkad unit of Sanchari had provided food and provisions last week. The Sanchari team has rented out a boat and equipped with doctors and nurse, the team is traversing the flood-hit areas administering their services. “On enquiring with the district administration, we were informed that help in medical camps and rehabilitation works was required urgently. And that is how we joined in the medical camp. Once the rehabilitation works begin, more members will be volunteering,” Salim added.

Donations from NGOs

Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA) has donated Rs 23, 97,185 to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund on Thursday for the affected people following heavy rain, flood and landslides in five districts. The fund was raised by collecting the contribution from all the school teachers of government and aided schools in the state. Apart from this, the association has also given clothes, food and medicine to Kottayam, Alappuzha, Wayanad, Malappuram and Idukki.

According to KC Harikrishnan, general secretary, KSTA, the relief measures are being extended to the victims in the affected districts.“The relief activities are still on. Medicines, clothes and food are being provided to the respective units in the districts so as to reach it out to the people very soon. More assistance will be given to the families in the coming days”, said Harikrishnan.

Sevabharathi sends medical teami

Sevabharathi, an NGO based in Thiruvananthapuram and Attukal Hospital, is on a mission to ensure relief at flood-affected areas. The team include six doctors and 15 paramedics. Dr Ranjith Hari, district president, Sevabharati, said, “We are going to the flood-affected areas with a team of six doctors and15 paramedics. We are also taking loads of medicines”.

He adds: “The team comprising three doctors from Sevabharati and three doctors from Attukal Hospital are on their way.” The team plans to put up medical camps across the flood-affected areas.

607,Drought Sri Lanka,Adaptation Finance Update: Most Vulnerable Nations Are Among Least Likely Recipients | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD - IISD Reporting Services,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/adaptation-finance-update-most-vulnerable-nations-are-among-least-likely-recipients/,"5 May 2019: The Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in April highlighted the socioeconomic impacts and costs of climate change in the region, including the debt burden arising from disaster recovery. Several publications emphasized that Pacific island nations are seen as facing particularly high risks, and highlighted adaptation and policy challenges.

Multilateral and bilateral adaptation finance activities, including for projects seeking to enhance climate resilience and targeting vulnerable communities in other regions, were also announced over the last month. Yet a study released in April by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) shows that the most vulnerable nations are the least likely to be selected as finance recipients by both bilateral and multilateral donors. This Update discusses these developments and challenges to achieving the goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Adaptation Fund Supports Climate Vulnerable Communities in Bangladesh

Climate change remains the major challenge faced by many economies. Bangladesh is one of the highly-exposed countries in Asia, threatened by impacts of both slow- and rapid-onset climate-driven disasters, including sea level rise, saline intrusion, cyclones, storm surges, floods, extreme heat and droughts. The Adaptation Fund approved USD 10 million in support of a five-year project in Bangladesh titled, ‘Adaptation Initiative for Climate Vulnerable Offshore Small Island and Riverine Charland in Bangladesh.’ Jointly implemented by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the project supports the country’s national priorities set out in the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan and its Nationally Determined Contributions.

A total of USD 32.5 million was approved by the Fund’s Board in March in Bonn for new projects in Armenia, the Dominican Republic, Bangladesh and Western Balkans to serve Paris Agreement implementation. Read the SDG Knowledge Hub adaptation finance update on the Adaptation Fund Board March meeting here.

ADB Promotes Adaptation Finance in the Asia-Pacific Region

ADB’s Board of Governors addressed the socioeconomic impacts and costs of climate change in the region during its annual meeting, held in Nadi, Fiji, from 1-5 May, where ADB agreed to provide a USD 2 million grant for the Nadi Flood Alleviation Project. Meeting participants examined challenges in the area of disaster recovery, high-cost structures, social service delivery, gender and labor. These were assessed in ADB’s Pacific Economic Monitor, which highlights that Pacific island nations are among the most risk-exposed nations globally, and provides the near-term economic outlook for the Pacific and specific policy challenges, as presented in the Asian Development Outlook 2019. On disaster recovery, the reports note that a significantly higher debt burden than expected was observed, demonstrating the heavy cost of necessary infrastructure reconstruction, rehabilitation and upgrading when grant funds are limited.

The meeting revealed ADB’s standing, showing that the Bank’s lending and grant operations in 2018 grew to a record USD 21.6 billion, compared to USD 13.9 billion in 2013, an increase of 55%. ADB’s report titled, ‘2018 Development Effectiveness Review’ (DEfR), assesses the Bank’s performance and progress in implementing its strategy. The DEfR demonstrates that ADB’s response to climate change and support for gender equality accelerated. The share of ADB operations supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation during the 2016-2018 review period reached 56%, surpassing the 2020 target of 45%. The share of committed sovereign operations supporting gender mainstreaming increased to 52%, exceeding the 2020 target of 50% of overall ADB operations. Achievement of gender equality results also remained above target, with 76% of completed operations successfully delivering their intended results in this priority area.

In spite of targeting groups vulnerable to climate change, multilateral donors do not prioritize the most vulnerable within those groups.

Speaking about implementation of ADB’s Strategy 2030, ADB President Takehiko Nakao said priority will be given to: reducing poverty and inequalities; climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts across the Pacific; accelerating progress in gender equality; as well as support for regional cooperation and integration, and expanding the Bank’s activities in education, health and agribusiness.

Among other activities in April, the ADB:

New and Ongoing Adaptation Support for Farming and Forest Communities in Sri Lanka, El Salvador and Paraguay

In April, the World Bank announced its support of USD 150 million to Sri Lanka for projects aiming to improve the climate resilience and agricultural productivity of small-scale farmers, and support priority infrastructure through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The two supported projects include: a USD 140 ‘Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project’ in the dry zone of the country, including a USD 125 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA), with a USD 10 million contribution from the Government of Sri Lanka and a USD 5 million contribution from the project beneficiaries; and a ‘Framework Development and Infrastructure Financing to Support Public-Private Partnerships Project,’ supported with a USD 25 million loan to mobilize and sustain development investments. The loan has a 20-year maturity, including a nine-year grace period. The project receives USD 2 million counterpart funding.

The Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) signed the funding agreement for the five-year USD 127.7 million ‘RECLIMA Project,’ aimed at building climate resilience in farming systems in El Salvador’s Dry Corridor. The FAO-designed projects aims to strengthen resilience of smallholder farmers by promoting the use of seeds tolerant to drought. It will benefit from USD 35.8 million in funding support, originally approved by the GCF in October 2018. In addition to the GCF grant, the project will receive USD 91.8 million from the Government of El Salvador and the Initiative for the Americas Fund (FIAES).

In Paraguay, vulnerable families, including from indigenous communities, depend on forests for their livelihoods, energy and income. They actively safeguard Paraguay’s forests, and support the government’s efforts in this regard. The GCF and FAO signed the funding agreement for a five-year USD 90 million project titled, ‘Poverty, Reforestation, Energy and Climate Change’ (PROEZA), which will be supported with a USD 25 million grant from the GCF. The Government of Paraguay, which co-finances the project with USD 65 million, will work together with the GCF and FAO to build the climate resilience of local populations through investments for low-emission development. The GCF approved the project in March 2018.

SEI Study: Most Climate Vulnerable Countries Are Unable to Access Finance Proportionate to Level of Need

A study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) titled, ‘Climate Change Adaptation Finance: Are the Most Vulnerable Nations Prioritized?’ warns that “the allocation of adaptation finance is not consistently aligned with the sentiment of the Paris Agreement.” The findings demonstrate that:

The most vulnerable nations are the least likely to be selected as finance recipients by both bilateral and multilateral donors;

Multilateral donors are found to allocate more adaptation finance to SIDS, yet they are not observed to prioritize vulnerable nations in the selection stage;

Multilateral donors are less orientated towards recipient need than their bilateral counterparts; and

Countries that are most vulnerable to climate change receive smaller allocations of adaptation finance from bilateral donors than their less vulnerable counterparts.

The paper finds that bilateral donors allocate more adaptation finance to recipients with: a higher level of need, determined by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita; more strategic importance, for example with whom they share a larger amount of bilateral trade; and higher levels of good governance, where aid is presumed to be more effective. Multilateral donors, the authors note, prioritize well-governed nations. In spite of targeting groups vulnerable to climate change, multilateral donors do not prioritize the most vulnerable within those groups. The study concludes that there are barriers that limit the ability of the most climate vulnerable countries to access a share of adaptation finance proportionate to their level of need.

By Sophie Hares

TEPIC, Mexico, Sept 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Severe flooding on the Amazon has increased amid changing weather patterns, and is harming the health and incomes of people living along the world's biggest river, scientists said.

Analysing more than 100 years of records measuring Amazon River levels in the port of Manaus in Brazil, they found extreme floods that occurred roughly once every 20 years in the first part of last century are now happening about every four years.

""There are catastrophic effects on the lives of the people as the drinking water gets flooded, and the houses get completely destroyed,"" said Jonathan Barichivich, environmental scientist at the Universidad Austral de Chile.

""Our findings unravel the ultimate causes of the recent intensification - wet season getting wetter, and dry season getting drier - of the water cycle of the largest hydrological basin of the planet,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Droughts have also become more frequent in the past two to three decades, but the rise in flooding stood out, he noted.

In a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers from institutions including Britain's University of Leeds said severe flooding had affected the Amazon basin nearly every year from 2009 to 2015.

They linked the increase in flooding to a combination of warmer temperatures over the Atlantic Ocean and cooler temperatures over the Pacific.

Known as the Walker circulation, this effect influences tropical weather patterns, and can partly be attributed to shifts in wind belts caused by global warming, the study said.

With temperatures in the Atlantic expected to rise more than in the Pacific, flood risks on the Amazon River will persist, the scientists predicted.

""We think that it's going to continue for at least a decade,"" said Barichivich, formerly a University of Leeds research fellow.

The paper also noted that deforestation and construction of hydro-power plants could play a role in water-level changes.

Besides disrupting cattle ranching and agriculture on the river's flood plains, heavy flooding has health consequences for communities in Brazil, Peru and other Amazon nations, as it contaminates water and helps spread disease, said the study.

Monitoring changes in river levels is important because the Amazon basin and its tropical rainforest play a major role in the world's hydrological and carbon systems, said Barichivich.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The El Niño drought emergency underscored the humanitarian crisis in Mozambique. Following two consecutive years of failed rains, particularly in the southern provinces of the country, the food security and nutritional situation in the country went from 1.5 million food insecure people in March 2016 to 2.1 million in November 2016, according to the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition’s (SETSAN) assessments. Of the 2.1 million people facing food insecurity and nutrition crisis, SETSAN estimated that about 1.2 million required humanitarian assistance up to March 2017, as this figure was the basis for the revision of the Humanitarian Country Team’s (HCT) strategic response plan (SRP).

Following the May 2017 assessment, this figure has been revised downwards to 350,000. In addition, the revised SRP included a contingency for 190,000 persons likely to be affected by floods and cyclone.

The Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN) published the latest food security and nutrition assessment conducted in March and April 2017 (SMART surveys in three districts and Rapid Assessments using MUAC in 17 districts). Integrated Phase Classification for Acute Malnutrition (IPC-AM) was conducted in 20 districts in May 2017.

The results of the IPC-AM analysis classified two districts (Chiure and Namuno) in a critical situation (Phase 4); three districts (Mutarara, Ancuabe and Macossa) are in alert/serious (Phase 2/3); one district (Morrumbala) as alert (Phase 2); with the southern districts as acceptable (Phase 1). (Figure 1). While assessed, no statistically significant variation in malnutrition cases was found between girls and boys.

The IPC-AN analysis projection for the period from May to September 2017 considers that the situation is likely to improve with some districts, improving from critical to alert/serious situation to acceptable. There may be no phase changes in Ancuabe, Namuno and Mutarara (figure 2) as the underlying causes are less well understood.

The projected improvement of the nutrition situation, based on the IPC analysis is likely due to an improvement of food availability and access (including self-sufficient production), decrease in food prices (cereals) and decrease of childhood illness (diarrhoea, malaria). In contrast, the forecast for the lean season (October – February) the situation may deteriorate in two additional districts (Cahora Bassa, Mopeia). These trends are consistent with the number of children with acute malnutrition detected during outreach sessions.

In February 2017, Cyclone Dineo struck Inhambane and affected 600,000 people which increased the urgency and need for critical Food Security, Nutrition, WASH, Education,

Health and Protection interventions. The humanitarian landscape for the 2016/2017 emergency season in Mozambique was both complex in its diversity of events (drought, floods, cyclone, cholera, IDPs, conflict) and in terms of humanitarian needs. The humanitarian situation resulted in changes in the humanitarian architecture to provide increased coordination among partners and efficiency in the implementation and delivery of humanitarian action. The role of UNICEF as cluster lead has been prominent both in chairing the inter-agency cluster coordination group (ICCG) and as a member of the HCT core group. In this capacity, UNICEF has been a voice for stronger coordination and pro-active engagement of all partners’ contributions and views.",2017-06-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['security', 'mozambique', 'children', 'humanitarian', 'districts', 'unicef', 'report', 'food', 'situation', 'nutrition', 'phase', '2017']",Mozambique,news article,English
2325,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Rising Waters on Kenya's Great Rift Valley Lakes - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147226/rising-waters-on-kenyas-great-rift-valley-lakes,"After months of unusually heavy rain, thousands of people in Kenyaâ??s Great Rift Valley have evacuated due to intense flooding. Rising waters have inundated homes, businesses, farms, and even entire islands. The torrential rains have also caused two important lakes to swell, creating several issues for local wildlife and businesses.

The natural-color images above show water levels on the south end of Lake Baringo on May 30, 2013 (left) and May 1, 2020 (right). The images below show flooding on the north end of Lake Bogoria, located less than 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of Lake Baringo. The images were acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8. Waters shaded brown and tan have heavy loads of suspended sediment.

The water levels of both lakes have been rising in recent years, but they have been particularly high in 2020. The senior warden for the Kenya Wildlife Service told Reuters that the area of Lake Baringo has expanded by 60 percent in the past seven years; it now covers 270 square kilometers (105 square miles). Lake Bogoria has swollen by 25 percent, now covering 43 square kilometers (17 square miles).

Both lakes play significant roles in sustaining local citizens, attracting tourists, and providing a home for many wildlife species. Lake Baringo provides irrigation and drinking water and is also home to Nile crocodiles. Rising waters at the lake have damaged businesses, schools, homes, and hotels, while bringing crocodiles and hippos dangerously close to people. Lake Bogoria is a World Heritage site and home to hundreds of bird species, including as many as one million flamingos at times. It also contains several geysers and hot springs that are popular with tourists; nearly 80 percent of these hot springs are now underwater.

Officials are particularly concerned that the freshwater Lake Baringo and alkaline Lake Bogoria could merge soon, which would cause cross-contamination and threaten wildlife even more. The two lakes were once 20 kilometers (13 miles) apart, but now sit 13 kilometers (8 miles) from one another. Neither lake has an outlet to allow excess water to flow out.

Editorâ??s note: Due to the persistent rain and the frequent midday cloudiness of nations around the equator, the images from May 2020 are the most recent clear views of the flooded areas acquired by Landsat satellites.

1436,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Are sandbags effective? A look at the popular flood-prevention tool - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/are-sandbags-effective-a-look-at-the-popular-flood-prevention-tool-1.4401429,"For centuries, residents of flood-prone areas have looked to sandbags to stave off rising waters. Flood management experts say that while it's easy to understand why sandbags have become the first line of defence, they may not necessarily be the best one. Here's a look at sandbags and their effectiveness:

DO SANDBAGS WORK AS FLOOD-PREVENTION TOOLS?

It depends entirely on the type of flood. Tamsin Lyle, principle engineer at British Columbia-based flood management company Ebbwater Consulting, said sandbags can be very effective in situations where they won't have prolonged exposure to water. Examples she cited include flash floods or holding off ocean waves that only reach impacted areas at high tide. But Lyle said sandbags lose much of their value once they become saturated with water, making them relatively ineffective in prolonged floods such as those currently unfolding in much of eastern Canada.

WHY ARE SANDBAGS SO POPULAR?

Lyle said the primary benefits of sandbags lie in their low cost and ease of use. Nearly anyone armed with a shovel and the right materials can construct a temporary flood barrier for next to nothing, she said, adding that pre-filled sandbags can also be stockpiled at home with relative ease. According to the Water Security Agency of Saskatchewan, optimal materials include burlap or plastic sacs filled with relatively heavy rather than gravelly soil. These factors, Lyle said, confer other ""intangible benefits"" that contribute to the sandbag's popularity. ""It makes people feel like they're doing something,"" Lyle said of filling and deploying the barriers. ""It brings communities together. You feel like you're fighting the flood.""

WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES?

In addition to their lack of durability in longer-term flood conditions, Lyle said sandbags can easily spring leaks if not assembled or deployed properly. James Blatz, a University of Manitoba civil engineering professor who studied the effectiveness of sandbags, said their drawbacks become even more evident once floodwaters have receded. The bags are generally made of materials that are not resistant to UV rays, ensuring they degrade quickly. Once sand contaminated by dirty floodwaters are added to the mix, Blatz said the result is a single-use product that quickly makes its way to the landfill. He recognizes, however, that these disadvantages won't carry much weight for people in the midst of a flooding crisis. ""When there's a flood happening, you don't have time to sit and chat with the academics,"" he said. ""You put whatever you can in front of the water and do your best.""

WHAT CAN MAKE SANDBAGS MORE EFFECTIVE?

The federal government's guide to reducing flood damage contains numerous tips for effective sandbag deployment. It suggests digging a trench to support the sandbag dike, as well as covering it with some form of plastic sheeting to further limit its permeability. Saskatchewan's Water Security Agency and other municipal sites urge users not to fill homemade sandbags up beyond the halfway point and to ensure they overlap one another as the dike is built. Blatz echoed that advice and stressed the importance of tamping bags down with one's feet to further compact the sand inside.

ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES TO SANDBAGS THAT MIGHT WORK BETTER?

Yes, there are several, though they can't be deployed for the same low cost as sandbags. Lyle said an increasingly popular option is a sort of large rubber tube known as an aquadam that fills up with floodwater and creates a barrier in the process. Another option gaining popularity in Europe, she said, involves sets of interlocking blocks that can be stored in off-seasons and assembled between pillars installed outside a home. Lyle said both tools outperform sandbags, adding they also have the advantage of being reusable. But she said a crucial part of flood prevention involves governments and municipal planners being more proactive in ensuring communities are ready to react if floodwaters rise.",2019-04-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['tool', 'popular', 'water', 'work', 'wont', 'effective', 'look', 'sandbags', 'materials', 'flood', 'floodprevention', 'blatz', 'floodwaters', 'lyle', 'security']",Canada,news article,English
515,DR-2021-000054-SOM,New UK aid focused on early action and helping front-line responders anticipate - Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre,https://climatecentre.org/news/1402/new-uk-aid-focused-on-early-action-and-helping-front-line-responders-anticipate-and-respond,"New UK aid focused on early action and helping front-line responders anticipate

The UK government Tuesday took the opportunity of a high-level dialogue of the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership (REAP) to announce US$ 17 million for developing countries to better prepare for and respond to disasters, including those linked to climate change.



The funds will go to Start Network agencies, while just over US$ 11 million more will support the Centre for Disaster Protection to help “climate-vulnerable countries deal with crises such as extreme weather caused by climate change and pandemics,” a UK press release said – all part of a package worth nearly $US 70 million announced earlier this year.



“As climate-related disasters increase in ferocity and frequency, we must take action to better prepare for and prevent them, to save lives, protect livelihoods and reduce suffering,” the British International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP 26 Presidency, Anne-Marie Trevelyan told the REAP session.



“The commitment and ambition demonstrated today, including the UK’s partnership with the Start Fund, is vital for reaching REAP’s goal of making 1 billion people safer from disasters by 2025.” She added [original emphasis]: “We must make risk-informed early action the default.”



Hubs



Selwin Hart, the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Action and Assistant Secretary General for the Climate Action Team, said: “We are in a race against time, a race to save livelihoods, a race we cannot afford to lose.



“Let us not wait until it is too late – the time to act is now,” he told the REAP session, which also included the IFRC’s Pascale Meige, its Director, Disasters Climate and Crises, and which was coordinated by the Wilton Park centre.



“Whether through new investments, sharing good practice, or placing early action at the heart of plans and policies, we need to work together ahead of COP26 to build a safer, more resilient world,” COP 26 President-Designate Alok Sharma said.



The new UK funding will support early action from improved forecasting for heatwaves in Pakistan to drought in Madagascar, as well as a new global network of hubs facilitating locally led responses, the government added.



The announcement follows the G7 foreign and development minsters meetings last week, where G7 countries committed support to early warning, better preparedness and early action, as well as scaling up finance for adaptation.

‘We must make risk-informed early action the default’

The UK has also announced a package of technical assistance by sharing British expertise on social protection and, through REAP, supporting countries vulnerable to climate impacts to implement “laws, policies and procedures” against future risk, and working with the UK-established Adaptation Research Alliance to fill gaps in evidence for early action.



Ms Trevelyan noted that the UK already contributed to the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund, including forecast-based action, and was “working with the British Red Cross to increase access to forecast-based finance, supporting early action in Southern Africa and the Sahel.”



As one of the largest donors to the UN’s CERF, the UK also supported its allocation of up to US$ 140 million for anticipatory action for food insecurity in Ethiopia and Somalia, and flooding in Bangladesh.



In terms of specific REAP targets, the UK would fund work with a priority group of vulnerable countries, “to review and integrate climate and disaster laws, policies and procedures” and strengthen shock-responsive social protection.

In Kenya, floods have displaced over 260,000 people and killed 100 others in at least 15 of the countryâ??s 47 counties, according to the United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. The floods, which have also affected refugees in northeastern Kenyaâ??s Dadaab camp, have damaged businesses, swept away homes and food supplies, closed more than 200 schools, destroyed community water points, and increased chances of disease outbreaks including cholera and malaria. The situation was so dire Facebook activated a safety feature this week asking users to indicate if they were safe.

In Somalia, 500,000 people were affected by the floods, prompting the government to ask for international assistance, and pushing African Union peacekeepers to relocate hundreds of people to safer grounds.

The flooding comes as many countries are just recovering from the devastating drought and famine that swept the Horn and East Africa region in the last two years. The drought, exacerbated by El Nino, curtailed crop production in Kenya, drove food prices higher, increased inflation, and put a strain on economic growth. It also forced over 1.3 million Somalis to leave their homes last year, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.

The current torrents show the poor planning and the lack of disaster preparedness among governments in the region. As such, countries experience a vicious cycle that alternates between droughts and floods, reacting to events instead of being proactive about attaining solutions.

In the aftermath of rains, for instance, roads are deemed impassable, drainage systems clog, transport networks break down, and rivers burst their banks blocking any humanitarian efforts. Both climatic conditions also exacerbate hunger and poverty, especially among pastoralists, who lose their herds for lack of water during dry periods and are swept away when it pours.

Africa is extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change compared to other continents. Even while emitting a small number of greenhouse gases, the continent is experiencing droughts, heatwaves, floods, and rising sea levels more frequently. To manage this challenge would require countries to invest in strategic approaches that would understand shortcomings, collaborate with research institutions to better understand climate phenomena, and create models that that would help prepare for and reduce the effects of disasters.

2015-10-07

Madagascar is world famous. Mention the island, the planet’s fourth largest, and most people think of its astonishing biodiversity, its lemurs, or – especially – the eponymous animated films.

Few know anything about Madagascar’s droughts, its floods, its chronically malnourished population or its defunct health system. Few know that Madagascar is one of the least developed countries in the world, or that its humanitarian situation is one of the most severe.

This is hardly unusual. Poverty fatigue is real, and it can be hard to interest anyone outside the development community in the fates of poor African countries.

But even on this scale, Madagascar is an outlier. Even within the development community, Madagascar continues to be neglected.

In late September at a hotel in the capital, Antananarivo, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) gathered foreign journalists to discuss this problem. Their contention is that Madagascar is a ‘donor orphan’: a country that should be getting lots of development assistance, but isn’t. This is a source of frustration to many aid workers in Madagascar, who confide – off the record – that their head offices don’t always get it.

Madagascar is neglected by the development community

The scale of Madagascar’s humanitarian crisis is dramatic. According to UNICEF, the country’s 23 million inhabitants have the worst access to water and sanitation in the world. Nearly half of the rural population practise open defecation. Neonatal and maternal mortality rates are rising. It has the fourth worst chronic malnutrition situation in the world.

One in four children don’t go to school, with only a third of those who do completing primary. A harsh climate brings regular emergencies: there were devastating floods in one part of the country earlier this year, and an even more devastating ongoing drought in another, and the country is buffeted by regular cyclones (it is the fifth most cyclone-prone country in the world).

A near bankrupt central government means that there is little government response to these humanitarian issues. Despite this, international aid to Madagascar has actually decreased over the past few years, and shows no signs of picking up again. Several theories may explain this apparent neglect.

The first, and most compelling, is that its geographical location – as an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean – means it has little geostrategic interest for most donor countries. Madagascar is not on the fault lines of any major conflict; it is not an intersection on a major trade route; it is not home to vast reserves of oil. Moreover, the ocean prevents Malagasy problems from spilling over into neighbouring countries, because there are no neighbouring countries. The ocean insulates Madagascar from the rest of the world.

Madagascar is a 'donor orphan' - a country that should be getting lots of assistance, but isn't

The second is that Madagascar, again because of its unusual position and history, falls into too many different regional organisations. These include the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union, the International Organisation of la Francophonie, and the Indian Ocean Commission. All of these take some, but not full responsibility for Madagascar – and often have different, and not necessarily complementary, approaches to dealing with the country.

Another theory is that the nature of Madagascar’s crisis does not lend itself to donor intervention. It is easier to justify funding in conflict situations, or in highly visible disasters like earthquakes or tsunamis, or for high-profile epidemics like Ebola or HIV/Aids. Madagascar’s problems tend to be less ‘sexy’.

Chronic malnutrition, which affects 47% of Malagasy children under five years old, is a largely invisible crisis, because the damage it inflicts is mostly inside the brain. This does not lend itself to heart-wrenching photographs. It is notable, in this context, that the highest-profile international engagement with Madagascar, the SADC mediation efforts, was designed to address the political crisis sparked by the 2009 coup – not the country’s ongoing humanitarian crisis.

David Zounmenou, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Security Studies, points to another factor. ‘Geography or even linguistics might have something to do with the apparent neglect of humanitarian issues in Madagascar. However, we can add that, again, the country is a victim of “post-crisis neglect syndrome,” where international attention declines once there is an election to restore a semblance of normalcy in conflicts areas.’

Elections in 2013 ostensibly closed the chapter on four years of political crisis sparked by a coup in 2009, although new President Hery Rajaonarimampianina has done little to solve the humanitarian crisis. Many donors were also scared away by the crisis itself, or defeated by the sanctions imposed on Madagascar in the wake of the coup.

Madagascar’s status as ‘donor orphan’ also raises a more general question: how do donors differentiate between the various crisis-stricken countries competing for their attention? What goes into the value judgments that are made to determine who gets money and attention, and who doesn’t?

Violence is usually more newsworthy than slow-moving humanitarian disasters

Clues can be gleaned from another profession which makes similar judgments, often about the exact same situations: journalism. Various crises compete for attention on the front page, and foreign correspondents must work hard to convince their editors to set aside resources for travel. David Smith, Africa correspondent for The Guardian, told ISS Today that a combination of factors decides what he covers, and what he doesn’t.

Needless to say, Madagascar doesn’t often make the cut. The Guardian caters primarily for a British audience, and historical ties play an important role in content decisions. Zimbabwe, for instance, gets plenty of attention. Cost is important, so trips to out-of-the-way places like Madagascar are usually expensive to justify. The nature of the crisis also plays a role: like it or not, violence is usually more newsworthy than slow-moving humanitarian disasters.

In other words: not all crises are created equal. And, most importantly, the amount of attention a crisis receives is not merely a function of its severity. This has major implications for journalists, researchers and development professionals. It’s clear that headlines are not a reliable guide to the significance of either political or humanitarian crises, and nor is donor attention. To understand our world better – to distribute scarce attention and resources more equally – we need to look beyond these metrics.

Until then, the likes of the humanitarian crisis in Madagascar will continue to fly under the radar, with millions of people affected by its neglect.

Ibadan is the third most populous city in NigeriaAfricas largest country in terms of population and economy. This city of six million also happens to be the countrys largest in terms of geographic area, but like many other cities, urbanization is largely uncontrolled, and people are exposed to disasters like floods.

We had the opportunity to experience Nigerias creativity and innovation in Lagos city, when the World Bank partnered with Co-Creation Hub and other players to organize a hackathon that focused on leveraging data and technology to improve accountability and service delivery in governance. People, including data and software engineers, professional and academic experts, and civil servants, came together to develop solutions for improved policy, governance and development impact.

The Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project (IUFMP) set up to tackle the citys urban resilience challengessubmitted datasets for the hackathon, and one of the teams that worked on the data from the project emerged as winner in February, 2020. Teams developed a geospatial visualization platform to overlay and view the datasets from the geodatabases created as part of the Ibadan city, and flood and drainage masterplans preparation, demonstrating how the government and other stakeholders can use insights from geospatial data to accelerate effective decision making in urban planning, flood risk and environmental management. With this open data, the state government can now use up-to-the-minute information to identify, manage, prevent, and prepare for flood risks, and other ensuing impacts from floods.

Building on this with support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and with the collaboration of technical initiatives from experts in Ibadan and around Oyo state, the project scaled up the use of data for flood risk management and developed an advanced geospatial visualization platform that empowers the government to seamlessly apply geospatial data in daily operations.

This innovation strengthens the capacity of the Oyo state government to manage flood risk and inform decision making in other sectors in Ibadan using data, coupled with previous capacity building efforts, gigabytes of geospatial data available and GIS innovation laboratories have been setup under the project. The labs established at the department of Urban Renewal Enforcement Monitoring and Compliance and Office of the Surveyor General under the Oyo State Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. The Project Implementation Unit has been equipped with computers, servers, printers, plotters and software needed to apply these datasets in decision making. These datasets, which are publicly available via an advanced geospatial visualization platform, now strategically inform technical decision making and engagements. This enhances urban resilience and disaster risk management, aligning strongly with the Oyo State Governments E-governance Program and leveraging internet connectivity infrastructure provided by the government in locations where the labs are present to facilitate data exchange.

From the people to policystudents sparking innovation

In August, the University of Ibadan and the project signed a formal memorandum of understanding, to foster capacity development, knowledge exchange and promote long-term project sustainability through collaborative research, data information exchange, internship programs for students, short courses and training programs for government staff and other professionals, and all-round collaborations that bridge the academic-policy-industry gap through open data and innovation.

With the rising thirst for innovative responses to managing flood risks in Ibadan, the University of Ibadan, in collaboration with the project, GIS Konsult Limited and other partners hosted the second season of the Ibadan Geo-Hackathon completed in November with the theme, Ibadan Urban Resilience, leveraging the advanced geospatial visualization platform and geodatabases to deliver solutions focusing on three thematic areas: risk-informed decision making, urban resilient design, and innovative technology solutions for urban resilience. The winning submissions for the respective categories include: Smart Citi, a web-based application for automated flood-risk assessment and waste management,, and Flood Health Risk Mapper an industrial research innovation, and Fire Incidents - A Reoccurring Menace, a story on disaster resilience. The city of Ibadan has now developed two comprehensive masterplans: A Flood Risk Management and Drainage Masterplan and a City Masterplan. Both documents create a vision for resilient and sustainable urban development in the face of climate change, identifying opportunities to boost inclusive economic development, and identify and prioritize the structures most at risk of failing (bridges, culverts, drainages, dam, etc.) to strengthen the government's capacity to detect and respond more effectively to floods, and build resilience long-term. The amount of data, maps and information generated by these master plans is vast. They include spatial datasets, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) topography, high resolution aerial imagery, and outputs of urban analytics, hydrological and hydraulic modelling. By making this information accessible to the public, it becomes useful for many stakeholders, and will inform individuals, private sector, and government decision making to better manage risks and improve urban development.

Open data for innovation and entrepreneurship in development

Entrepreneurship is on the riseand so is innovation and collaboration for the benefit of all. With data open and publicly accessible, businesses, academia and university students alike can utilize information for research and development. This innovation helps civil servants in their work as they tactically tackle disaster and urban development challenges.

Kasese Diocese Bishop Francis Kibara is leading the relief effort, said Don Grossnickle, a deacon at Our Lady of Wayside Parish and head of Microfinance Alliance Africa Projects Foundation, a 501(c) (3) not-for-profit group.

""Donors have provided $4,000 direct to him for food for 2,400 persons at six camps of homeless,"" Grossnickle said, adding that about 100,000 people in the area have been affected by the flooding.

""I spoke to the bishop and he and the people convey thanks. It feels really good to support these hurting people.""

The charity was formed in 2018 to fund anti-malarial clinical work in six mission church projects throughout Uganda. The only medical clinic in the area was washed away by the floods, Grossnickle said.

Funds are being used to buy beans, water, charcoal and bed nets to ward off swarms of mosquitoes. Priority is given to mothers, babies, pregnant women and the sick, he said.

105,DR-2015-000134-SOM,"As El Niño gets stronger Australia gets hotter, drier and more ready to burn - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/08/as-el-nino-gets-stronger-australia-gets-hotter-drier-and-more-ready-to-burn,"El Niño conditions are set to intensify across much of Australia, with extremely dry conditions expected to heighten the risk of drought and bushfires, the Bureau of Meteorology has said.



The bureau has updated its outlook for the rest of the year after Australia experienced its third driest September on record, with large parts of Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania getting very little rain.

The chance of a drier than normal October for southern Australia is about 70%, with the probability rising to 80% in Victoria where the state government is attempting to find ways to get water to parched areas in the west of the state.

El Niño is a periodic climatic event in which waters of the eastern Pacific warm, triggering a slew of weather changes around the world. In Australia it is associated with reduced rainfall and warmer temperatures.

The current El Niño, which will last throughout the summer, is considered one of the top four on record in terms of strength. It has been balanced by another trend, the Indian Ocean dipole, in which warmer waters off Indonesia help bring moisture, and therefore rain, to Australia.

But the bureau said this had changed in the past eight weeks, with waters in the eastern Indian Ocean now 1C cooler than normal. The warmer waters are now found off Africa, bringing rain to countries such as Somalia.

“We’ve had these two systems competing against each other, but now the El Niño is being reinforced – the wetter influence is being overrun by the drying influence of El Niño,” said Andrew Watkins, climate predictions manager at the bureau.

“This means that the odds of a dry October are very strong, at a time that is very important for agriculture and also bushfires. We have already seen fires in Victoria, which don’t normally happen until summer, so that’s not a good sign.”

Hundreds of bushfires have broken out in Victoria over the past week. Two homes, two sheds and two vehicles were confirmed destroyed on Wednesday from a 4,000-hectare blaze near the town of Lancefield. The fire started from a planned burn-off, prompting an independent inquiry.

Melbourne had its warmest early October day on Tuesday, with temperatures reaching 35C. Sydney and Adelaide have also experienced a string of days over 30C before cooler conditions moved in.

The bushfire and natural hazards cooperative research centre has forecast a greater than normal risk of bushfires across much of south-east Australia this year, with climate change making fire seasons longer.

“While summer is usually the time associated with the highest bushfire risk in the southern states across Australia, bushfire seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer,” said Richard Thornton, the centre’s chief executive.

“We know from research on recent large fires that many people living in high-risk bushfire areas are still under-prepared and ill-informed on the dangers and the preparations needed.”

The bureau said waters in the eastern Indian Ocean should start to warm again in November, bringing a slightly better chance of rain in Australia in November and December.

“Our model suggests there will be more even odds in terms of dry conditions in November,” said Watkins. “But given the strength of El Niño, it would be difficult to bet on a wet end to the year. There will be average rainfall at best.”",2015-10-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['hotter', 'warmer', 'ready', 'niño', 'drier', 'burn', 'conditions', 'waters', 'bureau', 'bushfire', 'bushfires', 'gets', 'stronger', 'australia', 'victoria', 'el']",Somalia,news article,English
1026,Drought Sri Lanka,No way out - Sydney Morning Herald,https://www.smh.com.au/world/no-way-out-20130211-2e796.html,"Fateful night … traffic surveillance footage of Andrei Monov’s group chasing two Gypsies in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, in late 2007. Fast-forward the traffic recording. There are flashing lights, and a crush of people follow as police lead Palfreeman to a police van. Young men surround the vehicle: Palfreeman says they were pounding on it. The driver struggles to drive away. Minutes later an ambulance arrives. A tall young man lies on a stretcher, his right leg and arm dangling over it as the paramedics lift it into the ambulance. It is Andrei Monov. He is bleeding from a single stab wound to the side of his chest. By the time the ambulance gets to the hospital, Monov is dead. His blood-alcohol reading is estimated to be almost six times the legal limit for Australian motorists. Another young man sits on the curb with a flesh wound to his side. Monov was the only child of well-connected parents. His mother is a notary, while his father, a psychologist who works for the government, is the go-to person for journalists seeking commentary on youth violence. Among the politicians at his funeral was Chavdar Georgiev, a former legal advisor to the Bulgarian president, and Mihael Mikov, who would soon be the country's interior minister. Also present was the head of Bulgaria's highest court of appeal. No winners here … Hristo Monov. Credit:Dobrin Kashavelov From the start, Jock Palfreeman said he had run to the assistance of a Gypsy who was being attacked by a group of football fans. He also said he only pulled out the knife when the aggressive youths turned on him, hoping that the sight of it would scare them away. He cannot remember stabbing anyone.

According to his dad, pathologist Simon Palfreeman, Jock has always been impetuous and would rush to help others with little thought about the possible consequences. But to Andrei's father, Hristo Monov, Jock is a sociopath who will kill again if released. In defence … Palfreeman’s father, Simon (at left) with lawyer Dinko Kanchev. Jock Palfreeman is the eldest of three boys. Spencer is studying finance and accountancy, while Angus has just started university. Their mother, Mary Jane, is a dentist who for some time was also a councillor on Sydney's Mosman Council, where she was an outspoken advocate for her constituents' rights. Father Simon is very different; quiet and obedient, he was voted by his primary school class as the student most likely to be Pope because he earned so many points for good behaviour. For him, a fun night while at medical school was to listen to Mahler at home. Simon accepts that he was, and probably still is, a nerd. Palfreeman's parents separated in his last years of primary school, and when he was in year 9 he moved in with Simon and his new wife, Helen. Although bright, he never starred academically. Sitting still in class didn't suit him; he was happier outside rowing and playing rugby. But a passionate involvement in social-justice causes made him stand out at Sydney's St Ignatius' College, Riverview. He helped establish the Riverview Student Peace and Unity Congress and joined protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Behind the wire … Palfreeman says he’s been jailed for a crime he didn’t commit. Credit:Dobrin Kashavelov

In a character reference for the Bulgarian court, Palfreeman's former house master described him as ""a young man with a friendly, open personality and a positive outlook on life ... socially aware and prepared to speak out for what he felt was right. He willingly and unselfishly would go out of his way to help others and to involve and include those who may feel isolated or marginalised."" Palfreeman headed off to Europe at 19, unsure of what he wanted to do in life. After arriving in Bulgaria in May 2006, he met Grayham Saunders, an English carpenter 10 years older than him, who was renovating a dilapidated house near the town of Samokov, 55 kilometres outside the capital. Palfreeman ended up staying in Samokov for five months, making close friends with locals his age and their families, buying a motorbike and travelling across the country in between working on the potato harvest and Saunders' house. He fell in love with a young Bulgarian woman - and the country. Yet he saw many incidents of violence in Bulgaria, including an attack on a Gypsy named Simo, who credits the Australian's intervention with saving his life. Palfreeman himself was assaulted several times. So he started carrying pepper spray when he went anywhere he thought was dodgy. Wrong spot at the wrong time … Andrei Monov. In early August 2007, there was an outbreak of attacks and counter-attacks in Sofia between young Gypsies and Bulgarian skinheads. Then, one oppressively hot night late that month, a 17-year-old Gypsy, Asparuh Asenov, was killed in Samokov during a fight between four young Bulgarians and some Roma youths. An estimated 1000 Roma took to the streets of Samokov in protest. In an opinion piece for a Bulgarian newspaper titled ""Gypsies versus Bulgarians: Two worlds on a knife edge"", Andrei Monov's father, Hristo, argued that tragedies like this were inevitable because young ethnic Bulgarian men working hard to get ahead were understandably sick of seeing Gypsies on welfare, driving their ""stinking horse-drawn carts on the streets of a European capital"", where the ethnic Bulgarians hoped one day to drive ""nice cars"". At this stage, Palfreeman had left Bulgaria and was living in a squat near Grayham Saunders in the English city of Bristol, where he volunteered in a food co-operative and tried to keep the squat clean of drug dealers. He knew his visa would soon run out, and so, too, would his money if he did not secure paid employment. So in late November 2007, he enlisted in the British Army, which welcomes recruits from Commonwealth countries, and began basic infantry training.

Claiming innocence ... Jock Palfreeman. Palfreeman had once tried to join the Australian Defence Force. Life at sea sounded to him like a Boy's Own adventure: lots of demanding physical exercise with a group of mates. But after a mix-up with the application process, Palfreeman decided to explore Europe instead. One of the Samokov residents he had befriended, Tihomir Pashev, was a retired captain in the Bulgarian army, and he describes Palfreeman's ""scatter-gun"" approach to career planning: ""He talked about one day becoming either a union leader or a soldier. He seemed to want to do everything at once.” British military records of his aptitude test show Palfreeman could have done almost anything in the army. They also show that by the time the Christmas break came around, he had studied the theory of war, ethics, weapons safety and personal hygiene, and learnt to march. Palfreeman had learnt how to clean a rifle, but had not yet used one. He had learnt nothing about knives other than that they were banned in the barracks. Instead of spending the festive season with his aunt in Bath, at the last moment Palfreeman decided to return to Bulgaria with Saunders for the Christmas break. When he got to Samokov, he noticed the shops had either sold out or no longer stocked pepper spray, but this did not concern him as he intended to stay in the countryside, where he felt safe. Reunited with Bulgarian friends, he spent Christmas in the snow-covered Rila Mountains. Two days later, Saunders suggested they have a night out in Sofia. Palfreeman was reluctant, but agreed to go. As they were heading off, he realised he had no form of identification on him, and ran back inside the house. His army ID card was on the kitchen table. Next to it was a pocket knife that Saunders had bought in Samokov. Palfreeman said he made a split-second decision to grab it as he took the card. This was no Swiss Army knife, but a butterfly knife with a 12.3 centimetre-long blade. In Bulgaria it is not illegal to carry a knife, and they are sold cheaply in tourist shops across the country. Saunders had bought it because he didn't have a knife in the house and needed one, and because this one caught his eye - flashy, cool, and unlike anything he'd seen in England.

Simon and Helen Palfreeman were holidaying with Angus when Simon got a call to say Jock was in trouble in Bulgaria. Simon thought Jock was in the UK. With confusion about the detainee's name, there was a chance the man arrested was not Jock. Simon describes himself as cautious and conflict-averse, and as more news filtered through, his instinctive reaction was to put off booking the inevitable flight to Europe, feeling he needed to gather more information. The holiday period meant it was hard to get hold of anyone. But events were moving fast in Sofia. Unfounded claims that the victims had been stabbed in the back fuelled a frenzy of damaging publicity. Potentially critical evidence was not secured from the crime scene. Closed-circuit television recordings from outside the government building where Palfreeman was arrested disappeared. Witnesses were not interviewed, among them the Gypsies. On December 31, Hristo Monov described Palfreeman in the press as a ""professional murderer"" and a ""monster"". The judge who heard the bail application that day later told me she believed Palfreeman hated Bulgarians and was ""racist"". She had decided the Australian was ""led by this feeling of superiority"" and dangerous. Several days later, Sydney's Daily Telegraph published an allegation by two young men that Jock Palfreeman had once been involved in a knife fight in Australia. The incident had been investigated by police at the time, but no charges were laid. Indeed, Palfreeman had no criminal record. Yet the article would remain in the case file in the grandly named Sofia Palace of Justice, and would be repeatedly referenced by the prosecution, the civil claimants and the media. Even the trial judge mentioned it in an interview with me. When Simon's flight touched down in Sofia on January 6, 2008, thick snow blanketed much of the city. When he went to see Jock in the remand centre, his son made little sense, jumping from one part of the incident to another, with forays into stories about his life in Bulgaria. Jock Palfreeman was battling to reconstruct what had happened and was horrified by the fact that someone had died. Jock knew he had fallen to the ground at some point but that after that everything was a blur. He wanted Simon to connect the dots, and to believe he had done nothing wrong. But over the coming months, Simon struggled to understand what Jock was telling him and why he had taken out a knife that night. Simon wanted corroboration. He wanted evidence and he wanted clarity, all of which Jock found immensely frustrating.

Simon and Jock's mother had agreed that Simon would look after Jock while she attended to his distressed siblings. Ultimately, she would make several trips to Sofia. In the meantime, Simon found a Bulgarian lawyer to represent his son. Dinko Kanchev advised Simon to become part of the defence team, which at that stage comprised just the lawyer and Jock. Although he knew nothing about law other than what he had seen in repeats of Perry Mason, Simon took on the role, as it gave him access to Jock whenever he wanted during work hours. But the prospect of examining witnesses, experts and Jock himself filled him with dread. What if he failed his son? Throughout the court proceedings in 2009, Simon and Hristo stood metres from each other at the front of the courtroom. Both fathers were middle-class professionals in suits; both were determined to get justice for their sons. In the Bulgarian version of the inquisitorial legal system, a civil case can be heard simultaneously with the criminal trial. This meant Hristo's role went far beyond what would be acceptable in an Australian criminal trial. As a victim demanding monetary compensation, he was able to play a significant role in how the trial unfolded. This included blocking evidence that supported Jock Palfreeman's version of events. The prosecution wanted a life sentence; Andrei Monov's parents wanted life without parole. Palfreeman pleaded with his father to hire a private detective to find the men he had helped and the missing recording, and badgered him to speak to the Bulgarian press. He argued they should be taking defamation action against media outlets. Simon disagreed, worried they might be misled or misquoted, and wanted to focus on the evidence they did have. ""My father can do anything he puts his mind to,"" Jock tells me. ""He is the turtle that won the race. I am more the hare that falls asleep under the tree ... I'd like to be more assertive and say, 'Look, there's a truth, let's get it out there.' And my father would say, 'Yes, there's the truth, but we can't push it in their face because when they don't react to you, then we're going to be in a worse situation than we were before.' "" As the trial progressed, Simon felt compromised at every level. ""All my life I've believed in the system. And I think in Australia you more or less can do that. And here I am for the first time faced with a system that I don't have confidence in."" He wondered how justice could prevail, but he dared not show that to Jock, who was increasingly dispirited.

""It's very hard as a father to ... watch him hurting like that and not be able to do anything about it,"" Simon said at the time. ""Partly because I know he's relying on me so much, I feel inadequate."" Adding to Simon's worries, Jock seemed to be fixated with helping other prisoners in the various battles they faced in prison and with their cases. The arbitrary application of rules enraged him. ""Each time I come, he seems to be more disoriented in time,"" Simon says. ""He is more and more focused on day-to-day things. He acknowledges he has an institutionalised mentality."" ""My father,"" explains Jock Palfreeman, ""has a very high moral standard: he is very principled. He carries the same mentality over here, where the system has no respect for your principles, no respect for morals, no respect for its own laws."" The combination of anxiety, uncertainty about when hearings would be held, and the need to fly back and forth between two countries, meant Simon struggled to appear upbeat and positive. Family members worried that Jock did not appreciate what Simon was doing. Simon sensed that Jock was using him as a punching bag to vent his frustration. But when I ask Jock, his response is heartfelt. ""I love my father. We're a good team.” What Simon did not know was that Jock was also working to set up a prisoners' association, to help inmates understand their rights. It was a high-risk plan that involved secret discussions with prisoners he could trust. If the prison authorities found out, they could come down hard on everyone involved. By the end of the trial, Simon was convinced his son had genuinely feared for his life during the incident. As a pathologist, he also believed the forensic evidence was inconclusive.

When Hristo gave his final statement to court, he turned to Simon. ""Whatever happens, whatever [Jock's] sentence,"" he said, ""you will receive the most horrific verdict - a son a murderer!"" When Simon stood to give his summary, he turned to his son. ""Jock's motive originally was to help [the Gypsy] and then to defend himself. This was an act that I can only describe as heroic. While as a parent I would have preferred that he stayed safe and did not get into trouble, as a human being I am proud that a young man would try to help another person despite the dangerous circumstances.” After five years spent researching this case, I have discovered there is more to it than has come out in court. Soon after the trial began, the forensic doctor who performed the autopsy was arrested. It was alleged he was profiting from the improper extraction of body parts for use by a private company. On his way to give evidence at Jock Palfreeman's trial, he was arrested yet again, this time for drink-driving with a blood-alcohol reading of 0.26 in Australian units. Despite now facing two serious charges, he was allowed to give expert evidence in the trial. His evidence was critical to the prosecution case. When the defence asked for a second opinion, it was refused both at trial and at appeal. In an even more bizarre twist, police raided the prosecutor's apartment and arrested her lover, who was allegedly involved in organised crime. The prosecutor had interfered in the arrest, which raised questions about her suitability for the job. Not long after Judge Georgi Kolev found Palfreeman guilty in December 2009, Kolev was elevated, uncontested, to one of the two highest courts in Bulgaria. The move generated debate about cronyism in a legal system that has attracted considerable criticism from the European Union and non-government organisations such as Transparency International. Then one of the young men who had been with Andrei Monov when he died was arrested in relation to an attack on a group of students protesting against conditions in a detention facility for foreigners.

To top it off, during the appeal in 2011, a Sydney barrister rang the Bulgarian Embassy in Canberra, alleging Jock Palfreeman had brutally attacked him in 2006. Immigration records show that Palfreeman was not in Australia at the time. The barrister was mistaken, but his allegation sat in the file before the judges, along with the one that had been published in The Daily Telegraph. Eventually, I was given access to the traffic surveillance camera recording. The footage was chilling to watch. The figures are hazy; the moment when Andrei Monov is stabbed is blurred. But moments before that, some movements are clear: Palfreeman is hit in the head, falls to the ground, gets up and tries to escape from the large group of youths that quickly surrounds him. He has always said he does not remember what happened after falling to the ground. He does not remember fleeing and being pursued. Last July, Jock Palfreeman had a victory. A Bulgarian court approved the application that he and three other prisoners submitted for the establishment of the obliquely named Bulgarian Prisoners' Rehabilitation Association as a non-government organisation. Bulgarian human-rights advocate Krassimir Kanev says the association is the first of its kind in Bulgaria and describes Palfreeman as a ""courageous and charismatic leader"". The two men are now working closely with each other, taking cases to the European Court of Human Rights. ""I am in prison because I was helping other people,"" Palfreeman says. ""Why am I doing this? Because I still want to help people."" Simon's sense that his son ""walks the talk"" still fills him with pride. But his fears for Jock's well-being have not diminished. On January 13 this year, Palfreeman began a hunger strike after the prison drastically reduced the amount of time he can use a computer. Prisoners are not given access to the internet, but Palfreeman is enrolled in an arts degree at Sydney's Macquarie University and needs to read the resource material that is sent to him on a disk, and to type essays. Neither Jock nor Simon know why his access has been reduced.

Kanev says it is probably payback for Jock Palfreeman's advocacy on behalf of some prisoners who had been bashed by guards. He says Sofia Central is among the worst prisons he has visited in Eastern Europe. ""It's a kind of a living death. It's an inhuman condition of detention essentially."" Australia and Bulgaria are both signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, and the Palfreemans want Jock to serve his sentence in Australia so he can be near his family. Kanev says transfer is essential on human-rights grounds and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs has instigated proceedings with the Bulgarian government, but little progress has been made so far. Simon Palfreeman has booked yet another ticket to Europe. Sofia is now bitterly cold and an icy wind whistles through the broken window in Cell 17. Jock fears the Bulgarian authorities will refuse a transfer out of spite. Simon can only hope that his son is wrong.

1566,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt wishes to resume Ethiopian dam negotiations holding onto water rights fundamentals: min. - Egypttoday,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/100121/Egypt-wishes-to-resume-Ethiopian-dam-negotiations-holding-onto-water,"CAIRO – 25 March 2021: Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdel Aty asserted Wednesday Egypt's desire to resume the negotiations on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) while holding onto the fundamentals it adopts to preserve its water rights.

The minister's statements came in his speech while presiding over a seminar titled ""The Water Future of Egypt: Opportunities and Challenges"" jointly organized by Canada-Egypt Business Council and the Egyptian Business Council for International Cooperation.

The minister presented the updates on the issue stressing that the Ethiopian Dam and its impact on Nile water compose one of the biggest challenges faced by Egypt. That is particularly in light of the unilateral measures taken by Ethiopia in terms of reservoir filling and dam operation. Abdel Aty warned against the massive repercussions that will not be accepted by Egypt.

The minister underlined that Egypt supports development in fellow African states and Nile Basin countries. Examples of such support is embodied in building a number of dams that harvest rainwater; underground water treatment plants and supply networks powered by solar energy serving remote communities; flood management projects; river harbors; fisheries, and, cleaning canals.

That is in addition to contributing to the preparation of studies necessary to establish dams that would secure water and generate electricity as well as offering training and capacity-building opportunities to technical cadres in Nile Basin countries.

Abdel Aty pointed out that water challenges require Egypt to deploy efforts on both the governmental and societal levels. On one hand, the government shall implement a number of large projects in the sector. On the other hand, there is a need to raise people's awareness on water rationalization and preservation from pollution.

On the legislative level, Abdel Aty indicated that the House of Representatives is examining a draft bill on efficient water management, and elimination of water-related violations.

The Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources noted earlier in March in a statement that it had accomplished the lining of 1,188 kilometers of canals across Egypt.

Currently, the ministry is lining further 4,312 kilometers while allocations to line 1,452 kilometers have been endorsed so they would be offered to contractors in tenders soon.

The target for the first phase ending in 2022 and worth LE18 billion is lining 7,000 kilometers of canals.

The canal lining project is part of the National Project for Developing the Egyptian Countryside aimed at raising the quality of life of residents of rural areas. The lining of canals would enhance water management and distribution, ensure the delivery of water to the ends of canals, and inhibit pollution.

On another level, the ministry is encouraging farmers to substitute modern irrigation systems for flood irrigation in order to rationalize water use. Modern irrigation systems have been introduced in 230,000 feddans and will be introduced in further 55,000 feddans as requested by agricultural land owners.

The ministry attributes demand by farmers on modern irrigation systems to the desire of lowering costs, and improving the productivity and quality of crops.",2021-03-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['min', 'modern', 'wishes', 'water', 'egypt', 'lining', 'fundamentals', 'aty', 'rights', 'irrigation', 'ethiopian', 'nile', 'kilometers', 'holding', 'resume', 'systems', 'minister', 'negotiations']",Egypt,news article,English

165,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka floods: Battle to rescue stranded as death toll tops 180 - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/29/asia/sri-lanka-floods/index.html,"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) Sri Lanka remains in the grips of the worst flooding in 14 years, and the bad weather that has killed at least 194 people is expected to continue, the Red Cross said Monday.

The flooding was brought on by monsoon rains across southwestern portions of the country, according to Sri Lanka's Ministry of Disaster Management.

As many as 99 people are missing, according to Sri Lanka's Disaster Management Center, and the death toll is expected to rise as authorities battle to rescue those still stranded and warn of the possibility of crocodile attacks. The Center adds that there are 112 people injured.

More than half a million people have been affected. India and other countries have sent aid.

Local Sri Lanka Red Cross volunteers and staff workers have been on the scene to give first aid, help with search and rescue missions, and distribute food, water and supplies.

The Red Cross is providing financial and technical support, said a statement by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies

Particularly affected is the district of Matara. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that there were still pockets where people were marooned, and rescue work was continuing. The nearby Ratnapura district, 63 miles southeast of the capital, Colombo, had the highest death count of any area, with 79 deaths.

'Never seen such floods'

The monsoon rains are the the worst to hit Sri Lanka since 2003. They come after two months of drought, which had grown severe enough to warrant aid from the World Food Programme.

Sri Lankans fleeing the floods say in many cases everything has been lost.

Banakiyanage Gnanawathie, who lives in the badly hit town of Matara, said by phone that her home is uninhabitable.

""I have never seen such floods, though I have spent my entire lifetime in Matara,"" she said. ""We have lost all our belongings and remain in the clothes we wore. I am still happy we escaped the floods and even the crocodiles.""

""It was only the next morning that troops arrived in boats, and took us to safe ground,"" she added.

She said they won't be able to return home for days.

""There is only a roof and building. We have lost everything else.""

Sri Lankan villagers cross a landslide site as military rescue workers and villagers search for survivors in Athweltota village in Kalutara.

The heavy rain occurred over a very short period, leading to the displacement of 112,000 people, according to Pradeep Kodippily, spokesman for Sri Lanka's Disaster Management Center.

The bout of severe weather triggered landslides throughout the country.

The southern coastal city of Galle has seen 223 millimeters (8.78 inches) of rainfall over the past three days, and Ratnapura, further inland, has experienced 453 millimeters (17.8 inches) of rain over the same period.

Police and military rescue teams are moving by boat to rescue those marooned as well as retrieve corpses.

Houses and shops remained submerged in 10 to 30 feet of water. The expressway from Colombo to Matara, 100 miles south of the capital, was flooded in several areas.

A Sri Lankan home is surrounded by floodwaters in the suburb of Kaduwela in the capital, Colombo.

'We could not stand up'

Stonemason Kirindagamage Pathmasiri, another Matara resident, said the police had urged people to evacuate, but he and his family stayed put as they had nowhere to evacuate to.

""The next day the waters began to rise gradually. Then the flow was so fast that we could not stand up. My wife, four children and I were very frightened. We did not know what would happen to us now. With great difficulty we managed to walk out,"" he said. They are taking temporary shelter in a school.

He said his house is submerged under 8 feet of water.

""A bigger shock awaits us when the waters recede and we return home. We have lost all our possessions,"" he said.

Sri Lankan residents travel by boat through floodwaters in the suburb of Kaduwela in the capital Colombo.

Overseas help

Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs activated its emergency response unit and called on the United Nations' International Search and Rescue Advisory Group, as well as neighboring countries, to help in the recovery effort. The government has deployed 2,000 military personnel to affected areas.

Australia has pledged $500,000 for inflatable boats and outboard motors to assist with search and rescue efforts, the country's embassy in Colombo said Tuesday.

India has dispatched three naval vessels to its southern neighbor to deliver relief aid and disaster expertise.

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi immediately directed provision of all necessary assistance,"" a statement issued by High Commission of India, Colombo, read.

""He also expressed condolences at the loss of lives and property and said that India stands with her Sri Lankan brothers and sisters in their hour of need.""

The navy's official Twitter handle posted media of one of the vessels, INS Shardul, docking in Colombo and unloading aid Sunday. It joins the INS Kirch. A larger vessel, INS Jalashwa, is also en route, as is a Pakistani vessel carrying relief supplies, and three Chinese ships ferrying aid to the beleaguered country.

""The World Food Programme is also providing help,"" he said.

Last year, India sent two ships and Air Force aircraft to Colombo with relief items during a cyclone.

One person is found dead after floodwater sweeps a car off the road and into a creek

Thousands were stranded in Southern California town

As many as 500 children and adults are being safely evacuated Monday after torrential rain and mudslides trapped them at a Southern California church camp, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department told CNN.

The Forest Home camp had been trapped behind a mudflow in Forest Falls -- some 80 miles east of Los Angeles -- stranding staff and middle and high school students.

""We've been able to punch through that last wall of mud so that people on the other side can start making their way out of town,"" fire department spokesman Ryan Beckers said.

Sudden rainfall Sunday had rendered most roads ""impassable due to mudflows"" in Forest Falls, San Bernardino Fire Capt. Kyle Hauducoeur said earlier. Thousands were stranded. Even a local fire station had to be evacuated.

So far, there have been no reports of injuries or missing residents in Forest Falls, population 2,000. Hauducoeur said the damage to homes due to flooding has not been severe.

But elsewhere in San Bernardino County, one person was found dead inside a vehicle that was swept off the road and into a creek by floodwater, county fire department spokesman Chris Prater said.

And 1,500 people in the nearby community of Glen Oak were stranded due to flash flooding, said Dennis Mathisen of Cal Fire

The downpour combined with the terrain made conditions especially daunting.

""Try to imagine the bands of rains from a hurricane -- that's what we're getting,"" Hauducoeur said. ""The difference (is) it's hitting mountains. What was a dry riverbed could become a river 6 feet deep, 20 feet wide.""

He said some roads are now covered with 6 to 8 feet of rock, and ""we have a lot of mud to deal with.""

Officials are asking residents to stay inside their homes and to call 911 if they need to be rescued. Hauducoeur said two swift-water rescue crews are in the area.

Hauducoeur said firefighters expect to be working the Forest Falls area for the next three to four days. But with ongoing wildfires in Northern California, resources will already be stretched thin.

The deluge in San Bernadino County came during one of the worst droughts in California history.

Much the state is grappling with ""exceptional drought,"" according to U.S. Drought Monitor . San Bernardino County has been dealing with ""severe"" or ""extreme"" drought.

2435,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Vast Brazil lawsuit in UK against BHP over 2015 dam failure hits buffers - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-bhp-court-dam-idUSKBN2BG1GU,"LONDON (Reuters) -A 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group said on Wednesday it had failed to resurrect a 5.0 billion pound ($6.9 billion) English lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP over a devastating 2015 dam failure.

The Court of Appeal agreed with a lower court that the vast group action was an abuse of process, that claimants were already able to seek redress in Brazil and that the case would be “irredeemably unmanageable” if allowed to proceed.

Tom Goodhead, the PGMBM lawyer representing the claimants, said it was “a sad day for the English justice system” after senior judges agreed that the claim, relating to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, should be struck out.

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

The landmark case was the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

But the English claim against BHP was first struck out in November after a High Court judge ruled that allowing it to proceed here would be like “trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel”.

Goodhead said he was surprised and disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision, which sent “a poor message about corporate responsibility and legal consequences for wrongdoing”.

“We are committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy. We will now take stock and assess our options as to how justice can best be achieved,” he said.

BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that the proceedings duplicated existing and ongoing remediation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil. It said it remained fully committed to doing “the right thing” for victims.

BHP says it and Vale each poured about $1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems.

BHP said Renova has spent nearly 12 billion reais ($2.17 billion) across the projects to date.

A United Nations expert report, published in September, said the disaster decimated the livelihoods of more than three million people, leaving locals exposed to dust and heavy metals in mud, that information about toxicity was inadequate and that all reparation projects were behind schedule.

In October, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against BHP and Vale, alleging compensation packages were too low and forced victims to waive rights in other legal proceedings.

Renova has insisted that projects such as water quality monitoring and environmental repairs are on track, while the miners reject allegations they are not complying with obligations and of wrongdoing.

352,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Floods pile pressure on Australia to rethink climate adaptation - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20210325225707-a7fl6/,"As climate change impacts worsen, Australia's population is exposed to more severe floods, droughts and bushfires, while action to protect people and their homes lags

* Severe floods have pummelled several parts of the country

* Climate change hiking threats fast, including from bushfires

* Government now working on new climate resilience plan

By Michael Taylor

March 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Australia, now battling its worst floods in more than half a century, has failed to adapt fast enough to the growing threats it faces from the impacts of climate change, with its people now suffering the effects of ""wilful ignorance"", analysts warned.

Heavy rains hit several parts of the country this week, sweeping away houses, roads and livestock and cutting off entire towns in the east. Dangerous flash floods killed two people and more than 40,000 people were forced to flee their homes.

""They call Australia 'disaster alley' because we've got a bit of everything,"" said Karl Mallon, CEO of Sydney-based Climate Valuation, which advises homeowners and buyers on climate and extreme weather risks.

As global warming accelerates, it is bringing fiercer storms, floods and heatwaves, more severe droughts and a growing risk of bushfires to Australia.

""It's a shame on us that we haven't tackled this already... We've got every incentive and the money to do it, it's just that we're not looking at it,"" Mallon told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Despite knowing about climate change since the 1980s, Australia continues to build homes in floodplains, he noted.

The problem is often rooted in ""wilful ignorance"", he said, citing government reliance on land taxes, builders and developers putting profits before safety from climate threats, and homeowners seeking to minimise insurance payments.

Property buyers are given little information on flood risks, either by local government or banks and insurers, Mallon said.

""Sometimes the first time they find out is when they get hit - and they say 'I didn't know I was in a flood zone',"" he added.

Richie Merzian, climate and energy programme director at think-tank The Australia Institute, said so far the approach to adapting to climate change impacts has been disjointed between federal, state and council levels, curbing resilience.

""The federal government seems allergic to any mention of climate change which hampers smart policy responses,"" he said.

'SELF-COMBUSTING MANURE'

Last year's bushfires - which Prime Minister Scott Morrison dubbed Australia's ""black summer"" - killed more than 30 people, destroyed wildlife and razed over 24 million hectares (59 million acres).

When the crisis hit, Morrison's deputy was reported to have partly blamed ""self-combusting piles of manure"".

Meanwhile, the health of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the world's most extensive and spectacular coral reef ecosystem, is in a critical state and deteriorating as climate change heats up the waters where it lies, conservation groups say.

""The first thing is to acknowledge that climate impacts will get worse and that 'one-in-100-years' type events will become more common, and we need to plan for that reality,"" said Cam Walker, campaigns coordinator at Friends of the Earth Australia.

To deal with the risks, a region-based approach to adaptation should be crafted that allows for joined-up responses between different levels of government and communities, he said.

Mallon said government, mortgage lenders and insurers needed to offer homeowners incentives to upgrade and better protect their properties, ensuring roofs are stronger against storms and flood barriers built around high-risk buildings.

At a municipal level, increased drainage, better sea walls and modern fire-fighting equipment would help, he added.

To reduce damage from bushfires, he advised at-risk property owners to clear guttering of flammable materials, install sprinklers and shutters that keep out embers, and use fire-retardant paint.

NATIONAL ADAPTATION PLAN

Australia has sophisticated weather monitoring systems and has been able to issue flood warnings and evacuate those in harm's way, potentially saving thousands of lives, said Merzian at The Australia Institute.

But despite the country's vulnerability to climate impacts, the government has been slow to conduct a national climate assessment or prepare a National Adaptation Plan, he said.

In January, Australia's environment minister committed to produce a new climate resilience and adaptation strategy this year, which it is due to publish before the COP26 U.N. climate talks in November.

As part of the initiative, Canberra said it would invest an initial A$12.9 million ($9.8 million) to prepare for disasters.

Protecting and restoring wetlands, mangroves and forests would help shield communities from floods and storms, while more trees in cities would also ease the effects of heat, green groups say.

Changing crops and tilling practices, and introducing livestock breeds that can tolerate drier conditions, are other options to combat droughts, said Will Steffen, a climate scientist at the Australian National University.

But conservative governments have been reluctant to change well-established practices in the agriculture and construction sectors, he said, adding that climate change has become ""a partisan political issue"".

BAND-AIDS ON BULLET-HOLES

Environmentalists say Australia is its own worst enemy due to its continued reliance on coal-fired power, which makes it one of the world's largest carbon-emitters per capita.

Green groups have long lobbied the government to ditch fossil fuels and set a goal to become carbon-neutral by 2050 - so far with little success.

""The government's failure to significantly cut emissions puts Australia and the Pacific region at risk of more fires, floods and cyclones,"" said Martin Zavan, campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific.

""When it comes to adaptation, you can't put a band-aid on a bullet-hole and expect it to get better,"" he added.

Friends of the Earth's Walker noted that Australia had produced 240 reports on natural disasters since 1920, but citizens were still suffering the consequences.

""Adaptation without (emissions) mitigation means surrender on the issue of climate change,"" he said.

Tony Robinson visited Gebel el-Silsila to meet with archaeologist John Ward for his new Channel 5 show “Egyptian Tomb Hunting,” who had uncovered what he believed to be an entrance to a hidden chamber. The hole, which scaled down more than 20 feet, was completely filled with water. Unsure on the source of the pool, the pair used pumps in a bid to get a look at what could be hiding inside.

After crawling on their hands and knees through a thick layer of mud, they got to a huge chamber, with another door awaiting them ahead. Mr Robinson asked: “Look at it, what do you reckon would be in there?” Before Mr Ward responded: “I don’t know, it’s totally different to any of our tombs that we’ve found in Silsila. “If that secondary chamber is another burial, we’re not talking about 50-60 people plus.""

The archaeologists uncovered an amazing find

Mr Ward found this flooded hole

Mr Robinson was stunned by the tomb, adding: “And all their bits and pieces are mixed in beneath our knees, like human soup. “The idea that so many people might be down here is pretty eerie, and some of them at least must have been of real status. “This chamber has been carefully chiselled out, and this doorway beautifully finished.” The pair began excavating the tomb, getting completely covered in dirt in the process. Mr Ward told viewers: “What’s intriguing me is that the ceiling is vaulted, it has got an arch to it. JUST IN: 'The spy in the BBC’ How undercover Nazi sent coded messages over national radio

1866,FL-2021-000038-KEN,MOROCCO: IFC finances studies on the recovery of industrial waste in Tangier - AFRIK 21,https://www.afrik21.africa/en/morocco-ifc-finances-studies-on-the-recovery-of-industrial-waste-in-tangier/,"In Morocco, the management of industrial waste remains very sensitive. The Cherifian kingdom produces 1.5 million tonnes of industrial waste each year, of which about 350,000 tonnes are identified as hazardous. According to the Moroccan authorities, only 23% of this waste is recycled in the kingdom, yet it is very harmful to humans and the environment.

The General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima (TTA) and five associations representing investors in the Tangier Export Processing Zone, the industrial zones of Gzenaya, Mghogha and Al Majd, as well as the Tangier Automotive City free zone, want to improve industrial waste management in Morocco. On April 15th, 2021, these key players in the Moroccan economy launched studies for the recovery of industrial waste in the Kingdom.

Initially, the waste management project will be deployed in Tangier, the second largest economic hub in Morocco after the city of Casablanca. The initiative, implemented by a specialised international office, will make it possible to define the best model for managing this type of waste for the city of Tangier. This model can then be applied to other cities in Morocco. The studies, which will last four months, will also promote the development of a circular economy around industrial waste, thus creating employment opportunities for young Moroccans.

IFC funding

The studies on industrial waste management in Tangier are being financed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of the World Bank Group responsible for financing the private sector. The results of the investigations will also be used by waste management companies, such as Suez, that wish to invest or set up in Morocco. In this North African kingdom, the French group manages the waste produced in the factories of car manufacturers PSA and Renault.

In March 2021, the local subsidiary of the French environmental giant Suez Maroc also won the contract to manage the waste of the Moroccan Tobacco Company (SMT). This new contract will run for two years.

Cyclone Molave  the fourth tropical cyclone to threaten Vietnam this month  is barrelling towards the countrys central coast, worsening severe floods and landslides that have inundated parts of the region for weeks.

Vietnamese authorities are rushing to evacuate half a million people before Molave makes a projected 28 October landfall, packing wind speeds topping 110 kilometres per hour. The country is already struggling with intense floods and landslides that have killed at least 130 people and damaged a quarter of a million homes.

The Vietnamese Red Cross has already warned that 160,000 people may need food aid over the next six months, but that figure could rise after Molave makes landfall and its impact becomes more clear.

Aid groups say parts of Vietnam are seeing their worst floods and landslides in two decades. Disasters are common during Asias various monsoon seasons, but this months flurry of storms has aggravated conditions, with weeks of extended heavy rainfall.

Parts of Laos and Cambodia are also submerged. And Thailand is projecting that Molave's rains will hit the countrys north and northeast.

Before threatening Southeast Asias Mekong region, Cyclone Molave uprooted some 25,000 people in the Philippines earlier this week.

The past 70 years have witnessed the two countries sharing weal and woe. The time-tested China-Pakistan friendship now sets exemplary for state-to-state relations, and is strategic asset for both countries, most dearly cherished by the two peoples.

Similar histories brought us close to each other. Both China and Pakistan are developing countries and have similar experiences in getting rid of foreign aggression and seeking independence. At such critical times, be it when New China endeavored to break the external blockade and open up a new prospect for diplomacy, or when Pakistan stood up to crises to defend national dignity, we have always been there for each other.

Similar ideas guide us stand shoulder to shoulder. China and Pakistan are the backbones in maintaining regional peace and stability. The two countries firmly defend multilateralism, free trade and win-win cooperation, commit to improving the global governance system, and support increasing the representation and voice of developing countries in international affairs. China and Pakistan always respect the diversity of civilizations, and advocate the vision of exchanges rather than estrangement, mutual learning rather than conflict, and coexistence rather than seeking superiority.

Common interests deepen our cooperation. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is an important pilot project of the Belt and Road Initiative. 46 projects have been completed or under construction, with a total investment of US$25.4 billion. The CPEC successfully helped Pakistan solve the power shortage that has plagued it for decades, established the main traffic line from north to south, and revitalized Gwadar Port to become a regional trade hub. China has been Pakistans largest trading partner for six consecutive years and largest source of FDI for seven consecutive years.

The tests of crisis reconfirms our common choice. The two peoples are always the first to lend a helping hand to each other when the other side is in trouble. When Wenchuan earthquake hit China in 2008, and when flood plagued Pakistan in 2010, both sides supported each other with full efforts. After the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the governments, armies and all walks of life of the two countries have rendered mutual assistance, and carried out close cooperation in fields of emergency supplies, Covid-19 prevention experiences-sharing, vaccine research and development, thus setting a model for international cooperation against the pandemic.

2021 is a year of great significance for both China and Pakistan. China celebrates the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and is implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan to embark on a new journey of modernization. Pakistan is making every effort to develop its economy and realize the Naya Pakistan vision proposed by Prime Minister Imran Khan, providing us with new opportunities for China-Pakistan cooperation. Standing at a new historic starting point, the two countries should further implement the important consensus reached by our leaders, continue to deepen the iron-clad friendship between China and Pakistan, and jointly build a closer China-Pakistan Community of Shared Future in the New Era.

China will continue to put Pakistan on the top agenda of its diplomacy, and firmly support Pakistan to maintain sovereign independence and territorial integrity, and exert a greater constructive role in international and regional affairs. We will continue to provide Pakistan support of medical supplies and vaccines within our capacity until Pakistan completely defeats the pandemic. Following the principle of mutual benefit, win-win cooperation, opening-up and inclusiveness, China will work with Pakistan to boost high-quality development of the CPEC, focus more on industry, agriculture, science and technology and peoples livelihood, so as to develop Pakistans manufacturing industry and increase employment and income of its people. China will continue to work closely with Pakistan to deepen the friendship between the two peoples, especially the young generation. We will endeavor to carry forward the China-Pakistan iron-clad friendship for another 70 years, enhancing the all-weather friendship and all-dimensional cooperation, and work together to uplift China-Pakistan bilateral relations to a new level with a brighter future.

Last but not the least, on behalf of the Embassy of China in Pakistan, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude and great respect to Pakistani friends from all circles who care about and support the development of our bilateral relations.

Chin-Pak Dosti Zindabad!

“A few weeks ago, I went to Greece with the International Rescue Committee — (the IRC) — a global humanitarian aid , relief, and development nongovernmental organization — to help out in any way I could,” she wrote. ""The Greek island of Lesbos is the closest to the shores of Turkey, so thousands of people arrive on these flimsy, rubber boats each day. On Lesbos, both refugees and inhabitants need all the help they can get.

“During the few days I was there, the IRC staff, along with local officials and volunteers, helped register more than 15,000 people. But that’s not all they did. They greeted incoming boats, organized buses for people traversing the mountain roads, cleaned the transit camp, and provided shelter and assistance to the most vulnerable — all the while treating people with dignity and humanity.

“What stood out to me most was just how incredibly patient and full of good will the Greek people and the refugees were after all they have been through. I got to know dozens of them during my time on the island and was moved by their kindness, sheer determination, and concern for one another.”

2033,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistan floods: Monsoon rains expose blockages in both Karachis drains and politics - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/pakistan-floods-karachi-moonsoon-rain-waseem-akhtar-a9666811.html,"C

raftsman Mohammad Zakir, who lives in a low-lying area of Karachis Orangi Town, does not recall the authorities ever cleaning out the storm water drain serving his neighbourhood.

Thorani Goth in West District was flooded during the fourth bout of monsoon rain this season from 6-8 August.

During that  and a previous downpour in late July  water came up 4-5ft (1.2-1.5m) inside Mr Zakirs home, ruining furniture, electrical equipment and important documents.

It also soaked an order of 250 womens garments he was due to decorate with sequins and beads  his first job in five months due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Ill put them out to dry to see if there are water stains on them, said the informal-sector worker.

If the clothes were ruined, he would have to bear half the cost of 250,000 Pakistani rupees (1,139), he added.

Karachi mayor Waseem Akhtar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation people are certainly not exaggerating when they say water comes up chest-high into their homes.

The city has a network of 550 storm water drains which zigzag through the city and flow out into the Arabian Sea, but many are obstructed by illegal construction, waste and sludge.

Mr Akhtar said the city authorities cleaned out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide the funds for the work.

In the mayors four-year term, which ends this month, management of Karachis services has been hamstrung by disputes between different levels of government.

Meanwhile the citys infrastructure is struggling to cope with heavy monsoon rains, as seen this year.

Sardar Sarfaraz, Karachi head of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said rainfall of as little as 50mm (2 inches) could cause urban flooding in some of Karachis low-lying areas, with the most recent downpour easily exceeding that across the city.

Scientists are still figuring out how global warming will affect the Asian monsoon, but in many parts of the world, higher temperatures are fuelling more intense bouts of rainfall.

Mr Sarfaraz noted the trend is for more erratic weather patterns, as predicted by climate scientists.

In Karachi, the August rains killed 22 people, 11 of them by electrocution, after 10 died in July. From 2014 to 2019, the city recorded more than 70 rain-related deaths, with 2018 an exception as it was largely dry.

After the havoc this July  with main roads submerged, sewage spewing from manholes and into homes, and power cuts lasting for hours  Imran Khan, Pakistans prime minister, tasked the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) with sorting out the citys drains.

The NDMA, helped by the militarys engineering wing, said it had cleaned three major drains in just under a week, clearing 42 choke points and removing more than 31,000 tonnes of sludge.

After touring the city, Sindh information minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah told Pakistans Dawn newspaper there were no floods in the city, despite the intensity of this months rain, as prevention policies had been effectively implemented.

But Mr Zakirs experience does not back up that assertion.

Illegal building

Hot sun after the monsoon rain has provided some respite for Mr Zakirs family and the 13 million city residents, out of a population of more than 17 million, who live in informal settlements that are prone to flooding.

Mr Zakir blamed illegal construction along the drainage channels, adding that the government needs to come here and bulldoze the buildings.

The storm water drains, some as wide as 200ft, have over the years, due to unauthorised construction, narrowed to just 30 feet  so what do you expect? said Mr Akhtar, the citys mayor.

The main responsibility lies both with residents who have encroached on land along the drain, and the provincial government for letting it happen, said the outgoing mayor.

The province of Sindh has taken a larger share of control from the city authority but has not provided the budget owed, which a court ruling ordered it to pay, Mr Akhtar said.

A Sindh government spokesman said it did not owe money to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, to which it had transferred 50bn rupees (227m) in the last three and a half years.

Solid waste dumped into storm water drains exacerbates the flooding. It is estimated that the mega-city generates 13,000 tonnes of garbage daily.

The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board collects 70 per cent of that and takes it to two landfills, but told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it does not know what happens to the rest.

Sewage is also being dumped in storm drains, as little has been invested in rehabilitating the crumbling sewerage system for two decades despite the citys expansion, officials said.

Longer-term plan?

Zubair Channa, director of the Sindh government-led Solid Waste Emergency and Efficiency Project (SWEEP), funded with $100m (76.8m) from the World Bank, said encroachment on most of Karachis large drains over a long period, coupled with their uneven width, caused disturbances in the flow of water.

Drains feeding into the big water channels are also not well maintained, making the flooding worse, noted the civil engineer.

What is needed is a comprehensive engineering solution, he said, rather than firefighting each year as the city does now.

In its first year, SWEEP has hired contractors to remove about 10 million cubic ft of sludge from the drains and deposit it in landfill by the end of August, he noted.

With floods causing so much devastation year after year, Mr Akhtar said it was time to take the firm but unpleasant decision of pulling down illegal buildings.

Before that is done, people must be provided with an alternative, he added.

There is enough government land that can be used for both vertical expansion as well as developing satellite towns around Karachi, where these people can be shifted, he said.

But with Karachi run by three tiers of government dominated by three different political parties, real solutions to its problems are often lost in a war of words.

We need the judiciary and the army to sit with experts like architects and town planners to resolve the issue, Mr Akhtar said.

However, parts of Lang'ata and Lower Hill will remain off supply as the technical team working with the Nairobi Metropolitan Service engineers seek to find a lasting solution.

The rains currently experienced in Nairobi led to the Nairobi Dam bursting its banks.

Since the past week, heavy rains have been experienced in many parts of Nairobi, contrary to the prediction from the weatherman that Nairobi would not experience long rains in the month.

In its May review, Kenya Meteorological Department had ruled Nairobi out of the regions that were expected to receive heavy rains.

The Grammy-nominated boy band's meal will launch starting next month in nearly 50 countries, including South Korea, McDonald's said in a statement on Monday, and will include chicken McNuggets, fries, and two dips.

The burger chain has seen its revenue outside the United States drop during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company is tapping on promotional campaigns through celebrity endorsements and limited-time menu items to get customers back into restaurants as economies reopen with the roll-out of vaccines.

The BTS meal follows similar U.S.-only deals with singers J Balvin and Travis Scott, which McDonald's says boosted sales in the later half of last year.

The spike in demand during the Travis Scott promotion caused the company to temporarily run short of ingredients to assemble its signature Quarter Pounder burgers at some restaurants.

1457,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Where Canada sits with overland flood insurance - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/canada-sits-overland-flood-insurance-1004132703/,"Five years after massive flooding caused more than $4 billion in uninsured losses in Alberta, more than a dozen insurers representing about three-fourths of Canada’s property insurance market are now covering overland flood.

Sixteen insurers representing 77% of the market now offer overland flood coverage, Craig Stewart, vice president of federal affairs for Insurance Bureau of Canada, said in a recent interview.

In 2015, Aviva Canada, The Co-operators and RSA Canada were among the first insurers to announce they would cover overland flood. Until then, only sewer backup was generally available. The 2013 southern Alberta floods led to economic losses of about $6 billion, but only about $1.7 billion of that was covered by insurance (mostly sewer backup).

Water damage coverage is still a concern because overland flood is not available at affordable rates to hundreds of thousands of Canadian homeowners, mainly because they live in areas deemed by insurers to be at a high risk of flooding, Stewart told Canadian Underwriter.

IBC is not naming all 16 carriers offering overland flood. Those who publicly advertise it include Aviva, The Co-operators, RSA, Gore Mutual, Wawanesa, Economical, Desjardins (whose brands in Canada include State Farm and The Personal), Intact, and Coachman.

Flood coverage was among the topics of conversation during a meeting of politicians on May 25. That meeting was co-chaired by federal public safety minister Ralph Goodale and Alberta municipal affairs minister Shaye Anderson.

Ministers attending that meeting asked IBC to “continue to further refine options for managing the financial costs of high-risk properties,” including drawing from international practices such as Flood Re in Britain, a Public Safety Canada spokesperson wrote Tuesday in an e-mail to Canadian Underwriter.

IBC recommended earlier that Canada have insurance for homes at high risk of flood where the coverage is administered by insurers but the capital is provided by government.

“It remains to be determined what the mechanism would look like,” Stewart said. “We don’t believe that low-risk insurance policyholders should be subsidizing those who have been permitted to continue living in harm’s way.”

Contacted by Canadian Underwriter, Public Safety Canada would not confirm whether the federal government agrees that it should provide capital for flood risk for high-risk properties.

Flood Re, a reinsurer subsidized by a tax imposed on all carriers writing home insurance in Britain, was launched two years ago.",2018-06-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['coverage', 'sits', 'risk', 'safety', 'stewart', 'canada', 'overland', 'canadian', 'flood', 'insurers', 'insurance']",Canada,news article,English
988,Drought Sri Lanka,Grand opening for race course mini pavilion | The Sundaytimes Sri Lanka - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka,http://www.sundaytimes.lk/121021/news/grand-opening-for-race-course-mini-pavilion-17503.html,"Grand opening for race course mini pavilion By Nadia Fazlulhaq View(s): View(s):

The Colombo Race Course Mini Pavilion, refurbished at a cost of Rs.125 million, was declared opened to the public yesterday by the Minister of Economic Development, Basil Rajapaksa, the Defence and Urban Development Ministry Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and the Mayor of the Colombo Municipal Council, M. J. M. Muzammil.

Special guests included politicians, members of the diplomatic community, high-profile cricketers, and heads of the armed forces. Others included prominent Cinnamon Gardens residents.

Under the Colombo City beautification project, the 119-year-old race course pavilions in Cinnamon Gardens are being restored in stages to their former grandeur, preserving the original colonial architecture. The Urban Development Authority provided architectural consultancy and the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau acted as engineering consultant.

During the glory days of the races, the mini-pavilion housed the jockeys’ room, the stewards’ rooms, inquiry rooms and betting offices. The pavilion now houses a set of boutique stores and fast-food restaurant McDonald’s.

Formerly maintained by the Ceylon Turf Club, the renovated race course buildings will be maintained by the Defence and Urban Development Ministry.

The restoration work was done by the Sri Lanka Army’s Sixth Engineers Service Regiment. About 300 military personnel were involved. The mini pavilion is part of a Rs. 450 million project that includes the completion of the grand stand, a rugby field and a Sports Ministry building.

The race course project is expected to be completed by December 2013.�Land that was once green racing turf is being developed as Sri Lankas first international rugby grounds.

850,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Menzgold Customers Besiege CID Headquarters ... to Present Petition - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907180522.html,"Some aggrieved customers of Menzgold, yesterday besieged the headquarters of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), in Accra, to present a petition to the police.

The customers, who were clad in red bands, were, however, prevented from entering the premises by the police, but the leaders were called in to meet the senior police personnel.

A reliable police source at the CID that confirmed these to the Ghanaian Times in Accra yesterday, indicated that the leadership was asked to go by the proceedings of the public order acts in presenting petition to the police.

The police source said by the act they were to write to the police and specify what they exactly wanted and give them five days before the petition could be accepted.

The Ghanaian Times reported on July 12, 2019, that the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Menzgold, Nana Appiah Mensah, (also known as NAM 1), was arrested shortly after arrival in the country yesterday.

NAM I had since been put before court and remanded into police custody and may be charged with abetment to defraud and abetment to carrying banking business with licence.

He was arrested by the CID, when he arrived in the country by an Emirate Airline, at the Kotoka International Airport.

Nana Mensah's arrest follows an International Police (INTERPOL) red alert for his arrest to assist in investigation in the alleged fraud case.

A reliable source at the CID confirmed these to the Ghanaian Times in Accra, yesterday, stating that he was arrested and detained at the CID headquarters, Accra, for interrogation on alleged charge of defrauding by false pretence, following complaints by customers of Menzgold.

NAM1 has spent more than six months in police custody in Dubai, following his arrest there, in December, last year, over a botched gold business deal with a Dubai based company.

He is said to have landed in Dubai hoping to retrieve some $39 million owed Menzgold by the Dubai-based company, Horizon Royal Diamonds DMCC, for the supply of gold.

His arrest in Dubai, which was initially unknown to the CID of the Ghana Police Service police, triggered an INTERPOL process in 194 member countries, declaring NAM 1 a wanted man.

When the CID later confirmed his arrest, a government delegation was dispatched to Dubai, to facilitate the extradition of the CEO, but this failed as the case for which he was arrested in Dubai had not ended.

The Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) secured a court order to freeze all landed properties and vehicles belonging to NAM 1, including Menzgold Ghana Limited and Menzgold Office Complex, Zylofon Art Complex.",2019-07-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['accra', 'yesterday', 'petition', 'customers', 'source', 'dubai', 'arrest', 'besiege', 'arrested', 'menzgold', 'times', 'present', 'headquarters', 'ghana', 'cid']",Ghana,news article,English
118,DR-2015-000134-SOM,The World Bank's projections on extreme poverty say progress in Sub-Saharan Africa has been uneven - Ventures Africa,https://venturesafrica.com/the-world-banks-projections-on-extreme-poverty-say-progress-sub-saharan-africa-has-been-uneven/,"According to World Bank projections, this year, extreme poverty will fall below 10 percent of the global population. This projection has estimated that over 700 million people – predominantly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia will live below the poverty line this year. Although this is an improvement from the 902 million people that were recorded last year, the report shows that sub- Saharan African and Asia has to take a decisive and effective steps to end poverty or be ready to suffer for many more years.

Extreme poverty is defined by the World Bank as average daily consumption of $1.25 or less. It is also a condition in which a person in deprived of basic human needs which include food, clean drinking water, and access to health, shelter, education and information. In trying to measure the level of poverty across the globe, the World Bank started the ‘dollar a day’ international poverty line in 1990. By 2005, the international poverty line has been increased to $1.25. However, due to inflation across the globe, World Bank has now set a new international poverty line using the Purchasing Power Parities (PPP). PPP is a standard measure of the real value of different currencies in relation to each other based on local prices of the goods and services consumed in each country. According to report from the 2014 PPP survey, anyone who lives on $1.90 or less is extremely poor.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, over 200 million people live in extreme poverty and of the 40 poorest countries in the world, about 33 are Sub-Saharan African countries. In a bid to address the problem of poverty across the globe, world leaders converged at the UN summit and pledged to end extreme poverty by 2030. To this effect, the UN has adopted the Sustainable Development Goals and which will cost over $3 trillion per year.

These are a few of the reasons economic growth in Africa has been uneven:

Prolonged conflict and violence

In places like DR Congo, Burundi and Central African Republic, unrest, war and inter religious conflicts have become the order of the day. These conflicts increase the number of Internally Displaced Persons in the country thereby increasing poverty. For example, in the 2015 United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) report, the Democratic Republic of Congo has over 2 million IDPs due to the ongoing religious crisis. The report estimates that the country needs over $ 200 million in order to provide food, shelter, water and education for its people.

Poor governance

According to the list released by Transparency International, Somalia ranks first on the list of most corrupt countries in the world and also has 73 percent poverty rate, which is one highest in the Africa. About 800,000 Somalians require life-saving assistance, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). When African leaders abuse their offices by engaging in dishonest and fraudulent dealings or diverting public funds for personal gains, it increases the level of poverty. Citizens robbed of public services, such as good health care system, standard and affordable education, constant power supply, subsidized housing among many others. Also, poor governance allows for income inequality.

Gender discrimination

The Human Development Report placed Niger Republic as the country with the highest gender inequality index in the world. Only 31 percent women are actively involved in labour force as opposed the 91 percent male representation. In most African countries, girls and women continue to experience discrimination in social practices and legal rights. Research has shown that only about 18 percent of women have land titles in countries like Nigeria and Zambia. Also in over 40 countries, discrimination is practiced, making women susceptible to unpaid labour and sexual harassment. This increases the risk of extreme poverty for households, especially the ones supported by women

Climate change

This is particularly common in the Northeastern parts of Africa which accounts for about 30 percent of the total African population. The region is not favorable for farming or fishing due to poor climate and the adverse geographical conditions. Poverty can thrive in these countries also due to their vulnerability to natural disasters. For example, the drought that hit East Africa in 2011-2012 reduced the GDP of the countries affected by at least 30 percent and caused over 9 million people to be homeless and hungry.

SPRINGFIELD - Water continues to rise in some parts of Livingston Parish as Tropical Depression Beta brews in the Gulf.

The storm surge produced wind speeds up 30 mph, causing flooding along the immediate coasts of the Gulf, Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain. Livingston Parish officials say the water has risen a few feet in just 24 hours.

Along the Tickfaw River, you can find high water signs, roadways submerged in water, and businesses that were forced to close because of the flooding.

Cameron Ferachi, a resident in the Terry Harbor neighborhood, says it floods every time a storm comes their way.

""I need a boat to get to and from my truck,"" Ferachi said.

Ferachi's camp sits at the end of a flooded road. To avoid pushing water into homes or damage to his vehicle, he and his best friend Mike have come up with a solution. They kayak to and from their trucks, which are parked at the end of the street.

Paddling up and down the roads they usually travel down in a vehicle is not a situation they're excited to be in.

""When the water comes up, you get people out here sightseeing, pushing water in front of everybody. It really sucks,"" Ferachi said.

These conditions are so inconvenient for some locals, like Ferachi, that they plan to move away.

""I'm actually moving Oct. 13 to get away from the flooding. I can't deal with it anymore,"" Ferachi said from his kayak.

In the meantime, flash flood warnings and advisories remain active in the area through Wednesday, Sept. 23.

Livingston Parish officials say they will continue to monitor the area. If you are in need of sand or sandbags, supplies are available at your local fire department.

The Livingston Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness released the following list of roads with high water as of Tuesday, Sept. 22.

Description of the disaster

On March 11, 2020, the Egyptian Meteorological Authority - stated that the situation during the period 12 – 14 March 2020 will witness heavy rains with potential floods. The government has appealed the citizens not to leave their homes and closed several major roads between the provinces, disrupting government, public and private sectors.

On 11 March 2020, the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) issued an emergency alert and activated its Central Emergency Operations Center (EOC) as well as the Emergency Operations Rooms at the Branches.

The continued severe weather, including heavy rain, strong winds and thunderstorms caused widespread flooding across Egypt, killing at least 40 people. According to Ministry of Social Solidarity (MoSS), 10 people died and more than 400 injured in Cairo, three people died and five were injured in Qena Governorate (central Egypt). The remaining fatalities occurred in Giza, Ismailia, Sharkeia, New Valley, Menofia, and South Sinai Governorates, 12.

The train service was suspended nationwide, as heavy rain caused a train collision in northern Giza, injuring 13 people. The official figures reported by the MoSS on the number of people affected by the floods in the country estimates 20,000 people (4,000 families).

As the rest of the affected people are located in various areas within the governorates, MoSS and some local NGOs have conducted the needs assessment in those affected areas. Several key highways and some public infrastructure, including seaports and international airports were closed. Schools and government offices remained closed on 13 and 14 March 2020.

Summary of response

The actions taken by the ERC to respond to the disaster:

After the government’s declaration of the emergency alert, ERC activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC has remained open 24/7 for any emergency and to follow up on all activities of the DREF.

Additionally, 100 ERTs in 27 branches were activated with an average of 500 volunteers mobilized.

ERC supported the evacuation of 684 people into the assembly points. There were 2,926 people hosted in 19 evacuation centers in Cairo, Giza, Beni Suef and Faiyum.

ERC also supported the evacuation of 38 migrants to move to an evacuation center in “6th of October” school.

They obtained hygiene kits, hot meals, clothes, blankets, mattresses and pillows.

2,247 people were assisted by ERC with First Aid services and received blankets, mattresses, pillows, clothes, hygiene kits and hot meals.",2021-01-23 08:00:00+00:00,"['eoc', 'floods', 'epoa', 'egypt', 'center', 'moss', 'flash', 'erc', 'heavy', 'n', 'giza', 'plan', 'closed', 'operations', 'evacuation', 'final', 'report', 'emergency', 'mdreg015']",Egypt,news article,English

Heavy rains have caused extensive flooding in Chad, Niger and Nigeria since the onset of rainy seasons in June. Chads rainy season, expected to last until October, is the heaviest in the past 30 years (OCHA 25/08/2020). Flooding in Niger has affected almost twice the estimated population. Flooding in Nigeria is less widespread than in 2019, but is still significant (NIHSA 06/2020; OCHA 21/07/2020).

Almost 60% of all affected people and over half of reported deaths from the three countries are in Niger, the country most affected by floods (UNHCR 15/09/2020). Flooding has affected more than 516,000 people across all eight regions, and resulted in at least 71 deaths (UNHCR 17/09/2020; OCHA 24/09/2020). Nigeria is at risk of crossborder flooding, given it is downstream from other flood-affected countries along the Niger River basin, including Niger (HNO 12/2019).

In all three countries, heavy rainfall and flash floods have resulted in the widespread destruction of shelters, driving displacement. Emergency shelters are overcrowded and unsanitary, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection and the spread of water-borne diseases (IOM 1/09/2020; OCHA 07/09/2020).

The Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region complicates flood relief efforts and increases protection concerns for highly vulnerable displaced populations in all three countries. The situation is most severe in northeast Nigeria, where over 2.7 million people are displaced and 10.6 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, especially food, shelter and WASH (OCHA 14/09/2020; UNHCR 31/07/2020). Additionally, cross-border violence from Mali affects northwest Niger and insecurity caused by banditry poses further risks to flood-affected populations in northwest Nigeria.",2020-10-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['ocha', 'affected', 'chad', 'flooding', 'briefing', 'unhcr', 'shelters', '2020', 'countries', 'note', 'nigeria', 'widespread', 'risk', 'niger', '30', 'acaps']",Nigeria,news article,English

(Source: /YouTube) Watch how Abhineet Mishra sends a serious message about the Assam floods. (Source: /YouTube)

There was little to laugh about in the comedy set Mumbai-based Abhineet Mishra did earlier in January this year. Yet the video — on the plight of 15 miners trapped in an illegal rat-hole mine in Meghalaya — went viral. “Comedy means telling jokes, but it also means you take a stand on things,” said the 31-year-old HR professional, who is a comedian by hobby.

On Tuesday, Mishra used his favourite hobby to take a stand again — this time on the devastating floods across the Northeast, particularly Assam.

According to the latest reports, more than 52 lakh have been affected in almost all 33 districts of the state.

“But you guys don’t know about it, right? The media has better things to do.” says Mishra, in the eight-minute long clip.

Like the Meghalaya miners video, Mishra’s new set isn’t performed in front of a live audience either — at the end of the clip, the viewer discovers that the comedian has been addressing an empty room all along.

“Entire districts have been marooned, homes have been swallowed up — but is anyone listening? Do we have the same hashtags as we did for Chennai and Kerala? No, we do not,” said Mishra to indianexpress.com, describing his act as a “symbolic action” to highlight how lakhs of people are suffering in silence.

Growing up in Meghalaya’s Shillong, Mishra feels that the Northeastern states might have numerous stories to tell, but no audience who really wants to hear them. “Why would the jokes from the Northeast be relatable when the entire region is unrelateable?” he asks in the video, which has already garnered more than ten thousand views on YouTube in the past 24 hours.

While Mishra uses dry wit to drive home a few points (“People in Mumbai say ‘My house has a swimming pool.’ So, what’s the big deal, I tell them. ‘Come to Assam during June to August, swimming pools have houses’.”), he ultimately wants to send out one serious message: “Get your act together” he tells the media and politicians.

The video, titled Staying Afloat, was shot in a cafe in Shillong where Mishra is currently visiting his family. Next week, he will do a few comedy shows around Assam. “There’s hardly any preparation that goes into these videos. For example, both the videos were written, performed and uploaded within a span of few hours,” said Mishra, “It’s not like I plan these — if I feel for it, I just do it.”",2019-07-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['mishra', 'youtube', 'video', 'abhineet', 'message', 'floods', 'assam', 'serious', 'watch', 'comedian', 'comedy', 'joke']",India,news article,English

The rising water levels of River Nile, which started in June, have left Obongi Landing Site and the neighbouring Obongi Town Council submerged.

By last Thursday, floods had submerged nearly half of Obongi Town, filling more than 100 homes, the town's main mosque, shops and primary schools.

The water has also cut off the road connecting Obongi to Moyo and Adjumani districts.

""Livestock such as cows, goats and chicken have died in the floods while very many remain stranded,"" Mr Taban Data, the Adjumani Resident District Commissioner (RDC), said at the weekend.

Area leaders and residents say they last experienced such flooding in 1964 when the then Obongi County suffered severe flooding, which submerged up to five kilometres of land from the original banks of River Nile.

The district authorities have warned of a potential rise in the water levels and asked residents in the low-lying areas to vacate.

""The water is claiming where exactly it used to be some years back and we have asked residents to leave that area because no one knows if the water levels may recede soon since the floods have persisted for long now,"" Mr Goffin Gore, the Obongi RDC, said at the weekend.

He added that people started settling on the banks of River Nile that are demarcated as wetlands without authorisation.

According to the district disaster management committee, 118 homesteads with nearly 380 people have been displaced by the floods.

Mr Gore said the district disaster management committee has petitioned the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), seeking its intervention. According to him, flood victims lack basic necessities such as food, clean water and accommodation.

Its path is expected to pass over the northern tip of the Comoros islands on 24 April and continue onward to northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania. It is expected to make landfall in the district of Palma in Mozambique on 25 April...The Global Disaster Alert Coordination System (GDACS) has issued an orange alert for the Cyclone, meaning a medium humanitarian impact is expected based on the storm strength and its forecasted path. According to UNOSAT, the entire population of Comoros (758,339) is within the Cyclone’s windspeed zones, with Grand Comore the primary concern. In Mozambique, more than 747,000 people are living within the Cyclone’s path, mainly in Cabo Delgado Province, including a projected 117,000 living in high wind speed zones. (OCHA, 24 Apr 2019)

The official death toll from the impact of Tropical Cyclone Kenneth in northern Mozambique has risen to 38 people, according to the Government. Nearly 35,000 houses have either been partially destroyed (32,034) or totally destroyed (2,930), according to the Government ... More than 570 mm of rain has been recorded since 25 April in Pemba, the highest in Cabo Delgado. (OCHA, 29 Apr 2019)

More than 27,000 people have been reached with food assistance since Cyclone Kenneth made landfall on 25 April 2019. International deliveries of shelter supplies began to arrive in Pemba on 1 May 2019; more flights are scheduled in the days ahead. The number of people affected by Tropical Cyclone Kenneth has risen to more than 384,800, with an estimated 185,000 people affected in Comoros and at least 199,836 affected in Mozambique. The risk of water-borne diseases is high, with many areas still without access to clean water following the cyclone. (OCHA, 2 May 2019)

From 9 to 17 September, in close coordination with Mozambique’s National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC), IOM DTM (Displacement Tracking Matrix) teams conducted baseline assessments at locality level (localidade), the findings were as follows:

- All the affected population remain within the same locality;

- More than 160,000 people whose homes were affected by shelter damage have stayed inside their locality;

- In Cabo Delgado, reported a displaced population who have not returned to their locality of origin estimated at around 1,000 individuals and 200 households;

This injection of $19.5 million comes at a critical time when aid agencies were running out of funds to continue their life-saving work,” said Toby Lanzer, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan.

This allocation from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund will enable non-governmental organisations and UN agencies to provide:

education for 41,000 school-aged children, integrated with protection, water, sanitation and hygiene services;

shelter and core relief items for 97,800 people;

food and agriculture support for 242,900 people;

therapeutic foods to treat severe acute malnutrition for 30,500 children;

services that help 91,800 people, including children and survivors of gender-based violence.

“I thank the people of Australia, Canada, Germany, Norway, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom who enabled their governments to contribute to the fund, thanks to which we can now help keep alive malnourished children, provide shelter to displaced families and help farmers get back on their feet after the drought,” continued Lanzer.

Heavy rainfalls experienced in the Eastern parts of Uganda in the months of May and June 2019 caused flooding and landside disasters within the Elgon region, directly affecting 569 households (2,845 individuals) in four districts of Bududa, Sironko, Mbale and Butaleja. The landslides in Bududa district caused six (6) deaths, and injuries to 27 persons who were all treated and recovered. Pease refer to the EPoA for details on impact per affected district.

As anticipated, an outbreak of cholera was later confirmed by the Ministry of Health in Bududa district two weeks after the launch of this DREF operation, which affected the same community affected by the landslides. A total of 72 cholera cases, with 3 deaths were recorded (Case Fatality Rate=4.17%). The operation therefore refocussed its strategy towards provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and hygiene behaviours among the affected and other at-risk communities in Bududa, Sironko, Butaleja and Mbale districts. The Ministry of Health later launched Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in Bududa where the operation supported with community mobilization that increased uptake of the vaccine among all at-risk individuals. All these efforts led to rapid interruption of the cholera outbreak spread in Bududa that prevented it from affecting other at-risk areas in neighbouring Manafwa, Namisindwa, Butaleja, Sironko, Mbale and Bulambuli districts.

On 20 June 2019, IFRC launched a DREF operation worth CHF 151,041 to support Uganda Red Cross Society respond to humanitarian needs of 2,845 people affected by landslides and floods disasters in Bududa, Mbale, Butaleja, and Sironko district. The emergency operation successfully ran from June to September 2019, although the heavy rainfall situation was still widespread, which caused fresh flooding events in completely new areas around November 2019, just two months after closure of this operation.",2021-02-24 08:00:00+00:00,"['cholera', 'mdrug042', 'landslides', 'final', 'mbale', 'butaleja', 'sironko', 'operation', 'report', 'dref', 'district', '2019', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'n', 'bududa']",Uganda,news article,English

The image shows an advancing glacier over a stream.

The glacial burst of Raini village of Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on the morning of February 7 has resulted in massive flash flooding. According to reports, 32 bodies have so far been recovered and 206 people are still missing after the natural disaster. Rescue operations by the Indo Tibetan Border Police, Indian Army and NDRF are still on.



The caption of the viral post on Facebook shared by The Northeast Journal reads, ""Pray For Uttarakhand #UttrakhandDisaster #glacier #GlacierBurst"".

Archive of the post can be seen here and here.

Fact Check

BOOM ran a reverse image search on the photograph and found the same image in the gallery of government website, National Science Foundation. The caption states that the image shows a melting glacier in Alaska, Mendenhall Glacier. It further states, ""This photo shows new forests above the shrinking Mendenhall Glacier. It's rare to see a developing forest above a glacier. This picture highlights how these landscapes are rapidly changing.""





Further, we found a blog by Live Science from March 5, 2010 which carried the same image claiming that it is a glacier stream in Alaska. This suggests that the image was clicked more than 10 years ago. BOOM could not independently verify the image, but was able to ascertain that it is not from the recent glacial burst in Uttarakhand.

According to a journal by a blog Adventure Journal, Alaskan glaciers in total lose ice at a rate of around 75 billion metric tons each year - states a 2015 study by the US Geological Survey and University of Alaska, Fairbanks. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), in 2016 summer, glaciers were melting 70 percent faster than the typical rate, due to warming temperatures.

Kerala, famed for its pristine palm-lined beaches and tea plantations, is battered by the monsoon every year but the rains have been particularly severe this season.

Those forced from their homes “have moved to 350 relief camps across the state”, said an official at the Kerala State Disaster Management control room.

The army has been roped in for rescue efforts in Kerala after two days of heavy rain drove authorities to open the shutters of 27 reservoirs to drain out the excess water.

One of the five shutters of a large reservoir in the mountainous Idukki district was opened for the first time in 26 years.

“Our state is in the midst of an unprecedented flood havoc,” Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote in a statement posted on Twitter.

“The calamity has caused immeasurable misery and devastation. Many lives were lost. Hundreds of homes were totally destroyed,” he added, lauding the efforts of rescue teams working in the state from across India.

The US embassy advised its citizens to avoid the areas affected and monitor local media for weather updates.

1034,Drought Sri Lanka,Caribbean: Barbados's garden attractions - Telegraph - Telegraph.co.uk,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/barbados/articles/Caribbean-Barbadoss-garden-attractions/,"One story goes that the first people to glimpse Barbados were Spanish traders, sailing to Brazil. They gave it the Spanish name for “bearded ones” because they saw an island densely wooded with the native banyan or bearded fig trees (Ficus citrifolia), so-named for their thick hanging roots.

How different from our first view of Barbados today, I thought, slumped crossly in a taxi from the airport to my hotel. The tired chorus line of tropical horticulture was all there along the roadside: savagely pruned bougainvillea, garishly splattered crotons, and municipal displays on every roundabout of castor-oil plants and coleus. Standard fare, from Bali to Florida, Mauritius to Barbados.

But once I had arrived at Cobblers Cove and had a soothing drink, my eyes began to open to the charms of the place. This comfortable British-owned hotel has a somewhat Fifties retro quality that makes it ideal for a trip focused on heritage rather than the beach - the lounge is stuffed with photo albums of the original house and gardens, evoking the west coast high life for which it is famous.

The villas are set within a densely planted garden: an example of what has been dubbed “tropical Cotswolds.” Lots of different plants are organised into wavy borders, and shrubs are clipped into tight shapes. So far so Home Counties. But the surroundings ooze a bodacious lushness. All those plants that, in British offices, would wilt on filing cabinets, are on a mission here to grow as huge and green as possible.

Even though Barbados tends to sell itself on beaches, rum punches and swimming with turtles, it has a rich horticultural tradition. It is, after all, a country of fertile soils and a long history of growing sugar cane. From plantation houses of the late 1600s, to Oliver Messel mansions dating from the chic Sixties and Seventies, to more recent public landscape gardens, the island has a range of horticultural hotspots. For this reason, Cobblers Cove is now offering a garden tour package, as owner Hugh Godsal explains:

“We want to attract the kind of guest who wants more than sea, sand and sun. Barbados has an amazing competitive advantage against so many locations. Places like the Maldives and the Seychelles look lovely in photos but, aside from the beach, there is absolutely nothing to do. Most people I know say that such destinations are great the first time, but by the end of a week they are beginning to feel bored. Hardly any go back to the same resort.

“The British in particular are garden-obsessed. What a perfect holiday to mix visits to special and very different gardens, with being pampered in a five-star beachfront hotel.”

I had set myself the independent challenge of finding enough gardens of interest to keep me occupied for four days. (A challenge I later came to regret, as I hardly saw the beach.) At the end of my stay, my impression of Barbados as an environmental burned-out case, dressed up with croton and bouganvillea cliches, had been shot down. The sun, sand and rum punch side of life is there. But if you’ve been to Barbados before and you’d like to see something different, or if you approach travel with just a little curiosity about local traditions and culture, there are gardens here – and gardeners – that will unlock the human history and the natural wonders of the island.

A key contact was Russell Corrie, owner of Nature Care, a garden centre and design business. He builds gardens for the rich and famous and his knowledge of both the natural and social history of Barbados was a huge help - although if you see all the gardens on this list in four days, as we did, you may feel you need another holiday.

Hunte’s Garden and Nursery

As proof that the Bajans take these things seriously, the island’s top-rated attraction on Trip Advisor is a garden owned by Anthony Hunte, a native Bajan whose English ancestors arrived in the 1630s, as indentured servants. The garden is in the centre of the island, about five kilometres from the east coast. Just inside the iron gates, I come across Anthony removing a dead leaf. A huge palm frond has fallen and it takes Anthony and a helper to carry it to the compost heap.

Following on his heels, I soon detect his masterstroke in creating this garden. It is in a sinkhole about 150 feet deep and 500 ft across, a geological curiosity formed by a massive landslip. Hunte took over the site in 1997 and spent two years making a garden in the crater before he opened to the public.

The atmosphere is one of controlled, primitive exuberance. “We aim to stay just one step ahead of the vegetation,” Anthony explains. Plants cascade down the slopes - gingers, aralias, coleus, impatiens and taro, and gather in waist-high drifts at the bottom.

The sides of the giant bowl are terraced with coral stone walls and intricate pathways. Some lead to dead-ends: a fountain shrine, or an overlook with a stone seat. It is a magical and atmospheric place.

The reward for toiling slowly back to the top is the chance to explore Anthony’s nursery and the picturesquely ruined outbuildings he has turned into a home. He joins guests on the verandah: the perfect spot to sip a lemonade and look out over the crater. Now in his seventies (check), Hunte has the air of a slightly mischievous bon viveur, but he is Bajan to the core. “I took up gardening in my twenties,” he told me. “I learned from my grandmother, who always grew plants for church fairs.”

With collections of family pictures and spoof mementoes, a piano concerto tinkling in the background, this is a warm and highly individual welcome that helps to explain why the garden is such a hit. Flora and Foxy, two fluffy little rescue dogs, follow Anthony everywhere. He assures me they can take visitors on a garden tour themselves, should he be unavailable.

Andromeda Botanical Garden

Iris Bannochie (1914 –1988) is renowned for her botanical knowledge (she won the RHS Veitch medal, its highest accolade for plantsmanship) but is mostly remembered by locals for her eccentricities (and liking for a drink). She made this garden at Bathsheba, on the east coast, on land that had been in her family since 1740. The site is littered with huge boulders; it is named after the Greek legend of Andromeda, a maiden who was chained to a rock. Iris donated the garden to the Barbados National Trust after her death.

Bathsheba, on the east coast of Barbados

Iris travelled the world, always looking out for new plants. More than 1,200 species are represented in the garden; about 75 per cent of them, and 90 per cent of the palms, were introduced to Barbados by her.

As I wander around, it is the sea views and the trees that really strike me. Near the entrance is a huge schleffera, with octopus-like fruits that attract flocks of native yellow breasts. Further along is a common screwpine (Pandanus utilis), a variegated form from Sri Lanka, once used in basket-making. I’ve noticed it lining the roadsides, usually ragged and forlorn. Here it spreads out, supported by a mass of prop roots, and makes a firework explosion of stripy foliage.

There are beautiful breadfruit trees, introduced by Captain Bligh (of 'Bounty’ fame) to feed the slaves, or so legend has it. And the fish poison tree (Barringtonia asiatica), which is bat- and moth-pollinated. The seeds are traditionally ground up and used to stun fish in freshwater streams. Everywhere a climber (Petrea volubilis) from central America scrambles about, with flowers in purple or white. It is known locally as sandpaper plant because the rough leaves were once used to smooth furniture.

Andromeda is still a centre of learning. Gardeners from the Eden Project in Cornwall are arriving soon to begin a classification project. There are also plans to start a native garden: the forests were cut down over 250 years ago to clear land for sugar cane, which explains why the famous bearded fig is now a rarity, even at Andromeda.

Fisher Pond House

While waiting for John Chandler to answer the bell I admire a fine pair of tree ferns flanking the door of his elegant plantation house. South American macaws squawk in the garden, and glittering chandeliers hang in reception. There’s a whiff of glamour in the air.

I soon learn why. John was a good friend of the late Colin Tennant, owner of Mustique. They got to know each other because John used to own the Ocean View hotel, a stopover where anyone (who was anyone) would shack up in luxury for a night or two en route to that most exclusive of islands. He gave up the hotel and moved to Fisher Pond House 16 years ago, but his reputation still draws the great and good for open-house lunches during high season.

The garden is organised as a gallery of spacious rooms. Theatrically decayed statues and fountains bought at local auctions pop up in strategic places. The old driveway is now a paved promenade flanked by John’s “English” borders: a riot of busy Lizzies and petunias mingled with gloriosa vine, roses and hibiscus.

John’s ethos is typified by a curlicued iron umbrella stand, which once belonged to Randolph Hearst: an accessory for the vines dangling over the portico. Coral stone walls and terraces ripple out from the house. Lunch is served against a background of frog croaks and birdsong, rather than breaking waves. Book in advance.

Bentham’s House

Helen Knighton’s home is a place of dedicated plantsmanship. She’s a personality most British gardeners would recognise - a small nursery owner with encyclopedic plant knowledge and firm opinions, generous with her advice (she runs a blog, My Rustic Bajan Garden) and her plants.

An old plantation house, Bentham’s majors in waterlilies and anything else that Helen is currently interested in. Between polytunnels, shade houses and borders, this adds up to a lot of plants; she seems to have grown everything.

Noticeable are the raised concrete ponds filled with colourful waterlilies. The 2ft-high walls keep out frogs, which are not the quiet sort we are used to: “At night it sounded as though someone was mowing the grass,” says Helen.

In this plot, giant plants rub shoulders with experiments and collections. The driveway is dominated by an enormous tamarind tree with ferns growing in the folds of its trunk. Beside this, in a pot, sits an anthurium from the Amazon, like a houseplant prop from Honey I Shrunk the Kids. In another spot is one of the best Bismarckii palms I’ve ever seen.

I notice a bronze-leaved ground cover with mauve flowers. “Martinique Kofia,” she says. “It’s not green, so not popular with clients,” she adds with a sigh.

Sugarcane fields in south west Barbados

Windblown, St Philip

The organisation that draws all these different gardens and gardeners together is the Barbados Horticultural Society (BHS), which wins gold at Chelsea Flower Show every year.

Orson Daisley, a retired police officer, will be its president in 2013. He and his wife Madeline are based at the appropriately named Windblown on the south coast, away from the tourist hotspots and not an easy place to garden. They have to deal with a keen salt wind, sandy thin soil and only 40 inches of rainfall a year. This is a niche for a different plant palette from the lush inland look. They have created an immaculate garden, using drought-tolerant Mediterranean plants. It will be on the BHS open gardens tour this season, an annual event (see box) and big weekend in the social calendar, along with the BHS show, also in January.

The Daisleys only moved in six years ago (having worked in Bermuda for many years), but lost no time getting to grips with the garden. A system for collecting rainwater was a must, and Orson planted a windbreak oleander hedge with a groundcover of variegated zeezee plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia, familiar to us as a tough houseplant) as a salt-tolerant barrier. It has done a quick job of sheltering the garden.

As with many gardening marriages, the couple have separate areas. Orson claims the vegetable garden, while Madeline has colonised sunny corners with her prize-winning collection of cacti and succulents. She has sculpted mini desertscapes, using variegated crown of thorns, sansieveras, and desert roses with their bulbous trunks.

1820,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Solution for Kenya's flooding ahead of rainy season – New Business Ethiopia - New Business Ethiopia,https://newbusinessethiopia.com/nbe-blog/solution-for-kenyas-flooding-ahead-of-rainy-season/,"The annual rainy season in March – June, in conjunction with climate change, is a major concern for Kenyans across the country. Dirty flood waters rendering the roads unusable, and submerging residential areas, are expected again this year, and experts warn that better waste management, urban planning and warning systems are needed to help protect citizens.



So says Simon Thomas, an international consultant and board member of Megapipes Solutions Limited which provides sustainable stormwater, sanitation and flood alleviation solutions throughout Kenya and East Africa. “The lack of adequate drainage and sanitation systems in Kenya has been well documented, however, not enough attention is being paid to how the sewerage systems have been designed and set up, or where excess water ends up,” he says. “Compounding the problem, there are multiple settlements that do not have adequate sewerage and sanitation services that edge onto Nairobi’s three main rivers, namely Mathare, Ngong and Nairobi.”







According to him, citizens who live in flood-prone regions are in danger of losing their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives. “And it’s always those living under the poverty line that are most vulnerable and need the most help and support in the event of such a disaster.”

He says in the past few years, many regions in Kenya have had above-normal rainfall, resulting in flooding across the country. “To lessen the potential impact of floods, the government has to map out and implement strategic plans to address flood disaster risk. These plans must pinpoint the projects and initiatives that are needed to manage and prevent floods.”

Currently, many densely populated formal and informal settlements in Kenya employ open drainage channels, which are used to discharge rainwater, to address the problem. However, Thomas says while drains can help prevent flooding, when they are left open, they can easily become clogged with solid and domestic waste, making the problem far worse.

“Moreover, multiple environmental hazards go hand in hand with open drainage channels, including groundwater contamination, a slew of easily preventable diseases, a lessening of soil productivity, and the contamination of vegetables and crops.”

Unfortunately, building exposed drainage systems has been around for decades and has become the norm. “Various regions in Kenya are prone to flooding, and at the same time, are notorious for blocked drainage systems. Also, town planners, do not seem to grasp the fact that open drains use land, which takes away space for pavements and walkways, forcing pedestrians, onto the streets and putting them in danger of being hit by motorists.”

The bottom line? Thomas says that if Kenya is to achieve its Millennium Development Goal for increasing access to water and sanitation this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.







Thomas says a wider implementation of properly engineered and sustainable drainage initiatives is required, which mitigate the effects of large amounts of rainfall coming down in urban areas. While other solutions exist, including putting in additional drainage ditches, these are unable to cope with significant rainfall or extreme weather.

However, it’s not all doom and gloom. “At Megapipes, we understand there is an urgent requirement for better systems that would be able to cope with larger volumes of waste and stormwater, particularly in fast-growing urban environments. With this in mind, we conducted studies into new large diameter pipe technology, already widely used with big success in other parts of the world. Megapipes Solutions made the visionary decision to opt for Weholite HDPE structured wall pipes, manholes, chambers and tanks, which address Kenya’s need for sustainable water systems.”",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['solutions', 'waste', 'season', 'kenya', 'rainy', 'kenyas', 'water', 'ahead', 'ethiopia', 'thomas', 'business', 'drainage', 'open', 'systems', 'solution', 'flooding', 'urban', 'sanitation']",Kenya,news article,English
1177,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Flood water in front of Renaissance Dam will not affect Egypt's water security level: statement - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/flood-will-not-affect-egypt-water-security-level/,"The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation said on Wednesday that water abundance seen in front of the Renaissance Dam is due to the high level of construction in the dam, which led to the formation of a lake, as the amount of water flooding exceeds the drainage, and will not affect Egypt’s water security level.

“The Blue Nile flood is known to last from June until the end of September each year.

The river receives great inflow of water and then later on in the year the flow drops,” Hossam al-Imam, spokesperson for the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation said in a statement.

He reiterated that the quantities of water present in that lake do not represent any damage to Egypt’s water quota.

Egypt fears the dam will affect its historic Nile water share of 55 billion square meters, which it has had access to since the historic 1959 agreement with Sudan.

Ethiopia, meanwhile, has reassured Cairo that its water share will not be affected.

In 2011, Ethiopia started construction on the Renaissance Dam over the Blue Nile River, one of the major sources of the water that forms the River Nile downstream.

The dam is expected to be ready in 2017.

Ethiopians see it as is a great national project and a means of overcoming poverty.

Earlier in June, the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Ministry official spokesperson Ahmed Abu Zeid asserted that Egypt’s water security is non-negotiable, saying that it is considered a red line that no one can approach.

When completed, the dam will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa, and one of the largest of its kind in the world. It was estimated in 2016 that the process of filling the dam with water (approximately 74 billion cubic meters) may take between five to 15 years.

According to global calculators of water scarcity, Egypt is already classified as being a water-stressed country, while Ethiopia is classified as being on the brink of water stress.",2017-07-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'security', 'water', 'level', 'spokesperson', 'ministry', 'dam', 'affect', 'nile', 'share', 'resources', 'renaissance', 'statement', 'egypts', 'river']",Egypt,news article,English

Zimbabwe’s government said it has secured combined loans of $108 million from the Export-Import Bank of China and Export-Import Bank of India to fix its power crisis.

The state-run Herald newspaper reports that the government concluded the loan agreements in the last few months.

The loans according to government officials should significantly help to the country’s power generation projects and broadband expansion.

Areas to receive boost and upgrade according to the government are Bulawayo and Hwange.

Zimbabwe has been experiencing power crisis since May this year, with parts of the country without power for several hours daily.

South Africa has tried to assist but largely unsuccessful due to it’s own power crisis.

The reported impact of power crisis according to the business community in Zimbabwe is around $200m in lost revenue.

Declining water levels in Lake Kariba have plunged most parts of the country into darkness for longer periods per day.

Water levels continue to decline in Zimbabwe’s Lake Kariba which is a source for power generation hydro-electric dam in Kariba.

The government has blamed the low levels of water on a major drought.

652,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"To save forests, cut some trees down, scientists say - Science Magazine",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/save-forests-cut-some-trees-down-scientists-say,"To save forests, cut some trees down, scientists say

Forests are feeling the heat. In places like the American West, rising temperatures and drought mean less water for trees, sometimes shriveling swaths of woodland. Now, scientists have found that thinning early in forest growth creates tougher trees that can endure climate change. What’s more, these thinned forests can suck carbon out of the air just as fast as dense forests.

“When it comes to carbon sequestration and climate change adaptation, we can have our cake and eat it too,” says Andrew Larson, forest ecologist at the University of Montana in Missoula and author of the new study. “It’s a win-win.”

As trees grow, they convert carbon dioxide to food and store it in their leaves, trunks, and roots. U.S. forests capture between 10% to 20% of U.S. emissions each year. But if trees get too crowded, they compete for light and water—and stressed trees are more susceptible to drought and insect attacks. Removing some trees can ease the competition, letting the remaining trees grow big and healthy. But scientists worry that removing trees can reduce forest carbon storage. These worries, however, are based mostly on models and short-term studies.

To see if the climate trade-off truly exists, scientists tapped into a long-term experiment in northwestern Montana. In 1961, U.S. Forest Service officials started the experiment in a young forest of western larch—a conifer common in the Inland Northwest. The forest was broken up into plots. In some plots, the 8-year-old trees were thinned from tens of thousands per hectare down to 494 per hectare (2.5 acres). These trees grew thick trunks and broad canopies. Other plots were left alone, and the teeming trees grew tall and skinny as they competed for sunlight. The original study was rooted in an interest in growing timber rapidly. But the scientists at the University of Montana sprouted a new question: How did tree density affect carbon storage?

To find out, they measured tree height, diameter, and width of branches to estimate the amount of carbon stored. They also calculated the carbon contained in other plants, dead wood, and forest floor debris.

Total carbon was nearly the same in both forests. The un-thinned forest had more trees, but the thinned forest compensated with bigger trees, the team reports this month in Forest Ecology and Management. Larson was surprised by how quickly the thinned trees had caught up.

“There are very few experiments that have ever been set up to test [carbon storage] directly,” says Mark Harmon, forest ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, who was not involved in the research. Long-term studies like this are useful to validate climate models, he says. “I think we need more examples like this.”

The key is early thinning, before trees start to fight over water and light. The remaining trees grow rapidly. Thinning treatments on mature trees haven’t had such success, because the leftover trees were already weakened by competition. “The later you wait, the more impact you’re going to have on carbon storage,” Harmon says.

Climate change may bring more severe droughts to the West. Big trees are more drought-resilient, and their thick bark can resist fire better than can young trees. Also, they are healthier and can fight off disease and insects. When the large larches do die, they become homes for woodpeckers and lynx.

The results can be applied to forests that have been clear cut, boosting the recovery of trees, says forest ecologist Michael Schaedel, lead author of the study. As a forester for the Nature Conservancy in Missoula, he’s thinned similar young larch forests. But, until now, he hasn’t fully understood how the practice will affect them in the long run. “Having an opportunity to travel through time to the present day—54 years later—and see what the effect of those treatments is is invaluable.”

There are still concerns over how thinning impacts other species. In Montana, snowshoe hares—preyed on by the threatened Canada lynx—inhabit young western larch forests. Thinning in these forests could reduce hare habitat and in turn food for lynx. Still, Larson thinks thinning could become a useful tool for addressing climate change. “I think there’s no more pressing issue in natural resource management.”",2017-04-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['scientists', 'thinned', 'forests', 'carbon', 'climate', 'montana', 'trees', 'thinning', 'cut', 'forest', 'young', 'save', 'say']",Ghana,news article,English

Lucknow: A disgusting incident from Lucknow came into light on Sunday when a video of four policemen fighting with each other, allegedly over share of bribe, went viral on social media.

Eyewitnesses said the fight was over division of bribe money that was collected by the policemen from trucks and local vendors of the area.

In the viral video, two policemen are seen throwing blows and jostling with each other in public, while the other two are trying to separate them but failed to do so. The four were later joined by a fifth policeman who also made an attempt to break the fight.

The local police, however, denied the reports of bribe being the reason for the fight.

Senior Superintendent of Lucknow Police Manjil Saini said that the brawl between policeman Vijendra Yadav and the Home Guard was over clearing the traffic jam in Itauja area in the outskirts of Lucknow.

""This is not true at all. Moreover the video is nearly two-three days old,"" Saini commented on the allegations of fighting over share of bribe.

While Virendra Yadav has been suspended, a letter has been written to Homeguard directorate seeking action against the Home Guard, SSP Manjil Saini said.

1483,FL-2019-000179-CAN,'We have no choice': Flooded Gatineau residents mull buyouts - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/gatineau-residents-quebec-flood-buyouts-1.5144128,"Some Gatineau residents say they're tired of living through flood after flood and want to know more about how they can be compensated if they leave their homes.

Around 300 people turned out to a meeting with provincial officials Tuesday night to get a sense of how a new provincial program will compensate them to either make repairs to their homes or walk away from them.

""I lived through it … two years ago. I'm living it through it now. I don't want to go through this again,"" said Louise David, who put $47,000 worth of work into her home on rue René in Pointe-Gatineau after the 2017 floods.

Others in her neighbourhood weren't allowed to rebuild, with the city holding public consultations on what it should do with that land this winter.

After two floods in three years, David said she doesn't believe she'll be able to sell her home again and plans to walk away.

""Give me the money and I'll run to the bank. I'll buy a condo, very high up,"" she said.

""[$250,000] in my pocket is better than zero in my pocket and having to live through this again.""

Louise David says she's ready to walk away from her home and is hoping for a buyout from the province so she can move to higher ground. (Kimberley Molina/CBC)

Under a new provincial program, the Quebec government is offering up to $100,000 to homeowners for flood damage compensation or a $200,000 buyout for them to move outside flood areas.

The province can also compensate residents an extra $50,000 for the land around their homes, said Mathieu Lévesque, the MNA for Chapleau.

Anyone who chooses money to repair their home won't be eligible for future renovation compensation, he said, though they could be eligible for the buyout if another flood occurs.

Appointments with claims officer begin Wednesday in temporary offices at the Campeau Arena on rue des Sables.

MNA Mathieu Lévesque says the repair and buyout are one-time offers, though if you take the repair money it doesn't stop you from taking a buyout in another flood. (Raphael Tremblay/Radio-Canada)

Louise Duplessis is also looking for a buyout for her home on boulevard Hurtubise.

She said she had planned to walk away from her property after the 2017 floods but a deal with the government for a buyout never materialized.

She's now been told she'll have to restart her claim.

""We have to start at zero once again and we do not have the capacity or the energy to redo all this,"" she said.

Will I be penalized because I was looking forward and trying to prevent more damages? I don't know yet. - Louise Goneau, spent $100,000 to help floodproof her home on Boulevard Hurtubise after the 2017 floods

Her home had 11 cracks in the foundation two years ago and she expects the damage this time around to be significantly worse.

She's lived in Gatineau since 1991 but doesn't know where she'll go if she gets a buyout, but knows she can't stay where she lives now.

Her home needs to be lifted and the foundation repaired for $260,000, she said, far more than the $100,000 she might be eligible for.

""We have no choice. At my age I cannot start with a debt of $100,000 or $60,000 and that's how much damage I have.""

Louise and Benoit Duplessis left their home on boulevard Hurtubise last month. They say they were offered a buyout after the 2017 floods, which was never finalized, and are now being told they will have to repeat the process to request a new buyout. (Kimberley Molina/CBC)

Others want to know if the preventative measures they put in place since 2017 will be covered under the province's new plan.

""The water was literally hitting our house all around and I had no water damage inside,"" said Louise Goneau, who also lives on boulevard Hurtubise.

She's put $100,000 into floodproofing her home with pumps and special cement, but wonders if her foresight will be recognized and reimbursed since she's costing the province less money this time around.

""Will I be penalized because I was looking forward and trying to prevent more damages? I don't know yet.""

Since her home was saved this flood, she only plans to make a claim for some preventative measures such as extra pumps and building a dike.",2019-05-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['money', 'residents', '2017', 'shell', 'buyout', 'buyouts', 'mull', 'gatineau', 'flood', 'choice', 'flooded', 'walk', 'damage', 'boulevard', '100000', 'know']",Canada,news article,English
1756,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Severe floods hit Timor-Leste capital Dili in Easter disaster - Asia Pacific Report,https://asiapacificreport.nz/2021/04/04/severe-floods-hit-timor-leste-capital-dili-in-easter-disaster/,"Asia Pacific Report newsdesk

Much of the Timor-Leste capital of Dili has been heavily flooded with rivers bursting their banks after three days of heavy rain over the Easter weekend, say disaster relief officials.

The floodwaters in some parts of the city have reached many metres deep with houses on the banks of the Comoro River being dragged into the raging waters, reports Lusa news agency.

The Civil Protection agency told Lusa that it was difficult to take full stock of the situation and determine the full numbers of casualties because ′′the whole city is a disaster zone”.

However, some reports say at least 11 people have died. The floods have come on top of a city already reeling from a serious covid-19 pandemic crisis.

Part of the oceanside Avenue de Portugal, where some embassies are located, has been seriously flooded with the waters entering the homes, including the Lusa office.

Several residents, including Portuguese citizens, have already been forced to leave their homes in spite of the difficulties of moving around Dili because of the floodwaters.

The high tide overnight and large volume of river water has raised the levels across almost the city, with civil protection teams, firefighters and government emergency services desperately spread around the city trying to help people.

Throughout the early morning residents in several parts of the city sent photos and videos to Lusa attesting to the fury of the floodwaters in some places.

An unknown number of families have lost their homes, with several areas – including the Presidential Palace compound – being flooded.

There is also concern about two places used to isolate patients suffering from covid-19 – the Vera Cruz Centre in Dili and the Tasitolu area.

Over the past few days, weather services have warned of the risk of heavy rainfall in several parts of the country, prominently on the north coast, due to the effects of a low pressure system, located on the Indonesian western part of the island of Timor.

Heavy rains had already caused problems in several municipalities in the country in recent days, with reports of destroyed homes and other infrastructure affected, including roads and bridges.

Some residents say the rainfall and situation in Dili today was significantly more serious than last year on 13 March 2020 when flooding affected tens of thousands of people in the capital.

Older residents have told Lusa they do not remember heavy flooding like this in Dili since the 1970s.",2021-04-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['homes', 'including', 'residents', 'say', 'disaster', 'hit', 'city', 'heavy', 'dili', 'capital', 'reports', 'severe', 'timorleste', 'easter', 'parts', 'lusa', 'floods']",India,news article,English
2443,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Signs of collapse across Brazil as Covid spirals out of control. Bolsonaro seems to have little response - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/03/27/signs-of-collapse-across-brazil-as-covid-spirals-out-of-control-bolsonaro-seems-to-have-little-response/,"National-World

You can hear the frustration in the nurse’s voice as he narrates the video, walking closer to an open window.

“You have to be an engineer to make this work,” he says. “You have to be like MacGyver.”

The video moves past a woman on oxygen, the tube running down from her nose to the gurney she’s sitting on and, eventually, out that open window.

It runs to another window, the green tube swinging in the breeze above an open courtyard a half-dozen stories below. The tube ends at an oxygen hookup in the wall of the other room.

This is the only way that woman, a Covid-19 patient at this hospital in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia, can get oxygen. The room where the oxygen source is located is so overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients, she has to sit in what is otherwise a hallway, her life-saving oxygen precariously fed to her.

The scene is a microcosm of what is playing out across Brazil right now amid a brutal and out-of-control wave of Covid-19.

On Thursday night, Brazil’s Health Ministry reported the gruesome figure of more than 100,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed in a single day, the country’s highest such figure since the pandemic began.

So far, a total of 303,462 people have died in the country from the virus, according to official data.

But it’s the seven-day averages that paint an even bleaker picture.

At 15,963 deaths from March 19-25 and 14,610 deaths in the previous week, those are the highest such numbers of the pandemic so far and they are trending in the wrong direction.

Brazil has recorded roughly 24% of all coronavirus deaths worldwide over the past two weeks, according to JHU data.

A Covid-19 variant, P1, continues to rip through the country as experts agree it is more contagious and potentially produces more severe illness than previous strains. Even younger people are not spared.

Of Brazil’s 26 states plus its federal district, only one or two on any given day have ICU occupancy rates below 80%.

More than half are above 90%, which means if the healthcare systems haven’t yet collapsed already in those states, they are at imminent risk of doing so.

Health systems have been inundated with patients they can no longer adequately take care of due to a critical lack of space and supplies.

As Brazil suffers through its worst days of this pandemic so far, there are signs of collapse at every level of the healthcare system in nearly every state across the country.

Signs of collapse

First responders, hospital personnel and even cemetery employees have told CNN they’ve been brought to their knees by this latest wave.

“It’s a war scenario,” said paramedic Luis Eduardo Pimentel in São Paulo. “I can barely describe what I’m seeing, it is so sad what is happening to the country.”

He described non-stop Covid-19 calls, unnecessary deaths, and hospitals so overburdened, they take supplies from wherever they can.

CNN spoke to him after his shift ended, earlier than expected, after a hospital took the gurney he had brought his Covid-19 patient in on — the hospital had run out of beds.

Other examples are myriad.

In a video given to CNN last week, 12 ambulances with patients inside are seen waiting outside a São Paulo hospital for bedspace to open up inside.

CNN visited a Covid-19-designated hospital on Thursday that had stopped accepting patients because they had run out of room. In a section normally reserved for 16 semi-intensive care patients, nearly double that amount were being treated.

Several had already been intubated and would normally have sent to an ICU, but no such space existed in the hospital.

When ICU rates hit 90%, as they did in Sao Paulo on Thursday, they’re effectively full, said Geraldo Reple Sobrinho, the state’s President of the Council of Municipal Health Secretaries. “In reality, that means total bed occupancy because every time there is a patient who is discharged or dies, you need time to clean this bed and change the equipment. It takes four, five hours.”

In the meantime, more and more patients keep dying. On several recent days, there have been so many deaths that burials in São Paulo cemeteries are happening every few minutes.

Crematoriums have not been able to keep up. In a video shared with CNN, at least two dozen coffins can be seen waiting to be cremated — the demand is about three times what the facility can handle in a single day.

The government response … or lack of it

As his country has reeled during this latest outbreak, President Jair Bolsonaro has yet to take any significant steps to try and implement a coordinated national response.

He did deliver a televised address to the country on Tuesday night, saying 2021 would be the “year of the vaccine.”

But critics derided the 3-minute speech as a half-hearted attempt at a public-relations rescue on a day where Brazil set its own record for most coronavirus deaths recorded in a single day.

The federal government appeared to commit another own goal the following day, with the Health Ministry announcing that it would require more information from municipalities reporting Covid-19 victim information.

That sparked immediate concern that the additional requirements would lower the number of Covid-19 deaths that were reported.

Those concerns appeared to be immediately justified as Wednesday’s reported death toll was nearly 1,200 fewer than the previous day.

By the end of the day Wednesday, the Health Ministry suspended the new reporting requirements after severe backlash from states and the public.

Absent a coordinated federal response, any restrictions put in place designed to stem the spread of the virus have been left to individual states.

Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais are among the states that have implemented nightly curfews, even as the Bolsonaro administration filed suit in Brazil’s Supreme Court declaring that only the federal government has the right to impose such restrictions.

The court this week sided with the states, however, calling Bolsonaro’s argument “totalitarian.”",2021-03-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['paulo', 'collapse', 'covid', 'little', 'response', 'são', 'patients', 'brazil', 'spirals', 'control', 'video', 'hospital', 'bolsonaro', 'states', 'signs', 'day', 'oxygen', 'covid19', 'deaths']",Brazil,news article,English

The body was recovered a day after middle school students and teachers visiting hot springs in the area were swept away by the torrent. Civil defense officials have said the surge, caused by heavy rains, carried some for several kilometers (miles) toward the Dead Sea.

Mustafa al-Basaiah, the director general of the kingdom’s Civil Defense, said that 13 of the dead and 21 of about three dozen injured were middle school students. Several people are still feared missing, he said.

A complex rescue operation involving helicopters, divers, sniffer dogs and hundreds of searchers had continued into the night Thursday.

Searches resumed after daybreak Friday.

GUWAHATI: When 409 inmates were shifted from the flooded Dhubri jail to a girls’ college nearby on Monday night, an undertrial accused of rape smelled an opportunity. In the wee hours of Wednesday, just a day after the shifting was complete, 28-year-old Hajifur Rahman broke open the grill of a window and swam to freedom. The Assam police DIG (Western Range) said investigation is on and a manhunt has been launched.

All the prisoners of the Dhubri district jail were shifted to the Dhubri Girls’ college building, which was notified as the temporary jail after floodwaters inundated the original jail campus, on Monday night. When the college’s ground floor got flooded too, the prisoners — including eight women — were kept in various classrooms-turnedprison cells on the first floor.

“Rahman managed to flee through a window of the college building. Though a security blanket was put in place after the prisoners were shifted, a college building can never be as secure as a prison. He managed to break a window grill and flee in the darkness,” said a police officer, adding that Rahman hails from Chagalchara Part II village in Dhubri district and was arrested on rape charges in 2018.

The police said the rising levels of the Brahmaputra, a stormy night and ‘zero’ electricity were some of the major difficulties faced by them at the designated jail campus. “Lack of electricity in the area has made it very difficult for personnel at night. We only had torches and other basic equipment. We had roped in an additional police company from Panbari to avoid a situation like this, but even that did not prove to be enough,” added the officer. Raunak Ali Hazarika, Assam police DIG (Western Range), said, “We have registered a sou motu case to find out the cause behind the prisoner’s escape and to fix responsibility. A manhunt is on to nab him.” He added that the flood situation was likely to improve and all the prisoners could soon be taken back to their original prison cells.

1762,FL-2021-000030-IDN,US: Florida governor urgently working to prevent 'catastrophic flood' in Tampa area - DW (English),https://www.dw.com/en/us-florida-governor-urgently-working-to-prevent-catastrophic-flood-in-tampa-area/a-57100510,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said Sunday his administration is working urgently to prevent a ""catastrophic flood"" near the major city of Tampa, following the leak of a toxic wastewater reservoir in the region. The pond at the Piney Point phosphate plant in central Florida could potentially release 340 million gallons (1.3 billion liters) of toxic water within minutes, threatening nearby homes and causing a potential environmental crisis in the area.

""What we are looking at now is trying to prevent and respond to, if need be, a real catastrophic flood situation,"" DeSantis said during a press conference, after surveying the site by air. The Florida governor declared a state of emergency on Saturday for Manatee County, where the plant is located.

Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes said this week the reservoir holds ""waste less conducive to life on land… and in sea."" Manatee County officials had ordered the evacuation of around 300 homes in the area on Saturday, due to ""further collapse of phosphogypsum stacks.""

Phosphogypsum is a byproduct of fertilizer from phosphate rock, and is considered to be weakly radioactive.

Why is the reservoir leaking?

The large reservoir at the Piney Point plant is leaking most likely due to a tear in the pond's liner. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nicole Fried has said there were previous problems with the reservoir's liner and claimed the Piney Point plant has a troublesome history.

""For more than 50 years, this central Florida mining operation has caused numerous human health and environmental disasters and incidents,"" she wrote DeSantis in a letter about the Piney Point plant, which was originally constructed by Borden Chemical Company in 1966.

In 1989, thousands of gallons of sulfuric acid leaked from a holding tank at the plant, forcing hundreds of people to be evacuated from the area. In 1991, air releases of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide from the facility sickened over 30 people near the plant.

Thunderstorms packing heavy rains and lightning have caused widespread flooding across Egypt, killing at least five people and injuring five others, officials have said, as authorities shuttered schools, government offices and an airport.

Thursday was declared a paid holiday to keep streets clear, closing schools and government offices, with officials urging people to stay at home and not to park near trees or in low-lying areas that would be at risk of flooding.

A driver died when strong winds blew his car into a canal in the southern province of Sohag, and a technician was electrocuted in New Valley province while trying to repair a lighting column that had lost power due to the heavy rain.

A child and five people were wounded when floods demolished their houses in a rural area in the southern province of Qena. Lightning also ignited several fires.

A state of emergency began on Wednesday as a powerful storm developed over the Mediterranean Sea, prompting authorities to issue warnings to residents.

On Thursday, authorities closed down the Luxor International Airport, a key hub for tourists, as well as the Mediterranean port of Alexandria and the Red Sea port of Sharm el-Sheikh.

The city of Ismailia, situated on the west bank of the Suez Canal, recorded 25 millimetres of rain in 24 hours. Mersa Matruh, a resort town on the country’s Mediterranean coast, reported 20mm.

Despite such relatively small rainfall totals, many parts of the capital, Cairo, were underwater.

Chaos generally accompanies bad weather in Egypt, raising questions about the country’s poor infrastructure and dilapidated sewage and drainage systems.

Late on Thursday, Cairo’s Water Authority announced it had suspended water service to the entire city because heavy rain had overwhelmed the vast sewage system. It said water would return when the weather improved, without offering an exact time.

Mahmoud Shahin, director of the analysis department at the Egyptian Meteorological Authority, said: “This level of instability in weather conditions has not occurred with such force since 1994.”

Egypt has no comprehensive rainwater drainage system and relies on a 105-year-old drainage network to siphon rainwater.

In an earlier statement on the floods that brought Cairo to a standstill last October, the cabinet said that Egyptian cities were built without rainwater drainage networks.",2020-03-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['mediterranean', 'heavy', 'storms', 'killing', 'floods', 'egypt', 'water', 'weather', 'authorities', 'bring', 'widespread', 'system', 'drainage', 'southern', 'rain', 'province']",Egypt,news article,English

In March, however, Federal Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale announced that Environment Canada would restart the project in collaboration with the private sector.Updated floodplain maps, which would reflect current changes in climate and topog­raphy, would allow the government, developers and insurers to take pre-emptive action to save homeowners from building in vulnerable areas and save them millions of dollars in water damage costs.However, according to Dr. Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, flood maps could actually do more harm than good to consumers.“Floodplain maps are politically toxic – nobody wants to take the lead in developing them and releasing them publicly,” Feltmate said at the 2017 Flood Risk Summit. “Governments that would support developing floodplain maps would take a lot of heat from current homeowners, who may be now identified as being in a floodplain. All of a sudden you have a $1 million home that is stigmatized and devalued down to half its current value, where it’s unsellable.”As controversial as the decision is, it provides an opportunity for MGAs and the industry as a whole to play a more active role in protecting properties from flooding.“There isn’t anything we can do about the unpredictability of the seasons, which is why it’s so important that brokers help their customers understand what they could be exposed to and assist them with choosing the right coverage for their needs,” said Barry Owen, Aviva Canada ’s assistant vice-president of personal lines propositions. “Brokers now have several markets offering flood insurance, but not all products are created equal, so they need to understand the differences.”",2017-09-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['floodplain', 'homeowners', 'save', 'maps', 'environment', 'canada', 'updated', 'feltmate', 'flood', 'coming', 'understand', 'current']",Canada,news article,English

1063,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,USAID Mozambique Factsheet: Disaster Response (July 2019) - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/usaid-mozambique-factsheet-disaster-response-july-2019,"BACKGROUND

Mozambique is the third most vulnerable country in Africa to disaster risks (according to the UN’s Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction). Frequent natural disasters disrupt livelihoods and food production of the most vulnerable people, undermining the fight against extreme poverty. During the last 35 years there were 75 declared disasters in Mozambique consisting of 13 drought events, 25 floods, 14 tropical cyclones and 23 epidemics (Instituto Nacional de Gestao de Calamidades, 2016). The regional El Niño-induced drought emergency of 2015-2016 was the worst in 35 years.

According to the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition’s (SETSAN) November 2016 report, an estimated 2.1 million Mozambicans had limited or uncertain access to food, and needed assistance prior to the March-April 2017 harvest. This figure represents an increase of 700,000 persons over 2016 and illustrates the vulnerability of the Mozambican people. The depletion of family assets (food stocks, seed stock, livestock and family savings) as a result of the 2016 drought left many households destitute and dependent on food and other assistance provided by the Government of Mozambique (GRM) and assistance provided by development partners such as USAID.

Approximately 80 percent of the Mozambican population relies on rain-fed agriculture for their subsistence, which is sensitive to extreme climatic events as well as pests. The recent introduction of new pests such as the fall armyworm is now creating additional food security concerns through the country. The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), FAW, is an insect pest that feeds on more than 100 crop species, causing damage to economically important cultivated crops such as maize, rice, sorghum, various legumes as well as vegetable crops, pasture grasses and cotton. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, with the adult moth able to move over 100 km per night.

Highly prolific, it can produce up to 12 generations per year. It lays its eggs on plants, from which larvae hatch and begin feeding. High infestations can lead to severe and significant crop damage and yield loss.

KEY CHALLENGES

The GRM lacks sufficient funding within its own budget or from donors to effectively mitigate or effectively respond to natural disasters and insect pest infestations. Often there are delays in issuing a disaster declaration, and poor coordination between the GRM and humanitarian partners further delays response efforts. The inability of the GRM to systematically collect sound data regarding numbers of victims, their locations and nutrition status before, during and after a natural disaster makes it difficult to develop an appropriate response that targets the right people.

Due to the fact that the FAW is new to the sub-saharan Africa, little information exists on FAW biology, behavior and impact in Africa There is a lack of experience within the Mozambican agriculture sector in recognizing and treating FAW infestations. Additionally, the availability of FAW pesticides commercially sold on the local market requires that they be registered, which is a slow and incremental process.

DROUGHT RESPONSE

The United States Government (USG) made a significant contribution to the 2016/2014 donor funded drought response effort in Mozambique. USAID Food for Peace (FFP) and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), as well as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) contributed a total of $45,866,814 to this cause.

FFP contributed $28,441,295 in mostly in-kind commodities,

OFDA contributed $10,996,221 and

PEPFAR contributed an additional $6,429,298 To mitigate the effects of the 2016 drought, USAID distributed food (beans and sorghum) and provided livelihood, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) support to hundreds of thousands of people in the most heavily affected areas. In addition to the provision of emergency assistance during droughts or other natural disasters, USAID has been implementing a Feed the Future program for the past several years. The goal of the Feed the Future program is to improve and diversify the livelihoods of Mozambicans with an emphasis on smallholder farmers, leading to better food security and socioeconomic stability. In terms of increasing disaster resilient agricultural productivity, USAID activities focus on developing improved seeds and a functioning seed market, farmer to market linkages, and the expansion of orange fleshed sweet potato cultivation and consumption. To improve the enabling environment for agriculture as a livelihood, USAID supports value chain development and agricultural and agribusiness policy reform. Drought tolerant crop varieties and climate smart management practices are currently included in USAID programs.

MITIGATING THE FALL ARMYWORM EFFECT

FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 (Sao Tome and Principe, Nigeria, Benin and Togo) and spread to an additional 18 countries, including Mozambique, by early 2017. FAW’s presence in Africa is expected to spread further and is irreversible. Large-scale eradication efforts are neither appropriate nor feasible.

After it was first detected in Mozambique in January 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture (MASA) has reported FAW presence in the provinces of Gaza, Maputo, Manica, Zambezia, Tete and Niassa and has proposed a three phase, $1.6 million mitigation plan. The plan includes FAW monitoring, conducting biological and ecological studies, an education campaign targeted at smallholder farmers and production of educational materials, and purchase and distribution of chemical pesticides.

USAID is currently working cooperatively with scientists from Southern African countries and Brazil to devise a FAW mitigation plan that can be applied throughout the region. Plans to include trainings and educational material on FAW prevention within USAID agricultural activities are underway",2019-07-31 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'mozambique', 'response', 'plan', 'disaster', 'usaid', 'factsheet', 'drought', '2019', 'food', 'assistance', 'faw', '2016']",Mozambique,news article,English

In may 2012, the Late Ethiopian dictator, Meles Zenawi, declared that Ethiopia would pump up gas out of the Ogaden in one year's time. That didn't happen. According to Wikipedia entry, the first exploration in the basin was undertaken by Standard Oil in 1920[2] More recent exploration by Tenneco resulted in the discovery of an estimated 68 million cubic metres (2.4 billion cubic feet) of gas in 1974.[2] China proposed to establish its own military base in O'bock , Djibouti near Bab al-Mandab straight, the strategic southern entrance to the Red Sea and the gateway to the Suez Canal. China understands the void of the Horn's old client ,Russia, and the importance of the Horn in terms of penetrating the Continent throughout Somalia's territorial waters, however, China is pursuing the same approach that led the failure of the Soviet Union instead of establishing itself a permanent position on the Indian and the Red Sea. China failed in Libya and South Sudan and will likely fail if it does not put all its efforts with Somalia and Somali speaking populations in the Horn amid to participate in the recourse of a strong central Somali government in Mogadishu. China will then have the upper hand and have a chance to avail its health and strong relationship with Somalis in the Horn, in doing so, it will get abundant natural resources including the country's untapped oil and gas reserves if she needs to be a superpower. Saudi Arabia and Israel met to discuss a number of international issues and they revealed that they had been in secret discussions for a year. In the discussion, they stated their interest in regard of the Ogaden oil and gas in Eastern parts of Occupied-Ogaden. Anwar Eshki, a retired major general in the Saudi armed forces, said in his speech about the Middle East and the Horn of Africa on June 4, 2015 that the Ogaden basin will unite the Horn of Africa under the Ethiopia"" (TPLF leadership). The source further said that Saudi Ben Laden Group could build a bridge across the Red Sea linking Yemen to Djibouti.Israel and Saudi would then be able to exploit the natural reserves in Ogaden."" Both Israel and Saudi Arabia have failed to learn the hostilities between the Somali ethnic population in Occupied-Ogaden and Ethiopian highlanders from Tigray and Amhara, an historical enmity that goes back the years of the Somali Adal Empire and Abyssinia's Aksumite Empire (14th Century-16th century). The book of ""Futuh Al-Habasha: The Conquest of Abyssinia"" would open their eyes if they wanted to learn the history of the Horn of Africa and the Ogaden region crisis.



Human rights abuses in the Ogaden region The massacres in the Ogaden have been described as ""genocide"" by the Genocide Watch. Rights Groups the likes, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International accuse Ethiopia of heinous crimes and human rights violations in its military operation in the Horn of Africa's Ogaden region. The government denied the allegations yet unwilling to collaborate with a fact-finding Mission from the UN Human Rights body on its research for the human rights abuses allegedly committed by its soldiers stationed in Ogaden region. Over the last seven years, the Ethiopian government has initiated a genocidal campaign against the Ogadeni civilian population. The Ethiopian Defense Forces are using a systematic policy of intimidation, rape, assault and detention and deportation against Ogadeni civilians. Ten of thousands of people have fled to refugee camps in Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea and Yemen. According to the Genocide watch, The Ethiopian Army's counter-insurgency campaign in Ogaden has included numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Ethiopian government's policy in Ogaden is to suppress all demands for autonomy from Ogadenis. It has included gradual stationary of the population in IDP Camps-a policy Genocide Watch calls Genocide by attrition. The army has imposed an economic blockade on many towns and villages in the Ogaden. The government has restricted access of water, food and other necessities. Food is being used as a weapon of war. Massacres, torture, rape and disappearances are prevalent in the Ogaden region. Women and children are the most vulnerable groups to suffer abuses and violence. They are accused of being relatives of ONLF members. Thousands of people have been arrested without any charges and held in the notorious prisons in Ethiopia and Jail Ogaden particularly.

The TPLF-led regime imposed a ban on all international media and most of the aid workers including International Red Cross and doctors without borders had expelled the region.

The regime arrested and detained dozens of people that their relatives are outside of Ogaden. The Security forces ordered their return or they will remain in custody. Ethiopia executed catholic priests , subjugated Sidamas, Gambellas, Afars, Benishanguls and more than 40 million Oromos. Despite all these, it is silenced and never discussed the war and human rights violations in Ogaden and other places publicly. Mass refugees movements and UNHCR's involvement to support them

Hundreds of thousands fled from Ogaden region for the result of the forgotten war in Ogaden region. Dhabaab, Kenya alone hosts 100, 000 Ogadenis that fled from the war-torn region of Ogaden. Among of them are protracted refugees that UNHCR has been feeding since the 80s. While hundreds of them live in a number of other refugee camps in East Africa including Djibouti's Ali-Addeh, Eritrea's Emkulu Camp, among others. It is six decades conflict that the United Nations has failed to solve and even its humanitarian arm, UNHCR Yemen is wondering how to help several hundred Ogadeni political refugees currently caught up in the Yemen conflict to get a safer place.



According to the Director of the Royal African Society, Richard Dowden, in 1991 and 1992, The UN Refugee Agency did nothing for the Ogadeni refugees that found themselves in Ethiopia after they had escaped from their camps in Somalia-where they sought refuge during the Somalia -Ethiopia war over the control of the Ogaden in 1977-78. The UN allowed Ogadeni refugees mostly women and children to die in its camps inside Ethiopia's Ogaden region after the Derg regime rejected to accept them as ""classified returnees"" because of their Somali ethnicity -making among the highest ever recorded death rate. That incident did at least result in a change of the UNHCR mandate. The scenario is the same, UNHCR's protection counselling office in Sana'a sees considerable security threats for the lives of Ogadenis and others amid at Saudi-led bombardment and economic sanctions. Moreover, the office wanted to provide cash assistance to those lost their jobs since last March despite under-funding and to expedite dozens of families that referred to U.S, EU, Canada and Australia. Sweden and France were able to take in several families since last March. Even though, the UN office managed to contribute one time food-aid to some of the urban refugees in Sana'a last month since March , the humanitarian Agency needs to open its doors and build trust in terms of giving solace or receiving applications from those in dire straits that wanted to talk to UNHCR for the purpose of : Following up on their cases, reporting a protection problem, seeking material and medical assistance or to those willing to be considered their cases for resettlement since they could not return to their homelands due to well-founded fear of persecution and their hosted nation of Yemen is on war.

Both UNHCR Senior Officials based in Geneva and Aden aware of those hundred Ogadeni families in Kharez Camp-registered with the UN as refugees from Somalia-but have a different status. Among of them are survivors from the little known Banbalaayo massacres of 1991 and 1992. As a source from Rebecca Hinchey's research titled, ""Ogaden- A state of Decay"" reads: ""Banbalaayo, roughly translated means 'desert of hell'- thousands of Ogaden refugees-mostly women and children died in Hiiraan Province, South of Somalia when their camp came under attack, the Ogadenis showered with thousands of bullets. Many fell to the ground, died or dying, Those that did not try to run but their only option was to cross the river behind them. Only a few were able to swim. Some men survived, but almost all the women and children drowned."" The resumption of that past experience is one of their main concerns now. Dozens of families displaced in Sana'a and other parts of Yemen while others are wandering throughout Yemen.

1510,FL-2020-000038-EGY,50-year-old Nile dam altered lives - Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2021/jan/17/50-year-old-nile-dam-altered-lives/,"MANIAL SULTAN, Egypt -- Yassin Saeed remembers when the Nile's annual flooding drenched his village in the years before the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Now, former flood lands are green fields year-round.

""Our lives were very hard,"" said the 76-year-old Egyptian, recounting how his father, his brothers and other farmers had to use the traditional felucca sailboats to harvest the corn crops in the flooded fields.

The area was flooded at least a third of the year; the villagers would erect mud barriers to prevent waters from reaching their homes. Then came the dam, which officially opened on Jan. 15, 1971.

Built in the 1950s and 1960s under the country's leader, the charismatic Gamal Abdel-Nasser, the Soviet Union helped in its construction after the United States and Britain withdrew financial support.

Their withdrawal was a factor in Nasser's subsequent decision to nationalize the Suez Canal, taking it from British and French companies. He planned to use canal revenue to finance the dam. Egyptians hailed it as the moment when their country finally threw off decades of imperialist control, and Nasser was called a patriot.

The move angered France and Britain. They, along with Israel, invaded and briefly took the canal in the 1956 Mideast war. But the United States and the Soviet Union ordered them to pull back, in what was seen across the Arab world as a defining victory for Nasser and Arab nationalism.

The dam's construction changed the very landscape of Egypt. It spared the farmers from seasonal droughts and flooding, and generated electricity, spurring Egypt's rapid development. For years, the dam served as the main source of power for the country, which has recently needed to invest in other sources to meet the needs of its booming population.

""It is the greatest Egyptian project since the time of the pharaohs,"" said Abbas Sharaky, a water resources professor at Cairo University, describing how the Nile was tamed.

The river is formed by its two tributaries, the Blue Nile, originating from Lake Tana in Ethiopia and the White Nile, from Lake Victoria in Uganda. The tributaries meet in central Sudan from where the Nile winds northward through Egypt and flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

The project ensured an adequate water supply all year, Sharaky said. In the 1980s, a prolonged drought dropped the Nile to its lowest level since 1913 south of the dam, and upstream countries faced drought and famine. But Egypt was spared. Lake Nasser, created by the dam, provided an alternative source of water.

Today, as Egypt marks 50 years of the Aswan Dam, it is embroiled in stormy negotiations with Sudan and Ethiopia to resolve a long-running dispute over another massive dam, one that Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, the main tributary of the Nile.

Ethiopia hopes its dam, now more than three-quarters complete, will generate electricity critical to help pull millions of its people out of poverty. Egypt, which relies almost entirely on the Nile to supply water for agriculture and its 100 million-strong population, fears a devastating effect if the Ethiopian dam is operated without taking its needs into account.

Despite the numerous benefits it brought, the Aswan High Dam also had negative side-effects. It increased the salt content of the soil used to grow food, holding back the rich silt that acted as a fertilizer, and drove thousands of villagers from their Nile Valley homes.

Some 50,000 Nubian people were subjected to forced resettlement in 1963 and 1964, to vacate the area where Lake Nasser, which covers 2,000 square miles, was created.

The world paid little attention to the displacement of the Nubians, who were moved to 44 new villages north of Aswan, but many still dream of returning to land along the lake, near their original homes.

There was, however, international uproar over antiquities dating to the times of the pharaohs that were endangered by the dam's encroaching reservoir. In 1960, the UNESCO issued an international appeal to save the temples of Abu Simbel, one of the country's most popular tourist attractions and a priceless treasure. More than 113 countries responded with funds or expertise at the time.

The temples were moved piece by piece to higher ground.

1487,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Back road to hope: Migrants flood Canada at remote NY outpost - BurlingtonFreePress.com,https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2017/08/09/back-road-hope-migrants-flood-canada-remote-ny-outpost/553716001/,"WILSON RING

Associated Press

CHAMPLAIN, N.Y. - They have come from all over the United States, piling out of taxis, pushing strollers and pulling luggage, to the end of a country road in the north woods.

Where the pavement stops, they pick up small children and lead older ones wearing Mickey Mouse backpacks around a ""road closed"" sign, threading bushes, crossing a ditch, and filing past another sign in French and English that says ""No pedestrians."" Then they are arrested.

Seven days a week, 24 hours a day, migrants who came to the U.S. from across the globe — Syria, Congo, Haiti, elsewhere — arrive here where Roxham Road dead-ends so they can walk into Canada, hoping its policies will give them the security they believe the political climate in the United States does not.

""In Trump's country, they want to put us back to our country,"" said Lena Gunja, a 10-year-old from Congo, who until this week had been living in Portland, Maine. She was traveling with her mother, father and younger sister. ""So we don't want that to happen to us, so we want a good life for us. My mother, she wants a good life for us.""

The passage — just across Lake Champlain and a little north of Burlington, Vermont — has become so crowded this summer that Canadian police set up a reception center on their side of the border. The center is in the Quebec community of Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, about 30 miles south of Montreal, or almost 300 miles north of New York City.

It includes tents that have popped up in the past few weeks, where migrants are processed before they are turned over to the Canada Border Services Agency, which handles their applications for refuge.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are adding electricity and portable toilets. A Canadian flag stands just inside the first tent, where the Mounties search the immigrants they've just arrested and check their travel documents. They are also offered food. Then shuttle buses take the processed migrants to their next destination. Trucks carry their luggage separately.

The Canadian military said Wednesday that about 100 soldiers began arriving to prepare a site for tents to accommodate almost 500 people. The soldiers will also install lighting and heating equipment.

How this spot, not even an official border crossing, became the favored place to cross into Canada is anyone's guess. But once migrants started going there, word spread on social media.

Under the 2002 Safe Country Agreement between the United States and Canada, migrants seeking asylum must apply to the first country they arrive in. If they were to go to a legal port of entry, they would be returned to the United States and told to apply there.

But, in a quirk in the application of the law, if migrants arrive in Canada at a location other than a port of entry, such as Roxham Road, they are allowed to request refugee status there.

Many take buses to Plattsburgh, New York, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south. Some fly there, and others take Amtrak. Sometimes taxis carry people right up to the border. Others are let off up the road and have to walk, pulling their luggage behind them.

Used bus tickets litter the pavement, their points of origin mostly blurred by rain that fell on nights previous. One read ""Jacksonville.""

One Syrian family said they flew into New York City on tourist visas and then went to Plattsburgh, where they took a taxi to the border.

The migrants say they are driven by the perception that the age of Republican President Donald Trump, with his ban on travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries, means the United States is no longer the destination of the world's dispossessed. Taking its place in their minds is the Canada of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a member of his country's Liberal Party.

Most of the people making the crossing now are originally from Haiti. The Trump administration said this year it planned to end in January a special humanitarian program enacted after the 2010 earthquake that gave about 58,000 Haitians permission to stay temporarily in the U.S.

Walking toward the border in a group on Monday, Medyne Milord, 47, originally of Haiti, said she needs work to support her family.

""If I return to Haiti, the problem will double,"" she said. ""What I hope is to have a better life in Canada.""

Jean Rigaud Liberal, 38, said he had been in the United States for seven months and lived in Florida after he left Haiti. He learned about Roxham Road from Facebook and said he thinks ""Canada will be better than America.""

""We are not comfortable in America,"" said Liberal. ""We are seeking a better life; we don't want to go back to Haiti.""

On the New York side, U.S. Border Patrol agents sometimes check to be sure the migrants are in the United States legally, but they said they don't have the resources to do it all the time.

Besides, said Brad Brant, a special operations supervisor for the U.S. Border Patrol, ""our mission isn't to prevent people from leaving.""

Small numbers continue to cross into Canada elsewhere, but the vast majority take Roxham Road. U.S. officials said they began to notice last fall, around the time of the U.S. presidential election, that more people were crossing there.

Francine Dupuis, the head of a Quebec government-funded program that helps asylum seekers, said her organization estimates 1,174 people overall crossed into Quebec last month, compared with 180 in July 2016. U.S. and Canadian officials estimated that on Sunday alone, about 400 people crossed the border at Roxham Road.

""All they have to do is cross the border,"" Dupuis said. ""We can't control it. They come in by the hundreds, and it seems to be increasing every day.""

Canada said last week it planned to house some migrants in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. It could hold thousands, but current plans call for only 450.

In most cases, once the migrants are in Canada they are released and can live freely while their claims for refugee status are processed, which can take years. Meanwhile, they are eligible for public assistance.

Brenda Shanahan, the Liberal Party member of Parliament who represents the area, visited the site Monday. She is proud of her country for being willing to take in the dispossessed, she said, but there is no guarantee they will be able to stay in Canada.

""It's not a free ticket for refugee status, not at all,"" Shanahan said.

Opposition Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel said the Trudeau government lacks a plan to deal with the illegal crossings, even though a summer spike had been anticipated.

""All that we have heard is that we are monitoring the situation,"" she said. ""The government needs to come up with a plan right away to deal with this.""

It will further backlog a system in which some refugees are already waiting 11 years for hearings, Rempel said. Canadians will question the integrity of the immigration system if the ""dangerous trend"" of illegal crossings continues, she said.

Trudeau himself recently said his country has border checkpoints and controls that need to be respected.

""We have an open compassionate country, but we have a strong system that we follow,"" he said. ""Protecting Canadian confidence in the integrity of our system allows us to continue to be open, and that's exactly what we need to continue to do.""

Inancieu Merilien, originally of Haiti, moved to the United States in 2000 but crossed into Canada late last month. U.S. authorities, he said, are trying to scare Haitians by refusing to guarantee they'll be able to stay.

""There's a big difference here. They welcomed us very well,"" he said after leaving the Olympic Stadium to begin looking for a home in Montreal's large Haitian community. ""They're going to give us housing in apartments. I hope everything goes well.""

1811,FL-2021-000030-IDN,The nine boundaries humanity must respect to keep the planet habitable - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2021/03/the-nine-boundaries-humanity-must-respect-to-keep-the-planet-habitable/,"All life on Earth, and human civilization, are sustained by vital biogeochemical systems, which are in delicate balance. However, our species — due largely to rapid population growth and explosive consumption — is destabilizing these Earth processes, endangering the stability of the “safe operating space for humanity.”

Scientists note nine planetary boundaries beyond which we can’t push Earth Systems without putting our societies at risk: climate change, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosol pollution, freshwater use, biogeochemical flows of nitrogen and phosphorus, land-system change, and release of novel chemicals.

Humanity is already existing outside the safe operating space for at least four of the nine boundaries: climate change, biodiversity, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus imbalance). The best way to prevent overshoot, researchers say, is to revamp our energy and food systems.

In 2021, three meetings offer chances to avoid planetary boundary overshoot: the Convention on Biological Diversity meeting in Kunming, China; the U.N. Climate Summit (COP26) in Glasgow, U.K.; and the U.N. Food Systems Summit in Rome. Agreements with measurable, implementable, verifiable, timely and binding targets are vital, say advocates.

Advanced human societies emerged during an unprecedented period of stability on Earth. During the 12,000 years prior to the Industrial Revolution, our planet’s surface temperature varied by less than 1° Celsius (1.8° Fahrenheit) above or below the average for that entire period. As a result, life — both human and wild — thrived.

But over the past two centuries, humanity has dramatically increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, pushing us outside this “safe” climate zone; outside the conditions for which civilization has been designed.

Unfortunately for us, climate change represents just one of nine critical planetary boundaries, which the imprudent actions of our species risk dangerously destabilizing and overshooting.

A safe operating space for humanity

In the mid-2000s, Johan Rockström, founding director of Sweden’s Stockholm Resilience Centre, gathered an international, interdisciplinary team of scientists to unite behind a single goal: define the boundaries for a “safe operating space for humanity” on Earth. They asked themselves: what are the safe operating limits of our planet, and what changes can we force on it before we trigger rapid, catastrophic environmental harm?

In 2009, the center published the Planetary Boundaries Framework, which outlined nine key processes, influenced by humanity, that threaten the stability of the entire Earth System. These are: climate change, biodiversity integrity (functional and genetic), ocean acidification, depletion of the ozone layer, atmospheric aerosol pollution, biogeochemical flows of nitrogen and phosphorus, freshwater use, land-system change, and release of novel chemicals (including heavy metals, radioactive materials, plastics, and more).

Together, the stability of these nine processes is essential to maintaining the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans and ecosystems in the delicate balance that has allowed human civilizations to flourish. However, these are also the processes that human activities have impacted most profoundly.

The researchers then estimated a limit of just how much human activities could exploit and alter each of these processes before the global system would pass a tipping point — a threshold beyond which we risk sending the Earth spiraling into a state that hasn’t been experienced for the entirety of human existence, bringing extreme change that could crash civilization and endanger humanity.

“Systems — from the oceans and ice sheets and climate system and ecosystems — can have multiple stable states separated by tipping points,” explained Rockström, now the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. If those “stable” systems are pushed too far, he said, they lose resilience and can transition, abruptly and irreversibly, into a new self-reinforcing state — one that might not support humanity.

The original 2009 Planetary Boundaries report, and its update in 2015, revealed a stark assessment: researchers found that humanity is already existing outside the safe operating space for at least four of the nine planetary boundaries: climate change, biodiversity, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows (Earth’s nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, which are being heavily impacted by global agribusiness and industry).

However, the experts warn, these limits are estimates: what we don’t know is how long we can keep pushing these key planetary boundaries before combined pressures lead to irreversible change and harm. Think of humanity, blindfolded, simultaneously walking toward nine cliff edges, and you gain some sense of the seriousness and urgency of our situation.

Dawn of the Anthropocene

The dynamics of large, complex and interconnected biogeochemical systems like those operating on Planet Earth can be thought of in terms of pathways or trajectories, weaving between different steady states. The Earth’s trajectory can be altered by tipping points, which shift us from one steady state to another (something like a car changing gears). A number of complex feedback processes can either reinforce the current steady state, or weaken it, and send the planet spiraling toward a completely new state, like a bowling ball with too much spin careening toward the gutter.

Climate change, the best known of the nine planetary boundaries on which we’re encroaching, offers a good example of how this equilibrium process works.

Today, “We are at risk of triggering tipping elements in the Earth System towards a ‘Hothouse Earth’ from which it would be very difficult to recover to pre-industrial climate,” explained Steven Lade, a Stockholm Resilience Centre researcher specializing in social-ecological system modeling.

However, “with rapid decarbonization we could possibly reach a ‘Stabilized Earth,’” he added, maintaining our climate within the safe window of conditions to which humanity has adapted over the last 12,000 years.

The period of Earth climate stability in which our societies have thrived is known as the Holocene epoch. Beginning some 12,000 years ago, it marked the end of more than 100,000 years of alternating glacial and interglacial periods that saw the planet’s temperature fluctuate by as much as 6°C (10.8°F).

Modern humans have existed for about 200,000 years, but it was “only in the last 10,000 years that we were able to develop civilization as we know it,” Rockström said. “The very origins of modern civilization, namely domestication of animals and plants and the establishment of agriculture, happened in the Holocene.”

Hear Claire Asher discuss the planetary boundaries and solutions to the challenges on Mongabay’s podcast, here:

Yet these very same hallmarks of our extraordinary success — agriculture, sedentary living, industrial manufacturing — are today fundamentally altering many Earth System processes responsible for keeping conditions on Earth stable.

In fact, our transgressions of the nine planetary boundaries have been so severe that geologists believe we have entered a new epoch in the Earth’s history. The start of the Anthropocene — a human-influenced period that scientists say was initiated somewhere between 10,000 and 70 years ago — has been marked by rapid, human-triggered increases in greenhouse gas emissions, large-scale land-use change, extreme biodiversity loss, and massive global consumption and pollution brought on by rapidly advancing technology and a booming Homo sapiens population.

The dawn of the Anthropocene, a new epoch, needs to serve as a warning, Rockström said, that “we’re starting to hit the ceiling of the biophysical coping capacity of the whole Earth System.”

On a path to climate and biodiversity overshoot

Six years on from the last Stockholm Resilience Centre update (another is due this year), Rockström noted there is little evidence we’ve reversed course to avoid looming tipping points. “If anything, we are even deeper into the transgression of climate, on biodiversity, on land-use, and on nitrogen and phosphorus. So we have not turned around the [2015] trends.”

Of the four boundaries that researchers say we have already exceeded, climate change and biosphere integrity are considered “core” planetary boundaries because either one, on its own, could change the course of Earth’s trajectory and endanger humanity.

“There’s enough science today to say that [human-induced climate change] on its own can knock the planet away from the Holocene state,” Rockström said. “Similarly, if we just continue our mass extinction, losing more and more species, from phytoplankton to top predators, you will come to a point where the whole planet [system] collapses.”

There is strong evidence we’re already in the midst of a global mass extinction. A 2019 assessment by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) reported that 25% of plants and animals assessed — totaling 1 million species worldwide — are threatened with extinction. A separate study found that more than 500 vertebrate species are on the brink, each with fewer than a thousand individuals remaining in the wild.

Importantly, researchers say we are flying blind when it comes to both the quantity or quality of biodiversity loss that can be tolerated by ecosystems before triggering irreversible change.

“IPBES made it clear that we have really high extinction rates right now and they’re getting higher,” said Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist and senior vice president of WWF. However, data not on extinctions, but on total population declines, are actually more informative for assessing biosphere health, she said, noting, “By the time species are moving to extinction there’s very little you can do.”

“We should really be looking at population [abundance] declines around the world, and nest that with ecosystem integrity measures, and nest that in [measures of] the way ecosystems are functioning to deliver services to humans,” Shaw explained.

According to WWF and the Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) 2020 Living Planet Report, population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish declined by 68% on average between 1970 and 2016 — a strong alarm call.

Early warnings

Scientists are now detecting the first flashing warning lights on the Earth System dashboard, telling us humanity is already pushing beyond our world’s safe operating space for multiple planetary boundaries and approaching tipping points.

“We have changed the planet so much that it is very likely that there will be significant impacts, and we’re seeing those impacts in the last five years,” Shaw said.

An example: melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets has accelerated since the early 1990s, suggesting these colossal ice deposits may have now entered a new state of sustained and escalating retreat, after many centuries of stability. Contained within these now vulnerable ice sheets is enough water to raise the global sea level by more than 65 meters (213 feet).

Similarly, Arctic sea ice is retreating and scientists predict the region could be mostly ice-free in the summer as early as 2035 — with no certainty of what extreme changes this might bring.

Other early warning signs that we are approaching a climate change tipping point include increasingly frequent and severe droughts, heat waves, storms, and tropical cyclones.

“The number of climate-related natural disasters is climbing at an alarming rate, with significant economic and health impacts, especially for the most vulnerable,” said Ana María Loboguerrero Rodríguez, head of Global Policy Research for the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

No one knows how much stress civilization can withstand before it starts to collapse.

Feedback loops upon feedback loops

These early changes are signs of an impending shift from once stable Holocene conditions, say scientists. More concerning: many of these changes are expected to create positive feedback loops that further accelerate change.

For example, the continued melting of the Greenland ice sheet will not only cause major sea level rise, but also could alter ocean surface temperature and salinity, potentially triggering a transition in ocean circulation systems like the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation (AMOC), which in turn could drastically alter global climate, and even accelerate the loss of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

However, it’s not all likely to be bad news: some feedback loops may have a balancing effect on the climate and on other planetary boundaries. “Which of these feedback loops wins, and when, is one of the big questions about our future climate,” Lade said.

Still, these reinforcing loops could trigger more complicated cascades of change. “The whole Earth System is a complex self-regulating system,” Rockström said, “if you push one [planetary boundary] too far it can cascade like a domino and impact the others.”

For example, land-use change due to agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation worldwide; it reduces the amount of water released to the air from plant leaves. In the Amazon Basin, this transpiration is a major source of rainfall. But signs are strong that rapid Amazon deforestation — combined with global climate change — may be triggering more extreme drought, leading to an abrupt shift from rainforest to degraded savanna, with profound implications for the entire planet. That biome-wide shift would release a vast store of ancient sequestered carbon, exacerbating climate change, leading to more drought and more tree die-off — a vicious, self-multiplying cycle.

“There is growing concern that, with the recent increase in deforestation rates under Brazil’s [Jair] Bolsonaro government, we may be approaching a tipping point for the Amazon rainforest,” said Will Steffen, emeritus professor at the Australian National University, Canberra, who was part of the team that developed the original planetary boundaries framework. “The three [Earth System tipping points] of greatest concern in my view are the Amazon rainforest, the Greenland ice sheet, and Siberian permafrost.”

The Amazon Rainforest example shows how disruptions to regional processes — such as the cycling of water by trees — can add up and push us toward planet-wide tipping points.

Another tipping point example: the devastating wildfires striking Australia and California in 2019 and 2020. They arose from multiple factors — intensifying drought due to climate change, accumulated leaf litter, unusual wind patterns — that built up slowly. Then, a small human intervention, such as a spark from a utility company power transformer as happened in California, was enough to “change a forest to a shrubland overnight because of climate change,” potentially altering biodiversity, Shaw said. “Climate change really manifests itself in these bursts of catastrophes.”

Regional interactions between planetary boundaries may already be accelerating our trajectory away from a safe Earth operating space. “At a planet scale, you don’t [yet clearly] see these types of things; [but] at the regional scale, it’s really phenomenal how [the interaction between] climate change and biodiversity loss [for example] is manifesting itself,” Shaw noted. “We never thought we’d see [biodiversity] collapse like we’re seeing at the regional scale this early.”

As regional and global change intensifies, scientists warn that it’s what we don’t know about the vast complexity of interactions between Earth System processes — only a fraction of which have been well studied — that concerns them most.

“It is quite frustrating to have to admit that we don’t yet fully understand the fundamental interactions between planetary boundaries,” Rockström said. Even if we are able to bring the climate system back into a safe operating space, he added, “we may by that time have triggered so much forest dieback and so much permafrost thawing and so much ice melt … that the planet has already chosen another route” — another trajectory and steady state not conducive to human civilization.

Food systems key to conserving a habitable Earth

If we are to steer our planet away from a devastating new trajectory, phasing out fossil fuels to reach a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions world economy is a key priority. But even more pressing, experts say, is a change to our food systems.

Food production accounts for nearly 25% of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions, is the biggest driver of biodiversity loss, the primary cause of land-use change, one of the largest sources of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, and it generates huge freshwater demand. Because food production generates big carbon emissions, it adds to ocean acidification too. That covers six of the nine planetary boundaries.

Together, “a food-system transformation and an energy transformation would take us a long way back into the safe space,” Rockström said.

“Nothing short of a systemic transformation of food systems is required to feed the world’s current and future population sustainably under climate change,” said CGIAR’s Loboguerrero. Making that sweeping change would not only reduce emissions, but improve health and food security, “providing multiple incentives for behavior change.”

Setting ambitious policy priorities

The next 12 months offer golden opportunities for the global community to come together and agree on policy priorities to set Earth on a trajectory for long-term stability.

Three major international meetings are scheduled for 2021: the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kunming, China, from Oct. 11-24; the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, U.K., from Nov. 1-12; and the U.N. Food Systems Summit in Rome from July 19-21. Measurable, implementable, verifiable, time sensitive, and most importantly, binding targets and agreements are vital.

“It’s a big year for outcomes and for commitments for the next 10 years that will determine whether or not we stay within these planetary boundaries,” Shaw said. At WWF, she added, “we’re looking to work with other stakeholders through those three meetings to get actions to stay within the safe operating zone at both the regional scale and planetary scale.”

In a paper published in Science last October, Shaw joined an international team of scientists calling for the CBD to set “ambitious goals” for biodiversity and sustainability, such as no net loss of biodiversity by 2030.

What makes this year’s meetings more crucial than ever: reminders of past failed global summits, and a clear understanding that time is fast running out.

Cause for hope

Experts are calling for a transformative, holistic approach to avoid risky tipping points, seeing the entire Earth System as a shared global commons, with humans as stewards. “The intertwisted nature of this framework calls for the development of a novel governance approach at global, regional, and local scales,” Loboguerrero said.

One such framework is the Global Commons Alliance, which brings together more than 50 international NGOs, multinational corporations, and city policymakers to promote the adoption of science-based targets to operate within planetary boundaries. But that partnership will need to grow geometrically if we are to act effectively.

That’s a daunting global goal. But there is one planetary boundary — the first we ever realized we were in danger of crossing — that offers hope: the depletion of the ozone layer. In 1987, the world’s nations recognized the urgency and validity of the science, and embraced the politically binding requirements of the Montreal Protocol. We stepped back from the brink, shrinking the ozone hole, which could now be healed by 2050.

If nations can come together to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, as they did to address the threat to the ozone layer, then there is a chance we can reverse current trends and steer Earth’s trajectory back toward a stable Holocene state. That chance is growing dimmer — but it is an effort we absolutely need to make.

The Nine Planetary Boundaries: A closer look The Planetary Boundaries Framework (last updated in 2015) defines nine key Earth System processes and sets safe boundaries for human activities. They are: Climate change: Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are leading to increasing global temperatures. We passed the safe boundary of 350 parts per million of CO2 in 1988. By 2020, levels were 417ppm. Novel entities: One of the more elusive planetary boundaries, novel entities refers to harmful chemicals, materials, and other new substances (such as plastics), as well as naturally-occurring substances such as heavy metals and radioactive materials released by human activities. We release tens of thousands of synthetic substances into the environment every day, often with unknown effects. These risks are exemplified by the danger posed by CFCs to the ozone layer, or of DDT to biodiversity. Stratospheric ozone depletion: The depletion of O3 in the stratosphere as a result of chemical pollutants was first discovered in the 1980s and led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The ozone layer is now showing signs of recovery. Atmospheric aerosols: Atmospheric aerosol pollution is a bane to human health and can also influence air and ocean circulation systems that affect the climate. For example, severe aerosol pollution over the Indian subcontinent may cause the monsoon system to abruptly switch to a drier state. Ocean acidification: Rising atmospheric CO2 levels are increasing the acidity of the world’s oceans, posing a severe risk to marine biodiversity and particularly invertebrates whose shells dissolve in acidic waters. Biogeochemical flows: We have profoundly altered the planet’s natural nitrogen and phosphorus cycles by applying these vital nutrients in large quantities to agricultural land, leading to runoff into neighboring ecosystems. Freshwater use: Agriculture, industry and a growing global population are putting ever greater strain on the freshwater cycle, while climate change is altering weather patterns, causing drought in some regions and flooding in others. Land-system change: Changes in land-use, particularly the conversion of tropical forests to farmland, have a major effect on climate because of the impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, on biodiversity, freshwater, and the reflectivity of the Earth’s surface. Biosphere Integrity: The functional integrity of ecosystems is a core planetary boundary because of the many ecoservices they provide, from pollination to clean air and water. Scientists are concerned about rapid declines in plant and animal populations, the degradation of ecosystems, and the loss of genetic diversity which could disrupt essential biosphere services.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

The number of patients with melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, has increased sharply at a major hospital in the central region following the prolonged flooding.

Since early October Hue Central Hospital in Thua Thien-Hue Province has admitted 28 people with the disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia Pseudomallei, which infects both humans and animals.

Around half the patients are from Thua Thien-Hue and the rest are from other central provinces like Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri, the province's news website reported.

The hospital is one of three biggest and most advanced general hospitals in Vietnam along with others in Hanoi and HCMC.

It said many of the patients came for treatment only after the disease had become serious, causing sepsis and multi-organ failure and threatening their life.

On November 14 a Quang Binh Province official died of the disease at the hospital.

Phan Thanh Mien, peoples committee chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trach District, had spent days in floodwaters in October managing relief efforts. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee, but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items in inundated areas.

The hospital had treated 83 people with the disease between 2014 and 2019 and 11 in the first nine months of this year.

It said the rise in the number of infections since early October is closely related to the floods that ravaged the central region throughout October and in November.

Various studies around the world have found that melioidosis occurs only in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, with outbreaks occurring after floods and typhoons.

In October central Vietnam was hit by floods thrice.

Melioidosis patients have symptoms like fever, pneumonia and abscesses in and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate is around 40 percent.

The disease was first diagnosed in Vietnam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country.

There are around 10,000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, around half of which prove fatal. There is no vaccine.",2020-11-17 08:00:00+00:00,"['thienhue', 'infection', 'vietnam', 'patients', 'quang', 'province', 'outbreak', 'central', 'hospital', 'floods', 'cause', 'bacterial', 'floodwaters', 'thua', 'disease']",Vietnam,news article,English

A study says indigenous knowledge on how nature flags up extreme weather is also relevant in urban areas to help alert residents

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indigenous knowledge about how to spot flood risks ahead of time could save lives in cities, researchers said on Wednesday, as climate change and population growth put millions of people at risk of increasingly unpredictable weather patterns.

Understanding changes in natural indicators - such as plants, birds and temperatures - could be used to alert urban residents to extreme weather where forecasts are seen as unreliable, said a study in the Journal of the British Academy.

""Indigenous knowledge is often overlooked,"" said Caroline Knowles, director of the cities and infrastructure programme at the British Academy, the UK's national body for humanities and social sciences.

""There are knowledge transfers that can be made between rural and peri-urban spaces that could save lives and livelihoods around the world,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The study interviewed 1,050 people in 21 rural and urban communities in Ghana, including the capital city Accra and the main city of Tamale in its Northern Region.

Researchers documented natural indicators used by indigenous communities to predict floods, droughts and temperature changes.

Those include links between rainfall patterns and ant behaviour, appearances by certain birds, flowering of baobab trees and observations of heat intensity, passed down between generations.

Knowles said not all rural indicators could be transferred to urban spaces, but some are relevant for both environments, such as clouds, heat, insects and trees.

Promoting tree-planting in urban areas could offer further opportunities to apply indigenous knowledge on flora in cities, said study author Raymond Abudu Kasei from Ghana's University for Development Studies.

More than 3 million urban dwellers could be at risk of flooding from extreme rainfall by 2050 as climate change brings more unpredictable weather hazards, the study said.

Extreme heat and power blackouts, alongside food and water shortages, are other threats if climate-changing emissions are not curbed, a 2018 report for the C40 cities network found.

As floods become more sudden and hard to predict, the inclusion of indigenous knowledge in science-based warning systems should be prioritised, researchers said this week.

""We have seen the use of indigenous knowledge for climate adaptation all over the world,"" said Stefan Thorsell, climate advisor at the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, who was not involved in the study.

""Indigenous people in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Myanmar and Ethiopia, for example, use their knowledge to observe and mitigate impacts of extreme climate events such as flooding and droughts,"" he added.

Dialogue is needed between indigenous groups and climate researchers as ""both can learn from one another"", said the British Academy's Knowles.

Indigenous knowledge can be used as an ""added layer"" to scientific research in designing early warning systems for floods, said Kasei.

More work is needed to document traditional knowledge at risk of being lost as the natural environments in which indigenous peoples live become more threatened by climate-related disasters, the study noted.",2019-08-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['study', 'world', 'used', 'floods', 'weather', 'extreme', 'rural', 'urban', 'indigenous', 'signs', 'climate', 'warn', 'cities', 'natural', 'knowledge', 'researchers']",Ghana,news article,English

The 25-year-old Sri Lankan refugee has been waiting in Thailand for five years to be resettled in a safe country. He spent four years of that time locked in an overcrowded, windowless cell in the immigration detention centre in Bangkok.

His three sisters and mother spent two years in detention before they were released on bail last fall at 50,000 baht apiece, or about $1,600 – a large sum refugees don't get back if they leave the country.

article continues below

His sisters and mother have resettled in the United States, but Chandru is still waiting for a country to accept him. Although he's on bail and checks in with immigration officials every two weeks, he constantly fears being arrested and thrown in the centre again.

He lives with his father, who is recognized as a refugee but also hasn't been resettled, in a musty one-room apartment in Bangkok. ""The situation is really bad for refugees here,"" said Chandru, who only gave his first name for fear of reprisals by Thai immigration officials.

That's the difficult situation facing most urban refugees who flee their homes for transit countries such as Thailand, hoping to be resettled in Canada, Australia or the United States.

Because Thailand is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention, asylum-seekers and refugees are treated like illegal immigrants and not allowed to work, go to school or receive social welfare.

Many have to wait years while their cases wind their way through the refugee system.

""Life is tough for them,"" said Vivian Tan, spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok. ""Most refugees have little access to public services. They can't work. They find work in the grey economy doing dirty, dangerous, difficult jobs that no one else wants to do. Their children can't go to school.

They are subject to arbitrary arrest and detention and they're not guaranteed a solution.

""They know they can't continue living like this for a long time.""

It's these dire circumstances that often push asylum-seekers in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia to pay human smugglers to get on dangerous boats heading for Australia, and, on two occasions in the past three years, to Canada.

Chandru said his family never considered paying a smuggler. But 492 Tamils did choose that option, leaving the port city of Songkhla and arriving off B.C.'s west coast on Aug. 13, 2010. Ten months earlier, 76 Tamil asylum-seekers turned up on the Ocean Lady.

The Canadian government calls them queue-jumpers and has taken dramatic steps to stop future boat migrants from reaching Canadian shores. Passed last summer, Bill C-31 imposes mandatory detention and a five-year ban on family reunification, permanent resident status and travel for any asylum seekers who arrive by boat.

But Michael Timmins of the non-profit refugee advocacy group Asylum Access in Bangkok says when you're a refugee, there is no queue. Canada and other Western countries have such strict visa policies that someone from Sri Lanka, for example, cannot get a visa to travel there, Timmins said. So people head to countries such as Thailand, where they can easily get in on a tourist visa. But Timmins said the constant fear of being arrested means they can't build a life there.

""They've been thrust into a situation where they have to leave their country for their life and then come to another country where their life is intolerable,"" Timmins said. ""When people start talking about other options, to maybe take a boat, then you start to look at it.""

While Timmins says he's not defending human smugglers, such operations have long been a way for desperate people to escape persecution. ""Think of classic movies, the Kite Runner, how did they get out? They got out of Afghanistan illegally. Think of Schindler's List, what was that? That was a people-smuggling operation. We're talking about different contexts here. The networks out of Thailand, they are criminal for sure, but they are responding to a need, in that there's a complete lack of protection in the region.""

After the arrival of the MV Sun Sea, the RCMP thwarted four more human-smuggling ships they believe were destined for Canada. The government quietly put pressure on Thai officials to stop more asylum-seekers from getting on boats. The result was a massive roundup of Tamils, with immigration police storming several apartment blocks known to house Sri Lankans on Oct. 11, 2010.

A total of 136 Sri Lankans registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees were detained, including three pregnant women and 30 children.

Just over two weeks later, 61 Sri Lankans were arrested in Songklha and Hat Yai and transferred to the Suan Phlu immigration detention in Bangkok.

Twenty-eight more Sri Lankans were arrested by the end of that year.

While Chandru and his family were already facing deplorable conditions inside the detention centre, it became even more crowded with the new arrivals.

""Sometimes, like, 400 people will be stuffed in a room where only 100 can stay,"" said Divia, 20, over Skype from her new home in California.

The Immigration Detention Centre is in the Suan Phlu area of Bangkok, amid traffic-choked streets, lined with merchants selling chicken satays and fried dumplings.

Chandru, who now makes a little money working as a Tamil translator for the Bangkok Refugee Centre, walks past the row of big, black caged-in trucks that transported him and other asylum seekers to the centre. The building could pass for a government office if it wasn't for the gates that encase the reception area. The reception door is open, but the detention centre itself is behind a solid steel door about an inch think.

A nurse with the Jesuit Refugee Service who works at the centre five days a week calls conditions ""very difficult.""

Chandru said when he was in detention, the nurse would often translate between detainees and security guards to make sure people got the help they needed. Children in detention can't go to Thai schools, but are allowed to attend a makeshift classroom that also serves as a daycare in a building next door.

For the adults, the only respite from staring at the dark walls are monthly family days, when all detainees are released into a central compound.

Fathers have a chance to hug their wives or kiss their children.

After they were released, Chandru's family was told if they were willing to split up, they would be resettled faster. ""My mom said yes because she was concerned about our studies,"" said Divia, who is finishing her high school diploma and hopes to go to university. Now the family's only connection is through grainy images on Skype.

Though Chandru is a designated refugee, the United States won't accept him because of his alleged ties to the Liberation Tamil Tigers Eelam, which many countries consider a terrorist organization.

Chandru, however, insists he never fought with the Tamil Tigers. In fact, the military group caused problems for his family, he said, coming to their home to look for his father, who was a member of the Democratic People's Liberation Front. Repeated threats forced Chandru's father out of the country in 2005. The rest of the family followed in 2007.

Oliver White, spokesman for the Jesuit Refugee Service, said of the 263 Sri Lankan refugees and asylum seekers in Bangkok, 15 per cent have links to the Tamil Tigers. Some of those links, however, are very tenuous. ""During the war, if you were Tamil, the LTTE was like a de facto government, so everyone was working [for them] to some various degrees.""

For one refugee, that involved printing banners. ""He never saw active combat, never committed any human-rights violations,"" White said. Yet the man is not eligible for resettlement. It's this group of people who are most likely to get on a boat, he said.

In January, the Canadian government announced it would spend $12 million on anti-human-smuggling operations in Southeast Asia, including $7 million on projects in Thailand. The funds include money to train police, immigration and border patrol officers in Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Laos.

Refugee advocates say law enforcement and border patrol are not the only answer, however. White said if Canada is going to push governments in Southeast Asia to crack down on human smugglers, it should also pressure those countries to give refugees legal status so they can work and their children can go to school.

683,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,A New Data Set to Keep a Sharper Eye on Land-Air Exchanges - Eos,https://eos.org/science-updates/a-new-data-set-to-keep-a-sharper-eye-on-land-air-exchanges,"The turn of the millennium marked a decade of systematic measurements of exchanges of carbon, water, and energy between the biosphere and the atmosphere, made by a few pioneering scientists at their own study sites. New knowledge was—and still is—generated from these data at individual sites. It quickly became clear, however, that pooling together data from multiple sites would create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts: a powerful tool not only for comparing and combining sites but also for studying land-air exchanges at regional and even global scales.

Scientists formed regional networks to foster sharing of data and methodologies, and FLUXNET was created, establishing a global “network of networks.” But a challenge remained: Data sets were still too diverse, incompatible, and hard to compare. In June 2000, at the Marconi Convention Center on the northern California coast, a group of scientists resolved to change that. The first FLUXNET data set was born.

FLUXNET2015 is the third data set in the series, following the original Marconi data set from 2000 and the widely used 2007 version produced after a workshop in La Thuile, Italy. Released in December 2015, with two augmentations in 2016, the FLUXNET2015 data set includes more than 1500 site-years of data at 30-minute intervals from 212 sites, ranging from the Norwegian tundra in Svalbard to the South African savanna in Kruger National Park, from the birch forests of Hokkaido, Japan, to the scrub oak near the launch pads of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Each site has records of fluxes of carbon, water, and energy and other ecosystem and biometeorological variables.

The fidelity of these flux measurements and their singular spatial and temporal coverage uniquely position them not only to help answer a broad range of questions about ecosystems, climate, and land use but also to bridge gaps between field observations and larger-scale tools like climate models and remote sensing. If past usage of FLUXNET data sets is any guide, we expect that scientists will use these data to validate satellite measurements, inform Earth system models, provide insight into a host of questions in ecology and hydrology, and fuel novel applications, many harnessing big data tools, on scales ranging from microbes to continents.

Updating FLUXNET Data Sets

FLUXNET sites span all continents and all major climate zones (Figures 1 and 2; Figures 3 and 4 and the photograph above illustrate three sites). Some regions of the globe and ecosystem types are still underrepresented, but this newest release has improved coverage (see Figures 2a and 2b). Increased data contributions from regional networks in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania helped expand the geographic and temporal coverage of the data set.

The longest continuous flux data records now exceed 25 years. AmeriFlux and the European networks reached 20 years of age in 2016, and other networks host records nearly as long. This combination of longer time series and new sites from undersampled regions make the FLUXNET2015 data set the state of the art for understanding long-term interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere and for addressing questions about year-to-year variability and trends in fluxes.

Such long flux records are also essential for gaining insight on extreme events and the ways that disturbed ecosystems respond over time. They can also help address emerging science questions, such as identifying the causes and effects of the greening of the Arctic, detected by nearly 30 years of remote sensing, or finding what drives the increasing amplitude of seasonal variability of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), observed in nearly 60 years of records from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

This update was also motivated by the opportunity for higher-quality data. The FLUXNET data team and site teams collaborated on extensive data quality control that allowed us to avoid or correct many of the data issues that are common in observed data such as missing sensor calibrations or inconsistent processing of a measured variable. Advances in the science and the availability of complementary data sets also allowed for the creation of new data products, such as uncertainty estimates and better methods for filling long gaps in micrometeorological data.

Earlier FLUXNET data sets were used in hundreds of peer-reviewed papers, for studies ranging from soil microbiology to effects of climate change at a global scale. As a simple metric, a Web of Science keyword search for FLUXNET now yields more than 400 papers. Stimulating new science with useful data products is a main motivation behind the work to create FLUXNET data sets.

What’s Inside

Data collection at FLUXNET sites engenders only minimal disturbance to the ecosystem and produces flux estimates on temporal scales from hours to years, and now decades. Data collection at FLUXNET sites engenders only minimal disturbance to the ecosystem and produces flux estimates representative of spatial scales of hundreds of meters and multiple temporal scales, from hours to years, and now decades. To make the data simple to use by scientists from many disciplines, data included in FLUXNET2015 were consistently quality controlled and gap filled. Also, ecosystem exchange of CO 2 was partitioned into ecosystem respiration (as CO 2 released into the atmosphere) and gross primary production (as CO 2 uptake by the ecosystem).

The FLUXNET2015 data set includes a number of new features. One is the revised and extended data quality checks, which not only increase data quality for individual sites but also help harmonize quality levels among all sites. This uniformity in the data is important for synthesis analyses, which require sites to be comparable.

Also included for the first time are estimates of uncertainties for key steps in the processing. Some of the steps, such as filtering for low wind conditions and partitioning of CO 2 fluxes, were implemented with multiple methods, resulting in more thorough estimates of uncertainties. These uncertainty estimates have been a long-standing request from ecosystem and Earth system modelers and make this data set especially useful for applications like model validation and constraining.

FLUXNET2015 also includes estimated energy corrections that were applied to achieve energy balance closure (between storage and incoming and outgoing energy), which makes the data more useful to climate and ecosystem models that require closed energy budgets when using flux data.

To fill long gaps in meteorological data, FLUXNET2015 used downscaled data based on the ERA-Interim global reanalysis data set, which provides a gridded and uninterrupted record derived using a data-informed model. This approach improved the accuracy of gap-filled micrometeorology data points and of temporally aggregated products such as those at daily or yearly resolutions.

Some of these data products and processing steps, especially the data quality checks, prevented some sites from being included in the data set. As a result, not all sites that contributed data or were part of the LaThuile data set were included in FLUXNET2015. The FLUXNET data team continues to work with these site teams to include data from their sites in future FLUXNET data sets.

Embracing the Benefits—and Challenges—of Open Data

Open data sharing has gained momentum and is becoming a cornerstone for scientific research. In principle, open data sharing doesn’t just benefit users—it also benefits the teams collecting the data by enhancing community integration, collaboration opportunities, data collection protocols, recognition for the data collection and curation work, and fulfilling funding agency requirements on data availability.

Data policies have evolved at least as much as the FLUXNET data sets themselves. In practice, however, sharing data remains complicated. The extra work and the logistics of supporting open sharing are beyond the reach of many scientists. FLUXNET data sets are based on field data collected by many independent teams from many countries. The multisource nature of the data set brings the added challenge of ensuring that the various data collectors receive proper credit when their data are used. Proper attribution is also necessary for site teams to get a better measure of the impact of their work and opportunities to participate in the science using their data. Data policies aimed at addressing these requirements have been put in place to enable data sharing via the services provided by regional networks and FLUXNET.

Data policies have evolved at least as much as the FLUXNET data sets themselves. For the Marconi data set, the policy stated that site teams had to be informed of the data usage and could request work on conflicting topics be postponed. For the LaThuile data set, each site team classified their data into one of three data policy tiers. The most lenient required only acknowledgement of the data source. A middle tier required users to submit proposals, which needed approval by a committee with representatives from each regional network and FLUXNET. In the strictest tier, data access was restricted to the teams who contributed data.

The FLUXNET2015 data policy has matured to allow access to all interested users, with two tiers differing only in the terms for using the data, for example, for publications or class assignments. One tier requires acknowledgments, and the other requires that data providers be given the opportunity to add intellectual contributions and potentially become coauthors. This policy approach allows much broader access to the data and more opportunities to experiment with it.

Over the past decade, many FLUXNET site teams moved from being cautious about data sharing to being advocates for increased openness. FLUXNET’s track record of more than 20 years of sharing data helps pave the way toward reproducible science and should encourage other communities to tackle the challenges of sharing data sets with many sources and users.

Where We Go from Here

The FLUXNET2015 data set can be downloaded from the FLUXNET-Fluxdata website. Download it, use it, discover—have fun! And let us know: Questions, suggestions, and comments can be sent to [email protected]. Site teams interested in contributing data to future FLUXNET data sets are encouraged to contact their regional networks.

There is still much room for improving the spatial coverage and representativeness of future data sets, considering all the existing sites that are potential new data contributors (Figure 2c). We thank the site teams that helped us prepare their site data for inclusion in this data set and urge teams from sites that were not ready in time for this release to work with us to add their sites to upcoming data sets.

Acknowledgments

Site teams are the true engine of all FLUXNET datasets. Their extensive effort in collecting data, often under harsh working conditions, generating quality data products, and providing their data for use by a broad community is invaluable and irreplaceable. The FLUXNET2015 dataset is truly a community achievement!

This work used eddy covariance data acquired and shared by the FLUXNET community, including these networks: AmeriFlux, AfriFlux, AsiaFlux, CarboAfrica, CarboEuropeIP, CarboItaly, CarboMont, ChinaFlux, Fluxnet-Canada, GreenGrass, ICOS, KoFlux, LBA, NECC, OzFlux-TERN, TCOS-Siberia, and USCCC. The ERA-Interim reanalysis data are provided by ECMWF and processed by LSCE. The FLUXNET eddy covariance data processing and harmonization was carried out by the European Fluxes Database Cluster, AmeriFlux Management Project, and Fluxdata project of FLUXNET, with the support of CDIAC and ICOS Ecosystem Thematic Center, and the OzFlux, ChinaFlux and AsiaFlux offices.

94,DR-2015-000134-SOM,This Ugandan innovation is a possible solution for viable drinking water in drought ridden areas - Ventures Africa,https://venturesafrica.com/this-ugandan-innovation-is-a-possible-solution-for-viable-drinking-water-in-drought-ridden-areas/,"Dr. Samuel Otukol, a Ugandan has invented a Water Distillation System Process (DSP) which works by evaporating salty or unclean water at low temperatures before it is condensed into fresh water. Using this technology, condensation is achieved at a much lower cost than using reverse osmosis.

Otukol, the President of Ultimate Water Solutions with a background in forestry, created the DSP to make alternative sources of viable drinking water available in drought ridden areas or where only sea water is available. In a recent interview, Otukol recalled how severe the drought in his home area in Uganda was, which forced him to trek long distances to search for water.

Drought is major feature in most East African countries and occurs when there is a long period of low rainfall in a particular region. In 2011, a severe drought occurred in several East African countries such as Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti and Somalia, caused by an ocean-atmosphere disturbance known as La Nina.

The drought, which interrupted rainfall for two consecutive seasons, led to a mass crop failure and about 50 percent loss of livestock, also caused a shortage in crop harvest and milk production. As a result, the price of food was inflated. About 9.5 million people were in need of assistance and at the end of the drought in 2013, over 100,000 people died as a result of starvation, diseases and other causes.

Farmers typically suffer the most in a drought because with water shortages, they are not usually able to meet crop water demands. Also, because water sourced during the drought period is often polluted by chemicals, access to clean water is limited.

Droughts also reduce availability of electricity and the economy is usually adversely affected because of this reduction in crop exports.

For African countries with poor electricity supply, the Water Distillation System Process also works with solar energy so that many countries can benefit from its ability to mitigate the unpleasant effects of drought.",2015-09-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['viable', 'areas', 'water', 'ridden', 'crop', 'drinking', 'system', 'usually', 'ugandan', 'using', 'solution', 'drought', 'african', 'countries', 'works', 'possible', 'innovation', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English

In Thailand, much imported electricity is used for air conditioning in shopping malls.

The Nam Tha, or Tha River, begins in northern Laos near the Lao-China border and runs southwest to join the Mekong just south of Huay Xay on the Lao-Thai border. In October 2014, I traveled by motorcycle and longtail boat up the Nam Tha, starting from its mouth at Pak Tha, to investigate a dam project on the river. Work on the dam’s access roads and other infrastructure had been underway for months, but no signs of construction were visible as I traveled—the banks were thickly forested, interspersed with patches of swidden agriculture, with occasional thatch villages where I stayed along the way.

The Nam Tha dam is being built by a subsidiary of the China Southern Power Grid, and 95 percent of the electricity it generates will be sold to Thailand. Scheduled to be completed in 2017, the dam will displace over 10,000 ethnic Lao and minority peoples, and during my visit the village Ban Hadmuark was being enlarged into a resettlement town for displaced villagers. (For details on the demographic impacts of the dam, see Olivier Evrard’s article “The Silenced River.”)

In February 2016 I returned to the Nam Tha to document the progress of the dam. This time I hitchhiked with a work truck driving in on the 37 kilometer access road from National Highway 3. I was stunned to discover that this stretch of the river had been transformed into a vast industrial plain, razed flat and crowded with cement trucks, lorries, earth movers, turbine parts, and scrap metal.

This photo essay starts with the Nam Tha as I experienced it in 2014, then switches to the way I encountered it in 2016. However, these images don’t convey the sense of violence that struck me when I entered the dam site a year and a half after seeing it in a nearly pristine state—the machinery, noise, ravaged hillsides, and clouds of dust raised up by gravel crushers, seemed limitless, on a scale to dwarf human individuals, communities, and aspiration.

Still, I hope these images serve in a small way to express the experience of peoples who have no voice or agency in the face of changes imposed upon them by international corporate interests and by their own governmental elite. Any form of protest can lead to police abduction and disappearance for Lao nationals in Laos—therefore, along with the advocacy of NGOs like International Rivers, this type of documentation may currently be one of the only means of dissent against hegemonic “development” which uproots and disenfranchises many for the benefit of a privileged, autocratic few.

1823,FL-2021-000038-KEN,VIDEO: Neck And Neck: Mom And Calf Giraffes Rescued From Flood Island - tntribune.com,https://tntribune.com/video-neck-and-neck-mom-and-calf-giraffes-rescued-from-flood-island/,"Nine critically endangered Rothschild’s giraffes have been rescued after they were isolated by heavy rains that turned their home into a sinking island.

Water levels in Lake Baringo in Kenya have been rising for some time, but in 2020, the rate increased — flooding lakeshore homes, businesses and threatening the lives of the small group of Rothschild’s giraffe on Longicharo Island in Ruko Community Conservancy.

Conservationists have worked around the clock for more than a year to save them. Now, the last two, a mother and calf, are the final pair to be rescued from the island.

The rescuers constructed a special steel barge — “The GiRaft” — in order to carry the giraffes to safety a mile away. Now, with the transfer of the calf named Noelle and her mother Ngarikoni, all the animals are safe.

The giraffes have been moved to a 4,400-acre sanctuary on the mainland.

David O’Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now, which works on over 20 giraffe conservation projects in nine African countries, said: “We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue.

“With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.”

Park rangers had to lure the animals onto the barge using food they were fed on the island, including pellets, acacia leaves, seed pods and mangos.

Each time a giraffe joined the barge, it was sealed, and they were driven to the 4,400-acre fenced sanctuary within the 44,000-acre Ruko Conservancy.

The towermates (as groups of giraffe are called) are together again and safely exploring the Ruko Conservancy, where they have plenty of food and securty.

Approval to move the giraffes was needed from Kenya Wildlife Service. The first giraffe, named Asiwa, was moved in December without incident.

Rothschild’s (Nubian) giraffe are a dwindling subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and Uganda. Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya.

1378,FL-2019-000084-IND,Floods in the Time of NRC: A Toss up Between Life and Citizenship - The Wire,https://thewire.in/rights/assam-flood-nrc-life-citizenship,"Growing up in Kolkata, I used to wait for the northwesterly winds and cloudy skies in the evenings; for the sultry afternoon sun to recede behind clouds, covering the city in long shadows. Then the rains came, hard pellets hitting the streets, pounding windows, strong gusts of wind blowing through the city. Memories of rain spattered afternoons – when Calcuttans unfurled their Mohendra Dutt umbrellas, walked in the downpour, water lapping at their feet, wind blowing against their faces – used to be a joyous prospect.

Not anymore.

As the Earth heats up, rains grow harder, and floods become endemic, people watch the skies with anxiety, not longing. For tens of thousands, living along precarious coastlines and in low-lying areas, in houses of doubtful durability, the onset of the monsoon can be a harbinger of death and destruction.

In 2019, we find a new layer to this emerging narrative. This layer, inserted by politics, is currently playing out in the race to prove one’s citizenship in this country. At this moment, thousands of people in Assam, a majority of them poor, are living in houses where water levels have risen to alarming heights. But people in these submerged houses are unwilling to move to places of safety. They have the noose of a July 31 deadline tightening around their neck. The final National Register of Citizens (NRC) will be published at the end of this month, barely two weeks from now. Till then, flood-affected people – however vulnerable they are to rising, perilous waters – are resolved to guard their documents.

The situation is a toss-up between life and citizenship. You may survive the floods but still not be able to prove your bonafide claim to go on living in the country you have inhabited for decades. What would the survivor of a natural calamity do if she cannot escape the punitive fiat of a “strong” state? She may find herself transported to a detention camp, reduced to the status of a stateless refugee, having to move from place to place filled with anxiety and fear. Her destiny lies in the documents that may or may not prove her citizenship.

It’s heart-breaking when you think of the condition of these homes going under water. These are not glitzy advertorial apartments with swanky safes or lockers built in to ensure the safety of important belongings. Neither do many of those affected have bank accounts and secure vaults. A compassionate state (if that very invocation is itself not an anomaly) committed to protecting the poor and vulnerable would frame rules keeping the interests of such precarious populations in mind. But as history shows, it is the poor, who, without fail, who feel the brunt of ill-conceived policies.

An Indian Express report on Wednesday revealed the predicament of people trying to cope with the ravages of floods and the stringent citizenship test. Many of those stuck in flooded areas are simply refusing to leave their houses, said the report. Parvesh Kumar, a rescuer from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF,) was trying in vain, for two days, to persuade Rina Begum, a resident of Tulsibari village in Assam’s Morigaon district, to leave her half-submerged house. “Over the last 48 hours, as rescuers shuttle her neighbours from their marooned homes to dry land, Begum, a 50-year-old grandmother of four, watched but remained defiant. “How can we leave our home?” she says, standing in waist-deep water,” the report states.

The reporter goes on to say, even when many families agree to leave their homes, they insist on ensuring the safety of their documents. It quotes Parvesh Kumar saying: “So many times, we brought them to safety only to go back again because they realise they have forgotten their document.” Land and home are defining identity markers in minority-dominated areas of Assam. “This could be one of the reasons that they feel so scared to leave their homes,” a local official told the Indian Express.

Climate, culture and refugees

The convergence of floods and the last days and weeks leading up to the final NRC paint a picture of what the world is going to increasingly look like in the days, months and years ahead. Perpetuating cycles of migrants in search of safety and livelihood, refugees produced by climate change and state action will walk in lock-step. The crises of climate and culture will converge to create new refugees. Proving citizenship is going to become the next big battle ground, and the state will step up its demand to produce increasingly more documents to prove that one belongs to the land one considers home.

India knows the trauma of refugees, knows it intimately, and on many fronts. If the 1947 Partition, and the 1971 Bangladesh war of liberation produced one kind of refugees, the displacement of tribals by massive economic projects produced another mass of landless people. Stripped off their homes and lands, residents become migrants become refugees. Against this backdrop, the NRC has opened yet another flank, further muddying and complicating an already fractious political discourse.

This Tuesday, home minister Amit Shah once again indicated his government’s resolve to make the NRC a nationwide project. He was responding to a supplementary question raised by Samajwadi Party member Javed Ali Khan. “Currently, the NRC is a part of Assam Accord. The Centre – as per its election manifesto – is dedicated to weaning out illegal immigrants from every inch of this country. We will make sure that all such immigrants are deported as per international law,” said Shah.

When Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted on 18 May 1980, the initial explosion blew sideways, creating a nearly 600-square-kilometer blast zone—and what has become a prized ecological research area. Dozens of groups have tracked life’s reemergence there, one lupine and ladybug at a time. Now, many of those research projects may be endangered. Last month, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), which manages the land, issued a decision to build a road stretching through the heart of the research area to the banks of Spirit Lake, 5 kilometers northeast of the crater. The agency says the road will service a tunnel that drains the lake to prevent a catastrophic flood, a threat to tens of thousands of people in the valley below.

The USFS decision has set off protests from scientists, including a lawsuit aimed at preventing the road’s construction and charges that the agency failed to consult with researchers. “We absolutely recognize the public safety issue,” says John Bishop, a botanist at Washington State University, Vancouver, who has been working for 31 years in the blast zone, designated a national monument in 1982 in part to encourage long-term ecological research. But, he says, “We think we can protect public safety and protect the heart of the monument. We’ve got to do both.”

When the eruption occurred, the north side of the mountain gave way, producing the largest landslide ever recorded. The avalanche of debris rushed into 890-hectare Spirit Lake, raising its water level by 60 meters and damming the lake’s natural outflow. The lake continued to rise, and officials worried it could cause the debris dam to give way, inundating downstream communities and an estimated $3.65 billion in property, including ports on the Columbia River. In 1985, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a 2.25-kilometer tunnel through the debris dam to allow the lake to drain into nearby Coldwater Creek. But seismic activity has repeatedly damaged the tunnel, requiring repairs.

On 16 March, Eric Veach, USFS supervisor for the region, released a “notice of decision” saying “the current risk situation at Spirit Lake is unacceptable and action is required.” The best option, Veach announced, is to build a 5.5-kilometer-long temporary road from an existing road across the blast zone, known as the Pumice Plain, to Spirit Lake. The road will allow the agency to bring in heavy equipment needed to repair the tunnel, replace a damaged gate that regulates the outgoing water flow, and carry out geological drilling studies of the long-term stability of the debris dam.

Carri LeRoy, an ecologist at Evergreen State University, Olympia, isn’t convinced about the urgency. “They argue it’s an emergency,” she says. But she and others say USFS could continue its practice of flying repair equipment in on helicopters to maintain the tunnel. “There is no imminent threat.”

However, the road’s impact on research would be immediate, says Susan Jane Brown, an attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center who filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court of Washington against USFS on behalf of three scientists and four conservation groups. Pumice Plain is home to 992 research plots, investigating how birds, amphibians, insects, and plants recolonized the shattered landscape. “It is a unique opportunity to look at long-term changes after a massive disturbance,” says James Gawel, an environmental chemist at the University of Washington, Tacoma, who has worked on the area since 2005.

The road would cut through 25 of the research plots, and USFS says it will directly affect about 4% of the total research area. But LeRoy calls that “a gross oversimplification.” The road would also cut across at least eight streams formed since the eruption, which drain into Spirit Lake. As a result, it would also impact everything downstream, including the lake, possibly introducing invasive species. “The impact would be massive,” Bishop says. “If you want to study the reestablishment of [native] life, that will be lost.” LeRoy, who studies the evolution of the newly formed streams, agrees: “There will be no point in studying there anymore.”

Veach acknowledges the road would have downsides for science, writing in his decision that the project “reflects a balance between public safety concerns and effects to ongoing research.” USFS considered other options, including a shorter road. But it would have required building a new parking lot for trucks and equipment on the lake, adding to the project’s ecological footprint. It would also have relied more heavily on helicopters and boats to access repair and drilling sites. The road now planned would extend to a staging site used decades ago for tunnel construction.

USFS’s road doesn’t represent a final plan for draining Spirit Lake. In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine laid out options for a long-term fix, including adding a second tunnel and carving a large channel through the debris dam. The report emphasized the need to include voices of all stakeholders, such as scientists, government agencies, and downstream residents. With the intermediate USFS plan, scientists lament that they have largely been ignored. In April 2020, USFS had issued a finding that the road would have “no significant impact” on local ecology, prompting letters from scientists. Last month’s decision dismissed those complaints.

“There has been no public assessment of the different options,” Bishop says. He favors continuing to use helicopters to service the tunnel and gate. Gawel agrees: “People fly in drilling equipment to other remote locations all the time. They are building a road only to make it cheap and easy.” But Veach’s decision noted the helicopter option would pose delays for repairs, as well as risks for crews. USFS declined to make Veach or other personnel available for interviews.

Construction will begin this spring, USFS says. But Brown is hoping the agency will hold off and work with scientists and other stakeholders to come up with other options. Barring that, she says she will file an injunction to block the road’s construction.

USFS’s announcement may actually make addressing the Spirit Lake threat more difficult by triggering a lawsuit and years of delays, says Robin Gregory, an environmental decision scientist at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. “That’s exactly what you don’t want.”",2021-04-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['planned', 'decision', 'road', 'st', 'tunnel', 'helens', 'prized', 'mount', 'spirit', 'usfs', 'scientists', 'research', 'near', 'lake', 'area', 'service', 'threatens']",Kenya,news article,English
1646,FL-2020-000164-IND,Criticism of new signs at Chilbolton Cow Common - Andover Advertiser,https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/news/18557183.criticism-new-signs-chilbolton-cow-common/,"A PARISH council has defended the installation of “hostile” signage at a beauty spot near Andover, which has made the area look like “some East German park”, in the words of one resident.

Chilbolton Cow Common has seen more than a dozen signs put up in recent weeks, warning visitors not to enter or park in certain areas, to observe social distancing, to treat the area with respect and not to “urinate or defecate on our common”.

The village’s parish council, which installed the signs, says the temporary signage is necessary due to “anti-social and inappropriate behaviours on the Common” which have seen police visit the site on “numerous occasions” in recent months.

But the measures have drawn criticism from some visitors.

One resident said the scene was “one of the most shocking things” he had ever seen, and reminiscent of an “East German park”. Another described the new signs as “hostile” and “a visual eye-sore” in a letter to the Advertiser and hit out at the parish council for installing them in the first place.

The council, however, says that action was necessary amid record numbers of visitors to the site.

A statement from Chilbolton parish council read: “Under normal circumstances I would agree that signage on the Common should be kept to a minimum.

“However, like many other beauty spots up and down the country, we have been trying to manage the Common in quite exceptional circumstances with record high numbers of people visiting the site. This has prompted a number of concerns being raised by local residents.”

Those concerns include parking issues, said to be a “hot topic” for a number of years, plus an “increase in complaints about anti-social and inappropriate behaviours on the Common such as the use of BBQs, using parts of the Common as a ‘open-air toilet’ and dis-regarding social distancing measures.”

The authority also says the temporary signage has, so far, been working.

Its statement continued: “The permanent signage that we have has proven to be nowhere near sufficient to manage the large numbers visiting the site and as a temporary measure we agreed to put high profile visible notices to ensure that people visiting the site know what behaviours are expected of them. Since erecting the signage and making changes to the area where cars park we have seen significant improvements. By and large the vast majority of visitors have understood the need for the signage and behaved responsibly.

“As a Parish Council we would like to hold a Public Meeting (when it is safe to do so) to discuss all of these issues and get the broader views of our local residents. We do not propose to do this until the Autumn at the earliest which will give us chance to reflect on all of the options and implications.”",2020-07-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['chilbolton', 'visitors', 'council', 'parish', 'signs', 'site', 'seen', 'criticism', 'cow', 'common', 'signage', 'visiting', 'temporary', 'park']",India,news article,English

December 09, 2019 09:45 AM

KAMPALA - Ugandan authorities say the death toll from a week of floods and mudslides has risen to 36 people and left thousands stranded after heavy rains swept across a mountainous region.

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.

Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.

The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.

“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.

Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.

“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.

Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.

Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.

Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.

The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.",2019-12-09 08:00:00+00:00,"['continue', 'heavy', 'ugandas', 'say', 'week', 'waterborne', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'death', 'toll', 'unusually', 'left', 'rises']",Uganda,news article,English

(Bloomberg) -- Despite Beijing’s best efforts, asset bubbles are forming in China.Home prices are soaring, prompting officials to revive the idea of a national property tax. A surge in raw material prices spurred pledges to increase domestic supply, toughen market oversight, and crack down on speculation and hoarding.The rapid gains are challenging the central bank’s ability to restrain inflation without hiking borrowing costs or making a sharp turn in monetary policy -- something the People’s Bank of China has said it will avoid. The risk is the government’s attempts to curb price increases won’t be enough, forcing the central bank’s hand at a vulnerable time for domestic consumption.That would be a shock to the nation’s financial markets, which are pricing in a relatively benign scenario. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen to the lowest level in eight months, while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index is the least volatile since January. The calm contrasts with the rest of the world, where investors are becoming increasingly obsessed with how central banks may react to the threat of an overheating global economy.“How to mitigate the boom in property and commodities without tightening macro policy -- it’s a real challenge for the Chinese government,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.More than 15 months after the pandemic first forced China to cut rates and inject trillions of yuan into the financial system, policy makers in Beijing are -- like many others across the world -- dealing with the aftermath. As the global economic recovery accelerates, some are being forced to act because of inflation: Brazil in March became the first Group of 20 nation to lift borrowing costs, with Turkey and Russia following suit. Even Iceland hiked a short-term rate in May.Others, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have insisted spikes in prices are only temporary. The PBOC also downplayed inflation worries in its first-quarter monetary report, published shortly after data showed factory prices surged 6.8% in April -- the fastest pace since 2017.What Bloomberg Economists Say...“It will be a challenge for China to contain rising producer prices because few commodities are priced within the country. There’s not much China can do, and even tightening monetary policy will not be able to change the situation,” said David Qu, China economist at Bloomberg Economics.-- Bloomberg Terminal subscribers can access more insight HEREWhile the rapid increase in commodity prices moderated in recent days, a continuation of gains could pressure companies to pass on rising costs to consumers, who are already spending less than expected. Analysts at Huachuang Securities Co. said in a May 9 report that prices of consumer goods, like home appliances and furniture, as well as electric vehicles and food, are rising. Still, there’s little evidence of demand-driven pressures, with core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, fairly subdued.The threat of inflation -- coupled with a fragile economy -- tends to be bad news for stocks because of how it erodes corporate profits, and for bonds it reduces the value of future cash flows. Accelerating prices walloped China’s bond market in 2019, and contributed to a steep selloff in stocks in early 2016.In a sign of how seriously that threat is being taken, China’s cabinet said Wednesday more effort needs to be taken to tackle rising commodity prices. A PBOC official said China should allow the yuan to appreciate to offset the impact of rising import prices, according to an article published Friday. The currency is trading near an almost three-year high against the dollar.Imported inflation is a headache for China’s leaders already dealing with risks caused by a surge in capital inflows. In recent years Beijing opened investment channels to allow more funds into its financial system. The goal was to use foreign institutions’ heft to anchor its markets and stabilize its currency, but the record liquidity unleashed by global central banks in the wake of the pandemic is now pressuring prices in China.That’s prompted some strong language from senior officials. Top securities regulator Yi Huiman said in March large flows of “hot money” into China must be strictly controlled. The same month, banking regulator Guo Shuqing said he was “very worried” that asset bubbles in overseas markets would burst soon, posing a risk to the global economy.Deciding whether recent spikes in prices are temporary or a permanent shift toward sustained inflation is something Chinese policy makers have to grapple with. For now, Beijing’s current approach of jawboning, boosting supply and penalizing speculation appears to be targeted at the former.“It’s still too early to tell if China can contain the surge in producer prices, and if it can’t, whether that will have large-scale impact on consumer prices,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “This inflation is largely imported -- it’s not something that can be solved by the PBOC.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",2021-05-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['bhp', 'inflation', 'global', 'lawsuit', 'court', 'dam', 'brazil', '69', 'uk', 'reconsider', 'billion', 'exclusive', 'central', 'bloomberg', 'china', 'rising', 'prices', 'costs', 'policy', 'banks']",Brazil,news article,English

What happens to a rich and unique biome when so much is destroyed?

Protected areas and indigenous territories from the Amazon Geo-Referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network.

The unprecedented fires in the wetland have attracted less attention than blazes in Australia, the Western United States and the Amazon, its celebrity sibling to the north. But while the Pantanal is not a global household name, tourists in the know flock there because it is home to exceptionally high concentrations of breathtaking wildlife: Jaguars, tapirs, endangered giant otters and bright blue hyacinth macaws. Like a vast tub, the wetland swells with water during the rainy season and empties out during the dry months. Fittingly, this rhythm has a name that evokes a beating heart: the flood pulse.

The wetland, which is larger than Greece and stretches over parts of Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, also offers unseen gifts to a vast swath of South America by regulating the water cycle upon which life depends. Its countless swamps, lagoons and tributaries purify water and help prevent floods and droughts. They also store untold amounts of carbon, helping to stabilize the climate.

For centuries, ranchers have used fire to clear fields and new land. But this year, drought worsened by climate change turned the wetlands into a tinderbox and the fires raged out of control.

“The extent of fires is staggering,” said Douglas C. Morton, who leads the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and studies fire and food production in South America. “When you wipe out a quarter of a biome, you create all kinds of unprecedented circumstances.”

His analysis showed that at least 22 percent of the Pantanal in Brazil has burned since January, with the worst fires, in August and September, blazing for two months straight.

Naturally occurring fire plays a role in the Pantanal, in addition to the burning by ranchers. The flames are usually contained by the landscape’s mosaic of water. But this year’s drought sucked these natural barriers dry. The fires are far worse than any since satellite records began.

Instruments on Terra and Aqua satellites have experienced periodic failures. · Source: NASA Terra and Aqua satellite data, based on detections with greater than 95 percent confidence levels.

The fires are also worse than any in the memory of the Guató people, an Indigenous group whose ancestors have lived in the Pantanal for thousands of years.

Guató leaders in an Indigenous territory called Baía dos Guató said the fires spread from the ranches that surround their land, and satellite images confirm that the flames swept in from the outside. When fire started closing in on the home of Sandra Guató Silva, a community leader and healer, she fought to save it with the help of her son, grandson and a boat captain with a hose.

For many desperate hours, she said, they threw buckets of river water and sprayed the area around the house and its roof of thatched palm leaves. They succeeded in defending it, but at least 85 percent of her people’s territory burned, according to Instituto Centro de Vida, a nonprofit group that monitors land use in the area. Throughout the Pantanal, almost half of the Indigenous lands burned, an investigative journalism organization called Agência Pública found.

Now Ms. Guató Silva mourns the loss of nature itself. “It makes me sick,” she said. “The birds don’t sing anymore. I no longer hear the song of the Chaco chachalaca bird. Even the jaguar that once scared me is suffering. That hurts me. I suffer from depression because of this. Now there is a hollow silence. I feel as though our freedom has left us, has been taken from us with the nature that we have always protected.”

Now these people of the wetlands, some still coughing after weeks of smoke, are depending on donations of water and food. They fear that once the rains come in October, ash will run into the rivers and kill the fish they rely on for their food and livelihood.

“I couldn’t help but think, our Pantanal is dead,” said Eunice Morais de Amorim, another member of the community. “It is so terrible.”

Scientists are scrambling to determine an estimate of animals killed in the fires. While large mammals and birds have suffered casualties, many were able to run or fly away. It appears that reptiles, amphibians and small mammals have fared the worst. In places like California, small animals often take refuge underground during wildfires. But in the Pantanal, scientists say, fires burn underground too, fueled by dried-out wetland vegetation. One of the hard-hit places was a national park designated as a United Nations World Heritage site.

“I don’t want to be an alarmist,” said José Sabino, a biologist at the Anhanguera-Uniderp University in Brazil who studies the Pantanal, “but in a region where 25 percent has burned, there is a huge loss.”

As the worst flames raged in August and September, biologists, ecotourism guides and other volunteers turned into firefighters, sometimes working 24 hours at a time. Fernando Tortato, a conservation scientist with Panthera, a group that advocates for big cats, visited the Pantanal in early August to install cameras for his research monitoring jaguars and ocelots. But he found the camera sites burned.

“I said to my boss, I need to change my job,” Mr. Tortato said. “I need to be a firefighter.” Instead of returning home to his family, he spent much of the next two months digging fire breaks with a bulldozer in an urgent attempt to protect forested areas.

One day in September, working under an orange sky, he and his team finished a huge semicircular fire break, using a wide river along one side to protect more than 3,000 hectares, he said, a vital refuge for wildlife. But as the men stood there, pleased with their accomplishment, they watched as flaming debris suddenly jumped the river, igniting the area they thought was safe. They raced into boats and tried to douse the spread, but the flames quickly climbed too high.

“That’s the moment that we lost hope, almost,” Mr. Tortato said. “But the next day we woke up and started again.”

Mr. Tortato knows of three injured jaguars, one with third-degree burns on her paws. All were treated by veterinarians. Now, biologists are braced for the next wave of deaths from starvation; first the herbivores, left without vegetation, and then the carnivores, left without the herbivores.

“It’s a cascade effect,” Mr. Tortato said.

Animal rescue volunteers have flocked to the Pantanal, delivering injured animals to pop-up veterinary triage stations and leaving food and water for other animals to find. Larissa Pratta Campos, a veterinary student, has helped treat wild boar, marsh deer, birds, primates and a raccoon-like creature called a coati.

“We are working in the middle of a crisis,” Ms. Pratta Campos said. “I have woken up many times in the middle of the night to tend to animals here.”

Last week, the O Globo newspaper reported that firefighting specialists from Brazil's main environmental protection agency were stymied by bureaucratic procedures, delaying their deployment by four months.

Given the historic scope of the fires, their long-term consequences on the Pantanal are unclear. The ecosystem’s grasslands may recover quickly, followed by its shrublands and swamps over the next few years, said Wolfgang J. Junk, a scientist who specializes in the region. But the forests will require decades or centuries.

Even more critical than the impact of this year’s fires, scientists say, is what they tell us about the underlying health of the wetlands. Like a patient whose high fever signals a dangerous infection, the extent of the wildfires is a symptom of grave threats to the Pantanal, both from inside and out.

More than 90 percent of the Pantanal is privately owned. Ranchers have raised cattle there for hundreds of years, and ecologists emphasize that many do so sustainably. But new farmers are moving in, often with little understanding of how to use fire properly, said Cátia Nunes, a scientist from the Brazilian National Institute for Science and Technology in Wetlands. Moreover, cattle farming in the highlands has put pressure on local farmers to increase the size of their herds, using more land as they do so.

Eduardo Eubank Campos, a fifth-generation rancher, remembers his family using controlled burns to clear the land when he was a boy. He said they stopped after adding an ecotourism lodge to their 7,000 hectare property, which now includes reserves and fields on which they raise about 2,000 head of cattle and horses. This year, thanks to firebreaks, a water tank truck and workers quickly trained to fight fire, they were able to keep the flames at bay. The worst impact was on his ecotourism business, hit first by the coronavirus and then by the wildfires. It brings in three-quarters of his revenue.

Mr. Eubank Campos struggles to understand who would set fires when the land was so dry. “Pantaneiros know this is not the time to do burns,” Mr. Eubank Campos said, using a term for the locals that also conveys a culture built up over centuries ranching in the wetland. “They don’t want to destroy their own land.”

The Brazilian federal police are investigating the fires, some of which appear to have been illegally targeting forests.

Still, when asked about the biggest threat to the Pantanal, Mr. Eubank Campos’s answer highlights the region’s political and cultural fault lines. “I fear those organizations that come here wanting to exploit the issue and eventually ‘close’ the Pantanal, turn it into one big reserve and kick out the Pantaneiros,” he said.

Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who campaigned on a promise to weaken conservation regulations, is popular in the region.

But Mr. Eubank Campos agrees with ecologists on a major threat to the Pantanal that comes from its borders and beyond.

Because ecosystems are interconnected, the well-being of the wetland is at the mercy of the booming agriculture in the surrounding highlands. The huge fields of soy, other grains and cattle — commodities traded around the world — cause soil erosion that flows into the Pantanal, clogging its rivers so severely that some have become accidental dams, robbing the area downstream of water.

The rampant deforestation and related fires in the neighboring Amazon also create a domino effect, disrupting the rainforest’s “flying rivers” of precipitation that contribute to rainfall to the Pantanal. Damming for hydroelectric power deflects water away, scientists say, and a proposal to channelize the wetland’s main river would make it drain too quickly.

But perhaps the most ominous danger comes from even further afield: climate change. The effects that models have predicted, a much hotter Pantanal alternating between severe drought and extreme rainfall, are already being felt, scientists say. A study published this year found that climate change poses “a critical threat” to the ecosystem, damaging biodiversity and impairing its ability to help regulate water for the continent and carbon for the world. In less than 20 years, it found that the northern Pantanal may turn into a savanna or even an arid zone.

“We are digging our grave,” said Karl-Ludwig Schuchmann, an ecologist with Brazil’s National Institute of Science and Technology in Wetlands and one of the study’s authors.

To save the Pantanal, scientists offer solutions: Reduce climate change immediately. Practice sustainable agriculture in and around the wetland. Pay ranchers to preserve forests and other natural areas on their land. Increase ecotourism. Do not divert the Pantanal’s waters, because its flood pulse is its life.

“Everybody talks about, ‘we have to avoid this and that,’” Dr. Schuchmann said. “But little is done.”",2020-10-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['amazon', 'worlds', 'water', 'indigenous', 'wetland', 'brazil', 'fires', 'inferno', 'tropical', 'largest', 'area', 'pantanal', 'guató', 'land']",Brazil,news article,English
1999,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Climate change: impending GLOFs and other disasters - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/article/97371/climate-change-impending-glofs-and-other-disasters,"The Shisper Glacier is melting again and at least 21 households in Hassanabad have been deemed at risk

Taus Bibi, 70, was tending to her goats in Sherabad, an area in Hassanabad, Hunza, when she heard a loud sound of something crashing into the nearby water channel. One of her grandchildren followed shortly, running and asking her to evacuate to a safe area as a flood was dangerously close to their home. Taus had no choice but to run to a nearby orchard where she and other people displaced by the flood spent over 35 hours.

Hassanabad also had one of the major power stations for the district of Hunza, which was also wiped out, depriving the villagers of electricity for many days. Such floods, resulting from glacial lake outbursts have been hitting the village of Hassanabad, (which includes Sherabad, Harum, Roshanabad and main Hassanabad) since 2010. Out of all the surging glaciers in the Karakorum Range, the Shisper Glacier is 12 kms long and has been impacting the most lives in the Hassanabad region.

Melted glacier water can form ice walls, which end up creating reservoirs for the rest of the melted ice. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) occur when these ice walls fail, unleashing entire lakes on nearby villages and roads. There are at least 7,000 glaciers in Gilgit Baltistan out of which 3,044 have formed glacial lakes while 33 are at the risk of outburst flooding. Such floods, if not mitigated, threaten at least seven million people in both Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In March 2017, in order to prevent large scale flooding, a project was started to scale up the lakes that were at the risk of bursting. The Ministry of Climate Change has been leading the project along with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and funding from the Green Climate Fund. The Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II) project is a part of Reducing Risks and Vulnerabilities from GLOF in Northern Pakistan, also known as GLOF I.

The Shisper Glacier is melting again with the advent of summer in Pakistan and despite the efforts by GLOF I, at least 21 households in Hassanabad have been deemed at risk and families have been asked to evacuate to safer locations while the Gilgit Baltistan administration has declared a state of emergency in the surrounding areas. Teams from both GLOF and the Pakistan Meteorological Department are keeping a close eye on the lake using ground penetrating radars and Differential GPS. Water levels are also being monitored. An automatic weather station has also been installed in Shisper to monitor the weather in real time.

Community Based Disaster Risk Management Committees (CBDRMC) have been formed by training locals in disaster risk reduction, they have also undergone mock drills while being trained in disaster preparedness.

It has been decided that the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) in collaboration with GLOF II will build gabion walls to protect the population in case of a flood, while irrigation channels are also on the cards along with building of shelters, where people may run to in case there is a disaster.

Emergency response equipment has also been handed out to the locals, which include generators, UPS batteries, inverters, binoculars, walkie talkies, GPS, gas cylinders, portal generators, cyber shot cameras, range finders and small solar panels.

Despite these measures, the locals stay fearful, as disaster management is not as good as living disaster free. They are waiting for permanent solutions, such as migration options to safer places that are not in the path of GLOFs, however, with the very real threat of climate change, it is only a matter of time before we have a lot more than just one village and glacier to think about.",2021-04-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['shisper', 'climate', 'gilgit', 'disasters', 'change', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'risk', 'hassanabad', 'water', 'glofs', 'baltistan', 'impending', 'disaster', 'glof']",Pakistan,news article,English
1213,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Ancient Water Underlies Arid Egypt - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/ancient-water-underlies-arid-egypt,"A hidden trove of groundwater is left over from the last ice age.

Aside from the Nile River’s green corridor, much of northeastern Africa is desert. But the arid landscape hides a secret: Vast quantities of groundwater fill an underground aquifer that spans four countries.

In the future, as Egypt’s population and agriculture expand, groundwater will become a more important resource. A new study using chloride isotopes to date the groundwater under Egypt’s Eastern Desert has found that the water in smaller, shallower aquifers is refilled by the larger, deeper aquifer, where vast quantities of groundwater date to the last ice age.

Most Egyptians live along the Nile and get their drinking and irrigation water from the river. Currently, just 7% of the country’s water usage is supplied by groundwater, but that number is expected to rise, said Mahmoud Sherif, a hydrogeochemist at the University of Delaware and lead author of the new study, published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. “In the future, as Egypt’s population and agriculture expand, groundwater will become a more important resource.”

The research team set out to date the age of the groundwater under the Eastern Desert to determine the aquifers’ responses to climate conditions and the recharge rates of shallower formations called alluvial aquifers. “These aquifers are closer to the surface and easier to access than the deeper Nubian aquifer,” Sherif told Eos.

“We expected the water in the shallow aquifers to be less than 100 years old,” Sherif said, with the clock starting when the rainwater falls from the atmosphere onto Earth. Instead, some of the water samples were more than a thousand times that age.

The researchers used the radioactive isotope chlorine-36, which has a half-life of 300,000 years, to date groundwater samples collected from 29 wells scattered around the Eastern Desert. They found that the oldest samples in the alluvial aquifers were more than 200,000 years old. “This was really surprising,” Sherif said.

Mixing with the Nubian aquifer helps explain the age: “This region is tectonically active and has a lot of deep-seated faults. Groundwater from the Nubian aquifer is making its way up along these faults and recharging the alluvial aquifers,” Sherif said.

The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is the largest known fossil water aquifer in the world. Spanning more than 2 million square kilometers across Sudan, Chad, Libya, and Egypt, it contains more than 150,000 cubic kilometers of groundwater—more water than the Nile River discharges in 500 years.

The water in the Nubian aquifer dates back to the Pleistocene epoch, when Earth weathered periodic deep freezes.

“During the Ice Age, what is now desert was a lot greener and wetter,” said Cliff Voss, a hydrogeologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., who was not involved in the new study. Today, the Nubian aquifer may receive a little water during flash flood season, but the recharge rate is “effectively zero,” Voss said.

The new study offers new data on the little-studied Eastern Desert, and the findings match up well with previous studies of the Western Desert and the rest of the region underlain by the Nubian aquifer, said Voss.

“In 2014, we mapped out the Nubian aquifer in the hopes that the four countries wouldn’t have to compete over their share of the water,” Voss said of his 2014 study published in the Hydrogeology Journal. “Fortunately, all four countries essentially have water forever, especially Egypt and Libya.”

To date, Libya is the only country to tap into the vast water reserves of the Nubian aquifer on a large scale. The pipelines known as the Great Man-Made River carry water from 1,300 wells more than 2,800 kilometers inland across the desert to the coastal cities of Tripoli, Benghazi, and Sirte.

The connection between the alluvial aquifers and the Nubian aquifer means that communities and agricultural operations in the Eastern Desert have an almost unlimited supply of groundwater without having to drill very deep.

“It’s a gorgeous supply of water, clean, not salty,” Voss says. “You can drink it without any filtration or treatment.”

854,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Successful elections and 'political dialogues' push democracy forward in West Africa and the Sahel - UN News,https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/07/1043181,"In the past six months, presidential polls have taken place in Nigeria (23 February), Senegal (24 February) and Mauritania (22 June), Mohammad Ibn Chambas, who also heads the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), told the Security Council.

Ahead of the “fiercely contested elections”, he said that he conveyed to all presidential candidates, regional and international partners, “the need to uphold the high electoral standards in the region”.

Beyond relatively smooth electoral processes, he continued, “the past six months also saw the opening of political dialogues between the ruling government and the opposition in Burkina Faso and Benin, while in Ghana, political stakeholders started a dialogue on vigilante groups”.

Moreover, just this month in Liberia, “the government respected the people s right to peaceful protests and agreed to begin a dialogue on strengthening the economy”, he affirmed.

However, Mr. Chambas pointed out that pre-electoral and post-electoral periods “continue to be characterized by tensions, antagonistic contests and disputes, including around non-consensual constitutional amendments”.

“Addressing such potential sources of conflict remains a major priority ahead of the upcoming cycle of high-stake presidential elections in West Africa scheduled for next year in Burkina Faso, Cote d Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Niger and Togo”, he explained, noting that tensions around electoral periods “derail the necessary attention to the pressing need to address questions of development and inequality”.

Challenges pervade

Several countries in the region continue to struggle with human rights challenges. Mr. Chambas expressed particular concern over what he termed “the instrumentalization of the judiciary for political objectives” as well as a “predominant sentiment of impunity for violent crimes”, which undermines the rule of law.

And what’s more, a persistently high level of inequality continues to negatively impact women, “making them prone to gender-based violence”, he observed.

The UNOWAS chief cited “violent extremism” as being responsible for the volatile security situation “in the entire Sahel”.",2019-07-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'west', 'successful', 'democracy', 'push', 'forward', 'dialogues', 'electoral', 'chambas', 'violent', 'tensions', 'security', 'political', 'presidential', 'unowas', 'elections', 'sahel']",Ghana,news article,English
937,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Greenwash Alert: Fortune Brands' Skinny Girl Cocktails Pulled off the Shelves of Whole Foods – Eat Drink Better - Eat. Drink. Better.,https://eatdrinkbetter.com/articles/greenwash-alert-fortune-brands-skinny-girl-cocktails-pulled-off-the-shelves-of-whole-foods/,"Skinny Girl cocktails, the fastest growing spirit brand in America and the brain child of Bethenny Frankel of the Real Housewives of New York City, has been pulled off the shelves of Whole Foods after they learned that ‘the natural ingredients are not so natural.’

One has to applaud Whole Foods for taking action against a drink that seems to have committed two sins of greenwash: ‘The Sin of No Proof’ and ‘The Sin of Irrelevance.’ Kim Conte at Cafe Mom had the best analysis:

… there’s no ingredient list on the bottle. Bethany herself has marketed the product as containing “natural flavors, lightly sweetened with agave nectar and made with premium Blue Agave clear tequlia,” but that’s the extent of what we know about its ingredients. Apparently, this wasn’t enough for Whole Foods. The chain allegedly removed the product from its shelves because they discovered that the “natural flavors” weren’t so “natural” (as if that term has any meaning anyway).

A little digging by Absurd2sublime.com, a fan site that follows all things RH, reports that allegedly it was the ‘caramel color’ that did in Skinny Girl. Hmmm…

And while it was laudable that Whole Foods removed the product from its shelves, the whole incident has been kept extremely quiet. The Skinny Girl website makes no mention of the Whole Foods removal nor does the Whole Foods site. And, the cocktails are still are available in hundreds of outlets across America. While Bethenny Frankel may not know about the FTC Green Guide rules on green marketing, brand owners Beam Global Spirits & Wine a unit of Fortune Brands Inc., the makers of Jim Beam, Canadian Club and Courvoisier, should know better.",2020-11-10 15:59:37+00:00,"['foods', 'skinny', 'cocktails', 'natural', 'shelves', 'site', 'removed', 'product', 'fortune', 'greenwash', 'drink', 'eat', 'girl', 'pulled', 'sin', 'know']",China,news article,English
