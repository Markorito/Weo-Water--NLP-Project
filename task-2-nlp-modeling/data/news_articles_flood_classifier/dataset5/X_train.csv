DAVID TILLMAN: Hello, I'm meteorologist David Tillman with your one-minute weather forecast. The threat for heavy rain is not over, and it's going to come from moisture in the Gulf of Mexico that the National Hurricane Center is now giving a 20% chance of developing. So that's an 80% chance that it will not develop.

But all of this moisture is going to be lifting in our general direction. And that means for the next couple of days, it's going to be pretty wet around here. Things are quiet out there overnight, but this moisture is going to be moving in our direction.

We think the deep moisture will start to move in as we get into Friday afternoon. That's when scattered heavy downpours are going to be likely around southeast Texas. And there could be some instances of some street flooding as well with this activity. It'll last overnight on Friday into Saturday morning.

And off and on, on Saturday, we'll see these downpours around. That as we get into Sunday, we'll begin to see some of this rain hit off to the west of us, but not before producing a good one to two, maybe three inches of rain around southeast Texas.

There could be some isolated places that get up to four inches of rain. Here's the extended forecast. We're calling for an 80% chance for rain Friday afternoon, evening and night, 70% on Saturday, 40% on Sunday, and then we'll be back to 20% as we head into next week.",2021-05-21 01:13:14+00:00,"['southeast', 'rain', 'moisture', 'tillman', 'going', 'downpours', '20', 'system', 'chance', 'gulf', 'thats', 'tropical', 'heavy', 'development']",Nigeria,news article,English
1849,FL-2017-000067-BRA,"""Amazon's Belo Monte dam cuts Xingu River flow 85%; a crime, Indigenous say"" - Mongabay.com",https://news.mongabay.com/2021/03/amazons-belo-monte-dam-cuts-xingu-river-flow-85-a-crime-indigenous-say/,"In February, IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental agency permitted Belo Monte mega-dam operator Norte Energia to drastically reduce flows to the Volta Grande (Big Bend) of the Xingu River for at least a year. That decision reversed an earlier ruling to maintain much higher Xingu River flows and the fishery — as legally required.

The flow reduction will leave 70% of usually-flooded forest dry this season, causing massive fish mortality and diminished reproduction, experts say. Community group Xingu Vivo Para Sempre denounced the decision as “a death sentence for the Xingu” and demanded IBAMA’s and Norte Energia’s presidents be “criminally prosecuted.”

Norte Energia has funded projects to mitigate the reduced flow, collecting and dropping fruit into the river for fish to feed on, and releasing captive-bred fish. But scientists say these approaches are unscientific and will likely be ineffective, and can’t make up for the loss of the river’s seasonal flood pulse, upon which fish depend.

Residents say the government has spread misinformation, telling Brazilian consumers that their electricity bills would go up if Belo Monte released more water to maintain the Xingu’s ecosystem — something Norte Energia is obligated to do. At present, water levels on the Volta Grande have not been restored.

Bel Juruna, of the Juruna (Yudjá) Indigenous people, points her camera at the Xingu River, beside which she lives in Mïratu village in the Paciçamba Indigenous Territory on the 130-kilometer (81-mile) Volta Grande (Big Bend), in Pará state, Brazil.

The video shows a shoulder-high, light-colored waterline streaking a dark exposed boulder. Just days before, that boulder was mostly submerged and the river ran at a much higher level, but its flow has been drastically, suddenly, intentionally, and possibly illegally, reduced — threatening the Xingu’s fishery and the people who depend on it for food and livelihoods.

On February 8, Belo Monte mega-dam operator Norte Energia received permission from IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental agency, to immediately reduce river flows to less than 13% of normal — shifting the water to the dam’s electricity-producing turbines. This dramatic flow reduction was completely unanticipated by riverine Indigenous and traditional peoples, Bel’s video shows the effects: canoes with outboard motors stranded on dry rocks, aquatic vegetation exposed to the air.

“These plants are usually on the bottom [of the river]; they are water plants. And because the water won’t come [here] any more, they’re all going to die,” Bel says.

Norte Energia’s action comes during the piracema, a time of year when fish should be traveling on seasonally rising waters, deep into the flooded forest to feed and spawn. The government’s water reduction decision effectively closes the door on this reproductive window — an opportunity that comes but once a year.

“The Volta Grande will turn into a cemetery. A cemetery of fish, a cemetery of dead trees,” Bel says.

Norte Energia’s Hydrogram B permitted

In the second week of February, Norte Energia diverted more than 85% of the Xingu’s normal flow away from the Volta Grande, where thousands of Indigenous and traditional fisherfolk live. The company’s diversion to the Belo Monte dam reduced river flow abruptly from early-February speeds of 10,900 cubic meters per second (m3/s) to 1,600 m3/s. (The historical average flows before the dam was built were 12,736 m3/s.)

On February 8, IBAMA president Eduardo Fortunato Bim signed an agreement allowing Norte Energia to implement the company’s so-called Hydrogram B, an artificial hydrological regime that will remove 73% of normal annual Xingu River flows from the Volta Grande.

The socio-environmental consequences, say experts, will be catastrophic. Hydrogram B “will cause the end of the cyclical, ecological phenomenon of the [annual] flood pulse, which guarantees fishes’ and turtles’ access to their feeding areas. There will be high amounts of mortality and, in those [aquatic animals] who survive, loss of nutritional condition,” Juarez Pezzuti from the Federal University of Pará wrote in an email to Mongabay,

Turtles, of “extremely high cultural significance” to the Juruna and other riverine people, “will no longer be able to accumulate the energy necessary to produce eggs. The number of times they lay eggs and the number of eggs per nest will be drastically reduced.”

In a note to Mongabay on Hydrogram B’s effects, Norte Energia states, “There is no technical-scientific proof, nor any indications at present, that the flow [regime] practiced by Belo Monte can cause mortality of fish or turtles,” citing “robust monitoring.” Independent scientists allege Norte Energia’s monitoring studies are flawed.

Lorena Curuaia, a leader of the Curuaia people, of Iawá village, sent Mongabay audio commenting on IBAMA’s decision: “This is absurd. Once again, we see the fauna, the flora, totally threatened, especially all the biodiversity. We know that the normal flow of water on the Volta Grande and the whole Xingu Basin doesn’t work that way.

“So they are assaulting nature again. To do what?,” she asks. “To generate energy, to generate financial gain for them, unfortunately leaving biodiversity to the wayside? We are indignant.”

The leader demands, “We want a response from IBAMA itself, saying why they accepted this from Belo Monte.” IBAMA did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

Norte Energia’s studies on Hydrogram B rejected as faulty

In 2009, IBAMA’s technical team rejected Norte Energia’s extreme low flow Hydrogram B proposal as being unable to maintain life on the Volta Grande, something the Belo Monte dam operator is legally mandated to do. In December 2019, IBAMA ordered Norte Energia to study alternative hydrological regimes.

But when IBAMA reviewed the new studies, submitted in December 2020, they found that Norte Energia had only presented an analysis of Hydrogram B versus the historical natural flow, and had offered no alternative flow plans. This limited comparison made it impossible for experts to analyze alternative hydrological regimes, says Pezzuti. Agreeing with that assessment is Camila Ribas of the National Institute for Amazon Research and the American Museum of Natural History, after she had access to the studies.

Consequently, on February 2, 2021 IBAMA’s technical team rejected Norte Energia’s studies as “faulty” and incomplete.

What should have happened next, says Ribas, is Norte Energia should have had to redo its studies, addressing IBAMA’s critiques, and then resubmit. Until then, IBAMA’s “provisional hydrogram,” with higher river flows — in place since April 2019 — should have continued.

Political pressure on IBAMA and misinformation

But IBAMA allegedly received intense pressure from other ministries within the Jair Bolsonaro administration, lobbying it to reverse its expected upcoming decision to maintain provisional hydrogram water releases to the Volta Grande. For two months, IBAMA had signaled that Norte Energia would have to return significant amounts of water to the river to prevent further ecosystem harm.

Meanwhile, Ribas recalls that the Mines and Energy department and the electricity agency ANEEL “leaked supposedly internal documents” to the press, claiming that if IBAMA ordered Norte Energia to divert less water from the Volta Grande, then Brazilian consumers’ electricity bills would jump dramatically in cost.

That claim, according to Ribas and Pezzuti, is false.

According to Pezzuti, “The company claimed [Belo Monte’s] non-production of energy would make it necessary to produce energy by activating thermoelectric plants” to make up an energy shortfall, which would supposedly greatly raise costs. But, he says, Norte Energia had presented outdated data on Brazil’s hydroelectric reserves, giving a false picture of Brazil’s current hydroelectric energy potential.

In fact, in the current rainy season, Amazon hydroelectric reservoirs are full. “The majority of hydroelectric plants [in Brazil] have a good level and flows, and so less energy [coming from] Belo Monte won’t generate the [electricity] deficit that’s being threatened by the press and the government,” says Pezzuti. Norte Energia did not respond to Mongabay’s question on this matter.

Political interference and an environmental crime?

Apparently, IBAMA president Bim contradicted his own technical team’s conclusions to strike the February 8 agreement with Norte Energia’s president, Paulo Roberto Pinto, allowing the company to immediately implement Hydrogram B.

Bim is thought to have circumvented IBAMA organizational procedures and overruled his own director of licensing Jônatas Souza da Trindade, who should have made the decision, notes Pezzuti. In a note to Mongabay, Licensing General Coordinator Régis Fontana Pinto stated, “The decisions pertinent to the application of the Belo Monte [dam] hydrogram are taken in the purview of IBAMA’s president, though supplied with information by the technical team, by me as General Coordinator, and by the Environmental Licensing director.”

This agreement directly violates Article 231 of Brazil’s 1988 constitution, Pezzuti says, which states that hydroelectric plants can’t impact Indigenous lands. It also appears to violate international conventions such as ILO 169, ratified in Brazil as Decree 5,051, which protects traditional activities such as fishing as essential for cultural preservation. Further infringed regulations may include Law 11,346 ensuring Nutritional and Food Security, Law 9,985 protecting “the natural resources necessary for traditional populations’ subsistence,” and Decree 6,040 guaranteeing “traditional peoples’ access to natural resources for their physical, economic, and cultural reproduction.”

Concerning projected losses to the diets of Amazon fisherfolk, Lorena Curuaia told Mongabay, “No company has the right to take away another’s dietary sustenance. The fisher people’s culture is fish. To remove their food, is to remove their life.”

On February 18, dozens of fisherfolk organizations, all members of the Xingu Vivo Para Sempre association, formally demanded Eduardo Fortunato Bim and Paulo Roberto Pinto be “criminally prosecuted” for environmental damages resulting from IBAMA’s decision.

“In my understanding, if the president of the environmental organ takes a decision that contradicts the technical position of the institution itself, he is failing in his duty. He is committing a crime in failing to act in accordance with his function, which is to protect the environment,” Pezzuti states.

In a note to Mongabay, Norte Energia states, “There is no crime practiced — since there do not exist any environmental damages, but rather impacts [already] predicted” in the environmental licensing stage. In 2020, federal judges and IBAMA’s team documented that impacts of the dam, characterized by IBAMA as “grave and irreversible,” were greater than projected during licensing.

Norte Energia offers mitigation plans

In its February 8 IBAMA agreement, Norte Energia also committed $R 157 million (US$ 28 million) to river flow mitigation plans. Three projects were approved: to send teams to collect fruit and leaves from the forests that should have been flooded, then throw these into the reduced area of the river where fish are trapped; to build floating platforms with bushes for fish to feed from; and to breed fish in captivity and then release them into the Xingu.

Pezzuti rejects the plan as scientifically unproven: “It’s an absurd pseudo-project, impossible to be executed on a scale that compensates for the [absence of] flooding of tens of thousands of hectares.” He notes, “The first two [projects] aren’t based on any kind of precedent,” and the raising of fish in captivity in the hopes of repopulating the river “already has proven to be ineffective in several studies.”

Alexander Lees, of England’s Manchester Metropolitan University, concurs that these are unworkable solutions, “a waste of money” better spent on maintaining the ecosystem.

“Messing around with chucking fruit into rivers or floating trees is just throwing money away,” says Lees. “It just looks like good publicity,”

Bel Juruna says Norte Energia’s present efforts are ineffectual. “There are lots of companies [contracted by Norte Energia] here that go around, visit, hold meetings, but despite that, there aren’t any projects from the [original] Basic Environmental Plan that are working here.”

Pezzuti explains that Norte Energia’s fisheries mitigation plan was “signed off on by professors employed by public research universities, contributing to this scientific makeup, as if there were a solution for the tragedy that Hydrogram [B] will cause.” However, he adds, independent researchers, not paid by Norte Energia, “experts in fish ecology and aquatic turtles… vehemently protested… this bizarre proposal,” as did “IBAMA’s analysts, who rejected it” on February 2.

Ribas adds, “The research Norte Energia and its consultants do is already directed toward a certain end goal.” She believes that the company-contracted researchers’ finding that Hydrogram B is viable resulted from a conflict of interest which, she says, might explain why the firm’s experts didn’t present analysis of alternatives. “That’s not science,” she says, but Ribas is concerned the Brazilian public will accept the flawed research as valid.

What’s needed, she concludes, is independent monitoring. Ribas and her fellow scientists are seeking funding to monitor the effects of Norte Energia’s Hydrogram B on the Volta Grande in 2021.

As for the Juruna people, Bel Juruna says they will endure: “We will be here. We want to resist in this place, fighting so that we, too, won’t turn into a cemetery in our village.”

286,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Australia floods: Entire New South Wales towns resembling an 'inland sea' after widespread flooding - Stuff.co.nz,https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/300259243/australia-floods-entire-new-south-wales-towns-resembling-an-inland-sea-after-widespread-flooding,"The New South Wales Rural Fire Service helicopter has captured dramatic imagery of Sydney's north-west appearing to be like an inland sea.

The footage, which covers the general vicinity of Windsor and Richmond, shows entire blocks and paddocks underwater as the Hawkesbury River bursts its banks due to extreme rainfall.

In one shot, an entire earthmover is underwater, its orange light still flashing as water rushes over the cabin.

NSW RFS NSW's State Emergency Service has confirmed that major flooding of the Hawkesbury River.

The Windsor bridge, which was built just last year, went underwater late yesterday after having been closed to traffic for hours.

NSW's State Emergency Service has confirmed that major flooding of the Hawkesbury River – particularly at the nearby suburb of North Richmond – is likely to be higher than the historic 1961 flooding event.

“The Hawkesbury River at North Richmond (WPS) is currently at 13.16 metres and falling with major flooding. Renewed rises are possible with forecast rainfall,” the Bureau of Meteorology advised.

“The Hawkesbury River at Windsor (WPS) may peak near 13.00 metres Monday evening with major flooding. This level is similar to the April 1988 and July 1990 flood events.”

A severe weather warning remains for much of NSW's coast, with damaging winds, heavy rainfall, abnormally high tides and damaging surf forecast.

“A strong high pressure system over the southern Tasman Sea continues to drive widespread and persistent rain onto the New South Wales coast. This is expected to continue today, particularly about the Mid North Coast and Northern Rivers,” the Bureau advises.

“Meanwhile, a low pressure trough in the state's west is deepening, bringing rain areas to the northern inland today. In this area, heavy rain is possible from the morning, becoming more likely in the afternoon and evening, extending to areas of the southeast over Tuesday.

“On Tuesday, as the trough reaches the Tasman Sea, a low pressure system may form, bringing increased rainfall, strong winds, damaging surf and abnormally high tides to the east and south.""

The entire state is unlikely to experience a reprieve from the wet weather until late Wednesday.

548,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"Ghana, Kenya and Malawi to take part in WHO malaria vaccine pilot programme - Malawi - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/malawi/ghana-kenya-and-malawi-take-part-who-malaria-vaccine-pilot-programme,"Brazzaville, 24 April 2017 - The World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO) announced today that Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi will take part in a WHO-coordinated pilot implementation programme that will make the world’s first malaria vaccine available in selected areas, beginning in 2018.

The injectable vaccine, RTS,S, was developed to protect young children from the most deadly form of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. RTS,S will be assessed in the pilot programme as a complementary malaria control tool that could potentially be added to the core package of WHO-recommended measures for malaria prevention.

“The prospect of a malaria vaccine is great news. Information gathered in the pilot will help us make decisions on the wider use of this vaccine”, said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Combined with existing malaria interventions, such a vaccine would have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives in Africa,” she added.

Africa bears the greatest burden of malaria worldwide. Global efforts in the last 15 years have led to a 62 percent reduction in malaria deaths between 2000 and 2015, yet approximately 429,000 people died of the disease in 2015, the majority of them young children in Africa.

The WHO pilot programme will assess whether the vaccine’s protective effect in children aged 5 – 17 months old during Phase III testing can be replicated in real-life. Specifically, the pilot programme will assess the feasibility of delivering the required four doses of RTS,S, the vaccine’s potential role in reducing childhood deaths, and its safety in the context of routine use.

WHO recommendations and RTS,S

RTS,S was developed by GSK and is the first malaria vaccine to have successfully completed a Phase III clinical trial. The trial was conducted between 2009 and 2014 through a partnership involving GSK, the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and a network of African research sites in seven African countries—including Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi.

RTS,S is also the first malaria vaccine to have obtained a positive scientific opinion from a stringent medicines regulatory authority, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which approved RTS,S in July 2015.

In October 2015, two independent WHO advisory groups, comprised of the world’s foremost experts on vaccines and malaria, recommended pilot implementation of RTS,S in three to five settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The recommendation came from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC), following a joint review of all available evidence on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The World Health Organization formally adopted the recommendation in January 2016.

Pilot implementation

The three countries were selected to participate in the pilot based on the following criteria: high coverage of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs); well-functioning malaria and immunisation programmes, a high malaria burden even after scale-up of LLINs, and participation in the Phase III RTS,S malaria vaccine trial. Each of the three countries will decide on the districts and regions to be included in the pilots. High malaria burden areas will be prioritized, as this is where the benefit of the vaccine is predicted to be highest. Information garnered from the pilot will help to inform later decisions about potential wider use of the vaccine.

The malaria vaccine will be administered via intramuscular injection and delivered through the routine national immunization programmes. WHO is working with the three countries to facilitate regulatory authorization of the vaccine for use in the pilots through the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF). Regulatory support will also include measures to enable the appropriate safety monitoring of the vaccine and rigorous evaluation for eventual large scale use.

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNITAID, are partnering to provide US$49.2 million for the first phase of the pilot programme (2017-2020) which will be complemented by in-kind contributions from WHO and GSK.

816,Drought Sri Lanka,Maharashtra to have new water policy - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-to-have-new-water-policy/article4820066.ece,"The water policy is being revised in accordance with the National Water Policy.

Against the backdrop of the severe drought in several parts of the state prior to this monsoon, Maharashtra Government is preparing a water policy on the lines of the National Water Policy.

The National Water Policy (NWP) stipulates that state policies should be drafted/revised in accordance with it, a senior official said. NWP was first framed in 1987 and modified in April 2002. It requires that every state formulate its own water policy backed by an action plan.

The government has invited comments and suggestions from various societies working in different sectors, NGOs and other water users for the modification of the present State Water Policy which has been in existence since 2003, he said.

The Departments involved in revision of the state water policy include the Water Resources Department, Water Supply and Sanitation Department, Environmental Department and Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA).

In the 2003 State Water Policy, the priority of water use was: drinking, industrial and irrigation. However, in May 2011, there was a revision of priority: drinking, irrigation and industrial use.

As part of the revision of the state water policy, the government has invited comments from all departments concerned to be submitted by September 30, 2013. The preparation of draft policy will be completed by November 30, and cabinet note on it is expected by April 30 next year.

The new NWP emphasises the need for a national water framework law, comprehensive legislation for optimum development of inter-state rivers and river valleys, amendment of Irrigation and other Acts, the official said.

It states that water, after meeting needs for safe drinking water and sanitation, achieving food security, supporting poor people dependent on agriculture for their livelihood and high priority allocation for minimum eco-system needs, be treated as economic good so as to promote its conservation and efficient use.

The policy says “ecological needs” of the river should be determined recognising that river flows are characterised by low or no flows, small floods, large floods and flow variability and should accommodate development needs.

The national policy also dwells on adaptation strategies in view of climate change for designing and management of water resources structures.

The suggestions can be sent to Deputy Secretary (Irrigation Management), Water Resources Department, in Mantralaya and emailed to wrd_cad_do_imp@maharashtra.gov.in, the official said.",2013-06-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['river', 'state', 'national', 'water', 'resources', 'irrigation', 'priority', 'department', 'revision', 'policy', 'maharashtra']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

1.1. Background

During the current monsoon, Sindh faced seven spells of moderate to heavy rains. These heavy rains affected several districts of Sindh including different districts of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur, Sanghar, Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Tando Muhamamd Khan Jacobabad and Umerkot.

According to Pakistan Meteorological Department Karachi received the heaviest rain in a single day ever in its history when 231 mm rain lashed out in just 12 hours. Maximum rain recorded in millimetres Karachi (Surjani Town 195, Kemari 170, North Karachi 168, Nazimabad 162, Masroor Base 154, Saddar 142, Landhi 126, Airport Old Area 122, University Road & Saadi Town 105, Jinnah Terminal 104, Gulshan-e-Hadid 49) Moen Jo Daro 44, Shaheed Benazirabad 34, Sukkur 15, Larkana 07, Jacobabad 06, Chor and Hyderabad 02. Hub Dam water level crossed 338.5 feet after 13 years of history.

During August 2020, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall record over the last 90 years. In recent most 7th spell that started on August 27 and continued, heavy rainfalls are recorded that turns the Karachi and many districts in Shambles. Karachi alone received 223 mm. of rain over 12 hours, and it caused more devastation to Karachi. Rainwater and overflowed water from nullahs and drains flooded most of the main roads and streets in residential locations, a significant number of residential areas including urban slums and villages in peri-urban areas, that gravely disrupted the peoples lives.

The misery of the people increases many folds due to long power outages and gushing flooded water on streets which causes traffic jams, resulted in difficult access for relief or rescue work in affected areas. The inundated roads caused massive traffic jams in Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Sarjani, Sohrab Goth, Khawaja Ajmer Nagri, Nagin Chowrangi, Power House Chowrangi, Orangi Town, Haideri, Liaqatabad, Gulshan Iqbal, Hussain Abad, Kareem Abad, Shahrah-e-Faisal, Quaidabad, Malir National Highway, Hassan Squire, Landhi, Gulshan-e-Hadid, Defence, Clifton, Gulberg, Kashmir Colony, Saudabad, Golimar, Rizwia, Patel Para, Pak Colony, Shah Latif Town, Lyari, Sakhi Hassan, Shadman, Anda Mor and other parts of the city.

On 29th August 2020, 6 districts of Karachi are declared as Calamity hit areas by the Relief Commissioner - Government Sindh under Sindh National Calamities (P&R) Act 1958. According to RNA the two districts respectively Karachi East and Malir are most affected.

1481,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Conflicting reports emerge in Nigeria over video of downed plane - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/03/conflicting-reports-emerge-in-nigeria-over-video-of-downed-plane/,"National-World

Conflicting reports have emerged in Nigeria over a video of a downed plane, after the countrys air force disputed claims from Boko Haram that its militants shot down a jet.

The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) strongly questioned the authenticity of the Boko Haram clip which purports to show fighters shooting at the military plane, eventually causing it to fall to the ground.

The NAF suggested that the crash was due to an air accident.

The video was published by the SITE Intelligence Group and is circulating across Nigerian media.

It is evident that most parts of the video were deliberately doctored to give the false impression that the aircraft was shot down when it was obviously an air accident, the NAF said in a statement posted on Facebook Friday.

The NAF rejected the seven-and-a-half-minute edited clip, calling it false propaganda and urging Nigerians to ignore the contents of the videos making the rounds until all investigations as to how the aircraft crashed are completed.

The NAF reported the plane missing on Wednesday, with two pilots on board.

A spokesperson told CNN Thursday afternoon the fighter jet had been deployed near Borno State in northeastern Nigeria to provide air support to ground troops, who were under fire from Boko Haram fighters before radar contact was lost.

The cause of the crash as well as the whereabouts of the 2 pilots remain unknown. The pilots are Flight Lieutenant John Abolarinwa and Flight Lieutenant Ebiakpo Chapele, the NAF said earlier Friday.

In the disputed video Boko Haram claims to have shot down the Alpha Jet.

The footage shows multiple fighters shooting into the air before a blast lights up the sky as a plane ignites into flames and falls to the ground. The video then cuts to fighters standing around what appears to be the wreckage of the jet.

It then cuts to the plane, showing NAF 475  the missing aircrafts ID number. It later shows a charred body.

Separately the video then shows what appears to be a patch laying on the ground, displaying John Abolarinwas name.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Boko Haram has increased attacks against the Nigerian military as it tries to regain control of lost territories in pockets of the countrys northeast.

13,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Ukraine-Russia Conflict Results In “Water War” - Water Online,https://www.wateronline.com/doc/ukraine-russia-conflict-results-in-water-war-0001,"By Sara Jerome,

@sarmje

Water utilities have been at the center of international political unrest this year as a result of the ""water war"" in Crimea.

""Crimeans voted to break off from Ukraine and join Russia. Their vote represents the re-establishment of a historic cultural relationship. But take away the emotional side of the Crimean referendum and reality hits home -- the economic challenges that are yet to knock on their door,"" CNN reported.

Water service is among the major challenges.

""According to Ukrainian news agencies, [Ukraine's government] has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85 percent of fresh water from this canal, which was built in [between] 1961 and 1971,"" ITAR TASS reported.

That creates an expensive issue for Crimea, and for Russia, its new homeland. It will take up to $417 million to solve the problem of water service for Crimea, the report said.

The water problem emerged as a central front in the tug-of-war between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea.

""Satellite images show that [Ukraine] is deliberately trying to cut off Crimea peninsula's water supply by building a dam. In the meantime Russian scientists are trying to find ways to supply Crimea with fresh water,"" RT reported.

The result is an all-out ""water war.""

""Amid the water war between Ukraine and Russia; the former and the current occupiers of the Muslim Autonomous Republic of Crimea, harvest in the devastated Muslim country has been despoiled, but the water war may take more victims, with two major Crimean chemical plants near closure because of a water shortage,"" OnIslam reported, citing a Crimean official.

Crimea formerly depended on Ukraine for water, Pravda reported this month.

Ukraine ""provided up to 85 percent of fresh water supplies to the Crimea through the North Crimean Canal from the Dnieper River. The water was used to irrigate farmland. However, after the reunification of the Crimea with Russia, the new authorities of Ukraine completely cut water supplies from the North Crimean Canal to the republic,"" the report said.

Russia is trying to solve the water problem.

""The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation delivers fresh drinking water to the Crimea from artesian wells,"" the report said.

""Experts from the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources are developing ways to supply fresh water to the Crimea from the Kuban River in the Krasnodar region to the North Crimean Canal which now receives limited water-flow, as Kiev tightens the lid,"" RT reported.

Russian official Dmitry Kirillov told reporters that the country is exploring its options.

“As one of options of providing the peninsula with water, we are considering an option of drawing water supply from the Kuban River and channeling it through the Strait of Kerch to the end portion of North Crimean Canal,” he said, per RT.

Desalination has also been viewed as a potential solution.

""Russia is debating the construction of desalination plants in Crimea to solve the peninsula’s water supply problem,"" RIONOVOSTI reported, citing a Russian official.

""[New] desalination technology and desalination plants could be used in Crimea, because there are many underground salt lakes on the peninsula. Singapore uses desalinized water for irrigation and for technical purposes; the same can be done in Crimea,"" a Russian official said.",2014-08-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['north', 'supply', 'russian', 'fresh', 'conflict', 'crimea', 'ukrainerussia', 'crimean', 'results', 'war', 'ukraine', 'water', 'canal', 'russia']",China,news article,English

Ltd.

Currently Chevron Bangladesh operates Block 12, Bibiyana Field, and Blocks 13 and 14, the Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar fields. Closing of the Bangladesh transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, the U.S. oil and gas major said today.

Himalaya Energy is held by a consortium of China ZhenHua Oil and CNIC Corp Ltd, a Chevron company spokesman told Reuters, but declined to say how much the deal was worth, or when completion was expected.

Back in February, ZhenHua Oil was said to have signed a preliminary deal to buy Chevron’s natural gas fields in Bangladesh estimated to be worth around $2 billion, Reuters reported.

Last summer Chevron was said to be selling $5 billion worth of assets in Asia as part of a plan to raise $10 billion total through global asset sales.

At the end of December 2016, Chevron said that its wholly owned subsidiaries had entered into a sales and purchase agreement with Star Energy Consortium to sell Chevron’s Indonesian and Philippines geothermal assets.

“This sale is aligned with our strategy to maximize the value of our global upstream businesses through effective portfolio management,” Jay Johnson, executive vice president, Upstream, Chevron Corporation, said back then.

Chevron announced the completion of the Indonesian asset sale on March 31, 2017, when it said that the conclusion of the sale of its geothermal business in the Philippines is expected later this year. Although the U.S. corporation has not released sums of the deals, Reuters had reported that the assets in Indonesia and the Philippines combined were valued at around $3 billion.

1592,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Ignored minority peasants crushed by poverty after Sindh floods - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1582827,"Marginalised minorities in rural Sindh have suffered badly in heavy rains this year due to displacement and loss of income.

Many [government officials] turned-up and wrote down our names, but we werent provided relief, said Ganga, a peasant whose poverty-stricken community in Sindh has been displaced by floods.

Ratol Kohli, an elderly member of her community, too, looked despondently at every passing vehicle. Their grievance is that, while officials jot down the names of displaced people, many have still not been given relief goods though some people do provide us cooked rice as lunch, she said.

Extreme weather events have been unkind to Ganga and her community in Pakistans second largest province, which this year witnessed unprecedented rains and flooding. While the medias focus was on the catastrophic urban flooding in Karachi and other urban centres, the August-September spell of rain wreaked havoc in rural areas with poor drainage.

The disaster has hit the marginalised Kohli, Bheel and Meghwar communities hard, as many of these scheduled Hindu caste members work in farms without ownership of the land they till.

Rain-hit communities have shifted to highlands and roads in Mirpurkhas district and set up improvised tents. They were displaced from their villages due to heavy rains in August.  Photo by Yasir Rajput/The Third Pole

Kohlis, Bheels and Meghwars are considered scheduled castes in Indias caste system which follows Hindu mythology. They are voiceless in the farming sector. They live in substantial numbers in Sindh but largely below the poverty line. While Meghwars opt for other occupations, the Kohlis and Bheels remain in the agriculture sector.

The Sindh government declared 20 districts as calamity hit areas after the recent rainfall. Districts in lower Sindh, including Badin, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Sanghar and Sujawal are the worst hit. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) office recorded 348 millimetres of rainfall in August 2020 in Mirpurkhas, which in the previous year had received 150 millimetres of rain.

The rains and the ensuing disaster are reminiscent of catastrophic floods in the area in 2011, when minority communities suffered tremendous losses yet received no relief.

This year, thousands have lost their produce  cotton and chilli crops  after the excessive rainfall. Selling it would have earned them an income for which they toiled tirelessly as the suns heat seared their faces.

A picture of misery

Its been around one month [since the rains] but we have been left to fend for ourselves here, said Ganga, one of millions displaced by rains in district Mirpurkhas which is home to Sindhs famous mango orchards.

Do you know how difficult it is to pick cotton and hold a baby simultaneously? We are bearing all this pain and suffering only to earn some money. Merely 10 to 15 maunds [around 40kg] of cotton is left for picking. The rest is lost, she told The Third Pole. In other years, they have picked nearly three times this amount.

As if this disaster-driven displacement is not enough, the police forces us to leave sections of the highways and shift to other highlands, she said.

Even in the third week of September, long after the rains stopped, large swathes of agricultural lands are submerged by standing rainwater. Drainage remains slow, and the poor farmers who worked in what is known as the breadbasket of Sindh sit idle.

The men, women, elderly and children sleep under the open sky. Their homes, traditionally made of mud and thatched straw, have collapsed. They lack basic civic amenities and even toilets. Their livestock and cattle suffer as mosquitoes and insects invade the environs soon after sunset, making the animals prone to skin infections.

When their homes flooded, the displaced communities temporarily shifted to highlands and roadsides with whatever belongings they could gather. They have set up improvised tents with empty sacks or polypropylene bags, plastic and pieces of cloth.

We gathered whatever we could when it started raining heavily on Aug 24 and 25 at midnight, said Marva Kohli.

Extensive damage leaves government helpless

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah wants international aid to ameliorate the situation in Sindh. He put the figure of people affected by rains at 2.5 million. We need international assistance like the kind we got in 2010, when the Indus river was swollen and experienced super floods, and then in 2011 when torrential rains visited Sindh, he said.

A September 19 assessment by his governments Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) put crop damage at 1.128 million acres and affected people at 2.48 million in Sindh. It reports 151 people dead, including 49 women and 23 children. The survey suggested nearly 30,000 homes were damaged and about 50,0000 cattle perished.

Among the damaged crop, cotton  an exportable commodity  and chilli are badly hit. The province, which produced 4.2 million cotton bales in 2009-2010 has barely come close to that figure in recent years. Production figures for 2010-2020 show a 40% decline.

The Pakistan Cotton Ginners Associations senior vice chairman Haresh Kumar puts the overall damage to cotton crop in 2020-21 at Rs 5 billion [USD 30.3 million].

Progressive farmer and the leader of a vibrant growers body, Syed Mehmood Nawaz Shah, too, said that while the value of Sindhs agriculture produce in 2020-21 for summer crops is about USD 7 billion, close to USD 1 billion has been lost in recent rains and flooding.

No relief for farmers

For the poor farmers, more hardship lies ahead.

We have lost the produce we had grown. We will lose our share [in the crop] as it will be adjusted by the landowner towards the cost of input he invested in the crop, said Peeru Kohli.

The immediate rehabilitation of haris (bonded farm hands) is a distant dream. Barefoot peasants enter submerged cotton fields to pick the remainder of cotton from dawn to dusk for Rs 400 (USD 2.40) per 40kg, thus exposing themselves to infection and insects.

Male and female peasants, including children, pick the remainder of the cotton crop hit by rains in Digri taluka of Mirpurkhas district.  Photo by Yasir Rajput/The Third Pole

The hari-grower relationship is not governed under any law. Haris are not registered under the record of rights as permanent tenants as per Sindh Tenancy Act 1950. In practice, peasants share expenses incurred by the landlord from the sowing to harvesting stages of the crop. All inputs are purchased by the landlord or through the areas conventional lending system.

The local lenders charge interest at rates much higher than banks. For instance, if a local lender provides a urea bag at Rs 17,500 (USD 10.60) on credit, he will charge USD 4.5 over and above the price as interest. The borrower/farmer has to sell his produce to the very lender as a precondition. Usually, a peasants loan is adjusted once the crop is harvested and sold in the market or to the same lenders who then offer a lower price for the crop along with deductions. The entire practice undermines the monetary interests of haris, who have to make do with a meagre share in profit after the deduction of expenses.

According to Peerus calculation, the landowner invests around Rs 30,000 (USD 181) per acre in the cotton crop which he or other peasants are supposed to share equally. With the considerable chunk of cotton or chilli gone, we end up getting zero share in the profit, he said, adding that he will now have to ask his landlord to lend him money.

My community fellows will be borrowing more money to earn a living till the new crop is sown and harvested.

Scheduled caste members cant buy assets or even read their religious books in line within Hinduism. They are the most persecuted community within Hindus, said Dr Sonu Khangarani, recipient of Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, Pakistans highest civilian honour, for his social work in 2010. I, too, hail from the Meghwar community, he said.

They cant break this vicious circle, he added. He urged the government to build villages on highlands for these landless peasants under the federal governments five million houses scheme and to give them ownership of land.

Under the Sindh Industrial Relations Act 2013, peasants are defined as industrial workers. But seasoned labour rights leader Nasir Mansoor said that unless rules are framed in line with the 2013 Act, it remains irrelevant. These are rules which will provide a framework to get haris enrolled under social security lawsbut the governments will is missing.

The floods in Assam turned critical in the first week of July 2019. Incessant rains in the state led to overflow of major rivers and tributaries leading to inundation in the catchment areas of river Brahmaputra. The floods caused massive displacement of people and damaged the crops, livestock and properties. This also led to destruction of critical infrastructure and hampering essential services.

The current flood scenario has affected 4.3 million populations in 4157 villages under 113 Revenue Circles. Out of the total 33 districts in Assam 30 districts have been badly affected. The total death has risen to 71 in the current flood. The flood hit districts are Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath,

Sonitpur, Darrang, Udalguri, Baksa, Barpeta, Nalbari, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Kamrup Metro, Morigaon, Hojai, Nagaon, Golaghat, Majuli, Jorhat, Sivasagar,

Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Cachar, Karbi Anglong, Hailakandi and Karimganj.

As per the latest data, 183 relief camps are operational providing relief to the affected people. In these relief camps a total of 83,180 flood affected people are taking shelter. In addition, 311 relief distribution centres have been set up by the district administration. As per government data, Barpeta district has been the worst flood hit area affecting 996,190 people. There were also 937,268 people affected in Dhubri and 563,049 in Morigaon.

Joshimath, Uttarakhand – Anger is growing among the families of 39 workers trapped in a tunnel after a deadly flash flood caused by the bursting of a Himalayan glacier destroyed two hydropower projects on Sunday.

Four days after tonnes of rocks and slush blocked the under construction tunnel at Tapovan Dam in Uttarakhand state, desperate families on Wednesday jostled with people in the village, expressing their anger with the administration over the handling of the rescue operation.

Swati Bhadouriya, the district magistrate of Chamoli, some 278km (173 miles) east of the main city of Dehradun, told Al Jazeera that one body was found on Wednesday morning, taking the death toll in the tragedy to 32 while over 170 people are missing.

Members of India’s National Disaster Response Force near Tapovan tunnel [Bilal Kuchay/Al Jazeera] The families of those missing allege not enough is being done by the authorities and time was running out for their loved ones trapped inside the 2-km (1.24-mile) tunnel. Officials said they have not been able to go beyond 120 metres.

But the workers’ families said the rescue team, which includes hundreds of paramilitary personnel and members of National Disaster Response Force, were taking “too much time” to clear the debris and have been giving “conflicting reports in the media” about the rescue mission.

“If anyone in the administration in the true sense believes the workers inside the tunnel are alive, then this operation shouldn’t take such a long time,” said Abdul Wajid, 30, from Saharanpur district of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state.

Wajid’s younger brother, Sadiq – a father of three – along with four others from the district had started working at the Tapovan tunnel last week.

They were supposed to finish their work by Sunday evening and return to their hometown on Monday, said Wajid, adding that destiny had something else in store for them.

Babu Ram’s brother Pramod Sen was also working inside the tunnel on Sunday.

“Four days have passed since the tunnel was blocked by the slush and still the rescue teams have not been able to find the people trapped inside,” he told Al Jazeera.

“We have lost every hope now. We don’t think our loved ones are still alive. We just want the administration to return the bodies of our loved ones safely.”

Piyoosh Rautela, a senior disaster relief official, told Al Jazeera they are working round-the-clock to find the workers and that the rescue operation was taking long because they cannot send too many machines inside.

“It was a tunnel and people were working inside. Debris came and choked the tunnel. We don’t know how far the debris has gone,” he said.

Rautela said he understood the agony of the families but they were “not aware of the practical realities which people face in the Himalayas”.

“These are fast flowing torrents. A person who is washed away in this may or may not be traced,” he said.

“Three days are not a long time, people do survive longer periods trapped at various places. There have been instances. We are hopeful that we will find them.”",2021-02-10 08:00:00+00:00,"['working', 'glacier', 'workers', 'fades', 'india', 'told', 'tragedy', 'trapped', 'taking', 'hope', 'tunnel', 'angry', 'families', 'rescue', 'tapovan', 'inside']",India,news article,English
1217,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt fines farmers for wasting water as Nile dam crisis drags on - Al-Monitor,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/02/egypt-fines-farmers-waste-water-gerd-talks.html,"CAIRO — Egypt is fining farmers for wasting water as Ethiopia approaches the second phase of the filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), built on one of the main tributaries of the Nile River, which Cairo fears will affect its share of water.

On Jan. 28, the Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Mohamed Abdel-Aty, instructed the ministry’s agencies to begin collecting fines for wasting water from farmers who fail to adhere to modern irrigation systems.

Abdel-Aty stressed the importance of finding successful ways to switch from flood irrigation to modern irrigation systems. He urged more farmers to switch to smart irrigation systems and use tools like soil moisture meters developed by the ministry, stressing the many advantages offered by modern systems to maximize productivity, reduce operating costs and increase profitability through the efficient use of labor, energy and water.

The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation's meters measure soil moisture levels to determine the crops’ water needs and send the data to farmers' mobile phones by text message.

In December, the ministry also launched a national project to rehabilitate about 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles) of damaged canals at a cost of 18 billion Egyptian pounds ($1.14 billion) by mid-2022.

In July 2020, Ethiopia announced it had completed the first phase of filling the GERD despite the lack of an agreement with downstream countries Egypt and Sudan. Ethiopia began constructing the GERD on the Blue Nile in 2011 as a power-generating facility but Egypt fears the dam will affect its Nile water share of 55 billion cubic meters a year, most of it from the Blue Nile.

Egypt's former Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohammed Nasr Allam told Al-Monitor that Egypt is fining farmers who had received state loans to adopt modern irrigation systems but failed to follow through.

He explained that the fines are part of the Egyptian state’s plan to rationalize water consumption because Egypt has a water deficit of about 30 billion cubic meters annually. He said that Cairo seeks to address this deficit amid the country’s increasing population growth, which could result in a drinking water deficit of 10 billion cubic meters.

Allam added that Egypt is working to rationalize agricultural water to avoid shortages of drinking water and is implementing agricultural expansion projects that require modern irrigation systems.

“We reject what Ethiopia is doing in the GERD without a binding agreement for all, neglecting Egypt's share of the Nile water. A solution that satisfies all parties must be reached because water is a red line for Egypt since it threatens its security and stability,” Allam said.

Mahmoud Abdel Mohsen, a researcher at Egypt's Agricultural Research Center, told Al-Monitor that Egypt has started developing irrigation systems in Kafr El Sheikh and Beheira governorates.

Abdel Mohsen added that Egypt's share of the Nile is limited and and crucial for drinking and the rest for agriculture. He considers Ethiopia’s actions unacceptable and the Nile water is a matter of life and death for Cairo.",2021-02-04 08:00:00+00:00,"['crisis', 'modern', 'meters', 'egypt', 'water', 'systems', 'drags', 'irrigation', 'nile', 'share', 'farmers', 'dam', 'fines', 'billion', 'wasting']",Egypt,news article,English
952,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Who were the mysterious Neolithic people that enabled the rise of ancient Egypt? Here's what we've learned on our digs - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/who-were-the-mysterious-neolithic-people-that-enabled-the-rise-of-ancient-egypt-heres-what-weve-learned-on-our-digs-121070,"To many, ancient Egypt is synonymous with the pharaohs and pyramids of the Dynastic period starting about 3,100BC. Yet long before that, about 9,300-4,000BC, enigmatic Neolithic peoples flourished. Indeed, it was the lifestyles and cultural innovations of these peoples that provided the very foundation for the advanced civilisations to come.

But who were they? As it turns out, they haven’t actually been studied much, at least relative to their successors. But our excavations of six burial sites – with some of the analyses recently published – have now provided important insights into their mysterious ways of life.

One reason why we know so little about Neolithic Egypt is that the sites are often inaccessible, lying beneath the Nile’s former flood plain or in outlying deserts.

Author provided

With permission from Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) we – members of the Combined Prehistoric Expedition – explore Neolithic sites in Egypt’s western desert. The sites we are currently excavating lie along the former shores of an extinct seasonal lake near a place called Gebel Ramlah.

Though not lush, the Neolithic was wetter than today, which allowed these ancient herders to populate what is now the middle of nowhere. We focus on the Final Neolithic (4,600-4,000BC), which was built on the success of the Late Neolithic (5,500-4,650BC) with domesticated cattle and goats, wild plant processing and cattle burials. These people also made apparent megaliths, shrines and even calendar circles – which look a bit like a mini Stonehenge.

During the final part of the Neolithic period, people started burying the dead in formal cemeteries. Skeletons provide critical information because they are from once living people who interacted with the cultural and physical environments. Health, relationships, diet and even psychological experiences can leave telltale signs on teeth and bone.

In 2001-2003 we excavated three cemeteries from this era – the first in the western desert – where we uncovered and studied 68 skeletons. The graves were full of artefacts, with ornamental pottery, sea shells, stone and ostrich eggshell jewellery. We also discovered carved mica (a silicate mineral) and animal remains, as well as elaborate cosmetic tools for women and stone weapons for men.

We learned that these people enjoyed low childhood mortality, tall stature and long life. Men averaged 170cm, while women were about 160cm. Most men and women lived beyond 40 years, with some into their 50s – a long time in those days.

Strangely, in 2009-2016, we dug two more cemeteries that were very different. After analysing another 130 skeletons, we discovered that few artefacts accompanied them, and that they suffered from higher childhood mortality as well as shorter lives and stature. We’re talking several centimetres shorter and perhaps ten years younger for adults of both sexes.

Astonishingly, the largest of these two cemeteries had a separate burial area for children under three years of age, but mostly infants including late-term foetuses. Three women buried with infants were also found, so perhaps they died in childbirth. In fact, this is the world’s earliest known infant cemetery.

Interpreting the findings

So what can this tell us about these peoples, let alone their descendants? As it turns out, a lot. We can use the findings to make interpretations about gender, life-stage, well-being, status and other things.

For example, why were there such differences between the two grave sites? They could have been separate populations, but it is unlikely based on overall physical similarities. So perhaps they imply variation by status – with one graveyard being for the elite and the other for workers. This is the earliest such evidence in Egypt.

The sites also shed light on the family structures of the time. The overall sex ratio across all cemeteries is three women to each man, which may indicate polygamy. However, the total number of burials and a lack of reference to individual houses suggests these were extended family cemeteries.

We also believe that attainment of “personhood” – the age children are socialised into being “people” – was from three years, given their inclusion in adult cemeteries.

There is also clear evidence of respect for previously buried people by later mourners reusing the graves to bury their dead. When coming across old skeletons, they often carefully repositioned the bones of these ancestors. In some interesting cases, they even made attempts to “reconstruct” the skeletons by replacing teeth that had fallen out back into the skeleton – and not always correctly (see lead image).

These behavioural indicators, together with the seemingly innovative technological and ceremonial architecture mentioned earlier, such as the calendar circles and shrines, imply a level of sophistication well beyond that of simple herders. Taken together, the findings provide a glimpse of things yet to come in Ancient Egypt.

Conservation of sites

A key component of our work involves conservation of Egyptian (and world) heritage. We found no evidence of grave looting, unlike for sites in the Nile Valley. The last people to touch Neolithic material at Gebel Ramlah lived during that time. However, wind-related erosion has reached a point where once-buried remains lie on or near the surface.

In fact, the pace of destruction has increased significantly since 2001. Once exposed, the context of these sites can be lost and organic material can get sandblasted to bits. This means that if we hadn’t discovered these remains when we did, they would have soon been lost forever. But sadly this likely means that other sites from the time are literally disappearing.

For that reason, we and the SCA have decided that, when we have studied our material, all will be reburied on site to, hopefully, survive for thousands more years.",2019-08-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['egypt', 'remains', 'ancient', 'weve', 'heres', 'enabled', 'mysterious', 'peoples', 'skeletons', 'cemeteries', 'women', 'rise', 'digs', 'sites', 'learned', 'neolithic', 'studied', 'material', 'long']",Egypt,news article,English

225,FF-2016-000062-IDN,In search of Madagascar's “marine primates” - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2016/06/in-search-of-madagascars-marine-primates/,"At least 23 species of lemur in five families have been spotted in mangroves, about 20 percent of all lemur species and about half of the species whose range is known to include mangrove areas.

In Madagascar, mangrove extent declined by 21 percent between 1990 and 2010, according to a study released in January 2016.

It’s difficult to say how important mangroves are for lemurs without further research, however.

In March 2015, Charlie Gardner and his wife were performing a bird survey for the marine conservation organisation Blue Ventures deep in the mangroves of northwest Madagascar.

They went for a walk one night and had just turned back toward their camp as it started to rain when they noticed the glimmer of a mammal’s eyes high in a tree. Being that there was about three kilometers (nearly two miles) of mangrove swamp between them and the nearest dry land, Gardner and his wife assumed it must be a fruit bat. But as they got closer, they realized it was in fact a Northern Giant Mouse Lemur (Mirza zaza), an endangered species found only in that particular part of Madagascar.

Gardner, an honorary research fellow in biodiversity management at the University of Kent, had seen ring-tailed lemurs in mangroves near where he lived in southern Madagascar many years prior to this sighting, and had been interested in this behavior ever since. But after searching all the literature he could find, he realized that only four species of lemur had ever been recorded in mangrove habitat.

But then, last year, Zo Andriamahenina, a geospatial scientist for Blue Ventures, found two Claire’s mouse lemurs in a mangrove up north, in Antsahampano — the same mangrove forest where Gardner and his wife encountered the Northern Giant Mouse Lemur.

These discoveries were surprising, to say the least, Gardner told Mongabay: “On the one hand it was surprising because mangroves are a difficult environment to live in. They are regularly flooded by seawater, they tend not to harbor great invertebrate diversity above the water, and they are floristically very poor — in fact in all of Madagascar there are just eight mangrove species, and many stands are composed of just two or three species. So all in all we would not expect there to be much for lemurs to eat year-round.”

Gardner continued: “On the other hand the lack of records might just be because no one has ever really looked.”

Mangroves are difficult places to conduct research, he explained. “The trees grow incredibly densely and many have horizontal stilt roots that make passing impossible, and of course you always have to travel either through water or deep, cloying mud.” Plus, given that Madagascar’s terrestrial forests are so rich in lemurs, “Why would a primatologist ever look in the mangrove?”

Gardner himself doesn’t typically spend much time in mangroves, but had still come across lemurs in mangroves twice now, leading him to hypothesize that many others might have had similar encounters. So he set out to collect as much anecdotal evidence as he could to supplement his review of the existing literature on the topic. He surveyed hundreds of scientists and conservationists as well as a variety of other people who might have spotted a lemur in a mangrove at some point in the past.

“I knew that I had to contact more than just scientists — after all, I already knew that primatologists rarely went near mangroves — so I also focused on ecotourism guides, hotel staff in coastal areas and so on,” he said. “In all I wrote to over 1200 people.”

The results of Gardner’s study were published in the International Journal of Primatology in April. He found that at least 23 species of lemur in five families have been spotted in mangroves, about 20 percent of all lemur species and about half of the species whose range is known to include mangrove areas.

“Lemurs used mangroves for foraging, sleeping, and traveling between terrestrial forest patches, and some were observed as much as 3 km from the nearest permanently dry land,” Gardner wrote in the study. “However, most records were anecdotal and thus tell us little about lemur ecology in this habitat.”

Still, this is pretty conclusive evidence that mangroves are more widely used by lemurs than has previously been thought. And since 94 percent of lemur species are threatened with extinction, mangroves “merit greater attention from primate researchers and conservationists in Madagascar,” Gardner wrote.

“Given that mangroves are among the most threatened of all tropical ecosystems (Duke et al. 2007; Valiela et al. 2001) and have lost 20%–35% of their global extent since 1980 (FAO 2007; Polidoro et al. 2010; Valiela et al. 2001), an understanding of their role in maintaining primate populations is essential to inform conservation planning, as well as contributing to our knowledge and understanding of primate–habitat interactions,” per the study.

In Madagascar, mangrove extent declined by 21 percent between 1990 and 2010, according to a study released in January 2016.

It’s difficult to say how important mangroves are for lemurs without further research, however. For several of the widespread species Gardner found reports of in mangroves, like the ring tailed lemur, aye-aye, and Coquerel’s sifaka, mangroves make up a tiny portion of their range, meaning mangroves are probably not hugely important for the conservation of those species.

But in northwest Madagascar, where the largest mangrove forests are, there are a number of threatened species — such as the critically endangered Claire’s mouse lemur, the endangered Danfoss’ mouse lemur, and the endangered Northern Giant Mouse Lemur — that only occur in small areas. “If these species are also at home in the mangroves, then that could be very significant,” Gardner said.

A small calf named Noelle and her mother Ngarikoni were loaded onto the same steel barge that carried the other seven one-mile through Lake Baringo to the Roku Conservancy.

The herd crossed what was once a peninsula to feed, but days of intense rain cut off access to the mainland and imprisoned them on Longicharo Island.

Ngarikoni gave birth to Noelle while on the island and were the last to be saved due to the extra cared needed to move such a young giraffe.

'Relief and elation emanated from the rescue team as little Noelle stepped confidently off the custom-built barge and onto dry land, followed by her mother, marking the successful conclusion of this ambitious rescue,' the rescuers shard in a statement.

Wildlife conservations have been working against time to rescue nine endangered giraffes stranded on a flooding Kenyan island and their efforts have paid off with the last two being brought to shore

The intense 15-month project was a collaboration with Ruko Community Conservancy, the Northern Rangelands Trust, and Kenya Wildlife Service, in addition to the Dallas-based Save Giraffes Now and locals living in the area.

David O'Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now, which works on over 20 giraffe conservation projects in nine African countries, said: 'We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue.'

'With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.'

The first daring rescue occurred in December 2020 and rescued a critically endangered Nubian giraffe named Asiwa.

Two juvenile females, Susan and Pasaka, were rescued weeks after and the four remaining adult females, Ngarikoni, Nalangu, Awala and Nasieku, and one adult male, Lbarnnoti, were moved this year.

The area had been plagued with intense rain that caused water levels of Lake Baringo, which is surrounding the peninsula, to steadily rising up to six inches a day.

Ruko rangers brought food to the stranded animals, but with rising water they a long-term was needed.

Working with the other teams, the rangers attempted to get each animal use to the barge by leaving treats like pellets, acacia leaves, seed pods and mangos on board with the hopes the giraffes would walk inside voluntarily and make the journey with ease.

The custom-made steel barge, dubbed 'GiRaft' floats on six empty drums and is reinforced on the sides to keep the giraffe from escaping.

And a small power boat pulled the massive raft down the river to the sanctuary.

'Not only did this groundbreaking project save these giraffe, but it also marks their reintroduction to the mainland for the first time in 70 years,' said O'Connor.

'This rescue is a significant success for both of those reasons.'

The animals are Rothschild's, or Nubian, giraffe, which is a critically endangered subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and into Uganda.

Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya. Pictured is part of the herd that was stranded on the island at their new home at Ruko

Susan Myers, Save Giraffes Now founder and CEO, said: 'Each giraffe has its own personality.'

'Some are very timid, while others are brave and go onto the barge readily. This is a painstaking process, and the team is being very deliberate about the training.'

1148,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Time to build an ark? More flooding expected in the future - constructconnect.com - Journal of Commerce,https://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/infrastructure/2018/05/time-build-ark-flooding-expected-future,"As a winter without end finally gives way to warm spring temperatures, rivers choked with ice and swollen with runoff are causing floods in many parts of Canada.

At the beginning of May, parts of Alberta, Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and, especially, New Brunswick were under water.

As soggy as the situation is now, many regions of Canada are likely to experience more flooding in the future, says Shawna Peddle, director of Partners for Action in the University of Waterloo’s Faculty of Environment.

“There are many reasons,” said Peddle.

“For example, changing weather patterns and an increase in the number of storm cell events. In addition, there is more and more development and paving-over of formerly empty ground, so there are fewer wetlands to absorb run-off.”

On top of that, says Peddle, much of Canada’s water infrastructure is old and out of date, and unable to handle the increased water volumes caused by up-stream development.

Although some regions of the U.S., such as the lower Mississippi River valley, and some countries, such as the Netherlands, are more often under water than Canada, flooding is still the number one cause of insurance and personal losses in this country.

“Most people remember such major floods as Winnipeg in 1950 and 1997, and Calgary in 2013, but they might not know that every province experiences flooding each year,” said Peddle.

“Some of the floods take place in rural areas where relatively few people are affected, and those events might not make the news.”

Although no city or region can be made 100 per cent flood-proof, the risks of a good soaking can be reduced in a number of ways, says Peddle.

Examples include upgrading water-related infrastructure, updating building codes and encouraging closer inter-jurisdictional cooperation.

“Measures can be taken at all levels,” she said. “Everybody has a role to play.”

Another measure the country could take to keeping dry is to equip itself with up-to-date flood maps, says Tamsin Lyle, principal engineer at Ebbwater Consulting Inc. in Vancouver.

According to a report of the National Floodplain Mapping Assessment commissioned by Public Safety Canada, the country has mapped the geography of only 28,000 kilometres of waterways.

And although some provinces use once-in-100-years as the flood-risk standard, others use a more conservative once-in-500-years yardstick.

“The risks of flooding in many parts of Canada are growing because the country is growing and people and buildings are being added to vulnerable flood plains every year,” said Lyle.

While there are certainly benefits to living in cities that happen to be located on flood plains, there are also costs, and we need to become more conscious of them and take them into account as we build our cities, she says.

“And when we’re designing our solutions, we need to consider all of the potential natural disasters that could happen in the area, so that we don’t inadvertently worsen the fall-out from another kind of catastrophe,” Lyle said.

“We could, for example, put buildings on stilts, to keep them above water in the case of a flood. But those buildings could collapse if an earthquake struck.”

Dave Murray, a principal and water resource engineer in the Victoria office of consulting engineers Kerr Wood Leidal Associates Ltd., says Canada should look abroad for ideas on flood mitigation.

“We need to study the Netherlands’ Room for the River flood plain management program,” Murray said.

Keeping their heads above water has been a preoccupation of the Dutch since people started settling on the marshy soil near the North Sea.

Two-third of the Netherlands is below sea level. And the rivers which flow through the country on their way to the ocean overflow regularly.

In 1993 and 1995, severe flooding resulted in mass evacuations and left thousands of acres of farmland under water.

As a result, the Dutch government developed a program that enabled the rivers to safely handle greater volumes of water than in the past.

This was a major shift in Dutch flood mitigation thinking.

Before the 1990’s floods, the Netherlands relied primarily on dikes and berms to keep flood waters at bay.

The Dutch program creates “room for the river” in a number of ways — increasing stream depth, storing water, relocating dikes, creating high water channels, and lowering into the river structures that disrupt water flow.

The program allows land lying along rivers to act as natural water sponges in the event of a flood.

Since it was developed, the Dutch have taken the Room for the River program to other countries, including the Philippines.",2018-05-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'program', 'future', 'dutch', 'river', 'netherlands', 'rivers', 'number', 'canada', 'flood', 'ark', 'build', 'expected', 'flooding']",Canada,news article,English

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Vietnam and local peoples generosity. Luu Thi Phuong , 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children, she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDPs 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam, she said.However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last years floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life, he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households, said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing.

957,FL-2016-000114-EGY,'Cannot go back': Malawi floods leave thousands homeless - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/cannot-go-back-malawi-floods-leave-thousands-homeless/,"“We just sleep on the floor in the tents,” said 28-year-old mother-of-five Mary Amidu who like thousands of other Malawians fled her flood-ravaged home.

“It’s a camp, so the situation is dire. You just find a small space in the tent with your family and make it home.”

Her village is just ten kilometers (six miles) away on the Mozambique border, beside the west bank of the Shire river which has burst its banks following days of torrential rain.

Across Malawi, at least 56 people have been killed following flash floods while the government estimates almost 83,000 people have been displaced.

The waters last week invaded her home so swiftly that the young widow had to scramble to get her family to safety.

“The floods came very quickly and we had no time to rescue anything. Most of my property went with the floods,” she said. “What was important was to save lives.”

They are now at the emergency camp, located in Bangula, southern Malawi — close to the border with Mozambique, which was hit by tropical cyclone Idai late Thursday, cutting off the coastal city of Berea.

“Although we have food, we have no cooking utensils to prepare the food because everything was lost,” said Amidu who said she fears a long stay at the camp as waters begin to subside.

‘No other choice’

“We cannot go back soon because the water has not receded and so the house has been destroyed. So we will hang around the camp until the situation normalizes. We have no other choice.”

Pilirani Andulu walked 15 kms to the camp after her home collapsed and has been forced to sleep in the open with her two-year-old girl because the tents are full.

A lack of blankets and mosquito nets means her child is exposed to mosquitoes, malaria and cold.

Relief official Humphrey Magalasi has been battling to ensure the 21 camps opened to handle the crisis can keep up.

“We have huge gaps in terms of resources such as food and non-food items,” he told AFP. “What we desperately need right now is food, tents, medication and mosquito nets.”

As many as 1,700 households had settled at the Bangula camp as of Thursday.

So far, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs has received just 5,000 bags of rice, supplied by China.

At Bangula airfield, Magalasi has also been dispatching food and emergency supplies to areas cut off by flooding including Makhanga, 65 kms from Bangula.

‘Accessible by boat or by air’

“We are airlifting supplies to Makhanga where about 2,000 households have been affected,” he said.

“Due to the flooding, the area is only accessible by boat or by air. We intend to airlift 600 bags of rice and other non-food items to Makhanga.”

At least 56 people have died in flood-hit areas as of Wednesday, according to the government, while 577 had been injured and three are missing.

“Most of the displaced families are living in camps. So far, a total of 187 camps have been established in the affected districts,” said the government in a statement.

“Assessments to establish the extent of damage in all the 14 affected districts (of Malawi’s 28) are still underway.”

The floods also caused heavy damage to property, including roads and crops which forced President Peter Mutharika to declare a state of disaster.

An AFP correspondent saw extensive damage to fields of corn, also known as maize, around Bangula. The destruction could potentially wreak havoc with the harvest due in April and May.

The country’s Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services has warned Malawians to expect further downpours.

The shutters of the Kochupampa and Anathode-Kakki dams were opened due to heavy downpour, causing the bridge to get submerged, The News Minute reported.

Travancore Devaswom Board President A Padmakumar has appealed to pilgrims to avoid Sabarimala for now. “It is dangerous to travel through the bridges now,” he said. The authorities have issued directives to stop the pilgrims at Pathanamthitta and Erumely.

The pilgrims are headed to Sabarimala for the Niraputhari ritual, for which the temple is expected to be opened on Tuesday, The New Indian Express reported.

At least 39 people have died in rain-related incidents in Kerala until Monday. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh described the situation “very serious”, and announced a flood-relief package of Rs 100 crore for the state.

Meanwhile, a team of wildlife enthusiasts and forest officials saved an elephant from being swept away in flood waters near the Athirapally waterfall in Thrissur district on Monday, the Hindustan Times reported. The animal had managed to climb on a rocky terrain but could not move out, until help arrived.

“The elephant was tired and it seems it was stranded there for more than 24 hours,” an unidentified senior forest official said. “We found gushing water should be controlled to save it. We immediately approached the officials of Peringalkooth dam and they agreed to shut three sluice gates for two hours. Once the water receded, we burst crackers and led the tusker to the forests.”

In May, an atypically high number of households are likely facing Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes in Kenya. Poor urban households dependent on casual wage labor or work in the informal sector continue to face difficulty purchasing their minimum food needs due to the impacts of COVID-19 movement restrictions on economic activity. In some rural areas, recent floods, localized market closures, slowdowns in food supply chains resulting in high prices, and the absence of school meals are negatively affecting household food access. On the area level, however, the above-average long rains season is broadly beneficial for livestock and crop production and continues to drive Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes.

As of May 26, 2020, the Kenya Ministry of Health has confirmed 1,348 cases of COVID-19 with 891 active cases and 52 deaths across 27 counties. Restrictions such as a nightly curfew and movement in and out of Nairobi Metropolitan Area, Kilifi, Kwale, Mandera, and Mombasa counties remain in place until at least June 6. Additional movement restrictions in and out of the Eastleigh neighbourhood in Nairobi and Old Town in Mombasa are in place due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases.

According to satellite-derived data, cumulative March to May rainfall broadly ranges from 120 to 200 percent of average across the country. Localized areas of Turkana, Wajir, Isiolo, Laikipia, Kwale, Kitui, and Tana River have received 200 to 400 percent of average rainfall. Recent heavy rains led to floods in 36 counties, where over 800,000 people were affected, including 237 fatalities and over 116,000 displaced. The floods also led to loss of property and livestock, considerable damage to crops, and disruption of agricultural activities in high and medium maize production areas. Worst-affected areas include Tana River, Mandera, Marsabit, and Turkana. With Lake Victoria reaching its highest water level on the historical record and a high likelihood of above normal rainfall in June, there is a threat of additional flooding from overflowing dams and river backflow. There also remains an increased risk for waterborne diseases, evidenced by an outbreak of cholera in Marsabit and Turkana and ICPALD/FAOâ??s Rift Valley Fever alert.

More desert locust hopper bands have been detected in northwest Kenya where control operations are ongoing. Mature swarms are still present in northwest and central Kenya, but damage to rangeland or crops are localized. Following a revised appeal for 32.1 million USD to curb the spread of the desert locusts, 61 percent of the requested funds have been received. The impacts of the desert locusts will likely continue to be mitigated given the ongoing procurement of necessary equipment for ground and air operations. However, efforts are likely to continue to be limited by insecurity in some areas along the Kenya-Somali border, most notably in Mandera county.

Despite the floods and desert locust infestation, the above-average rains continue to improve livestock production and crop growth prospects on the national level. Remote sensing imagery shows above-normal vegetation conditions across most of the country in mid-May, though localized areas of below-normal conditions are present. While late-planted crops (early to mid-April) in parts of the eastern and southeastern marginal agricultural lowlands are likely to be water-stressed in coming weeks with the end of the rainfall season, impacts may be locally significant but offset by above-average yields in terms of net national maize production. Most early planted maize crops are in good condition and in the reproductive to maturity stages.

Maize grain prices are being impacted by COVID-19 movement restrictions. In April, maize prices in urban reference markets ranged from 11 to 22 percent above the five-year average driven by delayed supply of cross-border imports from neighboring countries due to border restrictions and mandatory COVID-19 screenings of truck drivers. In Tharaka, Kilifi, Garissa, Wajir, and Mandera, above-average maize prices were 6 to 22 percent above their five-year averages primarily driven by declines in household stocks, COVID-19 related delays in the supply chain, and increased demand due to higher prices of substitutes. Across the rest of country, prices were mostly average except in Kitui, Makueni, and Turkana, where maize prices were 6 to 21 percent below average given proximity to cross-border source markets and available household stocks.",2020-05-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['increase', 'insecure', 'areas', 'phase', 'kenya', 'message', 'prices', 'update', 'covid19', 'production', 'key', 'rainfall', 'food', 'turkana', 'floods', 'impacts', 'maize', 'population', 'average', 'restrictions']",Kenya,news article,English

The flood situation in Assam continued to deteriorate Saturday with one more person losing his life, taking the toll to seven, as over 14 lakh people were affected by the deluge across 25 districts of the state. Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal called Union Home Minister Amit Shah and briefed him about the latest flood situation in the state.



Sonowal said 24x7 flood control rooms have been activated across the districts and that he is monitoring the situation personally.



Meanwhile, Shah assured all help from the Centre to the north eastern state and asked the Assam government to ensure all-out efforts to provide relief to the flood-affected.

According to the daily flood report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), one person was killed at Sissibargaon in Dhemaji district.

With this, the total number of persons who lost their lives in flood-related incidents in the state this year has gone up to seven.



At present, over 14.06 lakh persons have been affected by the floods in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Sonitpur, Darrang, Baksa, Barpeta, Nalbari, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, Goalpara, Kamrup, Morigaon, Hojai, Nagaon, Golaghat, Majuli, Jorhat, Sivasagar, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Cacha and West Karbi Anglong districts, the ASDMA said.

Barpeta is the worst hit with 5.22 lakh people suffering, followed by Dhemaji (1.38 lakh people) and Morigaon (nearly 95,000 persons).

Till Friday, around 8.7 lakh people were affected by the deluge in 21 districts of the state.

The NDRF and SDRF have rescued 848 persons in the last 24 hours across the state, while 4,476.74 quintals of rice, dal, salt and 7,907.11 litres of mustard oil have been distributed along with tarpaulin, water pouches and other essential items.

Currently, the Brahmaputra at Guwahati, Nimatighat in Jorhat, Tezpur in Sonitpur, Goalpara and Dhubri towns, while the Barak at AP Ghat in Cachar and Badarpurghat in Karimganj are flowing above the danger mark.

The ASDMA report said at present, 2,168 villages are under water and 51,752 hectares of crop areas have been damaged.

It said authorities are running 234 relief camps and distribution centres in 21 districts where 20,047 people have taken shelter. Embankments, roads, bridges, culverts and other infrastructure have been hit at various places in Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Kamrup, Barpeta, Baksa, Kokrajhar, Hojai, Darrang,

Biswanath, Chirang, Dibrugarh, Nalbari, Dhubri, Majuli, Sivasagar, West Karbi Anglong, Hailakandi, Golaghat and Bongaigaon districts.

Massive erosion has been reported at several places of Chirang, Barpeta, Sonitpur and Bongaigaon districts, the report added. Meanwhile, heavy rains have damaged train tracks in Lumding-Badarpur hill section under the Lumding Division of Northeast Frontier Railway, prompting the authorities to cancel a number of trains in the area.

""The repair work has already started on a war footing and senior railway officers are camping at the site, monitoring the restoration work. But, heavy rain is continuing in the area, making the soil loose.

""It is expected that the restoration work will be completed by July 16 if the weather condition does not deteriorate further,"" NF Railway Chief Public Relations Officer Pranav Jyoti Sharma said.

""I have just read the relevant information. I suggest you raise it with the defence ministry for more details,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said when asked whether China has expressed dissatisfaction to Sri Lanka for refusing to let its submarines to dock in Colombo port.

The remarks came as China gets ready to host Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wicikramasinghe for the high-profile silk road summit on May 14-15.

""What I can tell you is that China and Sri Lanka enjoy traditional friendship. The two sides maintain sound cooperation in the fields of politics, economy, culture and military to military exchanges,"" Geng said.

China has made about $8 billion investments in Sri Lanka in the last few years, specially in port projects like Hambantota and Colombo ports.

It continues to pressure the island nation for docking its submarines despite assertion by Sirisena government that it will not permit them due to concerns from India.

India has expressed concern over the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa's government for permitting a Chinese submarine in Colombo harbour in 2014.

China's request to dock its submarines coincided with the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Colombo.

China says it wants docking facilities for its submarines to take part in the anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden.

In February this year, Sri Lankan Ambassador to China Karunasena Kodituwakku told the media here that Colombo will not permit any military activity by China in any of its ports including Hambantota where a Chinese firm plans to acquire 80 percent in view of India's concerns.

However, China is happy that Wickaramansinghe has consented to take part in its Belt&Road Forum.

Significantly, Wickaramansinghe and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif are the only two top leaders from South Asia to attend the conference in which India is yet to confirm its participation owing to its objections to the USD 46 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

The other South Asian countries would be represented by either ministerial and official level delegation. China is yet to release the list of delegates participating in the event.

During his visit, Wickramasinge is expected to finalise the Hambantota Port deal as well as a Chinese free trade zone in the area which were stalled by public protests.

Saddled with heavy Chinese loans, Sri Lanka offered to lease 80 per cent of the loss making Hambantota port for 99 years lease. The two sides are also expected to finalise Free Trade Agreement.",2017-05-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['chinese', 'visit', 'china', 'port', 'lanka', 'sri', 'prime', 'colombo', 'refuses', 'submarines', 'hambantota', 'keeps', 'submarine', 'mum', 'dock']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
1353,FL-2021-000030-IDN,"Rivers can be climate change solutions, too (commentary) - Mongabay.com",https://news.mongabay.com/2021/03/rivers-can-be-climate-change-solutions-too-commentary/,"The usual avenues for addressing and adapting to climate change–like protecting forests and ramping up clean energy sources–typically overlook one powerful solution: rivers.

Rivers and their floodplains have the potential to act as shock absorbers to climate change, and are powerful agents for keeping wildlife and communities healthy and resilient.

The most effective climate action plans will account for this and incorporate rivers into their plans for a climate-resilient future, argues Michele Thieme, a freshwater scientist at World Wildlife Fund.

This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.

This past December marked the 5th anniversary of the landmark Paris Agreement. Soon after, the Biden Administration rejoined the Paris Agreement as one of their first actions in office. And in January, the Climate Adaptation Summit once again convened global leaders and local stakeholders to accelerate adaptation action.

As these milestones reinvigorate a call to action for our politicians and business leaders to act on climate and “ramp up climate ambition,” all eyes inevitably turn to the usual avenues for addressing and adapting to climate change: forests, clean energy and waving goodbye to our toxic relationship with fossil fuels. And while mitigation efforts continue to dominate the conversation, adaptation is ever-increasing in importance in global discussions as extreme weather and its impacts worsen around the world and countries work to build stronger national commitments.

Funding, policies and actions supporting adaptation, especially nature-based solutions, however, remain weak. They overlook a powerful resource in the fight to adapt to a changing climate: rivers.

We are seeing the climate crisis manifest through water. Droughts and floods are increasing in frequency and severity from the Mekong River to the arid Rio Grande, from the plains of Africa to the world’s largest tropical wetland, South America’s Pantanal.

Rivers and their floodplains have the potential to act as shock absorbers to climate change. But maximizing their ability to do so requires strategic interventions that keep their natural features intact or incorporate green and grey infrastructure that allow natural processes to occur. Governments and business leaders must prioritize climate adaptation actions that include rivers as part of the toolbox of nature-based solutions for solving the climate crisis.

Rivers: Unsung heroes of climate adaptation

Rivers are powerful agents for keeping wildlife and communities healthy and resilient. Their natural functions provide life-giving resources and, critically for sinking deltas around the world, protect coastal areas against rising sea levels. Let’s dive deeper on a few of these functions:

Sediment flow: Rivers carry sediment all the way to the ocean where, over time, the deposited sediment accumulates to build a delta. Deltas that are starved of natural sediment flows are at risk of being inundated by rising seas. The natural flows also provide sediments to reinforce riverbanks and deliver nutrients to fertile agricultural lands and mangrove forests along the floodplains and a river’s edge. Infrastructure, such as dams, blocks the flow of sediment, one of the causes of sinking and shrinking deltas.For example, over 100 billion tons of sediment is now stored behind upstream dams, greatly reducing sediment flows to coasts around the world. According to a recent study, at least 25 million people live in sediment-starved deltas and thus are vulnerable to increased coastal flooding and inundation.

Flood risk reduction: Floodplains and wetlands along rivers are like sponges, providing a buffer for the rising and swelling of rivers, especially during flooding events. As climate change exacerbates floods, it is more important than ever that we protect and restore floodplains and wetlands. Without action, the costs to society are potentially enormous. For example, coastal flooding alone could cost up to $1 trillion per year in damages by 2050 in coastal cities if no adaptation action is taken. Restoring floodplains and coastal wetlands, along with other interventions, is a critical preventative measure against such losses.

Food and water security: River systems are among the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems on the planet. Early civilizations flocked to rivers for their ability to support fertile agricultural lands, clean drinking water, and protein such as fish. This holds true today. River fisheries and those from other inland wetlands provide a source of protein for hundreds of millions of people As communities become increasingly stressed by climate change, it is more important than ever to protect the basic needs that rivers provide.

See related: Review all of Mongabay’s features on solutions to challenges like climate change here.

Current state of affairs

When rivers are able to flow naturally and are not impeded by infrastructure, like dams, we call these “free-flowing” rivers. They are vital to supplying climate adaptation services, but increasingly, human activities are severing rivers. This decline in river health is sounding alarms to freshwater scientists everywhere:

Connectivity: Infrastructure development and other man-made changes have fragmented or disrupted two-thirds of Earth’s longest rivers.

Species decline: Populations of freshwater species have experienced a staggering 84% decline since 1970

Dams and infrastructure: There are roughly 60,000 large dams around the world, with over 3,700 more hydropower dams currently planned or under construction.

Rivers and their floodplains lose the ability to buffer against floods and to deliver needed sediments to downstream deltas as they are fragmented. The Mekong River illustrates a harsh reality communities face when infrastructure is poorly planned.

The Mekong Delta is currently shrinking and sinking, having lost about 500 hectares of land in the decade leading up to 2012. While sea-level rise and groundwater extraction play a role, the immediate major causes of higher tides and salt intrusion in the delta are sand mining and trapping of sediments behind upstream dams.

Additional planned dams within the Mekong Basin will further exacerbate this problem, putting the tens of millions of people living in the delta at even greater risk for increased land loss, flooding and inundation.

In one hopeful measure, the Cambodian government has put a 10-year moratorium on any new dams on the main stem of the Mekong in Cambodia.

Wins to build on

Countries from around the world and other members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recently signed up to support the motion, ‘Protecting rivers and their associated ecosystems as corridors in a changing climate.’ This sets an important precedent for incorporating river protection into climate action policy.

There are a few other bright spots where governments and civil society are taking action to ensure that rivers and their floodplain and riparian zones can continue to act as corridors and buffers in a changing climate. One example is the recent action of the Colombian government to designate the entire free-flowing Bita River Basin as a Ramsar site, i.e. an internationally protected wetland. Another example is Mexico’s decrees for water reserves across nearly 300 basins that have effectively protected against over-extraction of water or blocking of river flows in some of the most intact basins of the country.

In Mongolia, the government has recently revised and approved 8.2 million hectares of water protection zones including riparian areas from mining and industrial development across seven provinces and is replicating this process in six additional provinces. In the U.S., the Wild & Scenic River designation has so far protected 13,413 miles of 226 rivers in 41 states. And this past autumn, U.S. environmental groups and the hydropower industry signed a joint statement to collaborate on river restoration and decarbonizing US electricity.

The burgeoning efforts to restore rivers began in the United States and have now spread to Europe, where the recent commitment of the European Union to dismantle dams and open up 25,000 km of rivers provides another compelling example. The “Room for the River” initiative of the Dutch government has taken measures at more than 30 locations along the Rhine, the Meuse, the Waal, and the Ijssel to give these rivers space to flood safely.

This progress is evidence that actions that allow rivers to act as corridors and buffers to build resilience in a changing climate are possible and that there is opportunity to replicate these wins.

A path forward

Humanity has always depended on the life-giving resources that rivers provide. As our global temperatures rise, people will be more dependent on rivers than ever before – both in terms of the benefits that they provide and the havoc they can bring if not well managed.

We cannot afford to continue to destroy one of our tools in the fight to adapt to climate change. Rivers need a seat at the table. The best-laid climate action plans will be those that account for the nature-based solutions rivers and floodplains provide in adapting to a changing climate. Business and policy leaders can incorporate rivers into their plans to support the flow towards a climate-resilient future.

When we think of climate solutions, let’s also think of rivers.

983,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Italy to resume unfinished barrier project that could have stopped Venice floods - Euronews,https://www.euronews.com/2019/11/14/italy-to-resume-unfinished-barrier-project-that-could-have-stopped-venice-floods,"In 1984, Italy launched a flood barrier project called Mose. It was supposed to protect the lagoon city of Venice from high tides.

If everything had gone according to plan, Tuesday’s high tide should never have reached Venice, let alone flood its basilica, submerge its squares and inundate its historic palaces.

But Venice's Mose project was never completed, and in November 2019, the city suffered its worst flooding since 1966.

The governor of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia said the ""aqua alta"", or ""high tide"", has done ""apocalyptic damage"" to Venice, while the mayor Luigi Brugnaro said: ""The future of Venice is at stake.""

On Thursday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte visited the lagoon city, in the hope to conclude the flood barrier project as soon as possible.

What happened to the Mose project?

Mose is an acronym for “Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico”, or “Experimental Electromechanical Module”, and refers to the biblical figure Moses who parted the Red Sea to enable the Israelites to flee to safety from Egypt.

It was designed in 1984 when the Italian government asked engineers to draw up plans to build a barrier at sea to defend the fragile city of Venice from the constant threat of high tides.

Work began in 2003, with the project's inauguration by Berlusconi, and should have been finished by 2016.

But the project was plagued by corruption, cost overruns and prolonged delays, and was at the centre of many bribery cases.

Such as...?

A report by Italy's L'Espresso magazine highlighted one particular case study after accessing court documents:

Their findings outlined how, in April 2013, the Italian finance police (Guardia Finanza) seized 12 million euros and bank accounts belonging to Giancarlo Galan, former governor of the region and undersecretary in Berlusconi's administration.

According to prosecutors, the bribes Galan cashed in were reinvested in luxury apartments in Dubai as well as factory buildings in Italy's northern Veneto region.

In 2014, Galan entered a plea deal for a 2 year and 10 months sentence for corruption.

The investigation into money laundering related to the Mose project involves a number of players and a network of offshore enterprises, some of them based in Panama. Galan's accountants, Guido and Christian Penso, ended up named in the now famous Panama Papers investigation. According the the prosecutors, they were helping Galan transfer money abroad totalling over 1.5 million euros. This sum was later transferred to a Croatian bank account belonging to the wife of another Galan's accountant, Paolo Venuti.

Venuti, L'Espresso's investigators reported, is also at the centre of a separate money laundering investigation, tied not to Mose but to a shoe factory: he is accused of moving around 33 million euros abroad and investing part of them in real estate in Dubai.

What happens now?

The modern-day Moses consists of 78 bright yellow mobile underwater barriers, when activated, rise above the surface and prevent surging tides from the Adriatic Sea flooding the Venetian lagoon.

All 78 gates are now in place and engineers are working on the mechanics of raising them simultaneously once tides of more than 110 cm are forecast, up to 3m.

The first testing is expected next year.

Engineers are predicting the sea defence system will be ready at the end of 2021 at a cost of €5.5 billion. The total cost, including all expenses, is estimated at €7 billion.

Will it be enough?

Experts worry that the Mose system was not designed to deal with the sort of rising sea waters that recent climate-change models have predicted.

A report by the U.N.’s science and culture agency UNESCO said Mose was planned on a base scenario of sea levels in the northern Adriatic rising some 22 cm by 2100, but many scientists fear that assumption is far too optimistic.

""A rise of 100 cm should not be excluded"" [...] with the projections given in this report there should be no doubt that the sea level will eventually rise to a value that will not be sustainable for the lagoon and its historical city,"" the report warned.

""The planned mobile barriers (Mose) might be able to avoid flooding for the next few decades, but the sea will eventually rise to a level where even continuous closures will not be able to protect the city from flooding. The question is not if this will happen, but only when it will happen"".

Georg Umgiesser, an oceanographer and researcher at the CNR and at the Institute of marine sciences, told Euronews that his projections showed a similarly worrying trend.

""In the scenario of sea levels rising by 50 centimetres, we will have to close it once a day, while it is designed to close twenty times a year, no more. There are maintenance cycles to be respected, associated costs... At this rate, in 30 to 40 years, it will already be out of date,"" Umgiesser said.

Mario De Marchi, Vice-President of the Order of Engineers of Venice argues, however, that it's important to finish the project: ""It would not make sense to leave it unfinished because it is now considered useless . Even If it were to last for 30 years, we would at least solve the problem for that period of time.""

It is 7 a.m. on a chilly morning in September.

Alice Akinyi Amonde is standing on a beach along the Kenyan shores of Lake Victoria. She makes her living by selling fish, and she's waiting for her boat to come in from a night on the lake so she can take the fisherman's catch, clean it and sell it in a nearby village.

When things were going well in her village of Nduru Beach, she'd earn about $50 a day. Now she is lucky if she makes $3 a day.

The reason for this downturn: In March, after prolonged heavy rains, Nduru Beach, population roughly 1,000, was literally submerged in water. The homes, typically constructed with sturdy and thick mud walls and metal roofs, were damaged and destroyed. Flood waters carried away the villagers' cows, chickens and other farm animals.

No deaths were reported among the residents, who fled inland. Some have found alternate housing or are staying with family or friends. Others live in crowded makeshift quarters on the grounds of a local church and in schoolrooms. They depend on aid and the charity of neighbors for basic needs such as food.

Even now, months later, many houses are submerged in five feet of water. Amonde is one of the very few who have returned, hoping to earn some money again in the fish trade. The fishing boat she owns survived the flooding.

She and her children are squatting in a rusty abandoned building next to the flooded beach.

No Sex For Fish

Last year, a team from NPR met Alice Amonde when we traveled to Kenya to do a story about a revolutionary program called No Sex For Fish.

In her village, and others along the lake, men do the fishing and women sell the catch. In the 1970s, a new practice arose that the women hated.

The population of fish in the lake began to diminish because of overfishing and environmental problems â?? sewage and agricultural runoff, for example.

So the men began saying: Give me sex, and I'll make sure you get fish to sell.

Many women felt they had no alternatives even if it meant they could be infected with HIV. ""I exchange sex, I get fish,"" Milka Onyango told us. The 40-year-old mother of six said, ""I don't care about getting HIV. Me, I need fish. I need earning to sustain my family.""

The women in Nduru Beach came up with a bold idea: What if women owned the boats? What if there was ... ""no sex for fish.""

With the initial help of a Peace Corps volunteer, the women got grants from USAID and later from the charity World Connect to buy their own boats. They hired men to fish for them. They flipped the power dynamic. Early on, a With a series of grants, the No Sex For Fish program got about 30 boats and gave them to women, including Amonde. The women hired men to do the fishing for them. It was an unprecedented flip of the power dynamic. Suddenly, women were in charge. They earned a good income. They told us how happy and proud they were.

On a sunny Sunday during our visit in November 2019, we visited Amonde in her well-kept home. Sitting on a comfy couch, we shared a meal of fried, fresh-caught fish and homemade bread while a kitten played at our feet.

Now the lake has risen so high that she can only see the roof of her home.

The walls of other homes are above water but cracked, rendering them uninhabitable.

And the No Sex For Fish program has been devastated by the flooding and its aftermath.

Thick invasive water hyacinth weeds, washed ashore by the swollen lake, surround the homes and fishing boats. Some of the boats are so entangled they cannot be used. And when fishermen do go out they blame the tangle of weeds in the lake itself for the poor catch â?? they say they're not able to row out to breeding sites where they can net hundreds of fish.

""The swelling of the lake has totally destroyed our lives,"" she says.

""There are no chances of going back to my home,"" she says. ""You cannot even know that my home stood there.""

The reasons for this catastrophic flooding are up for debate. Researchers caution that one season of heavy and prolonged rains would not likely cause such a dramatic water level rise.

Reports are that earlier flooding along the beaches of Lake Victoria, in September 2019, was triggered by the closing of an outlet on the Nile River in Uganda.

Christopher Aura, a scientist with the Kenya Maritime Fisheries Institute, has his own theory: ""The waters of Lake Victoria are swelling as a result of climate change."" But more research is needed.

Flipping the power dynamic

Even before the catastrophic flooding, the collective No Sex For Fish had problems to address. Many of their wooden boats were no longer fit to go out on the lake. It costs about $1,000 for a new boat propelled by oars, $1,500 for a sailboat. Those sums were beyond the reach of the women.

So the collective was preparing a new grant for money to repair and replace their vessels. Justine Adhiambo Obura, a leader of the collective, was optimistic: ""When you have hope, you can get.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR Julia Gunther for NPR

Now, however, her mood â?? and the mood of her peers â?? is far different.

""My lovely house is gone,"" Obura says. ""I have nothing.""

Like Justine Adhiambo Obura, Naomy Akoth, a mother of four, is struggling to pick up the pieces.

Akoth got her own boat through No Sex For Fish. ""I was very, very happy because my life changed,"" she says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Julia Gunther For NPR Julia Gunther For NPR

She also owned a small boarding house along the shore where itinerant fishermen stayed. It's among the buildings destroyed by the floods.

""I am just surviving by the grace of God. The floods destroyed my source of living and destroyed me completely. I am currently staying with my children in a classroom and rely only on well-wishers for food,"" she says as she prepares breakfast for her children â?? their first meal since lunch the day before

""I was very scared especially for my four children. I guessed it was a matter of time before my home could be affected by the waters. Every day the waters kept rising and it was worsened by heavy rains which also brought flash floods,"" says Akoth.

The floods have washed away other means of supporting a family in Nduru Beach. Cheryl Awuor depended on her livestock for income.

""My goats died. They were swept away by the floods. I am still heartbroken, I had hopes of making a good life from them,"" says Awuor.

A widow who has 3 children, Awuor now shares temporary classroom quarters with Akoth and two other families.

What next?

The fishing trade that sustained many of the families of Nduru Beach (and other fishing villages) has collapsed. The women from No Sex For Fish worry that even if fishing were to become possible again, the practice of trading sex for fish would re-emerge due to the difficulty of catching fish in the weed-clogged lake.

So the refugees from Nduru Beach live in limbo. The women interviewed by NPR in September 2020 say the government has not provided support or assistance. ""The only people who have been helping those who were displaced are businessmen and a few politicians,"" says Cheryl Awuor.

But the government says there is a limit to what it will do. ""Victims of such circumstances should know that when such tragedies occur, the government only assists to save lives and not to make life comfortable for them,"" is what Ruth Odinga, Kisumu County director of special programs, told NPR.

According to Odinga, the victims were warned in advance to move to higher grounds but some families did not heed the warnings â?? although several of the women interviewed by NPR dispute this. ""No, we did not receive any warnings,"" says Naomy Akuth. ""The region has been prone to floods the last couple of years but this year it was worse.""

Patrick Higdon, who administered earlier grants to No Sex For Fish from the charity World Connect, sent a field agent to Nduru Beach this fall to assess the situation.

The women told the agent they very much want to go back and pick up their fishing trade. But they need financial support to do so, they said. And they worry that more flooding is in the future.

So they are trying to think of other ways to earn their living. If fishing isn't in the near future, the Nduru Beach refugees wonder about a dairy goats project â?? or growing rice on the flooded terrain.

There are ""many hurdles to jump,"" says Higdon. But ""the ideas and energy are there as ever."" As is the hope for better days to come.

""I am still hopeful that fate will change for us,"" says Akoth, the mother of four. ""The damage that we have received is immense and it will take us time to resume our normal trade. I am hoping that the water levels will reduce so that I can pick up my life again.""

The battle of September covers of renowned magazines is on.

September, the month that marks the change of seasons, is critical for magazines. Editors give it all they've got in coming up with great ideas and producing an excellent issue.

The cover, as the first thing readers see, naturally becomes the most important part that goes into making a magazine. The best of the best will be used, from photographers, stylists, makeup artists and the most attractive and 'in' models or stars.

Cosmopolitan invited Angelababy, a Hong Kong based model, to add new vitality into the cover. Harper's BAZAAR asked Tang Wei to shoot a face-shot cover with dazzling and charming red lips. Zhang Ziyi and Shu Qi both collaborated with ELLE and shot feminine and graceful covers. Vogue and Marie Claire gathered supermodels to cover this significant month.

Chinese actress Fan Bingbing has joined hands with top-class men's magazine Esquire and worked up quite a transformation for the magazine's 15th anniversary issue. Her delicate features and beautiful locks were nowhere to be seen with her new 'bald' head and masculine expression, making her stand out among the numerous feminine covers of other magazines.

This is the third time Fan Bingbing worked with Esquire. When asked whether she is scared for her upcoming 30th birthday, Fan replied: ""I'm scared of drinks with color, nightmares and tanning under the sun, but I'm not afraid of turning 30.""",2011-08-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['fan', 'issue', 'scared', 'magazine', 'bingbing', 'covers', 'making', 'outshines', 'worked', 'magazines', 'cover']",China,news article,English
1629,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Living dangerously: The plight of Ntoroko flood-affected families - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/living-dangerously-the-plight-of-ntoroko-flood-affected-families-3360444,"By Alex Ashaba More by this Author

More than 150 families, part of the 10,000 people who were displaced by the floods two years ago after water levels in Lake Albert rose, are living in a dire condition.

The lives of many locals who have gathered in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District near Lake Albert, are being threatened since the temporal houses erected in water are on the verge of collapsing. The families are also in dire need of food and other essential basic needs.

The unstable houses, made of iron sheets, and reeds are being held by timber poles erected in water, some of which are rotting away and can no longer hold their weight.

Mr Justice Kabagambe,46, a resident of Kamuga Village in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District, one of the affected people, in April last year erected a temporary house above the water after his house that is a few metres away from the shores of Lake Albert, was submerged by floods.

Following the incident, he joined another family whose house was submerged days later. “I decided to build a temporary four-room house where I am staying with my family,” he said.

“The family is not sure of a single meal in a day but we get support from friends and well-wishers. My house is not stable and it shakes whenever it gets windy, especially at night, we fear it may collapse,” Mr Kabagambe added.

Mr Kabagambe’s house is surrounded by 40 others in the same condition. The houses are hard to access and one has to use a boat as a means of transport to visit friends and family members settled away from the flooded area. Similarly, food and other requirements are transported by boat from the dry areas. The operators of the few available boats demand a fee for their services.

There are a few makeshift shops built above the flooded areas. Mr Kabagambe’s family is forced to keep indoors since they have no compound.

The communities also lack clean water for domestic use and are forced to draw contaminated water from the lake.

The families lack toilets too and are forced to defecate in the water. “We use the same water to ease ourselves since our toilets and tap stands were submerged,” Mr Kabagambe said.

His plight is shared by more than 150 families who have found shelter above the water.

The sub-counties that are mostly affected include Kamuga, Kachwakumu and Rwangara. The affected families are, however, holding on to hope that the government will come to their rescue.

Those who were displaced in 2019 and later in 2020, were first sheltered in nearby schools of Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu, which were later submerged. The floods left homes, shops, schools, gardens and health facilities submerged.

Last year when the State minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Mr Musa Ecweru, and other officials visited the area, local leaders requested government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

Current situation

The chairperson of Kachwakumu Village, Mr Rwaheru Byaruhanga, said while some people sought refuge with friends and family, others have nowhere to go.

He said more than 200,000 houses are still submerged and only rooftops are seen floating on top of water. “People spend days indoors and school-going children have not reported to school because their schools were submerged. Our people have also risked their lives because any time, these makeshift houses may collapse. They will also contract disease because they use contaminated water,” Mr Byaruhanga said.

Lack of food

Ntoroko District’s main economic activity is fishing and cattle keeping. The livelihood of locals was greatly hit since the floods affected livestock farming.

Accessing health centres is also a big challenge and they have to hire boats to reach Butungama or Rwebisengo sub-county for medical service. The nearby Rwangara Health Centre III was submerged.

Dr James Kato, the officer-in-charge of Rwebisengo Health Centre III, said they have to travel long distances to pick drugs.

Mr Byaruhanga said since 2019, they have been requesting the government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

The chairperson of Kanara Sub-county, Mr Friday Mugiisa, said they have never received any relief food.

“People who are stuck in floods have no food to eat and they have been depending on fish. Last month, the UPDF fishing unit on Lake Albert destroyed all boats after accusing our people of illegal fishing,” Ms Mugiisa said.

The Ntoroko County Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, last year told Daily Monitor that the government had promised to relocate the displaced people and settle them at Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. This has not been fulfilled.

“The acres they are talking about are not enough, but sadly, they haven’t been availed to the people,” he said.

The acting chairperson of Ntoroko District, Mr Ben Muthahinga, said they recently received some relief items such as beans, posho and blankets from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), which they want to distribute to displaced people.

He said last week, the Minister for Tourism, Mr Tom Butiime, was in the area to discuss the relocation plan.

Mr Butiime confirmed that he visited Rwebisengo Town Council and held a meeting with local leaders and they agreed that Uganda Wildlife Authority reduces the restrictions on cattle keepers so that they can graze their animals in certain parts of the park.

He said the restrictions will only be applicable for farmers who have cattle but not for people who want to construct shelters in the park.

The Tourism boss also said the affected locals are being registered by the sub-county chief and they will soon be allowed to graze in the park.

Mr Julius Muchunguzi, the head of communications at the OPM, said: “The government is in the process of identifying land where the affected people can be relocated to. We have been supporting them with relief food.”

98,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Somalia: APLF leader narrowly escapes assassination - Waagacusub Media,http://waagacusub.net/articles/997/Somalia-APLF-leader-narrowly-escapes-assassination,"Waagacusub.net - Liyuu Police forces allied with Ethiopia fought Awdal People's Liberation Front (APLF), a unionist rebel group in Dharwanaaje town, near the Somali regional capital of Jigjiga.

The Liyuu or Special Police captured Dharwanaaje town at the outset of the war, prompting APLF leader Suldan Abubakar Elmi Waber to flee to Awdal State, a proposed autonomous state that borders, Djibouti, the Ogaden region and the Gulf of Aden.

The Somali regional President Abdi Iley and the commander in Chief of the notorious Liyuu (Special) Police is allegedly promised to award $3,000,000 (Three million US Dollars) for the extradition or the killing of Suldan Wabar, the leader of the APLF by the breakaway Somaliland administration.

Awdal state, which compromises the Awdal and Selel Provinces are drought-hit regions, and about 240,000 people are reportedly facing food insecurity and risk of famine due to the shortfall of the Gu' season i.e April and June rains between 2014 and 2015.

Mr. Wabar told Waagacusub Media that he knew the plot of the Somali regional President Abdi Iley and Siilaanyo Administration when he rejected an invitation from the Jigjiga administration before they raid his position.

Another source says that the Ethiopian Federal Armies intervened and forced the Liyuu Police to stop chasing the Awdal People's Liberation Front (APLF) since they are not threat to the Ethiopian interest.





Somaliland forces have been committing human rights abuses against the population in Awdal and Selel areas over the last 10 years. A football player was killed in Borama in Sunday last week 11 October 2015.

The authors of a paper published Tuesday developed a more accurate way of calculating land elevation based on satellite readings, a standard way of estimating the effects of sea level rise over large areas, and found that the previous numbers were far too optimistic. The new research shows that some 150 million people are now living on land that will be below the high-tide line by midcentury.

Southern Vietnam could all but disappear.

The first map shows earlier expectations of submerged land by 2050. But the new outlook, the second map, indicates that the bottom part of the country will be underwater at high tide.

More than 20 million people in Vietnam, almost one-quarter of the population, live on land that will be inundated.

Much of Ho Chi Minh City, the nation’s economic center, would disappear with it, according to the research, which was produced by Climate Central, a science organization based in New Jersey, and published in the journal Nature Communications. The projections don’t account for future population growth or land lost to coastal erosion.

Standard elevation measurements using satellites struggle to differentiate the true ground level from the tops of trees or buildings, said Scott A. Kulp, a researcher at Climate Central and one of the paper’s authors. So he and Benjamin Strauss, Climate Central’s chief executive, used artificial intelligence to determine the error rate and correct for it.

In Thailand, more than 10 percent of citizens now live on land that is likely to be inundated by 2050, compared with just 1 percent according to the earlier technique. The political and commercial capital, Bangkok, is particularly imperiled.

Climate change will put pressure on cities in multiple ways, said Loretta Hieber Girardet, a Bangkok resident and United Nations disaster risk-reduction official. Even as global warming floods more places, it will also push poor farmers off the land to seek work in cities.

“It is a dire formula,” she said.

In Shanghai, one of Asia’s most important economic engines, water threatens to consume the heart of the city and many other cities around it.

The findings don’t have to spell the end of those areas. The new data shows that 110 million people already live in places that are below the high tide line, which Mr. Strauss attributes to protective measures like seawalls and other barriers. Cities must invest vastly greater sums in such defenses, Mr. Strauss said, and they must do it quickly.

But even if that investment happens, defensive measures can go only so far. Mr. Strauss offered the example of New Orleans, a city below sea level that was devastated in 2005 when its extensive levees and other protections failed during Hurricane Katrina. “How deep a bowl do we want to live in”? he asked.

The new projections suggest that much of Mumbai, India’s financial capital and one of the largest cities in the world, is at risk of being wiped out. Built on what was once a series of islands, the city’s historic downtown core is particularly vulnerable.

Over all, the research shows that countries should start preparing now for more citizens to relocate internally, according to Dina Ionesco of the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental group that coordinates action on migrants and development.

“We’ve been trying to ring the alarm bells,” Ms. Ionesco said. “We know that it’s coming.” There is little modern precedent for this scale of population movement, she added.

The disappearance of cultural heritage could bring its own kind of devastation. Alexandria, Egypt, founded by Alexander the Great around 330 B.C., could be lost to rising waters.

In other places, the migration caused by rising seas could trigger or exacerbate regional conflicts.

Basra, the second-largest city in Iraq, could be mostly underwater by 2050. If that happens, the effects could be felt well beyond Iraq’s borders, according to John Castellaw, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general who was chief of staff for United States Central Command during the Iraq War.

Further loss of land to rising waters there “threatens to drive further social and political instability in the region, which could reignite armed conflict and increase the likelihood of terrorism,” said General Castellaw, who is now on the advisory board of the Center for Climate and Security, a research and advocacy group in Washington.

On Egypt's Mediterranean coast, August should be prime tourist season. But the seaside restaurants in Alexandria are almost empty. Worries over security are keeping a lot of foreign tourists away. But there's a much bigger worry looming: that hotter weather and a disappearing shoreline could make Egypt's prospects even worse.

Scientists generally agree that human-made climate change – the effect of greenhouse gas emissions from things like cars and factories – is making the sea level higher and its waters warmer.

Rising sea levels are affecting the Nile River delta, the triangle where the Nile spreads out and drains into the sea. It's where Egypt grows most of its crops. According to the World Bank, Egypt — with its already high poverty rates and rapidly growing population — is one of the countries that will be most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

Hazem Adel is already seeing some of those changes firsthand. He sells hats and woven handbags at a stall in front of a wall of concrete barriers on the Alexandria waterfront.

""The water used to flood and cover the people and their cars,"" says Adel. ""That's why the government put up the barriers – to stop the high water so it won't flood the street.""

All along the waterfront, the government has erected barriers to counter increasingly fierce winter storms. There's no beach on this part of the shore. The sand washed away years ago.

Many scientists predict a sea level rise here of more than two feet by the end of the century. Some historic buildings are already crumbling, as salt water seeps into the bricks. Entire neighborhoods could be submerged.

For thousands of years, Alexandria's fortunes have risen and fallen with the sea.

Near the concrete boardwalk, guides lead Arab tourists through a fortress built partly on the ruins of one of the wonders of the ancient world – the lighthouse of Alexandria.

For almost 2,000 years, the stone lighthouse was the tallest building in the world. It used mirrors to reflect the sun, and fires at night, to warn sailors away from the rocks. After a series of earthquakes between the tenth and 14th centuries, it tumbled into the water. Over the centuries, the sea swallowed what had been a thriving port and even the outline of the harbor itself.

Fishermen stand on what are believed to be some of the remains of the base of the lighthouse, casting lines into the water from long poles.

Saleh Hilmi, who has been fishing here for 25 years, says the fish now are smaller than before – he throws the ones he catches to stray cats. Because the sea water is warmer, he says, the bigger fish have retreated to cooler, deeper water.

It's a big worry for climate change experts like Mohammad al-Raey from the University of Alexandria, who has been researching the potential effects of warmer temperatures and rising sea levels for decades.

""The sea level rise would affect all coasts and all beaches,"" he says, looking out over the brilliant blue waters of the Mediterranean along Egypt's north coast. ""The models show the Middle East would increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation.""

Most models predict a possible average mean temperature rise of more than three degrees Fahrenheit over parts of Egypt over the next four decades.

Raey says the effects of hotter weather, including reduced rainfall, would cut agricultural productivity by 15 to 20 percent – a huge blow to a country already struggling to feed its people.

More than half of Egypt's crops are grown along the Nile delta.

All along the delta, the river banks are eroding. With rising sea levels, sea water is seeping into Nile water used for irrigation.

""The crops die,"" says Youssef Ghazali, who has been farming for 50 years. ""If you water them with salty water, they die immediately. If I had proper water, I could grow rice, clover cotton. I could grow anything.""

Ghazali's arms are crisscrossed with red gashes from cutting thistles. He shows me a patch of bare earth where, two years ago, he was growing rice. Now he says it's too salty to grow anything at all.

Other farmers say they have had to abandon traditional crops like sugarcane because of the salinity of the water.

Ghazali says people here are already struggling with river water polluted by runoff from factories — and now they've been told that human activity is changing the very weather.

""We've heard for a long time that we shouldn't burn wood and straw,"" he says. ""They say because of the smoke from that and smoke from the cars, it affects the temperature.""

Other Egyptians aren't so sure.

Further up the Nile delta, near a fishing village called al-Ma'adiya where the Nile meets the Mediterranean, fisherman say winter storms have been so fierce the past two years, some people here believe God is punishing them.

""Last winter was the worst,"" says Bedair Mohammad. ""The sea swallowed up some of the land and got closer and closer to the village. We're seeing things we never saw before, in a way that could make us believe this is anger from God on the village and its people.""

Mohammad says every year the winds get stronger, the waves get higher and more land disappears. They have to go further and further out to sea to find the same fish they used to catch close to shore.

He points to where the pale blue water of the Mediterranean starts to turn brown a few hundred feet closer to shore. It was bare ground just a few years ago – now it's covered in water. In his grandfather's time, it took more than half an hour to walk from the village to the shore. Now it takes less than 10 minutes.

Ten years ago, these were such rich fishing grounds people referred to this stretch of the coast as ""Kuwait"" — because its villages were so prosperous. Now the fish near the shore are smaller and scarcer. Fishermen need motorboats to get out to deeper water instead of the rowboats they used to use.

Mohammad says last year, the winds were so strong, the third story of his house was knocked down. Boats were tossed up from the water into the road.

""In the winter, the sea attacks us,"" he says. ""We are afraid the village will sink into the sea.""",2017-08-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['mediterranean', 'fish', 'sea', 'changes', 'egypt', 'water', 'used', 'rising', 'shore', 'village', 'nile', 'winter', 'effects', 'climate', 'growing', 'jane', 'worries']",Egypt,news article,English
1729,FL-2019-000092-VNM,Vietnam's handling of deadly floods shows how Covid-19 may slow disaster response - The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/vietnams-handling-of-deadly-floods-shows-how-covid-19-may-slow-disaster-response,"JAKARTA - A series of storms buffeting Vietnam this month, claiming the lives of 130 people and leaving 20 missing so far, has underscored the added complexity of responding to disasters during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Typhoon Molave, packing winds of 125kmh, is the fourth big storm to hit the country's central provinces this month, further immiserating the 800,000 people already affected by flooding in the region, as well as in Cambodia and Laos.

In such emergencies, teams of logistics and communications specialists would normally be dispatched from neighbouring countries to help pave the way for the delivery of supplies, and search and rescue missions. This time, owing to the pandemic, Vietnamese officials have declined such offers of help.

""Vietnam made clear that no personnel could come - only items,"" said Ms Adelina Kamal, executive director of the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, better known as the AHA Centre.

To be sure, Vietnam has seen worse and may be able to manage the disaster itself, with or without a pandemic. In 2017, more than a dozen storms triggered floods and landslides that claimed nearly 400 lives and caused the equivalent of $3.5 billion in damage.

Last week, the AHA Centre arranged the airlift of 1,300 kitchen sets, consisting of utensils for cooking and eating, from Subang, Malaysia, the location of one of three Asean regional stockpiles.

But none of the more than 320-strong Emergency Rapid Assessment Team who were already outside Vietnam were permitted to enter.

As Covid-19 threatens to drag on for many more months, emergency response officials will need to rely more on local talent if the pandemic deters the arrival of help from overseas.

There could be a repeat of recent years that saw multiple large-scale disasters, at a time when disaster mitigation officials may already be distracted with Covid-19.

Damage caused by storms and typhoons in the western Pacific in 2018, including Typhoon Mangkhut which claimed more than 130 lives in the Philippines and China, set a record of US$30.2 billion (S$41.2 billion) that year, only to be bested by the figure the following year which topped US$34 billion.

More than 4,300 lost their lives in earthquakes and tsunamis that stuck Indonesia's Central Sulawesi in September 2018. Ms Adelina recalls daily morning meetings in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan to plan airlifts using military aircraft to ferry supplies to victims of that tragedy.

""Without physical coordination, if we have multiple disasters like in 2018, it's going to be difficult,"" Ms Adelina said.

Flooding in Vietnam notwithstanding, this year has been quiet. The airlift to Vietnam this month was AHA Centre's first for a natural disaster since the onset of the pandemic in March, Ms Adelina said

The AHA Centre was established in 2011. By now, teams there have notched up sufficient experience and familiarity to cope with limitations stemming from the pandemic, said Ms Adelina, stressing the need for preparation to deal with disasters.

""We have to start the planning from now on,"" she said. ""People may have been clouded by Covid-19. Maybe they are praying that there won't be a disaster. But we are a disaster-prone region.""

Dr Raditya Jati, head of data, information and disaster communication at Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), said the central government is pushing local governments to identify populated areas prone to flooding and landslides, and temporary shelters that can minimise crowding.

Floods in West Jakarta last month were something of a dress rehearsal for a large-scale disaster, with officials handing out masks and enforcing social distancing, which Dr Raditya said prevented clusters of Covid-19 infections.

Decisions to admit foreign emergency workers remain on a case-by-case basis, Dr Raditya said.

""We are a big country,"" he said. ""There is a challenge to access the whole country.""",2020-10-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'officials', 'response', 'deadly', 'covid19', 'shows', 'disaster', 'lives', 'pandemic', 'adelina', 'floods', 'handling', 'month', 'vietnams', 'slow', 'ms', 'aha']",Vietnam,news article,English

Ongoing heavy rainâ??which has killed nearly 300 and displaced about 500,000 peopleâ??has slowed down operations aimed at controlling the worst locust crisis in decades and increased the risk of the spread of COVID-19.

Dr Simon Missiri, IFRCâ??s Regional Director for Africa said:

â??The ongoing flooding crisis is exacerbating other threats caused by COVID-19 and the invasion of locusts. Travel and movement restrictions meant to slow down the spread of COVID-19 are hampering efforts to combat swarms of locusts that are ravaging crops. Flooding is also a â??threat amplifierâ?? with regards to the spread of COVID-19 as it makes it hard to implement preventive measures.â?

Flooding has left thousands of people homeless, many of them now seeking shelter in temporary accommodation centres where it is not easy or not possible at all to observe physical distancing. As a result, thousands are now at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or waterborne diseases and need emergency food assistance.

â??We are facing an unusually complex humanitarian situation. We are worried that the number of people who are hungry and sick will increase in the coming weeks as flooding and COVID-19 continue to severely affect the coping capacity of many families in the region,â? added Dr Missiri. â??Harsh weather conditions are having a multiplier effect on an already difficult situation and this could potentially lead to worrying levels of food insecurity in the region.â?

Red Cross teams in the affected countries are rushing to respond to multi-faceted and overlapping crises. To respond to flooding, COVID-19 and locusts, the IFRC has provided over 7 million Swiss francs to Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies in East and Horn of Africa.

Red Cross and Red Crescent teams in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda are helping communities mitigate the negative impacts of the triple disaster through community awareness and direct food and non-food support. In Kenya, the Red Cross is conducting assessments in 16 counties, using drones and satellite images. Red Cross teams are also airlifting household items to families that have been marooned by floods.

â??Flooding is a recurrent phenomenon in the region. To break this cycle, we call upon Governments and partners to invest more in preparedness and flood control methods,â? said Dr MISSIRI.",2020-05-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['teams', 'missiri', 'menace', 'raises', 'cross', 'alarm', 'covid19', 'locusts', 'spread', 'food', 'crescent', 'triple', 'kenya', 'flooding', 'floods', 'red']",Kenya,news article,English
632,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Weatherwatch: the West Sussex lexicon of mud - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/19/weatherwatch-the-west-sussex-lexicon-of-mud,"Soon the rain falling on the south of the country after two years of drought will stop being absorbed into the ground and turn the soil to mud. In the north this has already happened and worse.

It might be useful then, to prepare for conversations with strangers about the terrible weather, to brush up on your vocabulary for describing mud.

In her informative and entertaining book Wilding, about turning a West Sussex farm back to nature, Isabella Tree says there are 30 local dialect words for mud.

It is an area where the clay is deep and, once the rain begins in the autumn, presents some serious hazards for farmers and anyone else who ventures into the countryside.

Some of the useful terms are: clodgy, a description of a muddy field path after heavy rain; gawm – sticky foul-smelling mud – and gubber, a black mud of rotting organic matter.

The sound of the words helpfully conjures up the type of mud it describes. Slob or slub for thick mud; smeery, wet and sticky surface mud; stodge, thick pudding mud; and swank, a bog.

Isabella says until hard surfaced roads were invented people took to rivers, canals and the sea in winter rather than risk travelling across the land.

The hieroglyphs on Nile’s Sehel Island near Aswan in southern Egypt are more than 4,000 years old, but worries about the natural rhythm of the Nile, which provides 90% of Egypt's fresh water, are of no less importance today.

""The Nile does not reach its previous levels in the winter and summer flows,"" said 52-year-old Abdel Hares Mohamed, a resident of Aswan who gives Nile boat rides to tourists.

Officials say Egypt currently has around 570 cubic meters (150,000 gallons) of water per person per year. Experts consider a country as water poor if its supply is less than 1,000 cubic meters per person annually.

Experts blame population growth, climate change and a giant hydropower dam built by Ethiopia on the Blue Nile, which Egyptian authorities say poses a threat to its water security.

Ethiopia says it has taken the needs of Egypt and Sudan into account in the construction and scheduled fillings of its Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).

While modern day Egyptians can still empathize with King Djoser's plight, the measures he took to counter the drought would not get much support today. The ancient pharao was instructed by Imhoteb, the designer of his famous Step Pyramid, to offer a sacrifice to Khnum, God of the Nile.

""When Egypt had a famine for seven years, he (King Djoser) made a council ... And Imhoteb told him: we have to give an offering to Khnum,"" said egyptologist Zahi Hawass. ""Because Khnum controlled the water from the Nile.""

924,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Sudanese hope Ethiopian dam ends Blue Nile floods - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2019-11-sudanese-ethiopian-blue-nile.html,"Sudanese farmers like Othman Idris say Ethiopia's construction of a controversial dam on the Blue Nile is a dream come true that would regulate flooding during rainy seasons

The Blue Nile is a renegade river, according to Sudanese farmer Osman Idris, its unpredictable flooding swallows crops and houses as it crashes through Sudan from Ethiopia on its way to Egypt.

""Tonight, the level of water will be low,"" said Idris, a resident of Juref Gharb, a small village on the bank of the Blue Nile outside Khartoum.

""Tomorrow, it will swallow all the houses... It's a renegade river, it rises so fast,"" said the 60-year-old, dressed in a traditional Sudanese robe.

For Idris, Ethiopa's construction of a controversial dam on the Blue Nile is a dream come true, as it promises to regulate the floods that inundate Sudan every rainy season.

This year alone, flash flooding has killed more than 60 and injured dozens in Sudan.

The Blue Nile joins the White Nile in Khartoum and supplies the overwhelming majority of the Nile's water, which runs through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea.

Construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam began in 2012, but since then Egypt has sounded the alarm that the project would severely reduce its water supplies.

Egypt depends on the Nile for about 90 percent of its irrigation and drinking water, and says it has ""historic rights"" to the river guaranteed by treaties from 1929 and 1959.

It sees the project as an existential threat, fearing Ethiopia's rapid construction of the dam might lead to water and food scarcity for millions of Egyptians.

Construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam began in 2012 but the controversial project has raised concern in Egypt which says it would severely reduce its much-needed water supplies

More cash crops

After several rounds of talks failed to resolve the issue, a new dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan was mediated by the United States in Washington earlier this month.

The three delegations agreed to resolve the dispute by January 15, with ministerial-level talks being held this week in Addis Ababa.

Ethiopia insists the $4 billion hydro-electric barrage is essential for its economic growth given that most of its population still lives without electricity.

And in Sudan, farmers hope the dam will provide predictable flow.

Over the years, farmers like Idris who own farms along the Nile have been forced to change their crops due to flood devastation and tonnes of deposited silt.

Brickmakers fire blocks of mud in riverside kilns, producing smoke harmful to crops.

""I had to shift from cultivating fruits and vegetables to animal feed,"" Idris told AFP.

Being reliant on flooding for irrigation means only one harvest per year and limits the kind of crops that can be grown.

If the river's flow were regulated, more intensive agriculture could be practised, Idris said.

The dam could block unwanted silt which brickmakers in Sudan depend on for their livelihood

""We can plant crops through the year. It will be better for the environment and for marketing our products, which means more income for us,"" Idris said.

Ekram Dagash, a professor at Khartoum's Al-Zaiem Al-Azhari University, agreed that Sudan stands to gain from the dam, which will maintain water levels and block unwanted silt.

""Ethiopia is building the dam for one reason only, to produce electricity and export it, not only to neighbouring countries but to the whole African continent,"" she told AFP.

Worried brickmakers

But one group of Sudanese are concerned about the dam: brickmakers, who depend on the silt for their livelihood.

Dozens of small kilns line the river, providing an income for hundreds of brickmakers like Yakoub Noreen.

""If the dam is built, this won't arrive,"" the 40-year-old said of the silt he was standing in, as he pressed wet clay into a mould.

Nearby, workers stacked bricks into a kiln belching thick smoke. Later they will be sold for 1,500 Sudanese pounds ($32) per 1,000 bricks, Noreen said.

Professor Dagash said workers can be compensated and provided alternative livelihoods if brickworks close, adding that benefits from the dam outweighed such losses.

Vast areas of land would open up for agriculture as well as industrial projects, she said.

""The dam will provide Sudan with low cost electricity... and low cost electricity means more growth,"" she said.

1190,FL-2020-000038-EGY,"After seeing floods, Indonesian leader visits quake zone - Egypt Independent",https://egyptindependent.com/after-seeing-floods-indonesian-leader-visits-quake-zone/,"MAMUJU, Indonesia (AP) — Relief workers worked to clear up rubble of collapsed buildings Tuesday on an Indonesian island where a deadly earthquake left thousands of people homeless.

The 6.2 magnitude earthquake Friday that killed at least 84 people was one of multiple recent disasters in Indonesia.

President Joko Widodo, who visited a flood-hit area on Borneo island on Monday, visited the quake-hit areas of West Sulawesi province Tuesday to reassure people the government’s response is reaching those who are struggling.

He pledged to rebuild government buildings that collapsed and to help people rebuild their damaged houses with aid of up to 50 million rupiah ($3,560) as he toured the hard-hit city of Mamuju, a city of nearly 300,000 people and the provincial capital.

“We hope with the assistance by the central government can hasten recovery of collapsed houses and economy,” he said in a speech after visiting survivors being housed in shelters on a soccer field. “The government services should be returned to normal,” he said.

The National Search and Rescue Agency counted at least 30,000 survivors who have moved to shelters in Mamuju and its neighboring district of Majene in West Sulawesi, as the government and aid agencies pooled efforts to meet the survival needs of shaken communities.

Four days after the disaster, the streets of Mamuju were still covered in debris and most people have slept outdoors, fearful their homes would crumble if strong aftershocks come. Sniffer dogs were being used to search for bodies and possible survivors.

The president had traveled Monday to flood-affected areas in South Kalimantan province on Borneo, the island known for rainforests and orangutans where floods since last week have inundated several regions. The floods killed several villagers and forced tens thousands of people to flee their homes. Floods also reported in many other provinces in the vast archipelago nation.

Widodo said rainfall caused the floods in South Kalimantan, but environmentalists blame deforestation by mining, palm oil and agricultural industries.

The quake and flood disasters follow a deadly landslide in West Java on Jan. 9 that left 40 people buried in tons of mud. On the same day, a Sriwijaya Air jet nosedived into the Java Sea, killing all 62 people on board.

Indonesia also last week began vaccinating health workers with a COVID-19 vaccine in a campaign that aims to immunize two-thirds of the population in the world’s fourth most populous country. It has confirmed more than 917,000 infections and 26,000 deaths from the pandemic, the most in Southeast Asia.

And on Saturday, Mount Semeru, the highest volcano on Indonesia’s most densely populated island of Java, spewed hot clouds as far away as 4.5 kilometers (nearly three miles). The eruption caused panic but no casualties.

Indonesia, home to more than 260 million people, is lined with seismic faults and is frequently hit by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. Annual monsoon flooding also causes problems, and its transit infrastructure is often weak and stretched beyond its capacity.

Flooding in eastern Canada forced the evacuation of 1,200 people while more than 600 troops have been deployed in response, authorities said Sunday.

Warming weather over the Easter weekend has brought spring floods due to heavy rains and snowmelt from Ontario to southern Quebec and New Brunswick.

A man was killed Saturday in Pontiac, Quebec after he failed to see that a bridge had been swept away by the floods and drove his vehicle into the water.

Authorities, who initially feared a repeat of catastrophic 2017 floods in Quebec, the worst in half a century, appeared more confident about the situation on Sunday.

""We are optimistic about the coming days,"" civil security spokesperson Eric Houde told AFP.

""There will be significant floods but globally not at the level of 2017, except in certain areas like Lake St. Pierre,"" a widening of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, he said.

""The big difference from 2017 is the level of preparation of municipalities and citizens,"" he added.

Over the past several days, towns have mobilized volunteers and distributed tens of thousands of sandbags to erect barriers or protect houses in threatened areas.

The areas most affected Sunday were the region around Ottawa, and Beauce, a region south of Quebec City where nearly 800 people were evacuated. As of midday Sunday, about 1,000 homes had been affected by the flooding in Quebec.

Residents in Laval, just north of Montreal, erected barriers with sandbags to ward off flooding

The provincial governments of Quebec and New Brunswick asked for reinforcements from the military. About 200 soldiers had deployed in Quebec by Saturday night, and 400 others near Ottawa; in Laval, just north of Montreal; and in Trois-Rivieres between Montreal and Quebec City.

About 120 additional soldiers were available to be mobilized in New Brunswick.

The Gunners are putting their faith in young players as they look to return to the summit of English football under Unai Emery

""Identifying, recruiting and developing young players is a key part of our strategy.”

Those are the words of Raul Sanllehi, Arsenal’s head of football and the man leading an overhaul at the Emirates aimed at not just restoring the Gunners to the summit of English football, but also putting them back among Europe's elite.

Arsenal are a club known for giving youth a chance. George Graham two’s title-winning teams were built around players who had progressed through the under-age ranks.

The likes of Tony Adams, David Rocastle, Michael Thomas and Paul Merson helped end an 18-year wait for a league championship, in 1989, and then, two seasons later, they were joined by the likes of David Hillier and Kevin Campbell as the Gunners again finished top of the old First Division.

However, during Arsene Wenger's 21-year tenure, Arsenal didn't just rely on local talent. Teenagers were brought in from across the globe and given a platform to turn themselves into world stars.

Nicolas Anelka was the first in a succession of success stories, including Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Wojciech Szczesny.

Those players, along with a British contingent featuring Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott, were the bedrock of Arsenal's famous 'project youth', the period which followed the move from Highbury to the Emirates, which left Arsenal financially hamstrung by construction costs.

It was a period that promised plenty but ultimately failed to deliver any silverware. They went close more than once, but that only strengthened the belief among many critics that Arsenal were hindered by a lack of experience.

Between 2005 and 2014, Arsenal failed to win a trophy – a drought that came to an end in the first season after the purse strings were loosened, resulting in the arrival of Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid for £42.5 million ($51.7m).

Arsenal have won the FA Cup three times in the last six years, but now they want more. The Gunners have found themselves outside of the top four in the Premier League for each of the past three seasons – which is considered unacceptable by those now running the club.

Sanllehi, a man who is used to winning following his time with Barcelona, is determined to bring the good times back to Arsenal – and he feels young players will help do just that.

Whenever you speak with the Spaniard, it’s never too long before the conversation turns to Barca and the sustained success enjoyed by the Catalans over the past two decades.

Sanllehi believes the bedrock of that success was the club’s famous La Masia academy, which produced a plethora of players with ‘Barcelona DNA'.

Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique, Carles Puyol and Pedro all knew exactly what it meant to play for the Blaugrana, according to Sanllehi, and, consequently, would go that extra yard when needed because of their deep-rooted love for the club.

And that is precisely what he wants to replicate at Arsenal. Sanllehi makes no secret of the fact that he believes that a successful academy will be key if the Gunners are to get back on their perch at the top of the English game.

“We have some great talent coming through our younger age groups and, like all top clubs, the challenge is to help them make the most of their abilities,” he said.

""We need to make sure the academy pathway continues to drive great talent into the first team.”

Right now, the standard of players being produced is as high as it has been for years. Arsenal have pumped money into their academy, spending £40m ($48m) on improving facilities at Hale End and London Colney.

The redevelopment project lasted for nearly two years and Hale End is now unrecognisable, a sporting complex up there with the best on offer anywhere in England.

This project pre-dated Sanllehi’s arrival, with former chief executive Ivan Gazidis driving the plan forward before the new Hale End was completed in 2017.

“We wanted to take the level of the facility to something that was world class and world leading,” Gazidis said. “It’s something that will stand the club in good stead as we look forward.

“We’ve got an ambitious goal. To get to one young player joining our first-team every two years.

“Youth has always been one of the bedrocks of this club and with this investment we’re future proofed for at least the next 10 years.”

This summer, Arsenal promoted four players from the youth team to the senior set-up: Emile Smith Rowe, Joe Willock, Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson.

What's more, both Nelson and Willock started on Sunday, when Arsenal kicked off their new Premier League campaign with a 1-0 win at Newcastle.

With Ainsley Maitland-Niles also in the side, that meant that three of the starting XI at St James’ Park were academy graduates. Two of them, Nelson and Willock, were teenagers and you'd have to go back 21 years to find the last time two English teenagers started a league game for the Gunners.

That’s a hugely encouraging sign and it must be noted that Nketiah would have probably been involved too had Arsenal decided not to send their impressive young forward out on loan to Leeds United on deadline day.

Nketiah, who took just 43 minutes to score on his Leeds debut, will be back next summer. This isn’t a loan with a view to a potential sale.

Indeed, Arsenal are adamant that he will return and join Nelson, Willock and Maitland-Niles in the first-team; that’s why they were so thorough when it came to choosing a destination for Nketiah.

The north London giants have been hurt in the past by sending players out on loan to the wrong club. Serge Gnabry’s ill-fated move to West Brom is still viewed by senior figures at the Emirates as the reason they lost the German star.

Gnabry made just three appearances while at the Hawthorns during the 2015-16 season before returning to north London, with Pulis stating the teenager – who is now starring in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich – was not at the required level to play.

A disillusioned Gnabry then turned down a new contract at Arsenal in favour of a return to Germany and in the space of just three years has transformed into one of the brightest young stars in the game.

Arsenal are determined to prevent similar situation happening in the future and the way Nketiah’s exit was handled shows how much attention to detail now goes into deciding where their best young players will be sent.

Close to 20 clubs had shown an interest in loaning the striker and those were whittled down to just three: Leeds, Bristol City and Fortuna Dusseldorf.

Representatives of those three clubs were then invited down to London Colney and - as first revealed by the Athletic - asked to produce a presentation detailing exactly why Nketiah should join them and how they planned to use the forward.

Loan manager Ben Knapper, contract negotiator Huss Fahmy and Nketiah himself listened to the presentations and, ultimately, it was decided that a move to Elland Road would be best for the 19-year-old.

It was the first time that Arsenal used this process to select a club for a young player and is another sign of the importance the Gunners now place on the loan market in terms of developing talent.

But it’s not just academy players that are the heart of the work being done in a bid to bring the good times back to London’s most decorated club.

A look at the recruitment that has taken place since the end of the 2017-18 season shows that youth is now viewed as the way forward.

In the summer of 2018, Matteo Guendouzi arrived as a teenager from France and 22-year-old Lucas Torreira was signed from Sampdoria.

This year, Nicolas Pepe, 24, was signed for a club-record £72m ($87.5m) fee, while 22-year-old left-back Kieran Tierney was bought from Celtic and 18-year-old forward Gabriel Martinelli arrived from Brazil.

William Saliba, aged just 18, also joined from Saint Etienne for £27m ($32.8m), but he will spend this season back on loan with the Ligue 1 outfit before linking up with Unai Emery’s squad on a permanent basis next summer.

With Tierney, Saliba, Rob Holding and Hector Bellerin, Arsenal have a potential back four that could remain in place for years.

However, Arsenal are aware that youngsters need to time to settle, which is why the likes of David Luiz and Sokratis – both now in their 30s – have also been brought in to share the workload and provide much needed experience, both on the pitch and in the changing room.

The clever recruitment in recent seasons, combined with the investment in the academy, has seen Arsenal amass an army of hugely talented young players that is generating plenty of excitement behind the scenes at the Emirates.

Nelson, Willock, Guendouzi and Maitland-Niles are leading the way, but scratch beneath the surface a little and you have teenagers such as Bukayo Saka, Tyreece John-Jules and Folarin Balogun, who are all expected to become first-team players in the coming years.

Of course, while the conveyor belt of talent at Hale End is producing some of the best youngsters in England, the challenge now is ensuring they all get the opportunity to fulfil their potential at Arsenal.

With that in mind a ‘transition team’ was set-up in the summer, which saw Freddie Ljungberg – last season’s Under-23s boss – promoted to the senior coaching set-up.

“The transition from Under-23 to first team is massive,” said Sanllehi. “It’s a specifically English issue as we don’t have B teams playing at a high level, which our European competitors have.

“So, we need to make careful choices around who stays with the Under-23s, who trains with the first team and who goes on loan.

“The transition team will be responsible for managing development plans for each and every player to best optimise their potential.”

Ljungberg’s arrival has already seen the likes of Robbie Burton given a chance during the summer, with the 19-year-old midfielder making a big impression during the tour to the United States.

“Freddie is helping us with the young players because he knows better than us every young player,” admitted Emery.

“For example, I didn’t know Robbie. Freddie said to me he’s a good player with the capacity to play as a six or an eight. Really, he helped us like we needed.”

Whether Burton goes on to make his mark with the first-team remains to be seen, but his performances in the States were another sign that the work being done to get the best out of Arsenal’s young talent is already bearing fruit.

The original ‘project youth’ may have ultimately flattered to deceive in north London, but there are signs that the updated version could go on to bring success that Sanllehi, Emery and the fanbase crave.",2019-08-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['pepe', 'tierney', 'nelson', 'arsenal', 'inside', 'arsenals', 'academy', 'creation', 'willock', 'team', 'gunners', 'young', 'best', 'end', 'players', 'youth']",Ghana,news article,English

“Not only has the Iranian government been negligent, it has also warned victims’ families and those who have suffered losses that they will be prosecuted if they paint a dark picture of this [natural disaster and state relief efforts],” prominent human rights lawyer Abdolkarim Lahiji told the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI).

“The government wants to shift the blame to the people and unleash the police against them,” he added. “We are dealing with a regime that considers it a crime to inform the public about natural disasters and criticize.”

The starkest warning was issued by the state’s cyber police force, referred to by the acronym of FATA, on March 27, 2019.

“All police units in the provinces have been instructed to monitor social media and take swift action against those who publish images and spread rumors that disturb public opinion and disrupt the peace in society,” said Ramin Pashaie, FATA’s deputy chief, on March 27.

Pashaie also accused those who have shared photos and video footage of the damage, particularly from the hardest-hit city of Shiraz, Fars Province, of doing so for personal gain.

“We ask our dear citizens to not pay attention to news from unknown sources on social media because many of these individuals want to take advantage of the recent floods in order to increase their audience and followers,” he said.

According to the state-funded Emergency Services Organization, 44 people had died as a result of flash flooding in Fars, Mazandaran and Golestan provinces as of March 25, including 21 people in Fars.

Iran’s Ministry of Agriculture and Jihad, which manages and oversees the country’s agricultural industry, also announced on March 28 that the sector had so far suffered 2.4 trillion tomans ($573.7 million USD) in damages.

Article 18 of the Computer Crimes Law allows people to be prosecuted for publicly posting material online deemed objectionable by the state under the charge of “dissemination of lies” (with the intention of disturbing the public state of mind).

But not all Iranian authorities have supported the warning.

Lotfollah Dejkam, the Friday prayer leader of Shiraz (he is also Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s representative in Fars Province), said people have a right to be angry at officials for having made poor city planning decisions that have worsened the impact of the floods.

“We cannot just be sit by and watch what’s going on,” he said in a meeting with provincial officials on March 27. “The people have a right to curse and hurl every bad word at us.”

“The floods overflowed because the municipality built buildings over the ravines,” he added “Why did they block the flood’s path near the Quran Gate? Where was the flood water supposed to go?”",2019-03-29 19:51:47+00:00,"['public', 'flooding', 'warned', 'provinces', 'prosecuted', 'floods', 'prosecution', 'iranian', 'iranians', 'online', 'threatened', 'fars', 'social', 'state', 'disastrous', 'suffered', 'postings']",Iran,news article,English

At least two people were killed and more than a dozen were injured as torrential rains damaged houses in Panjgur district of Balochistan.

The torrential rains and hailstones started Friday afternoon caused flood and mud, debris and rainwater entered into houses in Tusp Khuda-Badan, Girmakan, Wasbod Kilag, Irap, Damb and other areas of the district.

We did not break fast till late evening as water entered our house and we were trying to keep our stuff safe, said Anwar Azad, a resident of Dumb. He added flood not only destroyed our valuable stuff and furniture but also damaged walls of our house.

According to locals of the area, walls of more than a hundred houses in Dumb, Irap, Qadirsbad, Saravan and adjacent areas were collapsed and dozens of livestock and two vehicles were washed away in the flash floods, while the situation compelled people to spend whole night in open sky.

Panjgur Deputy Commissioner Abdul Razzaq Sasoli, SP Captain (retd) Zuhaib Mushin, Commandant Frontier Corps (FC) Panjgur Rifles and other officials visited the flood-affected areas, examined the damages caused by flash floods and assured public of financial and manpower support.

Sasoli assured people that Levies, police and FC men were on the ground helping affected people and taking part in rescue operation, adding the government would compensate flood-affected people.

Following the situation emerged after heavy rain and flood, Panjgur Rifles FC set up an emergency cell in the town through which affectees would be assisted.

All flood-affectees are directed to submit their claims and other details with Emergency Cell or contact officials at the helpline, 0855641240, said Panjgur FC in a statement issued on Saturday.

A roar, a haze, a split second of stunned silence. And then, chaos.It was an exceptionally bright Sunday morning when Mahatami Devi, 42, stepped out of her house in Uttarakhand’s Jugju village to fetch firewood and cattle fodder from the neighbouring Raini village. One of her three sons, 17-year-old Ankit, was home at the time. “I met her around 8am. I was going uphill with three men to carve a pagdandi (pathway) in Raini. She was headed downhill. She said a quick hello and moved ahead,” Sangram Singh Rawat, former gram panchayat member of Raini village, told TOI.“An hour later, there was a loud, thundering sound. When we looked up, the clear blue sky had turned grey. And then, we heard Ankit screaming, ‘Save my mother.’ A wall of water came surging through the hills, sweeping with it everything that came in its way — people, cattle, trees. We could do nothing.”Metres away, Anita Devi, 70, from Raini Chuksa village was grazing cattle when the debris-laden Dhauliganga raged through Raini. “She was with her grandson Golu and daughter-in-law Tanuja. The two of them ran for their lives when they heard the sound. Anita Devi was left behind. We saw the river swallow her as she stood there, helpless,” said Kundan Singh, 42, from Raini.While those in the higher reaches saw their loved ones swept away, those downhill darted in panic. “Bhaago (run),” people were screaming. But they could not keep going. “The air was thick, pungent. They could not breathe, could not run faster. They just buckled down and waited,” Sangram said.After about half an hour, the village elders in Raini said they should go looking for those who were missing. “What we saw was horrifying. Where we had seen people working hours ago — cutting wood, grazing cattle — there was a swamp of debris. Not one of our people could be spotted,”Sangram said. Kundan’s nephew is among them. “He had taken around 150 goats for grazing. He has gone missing,” Kundan said. With villages in the area cut off because bridges have been swept away, many labourers and their families are stranded. Kundan is hosting about 20 of them at his house.Kundan and Sangram have been protesting against hydropower projects in the geologically fragile region for years. Their petition had taken the state and Centre to court for the Rishiganga project . Kundan said, “What happened today was nature’s way of telling us things are horribly wrong.”",2021-02-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['glacier', 'helplessly', 'away', 'flood', 'joshimath', 'ones', 'chamoli', 'ganga', 'village', 'washed', 'river', 'district', 'watched', 'burst', 'raini', 'uttarakhand', 'loved']",India,news article,English
1782,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,"We need cash to adapt, Kenyan slum dwellers tell COP26 president - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-kenya-trfn-idUSKBN2BI2QU,"(Refile to clarify job position in para 3)

NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -Rich countries must provide more finance to help the poor cope with the impact of global warming, residents of Kenyaâ??s biggest informal settlement told the president of the COP26 global climate talks as he visited on Friday.

Alok Sharma, president of the United Nations conference, was visiting a community-led project in Nairobiâ??s flood-prone Kibera settlement that provides easy-to-understand weather forecasts via SMS, WhatsApp and radio.

â??The climate has changed a lot. We experience heavy rains more and this brings flooding which damages houses, brings diseases to our children and causes deaths,â? said Faith Ondiek, a weather forecast provider or â??Weather Mtaaniâ?? leader with the DARAJA project.

â??The message we want the president to take back to global leaders is that we are doing what we can to deal with climate change, but we need help. The rich nations must contribute some funds so we can improve our lives in the face of this threat.â?

Sharma said Britain would place adaptation and resilience â??front and centreâ? during its presidency of COP as he praised the forecasting project.

â??Globally as extreme weather events become more frequent and more severe we need to build resilience among the most vulnerable communities,â? Sharma said in a statement.

Governments will submit updated national action plans to reduce planet-warming emissions and adapt to a hotter climate ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November.

Sharmaâ??s visit aimed to show that COP26 was not just focused on the West bringing down their carbon emissions, but also on garnering the finance so that countries like Kenya could adapt, said a British official.

Ministers from a number of countries will meet virtually next Wednesday ahead of the summit to identify practical next steps for climate vulnerable communities.

BUILDING RESILIENCE

Developed countries agreed at the United Nations in 2009 to jointly contribute $100 billion each year from 2020 in climate finance to poorer countries, many of which are grappling with rising seas, storms and droughts made worse by climate change.

But only a fifth of global contributions have so far gone towards adaptation, with most support focused on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries.

Adaptation action includes everything from expanding green space in cities to prevent floods and moving coastal communities to safer places to capturing rainwater, providing storm warnings and giving farmers weather and crop advice via mobile phones.

In Kibera, a sprawling informal settlement housing more than 200,000 people living cheek-by-jowl in makeshift homes, the change in weather patterns - in particular increased rainfall over a shorter period of time - has had a devastating impact.

Due to poor drainage and garbage collection, floods are a common occurrence - not only destroying homes and possessions, but also contaminating drinking water and even causing deaths through building collapses, electrocutions and drownings.

DARAJA provides localised weekly forecasts from the Kenya Meteorological Department, which are translated into Kiswahili and local slang Sheng and sent out daily via SMS, WhatsApp and radio.

The forecasts provide actionable information, telling residents to avoid a particular route as it may be flooded, or advising parents not let children play near the river as heavy rains are expected.

The Mtaani leaders also organise clean-ups of the river and drainage areas, ensure electrical cables are out of harmâ??s way, and advise residents to add waterproofing materials to their homes when heavy rains are forecast.

â??The DARAJA project has been an effective way to get the information out,â? said Pascaline Chemaiyo, principal meteorologist at the Kenya Meteorological Department.

â??The project has formally finished, but the team members are still continuing the work as the community have found it very helpful and it has helped to make them more climate resilient.â?",2021-03-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['residents', 'cash', 'slum', 'weather', 'adapt', 'nations', 'countries', 'tell', 'project', 'global', 'need', 'president', 'climate', 'kenyan', 'dwellers', 'settlement', 'rains', 'cop26']",Kenya,news article,English
1160,FL-2019-000179-CAN,How we can better mitigate flood risk in Canada - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/how-we-can-better-mitigate-flood-risk-in-canada/article37609942/,"Glen Hodgson is a senior fellow at the Conference Board of Canada.

The scenes last year of widespread flooding in Quebec, the Ottawa region and then the ""500-year flood"" in Houston were stark reminders of the risks – and massive human and physical costs – of these natural disasters.

Up to 10 per cent of Canadians live in high-risk flood zones. They live in floodplains, urban areas with inadequate storm-water drainage or in low-lying coastal areas subject to saltwater inundation.

Story continues below advertisement

Mapping of flood risk in Canada is inconsistent and may not be widely available. Many property owners have chosen to live or work in these areas based on inadequate and incomplete historical information. While mapping is improving today with more sophisticated technology, risk mapping and flood-risk information are not managed or distributed under an integrated system.

How is flood-risk managed? Today, it is a combination of public-, private- and personal-risk management. This is still a nascent market for insurers, who have begun to offer flood coverage in Canada over the past two years. Properties in high-risk flood zones are very difficult to insure because of the exceptional risk and, if coverage is available at all, the premiums are usually very expensive as a result.

The perceived availability of disaster relief – de facto free insurance coverage – may deter at-risk property owners from seeking flood insurance in advance. And flood risk is poorly understood by the general public – in a recent survey by the University of Waterloo, only 6 per cent of Canadians surveyed were aware they live in a designated flood-risk area.

Moreover, extreme weather related to climate change appears to be increasing the frequency and severity of flooding events. This trend has enlarged existing flood zones and even created new flood-prone areas previously thought to be risk-free. It is hard to ignore the growing relationship between climate change and the resulting impact of severe flooding events.

There is no easy fix for destruction and damage from flooding. The responsibility and incentives for managing property development and for reducing flood risks are not well aligned. There are differences in property-development management practices between, and even within, provinces. Local governments approve property development, and receive development fees and property taxes. But they do not always assume responsibility for land-use planning nor do they bear the full costs of flood relief.

All orders of government incur costs during immediate disaster response. Canadian government spending on floods and recovery have increased dramatically since 2000, reaching a high of $2-billion in 2013-14. Flood-recovery costs have been projected by the Parliamentary Budget Office to remain high for the federal government, at $700-million annually.

In short, Canada's system for managing flood risk is a patchwork, a legacy built up over time. So where to start improving the flood-risk management system? A number of critical elements ought to be addressed:

Story continues below advertisement

Risk identification and awareness

There is a vital need to raise the ""flood-risk IQ"" of Canadians through education and regular communication on flood risk. A collaborative framework might include a formal program of public education on the risk and costs of flooding, and how it could be better managed.

Risk reduction and mitigation

Policy measures that could be designed and implemented in advance include:

Comprehensive mapping and information-sharing;

Improved land-use planning and building codes;

Investment in flood-prevention infrastructure;

Mitigation by communities and property owners.

It should be emphasized that risk-reduction measures are a necessary, but not sufficient, precondition for improved flood management. Even if all the elements of risk reduction identified here are acted upon, some existing properties in flood zones will remain at risk.

Financial-risk management

Story continues below advertisement

Although the insurance industry is increasing its capacity to provide flood coverage, coverage is uneven and properties in high-risk flood zones are difficult and expensive to insure. A public-private risk-sharing partnership (as has been developed in other countries) that draws on the strengths of all parties will likely be required to improve overall Canadian flood-risk management, while also improving incentives for property owners to mitigate their own specific flood risks. A U.S.-style system, in which the government provides the high-risk flood coverage, but under-funds evenutal liabilities, should be avoided, however.

Disaster management and recovery

It is reasonable to expect Canadian governments to aspire to best-in-class practice for managing disasters, as is the case in many areas of public policy. The ideal goal could be to build a co-ordinated and integrated pan-Canadian response and recovery plan for floods and other potential disasters.

A national conversation on improved flood management has begun among Canadian governments, the insurance industry, academics and think tanks and other stakeholders. This conversation is an important starting point, but much more analysis, discussion, concrete decisions and action will be required if Canada is to reduce the risks and improve the management of flooding.",2018-01-15 08:00:00+00:00,"['coverage', 'zones', 'better', 'risk', 'costs', 'areas', 'floodrisk', 'canada', 'mitigate', 'management', 'flood', 'property', 'flooding']",Canada,news article,English
1436,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Remembering The Day One Of The Blue Angels Crashed in Cedar Rapids [WATCH] - khak.com,https://khak.com/the-blue-angels-near-disaster-in-cedar-rapids-watch/,"An exciting day that turned frightening for tens of thousands of eastern Iowans has been brought back into focus by a new video from a pilot that was there.

It was August 30, 1970. The Blue Angels were performing at the 4th Annual Cedar Rapids Jaycees Air Show at the Cedar Rapids Airport, now the Eastern Iowa Airport.

There were four Blue Angels jets in the air that day, with 35,000 people in attendance, according to the Iowa City Press-Citizen. One of those pilots was 27-year-old Ernie Christensen.

The Des Moines Register reported the Blue Angels performed for only about 40 minutes due to visibility problems. Christensen said a crosswind made it even worse. As the Blue Angels began to land, Christensen heard their challenges on his radio.

When it was Christensen's turn to come down, he made a huge mistake. In his concern for the other Angels, Christensen had forgotten to put down his landing gear.

When Christensen hit the runaway, he immediately knew something was terribly wrong. In a new video he says he thought, ""'Oh my god. What happened?""... He goes on to describe the scene: ""I'm on fire. The whole bottom half of the aircraft is on fire and I'm in full burner and I am screaming down the runway... I'm looking ahead of me. On this side, I got crowd. On this side, I've got bleachers and crowd... By that time, (I) went off the runway on fire and probably still doing 80 knots (92 miles-per-hour)... and I ejected."" What's important to note is that, even though his plane was on fire, Christensen didn't eject until he knew those in the crowd, and his fellow Blue Angels pilots, were out of harm's way.

After ejecting, Christensen would come down, parachute and all, on his back on the airport runaway. His #4 Blue Angels U.S. Navy Phantom jet finally stopped in a cornfield, where it was extinguished by firefighters.

279,FL-2021-000025-AUS,"As claims rise, Australian insurers says early to estimate costs of Sydney flood - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-weather-suncorp-idUSKBN2BE0BY,"(Reuters) - Two of Australia’s three top insurers on Monday disclosed the number of claims received so far from the worst flooding that Sydney has faced in 60 years and said it was too early to estimate the costs.

Heavy rains along Australia’s east coast over several days have resulted in thousands of people being forced to evacuate their homes.

Suncorp Group has received 1,300 claims and expects the number to rise in the coming days. For fiscal 2021, it has set aside A$950 million ($734.07 million) as its natural hazard allowance.

Insurance Australia Group said it had received more than 2,100 claims by the end of Sunday, covering mainly property damage.

The full extent of the damage caused by the floods is yet to be determined with the rain forecast to continue for several days, S&P Global Ratings analysts said.

“While the ultimate losses for individual insurers will vary... we expect these to be manageable”, they added.

Shares of Suncorp and IAG ended about 2% lower at the end of trade on Monday. QBE Insurance Group, the largest by market cap, fell nearly 3%.

35,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Cowboys tired of 8-and-8 - KLTV,https://www.kltv.com/story/26227572/cowboys-tired-of-8-and-8,"OXNARD, CA (KLTV) - After three consecutive 8 and 8 seasons, Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo jokes there's no desperation in Dallas.

""Yeah, we're desperate,"" said Romo with a smile. ""No, that's a joke. I think you don't have that feeling of desperation ever, I think the feeling that comes across is more you're upset. Not happy with the outcome.""

There may not be desperation, but there is pressure. The Cowboys have failed to make the playoffs for 4 consecutive seasons. The longest playoff drought of the Jerry Jones era, dating back to 1989.

""It doesn't sit well with anybody,"" said Romo. ""Everyone was disappointed. We had a chance last year but we didn't get the job done.""

Dez Bryant wears No. 88, but he's tired of 8 and 8. Bryant has never experience the playoffs.

""That bothers me a lot,"" said Bryant. ""I think the work we put in this off season will give us the results to see if we can be there at the end of the year.""

Hoping to get over the hump, the Cowboys have made major changes to their roster. Letting go of veteran leaders, the Cowboys have gone younger in 2014. Jerry Jones says it's not a rebuilding project.

""It is not about next year,"" said Jones. ""We've gone from possibly being one of the older teams to one of the younger teams. But I think we have the fundamentals to be able to compete and compete right now.""

""We're trying to redeem ourselves from last year and not be that same 8 and 8 team,"" said cornerback Morris Claiborne. ""That's fire under each player, coach out here to go out and get the job done.""

592,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Michael Jordan's Failed Motorsports Team: The Full Story - Highsnobiety,https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/michael-jordan-motorsports-racing-team/,"Michael Jordan's competitive nature is the stuff of legend — responsible not only for unprecedented success in the NBA, but also a post-basketball life that has made him one of the ""most powerful NBA owners"" and the figurehead behind the popular Jumpman imprint which continues to carry Nike to new heights.

While to err is simply human, Michael Jordan has used that tireless desire for winning to avoid any major missteps aside from that fateful year of minor league baseball after he became disenfranchised with basketball following the death of his father.

But even the biggest MJ ""Stans"" might be surprised to learn that Jordan's foray into baseball isn't his only misstep in the athletic realm. There was a time right after his last retirement when he bet on himself as the owner of a superbike motorcycle team, aptly titled ""Michael Jordan Motorsports.""

Combining elements relating to high-octane performance and merchandise, Michael Jordan Motorsports could and probably should have been an added dimension to his portfolio of assets. But the venture never took hold; immortalized by a friends and family Jordan IV ""Motorsport"" silhouette which was given out to team members in 2006 and recently retroed — a not-so-subtle reminder of His Airness's need for speed.

Michael Jordan Motorsports wasn't as unlikely a venture as it may seem given the automobile ties to some of the Jordan Brand's most popular silhouettes over the years — highlighted by the Air Jordan VI being based of the Porsche 911, Air Jordan XIV based off the Ferrari F335 and 550M, Air Jordan XVII based off the Aston Martin, Air Jordan XXI based off the Bentley Continental GT Coupe, and elements of the Air Jordan 31 based on Ferrari seats.

When the Chicago Bulls drafted Jordan with the third pick in the NBA draft, one of the major stipulations was that he could no longer ride a motorcycle for fear that even the most minor an accident could jeopardize a team's fortune - highlighted by that very thing which occurred to the Bulls 20 years later when their top pick, Jay Williams, crashed his motorcycle and nearly died.

""I started riding dirt bikes when I was 7 or 8 years old,"" Jordan recalled. ""Way back when. I kind of got into it, and obviously I couldn't ride because of my contract stuff. But as soon as that was over with, I got back into it.""

""It's skillful. I grew up in NASCAR, so I've been a big race fan,"" Jordan added. ""But the thing about motorcycles is the instinct, the reactions — you see the riders working the bike. It takes a lot of skill to be in position on the bike, to be able to downshift and upshift and all that stuff, which is a little bit different than NASCAR. NASCAR is always left-hand turns, and circles the whole time. There's an art to what they do, I'm not diminishing that. I just felt from coming from a sport where it's a reaction sport, to see how they react much quicker — their decision-making has to be really quick. I was intrigued by that.""

According to Kenneth Abbott, Jordan's media manager, Jordan decided to explore his motorsport options after a chance encounter with James Casmay — a Chicago-based motorcycle enthusiast — who often zipped around the city and enjoyed talking intricacies of motors and tires with fellow riders.

""One of the guys went up and started talking to Mike and said, ‘If you want to go riding, here’s my card, give us a call,'"" Casmay recalled of his first interaction with Jordan at a Chicago gas station.

""We started having a good time riding late at night, probably ride at 1 o'clock, 1:30, up and down the freeway,"" remembered Jordan. ""Once I started coming out, everybody seemed to migrate to where I was riding. Instead of riding with eight or nine guys, we started riding with 30 or 40 guys, which is just an accident waiting to happen. So we started trying to secretly get out. But obviously once they saw I was out, everybody started looking for me.""

Despite Jordan's seemingly endless amount of wealth and access to some of the brightest apparel minds in the business, Casmay and other riders were struck by just how ill-equipped Jordan seemed to be for riding a high-performance motorcycle on the Chicago streets.

""I'm looking and I'm like, 'something's not right with this picture,'"" recalled another rider, Noble Williams, a Chicago police officer who noted that Jordan's attire was more akin to how a person would warm up for a basketball game than go for a motorcycle ride. ""The whole thing was just wrong. He came up with a Jordan shirt, jogging pants and Air Jordan shoes.""

""The gloves he had on were the weightlifting gloves that had the fingers cut off the front,"" recalled another rider, Montez Stewart, who would prove to be instrumental in Jordan's first major venture after he had retired from the NBA. ""It was funny. When I saw that, I was cracking up.""

Much like a rookie accepting ribbing from veteran players, Jordan was appreciative of the riders' concern.

""If it wasn't for those guys, I could have gotten myself injured, and would have never been in this sport,"" recalled Jordan.

Jordan eventually made good and phoned Casmay to discuss if there were any opportunities to take a local rider and give him a push toward a professional career. Casmay insisted that Montez Stewart was that guy.

“We had no intentions of starting a race team,” said Casmay, who was running a small investment company at the time. “But after introducing Montez to Mike, we said, 'you know, this is fun on the streets, but it’s more fun on the track.'”

After a day at the track where Jordan assessed Stewart's racing acumen, he knew he was the perfect rider to serve as the inaugural pilot for the yet-to-be-minted motorsports team.

Ken Abbot, CCS-Formula USA Road Race Competition Director, said of Stewart's abilities at the time that he was “probably the dominant rider in the Midwestern Region of the CCS by the end of the 2003 season.”

""He asked me as friends, 'Montez what can I do to help you fulfill your dream as a road racer?"" Stewart recalled. 'If you're serious, we can pursue this together.'""

Although it took Jordan 20 years to rekindle his passion for motorcycles, he established Michael Jordan Motorsports in 2004 with the help of Pete Mauhar — a seasoned team manager in the pro circuit with a decade worth of Superbike experience — to help him navigate a sport dominated by factory teams from Suzuki, Honda, Kawasaki, Ducati and Yamaha since the sport was officially recognized on a global scale in 1988.

“I got a call from James Casmay, someone I didn’t know, who was asking about whether we’d want to help Michael Jordan go into racing. Which was a pretty bizarre call, really,” Mauhar said. “Honestly, I thought it was some of my friends messing around with me.”

While it takes a motorsports team a year or longer to secure sponsorship, get equipment, find riders and mechanics, and get approval from the sanctioning body for SBK, Jordan Motorsports managed the monstrous task in only five weeks time — surely aided by Jordan's name recognition that had people on the periphery of the sport buzzing.

According to Forbes, ""Almost overnight, Yamaha had provided new bikes fresh off the boat from Japan at a discounted price. Then those bikes were sent to Gemini Technology Systems, a Wisconsin company that makes motorcycles race-ready and provides crew and race team management. Gemini even applied the Carolina Blue color scheme to honor Jordan’s old college team.""

With sponsors like Jordan Brand, Gatorade, Hanes, Upper Deck, and the National Guard painted on the side of his YZF-R1 AMA Superbike, Montez Stewart was on the starting grid at Daytona for the first American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) road racing event of the 2004 season.

“I’ve done a lot of club racing, and I always wanted to be a pro racer and come race with the AMA and run with the big boys,” Stewart said at the time. “So I’m really glad to be here.”

As The Los Angeles Times noted in its coverage, ""Michael Jordan attracted most of the attention before the main event as the retired NBA legend was on hand to encourage his young protege, Montez Stewart of Matteson, Ill. It didn't help much, however, as the rookie rider — who looks more like an NBA prospect at 6' 3"" than a motorcycle racer — qualified 33rd in superstock and 39th in supersport.""

Stewart turned lap times good enough to make the grid in both classes. In Superstock, Stewart qualified in the ninth row, turning laps at 1:58.620. In Supersport qualifying, he made the grid in 43rd position, turning a fast lap of 2:01.075.

Stewart ultimately finished 26th at Daytona and 23rd overall in the standings out of 40 riders for the entire season.

For some, this may have been a small victory. But for Michael Jordan, how would he interpret a middle-of-the-pack finish?

""Knowing me, I wanted to win the first year,"" Jordan told E60. ""But I knew — mechanically — I didn't have the right equipment to win. But that doesn't mean that I don't hope for some type of win,"" while adding, ""I like being the underdog. When you least expect it, you go out and find ways to beat the favorites. It's tough, because the factory teams are well-equipped. But what's starting to happen is they're seeing no matter what, my interest and my passion is strong enough that, sooner or later, I'm going to find the right things that make it work, and get us up in front and get us winning.""

Whereas branding and motorsports often meld machine and merchandise, Jordan's involvement also allowed his team to bring footwear into the mix thanks to the help of Nike designer Mark Smith, who helped design the look of the bikes so that they could be paired both with the latest Jordan game shoe and retros.

“We weren’t doing it to create any heat in the market with sneakerheads,” Smith said. “What I was doing was making something specific for the race team. And it’s appropriate, it matches up with the bike and it matches up in the paddock. I look at things as a photograph. There was nothing better than a pair of sneakers on a motorcycle. That was enough of a reason to do it.”

A prime example of this fusion came in 2009 when Smith designed the 6 Rings sneaker, which matched nicely with a bike heavily draped in a classic elephant print.

Despite the ""look good, perform good"" mantra, Jordan Motorsports failed to win a single race after 93 appearances at various events between their inaugural season and 2010.

If Michael Jordan's various championship-winning Bulls are viewed as the benchmark for NBA success, then Suzuki's Yoshimura factory team during this period could best be described as a dynasty — winning 10 consecutive championships and 53 straight races — and owning the new millennium between 2000-2010.

""I felt like it was an unfair playing ground,"" Jordan said. ""When manufacturers were winning every single race. We didn't have the parts. Obviously we didn't have the technology. We had no chance at winning.""

2009 ultimately marked a radical shift in the rules of superbike racing — creating uniformity amongst suspension, tires and engines that teams were able to use.

""I am a competitor to the end, and I will fight until I get to the front,"" Jordan said a year later, adding ""may the best rider win.""

Jordan's team went from a single top-three finish in 2008 to ninth the following year. However, he still hadn't managed to crack the winner's circle despite the hit that Suzuki had taken following the rule changes.

The Jordan Motorsports drought ended in 2010 when Jake Zemke took the basketball legend’s race team to Victory Lane at Daytona International Speedway while Jordan watched from the press box. It was clear that Jordan wanted to go down and celebrate, but instead he opted to let his rider and crew relish in the achievement.

In subsequent seasons, Jordan Motorsports added Ben Bostrom and his Suzuki GSX-R1000 bike to the team — draping the machine in a Chicago Bulls colorway and signature ’23’ logo on the front and rear end.

Bostrom would finish in second place during a rain-soaked race at Barber Motorsports Park in 2011.

“A huge thanks to the Jordan Motorsports boys,” commented Bostrom. “The results were not what I hoped, but the bike has really come together and now the rider has to step it up. We’ve struggled for a few events for sure and it’s nice to have fun riding again. We’ve got a few weeks off to ready ourselves for Mid-Ohio, where I’m sure the Jordan bike should be at the front. The bike is ready, the rider needs a little work and we will have a winner. I like Mid-Ohio and so do the Suzukis, so let’s see if we can sweep another podium in three weeks.”

In 2013, Michael Jordan Motorsports announced that it was suspending operations of its AMA Pro Superbike team and would instead focus on transitioning to international competition as early as 2014.

“We’ve decided to not move forward with our AMA Superbike program,” Michael Jordan Motorsports Corporate Relations Director Kreig Robinson said. ""We have no bad feelings toward AMA Pro Racing. This is where we are, where we’re from. We like the property. We don’t have any bad feelings toward anyone in particular, but the property as it stands right now doesn’t allow us to go out and get the sponsorship that we need.""

Even with Michael Jordan's involvement and a financial commitment of $1 million annually (of a $5 million operating cost), the loss of key sponsors like the National Guard ultimately proved to be the final nail in the coffin.

1406,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Landslides Mar the “Pearl of Africa” - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/landslides-mar-the-pearl-of-africa,"Behind Uganda’s lavish beauty, climate change has taken its toll: Death, destroyed properties, and displaced communities increase as above-normal rainfall floods the country.

Uganda is known as the “Pearl of Africa” because of its stunning natural beauty and biodiversity. Its lush vegetation is associated with regular tropical rainfall, but the East African nation is now struggling to deal with more frequent and intense rains that are causing landslides.

Landslides can dump millions of tons of muddy debris in Uganda’s rivers and streams, said Mary Goretti Kitutu, Uganda’s minister of energy and mineral development and an expert on geology and landslides. Such debris can dam rivers, flood surrounding areas, and cause damage to infrastructure.

“The main landslide types [in Uganda] are debris slumps, which occur on concave slopes where water concentrates. Slopes facing northeast are most prone to landslides, which coincide with the dominant rainfall direction,” Kitutu said.

The region’s soil profile is significant, she continued, explaining that “topsoils have a high infiltration rate, which allows fast flow of water into the deeper, clay-rich horizons—promoting water stagnation and causing slope failure.”

Landslide Losses

Although Uganda has always experienced some loss of life due to landslides, the number of casualties has increased this century.

Over the past 25 years, catastrophic landslides have regularly hit the foothills of Mount Elgon, for instance, which straddles the border between eastern Uganda and Kenya. The region’s most devastating landslide swept the slopes in 2010. Although more than 300 people are thought to have perished, only about 100 bodies were recovered. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed.

In 2012, a landslide followed 2 days of heavy rains in the same area. At least 18 people were killed, and 15 houses were destroyed. In December 2019, five people died in mudslides following heavy rainfall, 150 houses were destroyed, and the crops of smallholder farmers were swept away.

The most obvious trigger for Uganda’s slump landslides is rainfall. Rainfall events of low intensity but long duration are thought to be the most disastrous, a pattern that is well known among Ugandan farmers.

Callist Tindimugaya, commissioner for water resources planning and regulation in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, attributed the increase in rainfall to changing climate patterns and rapid loss of forest cover due to trees being cut down to be used as fuel. Tindimugaya said climate change is likely to increase average temperatures in Uganda by up to 1.5°C in the next 20 years and by up to 4.3°C by the 2080s.

“Changes in rainfall patterns and total annual rainfall amounts are also expected,” he added, “but these are less certain than changes in temperature.”

“Rain Has Become My Enemy”

“Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks.” “Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks,” said Gerald Masaba, a coffee farmer in the Bududa District in eastern Uganda.

Masaba said many forests in the area have been turned into farms. The thin topsoil of converted forest often fails to retain water during heavy downpours, increasing the farm’s vulnerability to flood. In addition, terraced agriculture is not popular among farmers “because they believe terraces promote water infiltration, which triggers landslides,” Kitutu added.

Clovis Kabaseke, however, said farmers can be trained on how to successfully engage in terraced agriculture. Kabaseke is a lecturer and researcher in the School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences at Mountains of the Moon University in Uganda.

Kabaseke said the agricultural method can be effective in maximizing arable land area in variable terrains and reducing soil erosion and water loss, but farmers need to be taught the most effective practices.

Displaced Communities

Alfred Okidi, the permanent secretary in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, said that in 2020, more than 850 people were permanently displaced by mudslides.

With assistance from partners such as the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Ugandan government was able to safely relocate these displaced people. Okidi said IOM and CERF provided $818,000 in emergency relief.

Musa Ecweru, the state minister for relief and disaster preparedness in the Ugandan cabinet, was hopeful that the relocation would ultimately help build communities and economies. “The landslide victims were settled in Kiryandongo District,” he said, “where each household was given land to farm so that they can move on with their new lives.”

Rosemary Nandudu, however, says the transition will not be easy. Nandudu was relocated from the wet, fertile ecosystem of eastern Uganda to the drier one of the western Kiryandongo District and said the land provided by the government is not fertile. “It has been hard for us to adjust to a dry land, when most crops we used to know and grow cannot grow there,” she said.

Margaret Kemigisa, who grows tea in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda, said farmers who formerly grew crops such as beans, millet, and bananas have switched to tea. Tea requires heavy seasonal rainfall and is grown at altitudes that are less vulnerable to debris slumps.

“Farmers from Bushenyi, Kanungu, Mityana, Mbale, and Mukono—which are hilly—have been trained to grow tea, which can also be grown in greenhouses provided the soils are acidic,” Kemigisa said.

According to Nandudu, relocated communities also face lifestyle changes. They are unable to keep cattle in the new area and have to buy food, which was not the case in their former self-sufficient community.

Joseph Mafabi, who was relocated to Kiryandongo, had to find a new job in a refugee settlement to make ends meet. “I would have wanted to go back to the Elgon region, but the government is telling us that it is not safe to go back,” he said.

What Is Being Done

Community groups, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations are working to reduce the frequency of landslides in Uganda, mostly by planting trees in vulnerable areas. In one settlement, a group of more than 100 teenagers began their own tree planting campaign to reduce the chance of future landslides.

Tom Obong Okello, executive director of Uganda’s National Forestry Authority (NFA), said the NFA has started planting trees on the slopes of Elgon to control soil erosion. “We are restoring the lost vegetation and trees to mitigate landslides in the area,” he said.

Trees for the Future, an international nonprofit organization, says it has planted more than 16 million trees in Uganda to help farmers restore their land and mitigate landslides.

David Duli, country director of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Uganda, said WWF Uganda has helped organize community groups to reforest areas that have been the most affected by landslides. “Forests play a significant role in national development through their contribution to the ecological balance, energy, and industrial activities.…We have formed community groups to replant trees in areas that were affected by landslides, but we also wanted the community to own these initiatives,” Duli said.

Blatter kept telling us that not only are refereeing mistakes part of the game, they are – and he really believed this – GOOD. They give us something to talk about. If TV replays were used to clear up every close call, what on earth would the fans talk about? Blatter perhaps forgot that there's been a fair amount of discussion about, for instance, World War Two, but that is generally regarded as not so good.

But then Blatter contradicted himself. I was at the Germany- England game at the 2010 World Cup, down in the cheap seats below Emperor Blatter and his fat cat buddies spilling over the sides of the best seats in the house.

Fans found it hard to know what to look at. The game, Blatter, or the German players' wives and girlfriends who were sitting in a section up to our left. But when Frank Lampard launched a shot that hit the underside of the crossbar, bounced down way beyond the goal line, and out again, and the officials said No Goal, all eyes turned to the odious Swiss as he did his best to look Not Guilty.

His negligence had cost England that goal, a goal which would have made it 2-2. Who knows how the match, which ended 4-1 to Germany, would have panned out had the goal stood?

Afterwards, Blatter (who, remember, had been in favour of referring blunders) changed his tune. He said ""Perhaps now iss ze time to reconsider technology in ze instance of if it's a goal, if it's not a goal.""

That's how we ended up with computer chips in the ball and gamma rays on the goal line.

Now with that particular dinosaur sinking into the quicksand of his own making, the tectonic plates are sliding a little more.

Various leagues and competitions, including the A League, are trying out new innovations to improve the game and help the refs, whose job, which had always been difficult, has in recent years been made impossible by the increased speed of the game and the increased determination of the players to deceive him.

How absurd that all these years, with cameras on hand which would let the referee make the correct decision within moments, the referee has been denied use of them?

I was also at the Brazil-Ghana at the 2006 World Cup, when Brazil scored a goal from an offside position. Replays of controversial incidents were not shown on the stadium screens normally, but somehow this one slipped through the system, and the Ghana players could see that the scorer, Adriano, was offside. They pleaded with the referee to look at the proof. He refused. The referee's decision is final. Even when he's wrong. Even when he knows it.

Two weeks ago a Leicester player fouled an Atletico player outside the box in a Champions League match. As refs have done since time began, this one incorrectly gave a penalty. Atletico scored. A moment of incompetence potentially costing Leicester millions of pounds.

Wrongs like this need to be righted, and anything that allows referees do so is good. The argument that football is a flowing game, that TV replays will slow it down, is invalid. Modern football seldom flows, it's a game of stoppages made difficult to watch because the players are constantly trying to get the game stopped, with their fouling and diving. The stoppages are frequently extended by over a minute as the players bicker with the ref, his assistants and each other every time an important call is made.

But players have stopped arguing about goal line decisions because they know the technology has made the right call, and that's sped the game up.

Video assistance with fouls will have the same effect.",2017-04-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['fouls', 'football', 'look', 'players', 'bill', 'video', 'world', 'replays', 'assistance', 'harris', 'referee', 'used', 'technology', 'goal', 'blatter', 'needs', 'game']",Ghana,news article,English
1688,FL-2017-000155-VNM,"Vietnam province drowns in misery amid continuing rain, floods - VnExpress International",https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-province-drowns-in-misery-amid-continuing-rain-floods-4179074.html,"People in Thua Thien-Hue Province in central Vietnam might be no strangers to floods, but the blackouts and food shortage of the past few weeks are taking their toll.

Huynh Kim Luong was standing in a corner of his home, struggling to find a spot for guests to sit. The pots, pans and clothes scattered around the house were illuminated by the light of flickering candles.

""It has been 21 years since I saw such a flood,"" he said.

For the past 10 days the 60-year-old farmer and his family of three have barely stepped outside. In their Huong Toan Commune in Thua Thien-Hue, floods triggered by heavy rains have inundated over 2,000 homes. The only sounds they hear these days are the thump of rain falling on the roof, the clattering of windows in the wind, and distant hums of motorboats moving through the sea of water.

Like many people in central Vietnam, Luong and his wife Hoa were proud of their ability to live with floods. Since the beginning of this month, Hoa has been stocking up rice, dry fish and peanut on warnings of coming storms and rains. They knew not to stock up on meat since electricity is always cut when a storm hits. They were right.

On the morning of October 9 Luong opened his front door only to see the water almost reaching the threshold following heavy rain the previous night. As the hours passed and the rain showed no signs of relenting, the water started to come inside the house. Everywhere in the neighborhood, people were yelling that the floods had come.

Their eldest daughter, who is in her final year of high school, began to put all her books into plastic bags. Her parents waded around the house to salvage the familys most valuable belongings like the refrigerator, TV and stove, and put them on a table that is reinforced with four blocks of wood.

Within a span of not even a day, Huong Toan turned from green paddy fields to muddy sea in the afternoon. With the electricity duly cut and dusk falling, the area, now flooded for dozens of kilometers along National Highway 1, slowly sank into darkness.

Also on October 9, in Huong Van Commune, about six kilometers away, Le Thi Thuc spent a sleepless night watching the water rise.

""I say keeping watch, but the water will rise anyway even if Im asleep. But my mind can be a little bit at rest if I watch it,"" she said.

The 54-year-old too has been confined at home for several days.

That night the entire family took refuge in the bedroom of her 85-year-old mother, whose room is situated farthest from the water. Thuc told her three children to go to sleep early, reminding them to turn off their phones to save the battery for the coming days without electricity.

Dung, her husband, shone the flashlight at the floor, sighing. The water was closing in. That night none of the three adults in the household slept a wink.

The local rice milling shop closed as soon as it started raining, catching Thuc off guard, leaving her no time to prepare enough food for the family.

Luckily her sister, who lives on higher ground, helped out, rowing a boat to Thucs house to deliver much-needed rice, bamboo shoot broth and boiled duck.

Seeing the family of six enjoying a meal sitting on a bed, surrounded by floodwater, Thuc could not help but weep.

For the next eight days the water ebbed and flowed. The children kept asking when the rain would stop, but the weather forecast kept getting gloomier.

The whole family had to shovel and sweep the mud and sludge entering the house. ""It was like walking in a swamp,"" they said.

Last Friday the water started to recede a little, going down to waist level, and Thuc took the opportunity to go out and buy some fish and vegetables. Looking around the neighborhood after being trapped inside the house for a week, she failed to recognize the place.

In Huong Toan, the situation has been grim. With the water showing no signs of receding, Hoang Trong Hieu, the commune chairman, other officials and police officers have not gone home for the last 10 days.

The group, which consists of over 20 people, has divided itself to take 24-hour shifts at the Peoples Committee office to distribute supplies and respond to emergencies like transporting the injured and evacuating people.

Since the entire commune is under a meter of water, all travel is done by boat.

""It has been a long time since we saw our feet,"" a member of the group joked, carrying bags of rice on his shoulder in chest-deep water. The man had given Luongs family two cartons of instant noodles the other day.

The day before electricity was cut, Luongs had some vegetables, eggs and fish in the refrigerator, but only enough for two days for the family of three. So for the next eight days they had nothing to eat but rice and dry fish.

""I was given instant noodles but did not dare eat them because I did not want to urinate too much,"" he explained.

Luongs wife, who had surgery just a month ago, stumbled in the dark and fell one night as she sought to go to the bathroom amid the sea of water. Since then he has been placing pots by the bed and replaces the candles twice every night.

""There are a lot of mosquitoes due to all the water.""

Nguyen Van Lieu wades through water to the stove in his flooded home in Thua Thien Hue Province, October 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Tao.

In Huong Van Commune, Nguyen Van Lieu, 63, has taken over the most dangerous task from his wife since the floods came: cooking. He dons his conical hat and raincoat every day to light the stove, standing in chest-deep water.

""If my wife gets into the water to cook, it will come up to her neck,"" he joked, patting his wifes back with a smile.

Their house was almost completed earlier this year but the roof has not been finished. The family is among the luckier ones in the neighborhood since the water only comes up to the thighs even during the heaviest rains.

But the kitchen is a different story. There had been over 20 bags of rice, weighing over a ton, but everything was soaked the very first night. Vy, Lieus wife, had no choice but to give them away to her neighbors to feed their ducks and chickens. She has been borrowing rice from others.

They have not told their two eldest children, who are workers in the south, about their situation, not wanting to worry them.

Like many others, the couple have been trapped inside their home, situated just 100 m from the national highway, for more than a week. Every day Vy would cast her gaze on the other side of the highway to look at the paddy fields longingly despite realizing they must be submerged under water.

A few days before the rains came she had sold her first few gourds of the season. ""They sell well this year at VND10,000 (43 cents) per kilogram,"" she said. She was hoping to earn around VND10 million from selling them all over two months.

But that was before the storm came. She was only able to sell for two days, earning VND240,000, before she was forced to remain at home.

She and her husband have been reminiscing about the historic flood in Thua Thien Hue 21 years ago. The deluge in November 1999 had submerged thousands of houses and paralyzed all traffic and electrical and communication systems in the province. There had been rainfall of up to 2,300 mm in just the first three days. Several people had been swept away and killed during that disaster.

At that time the couple and their children stacked two beds on top of each other and waited for the floods to recede, the anguished voices of people who lost loved ones in the background.

Their son, seeing how his parents had to face flooding year after year, wanted to help them find a safer place to live in, but they cannot countenance moving out of their hometown.

More heavy rains are expected in central Vietnam regions at least until Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Rivers are expected to rise further, as is the risk of floods and landslides. Vehicles continue to line up along National Highway 1 and other roads on higher ground as people park their cars and motorbikes there to avoid the water.

But the people cannot do the same, they cannot just leave their houses. The only thing that Luong, Thuc and Lieu can do is to barricade themselves inside their homes and pray for the water to go away",2020-10-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'misery', 'rice', 'water', 'province', 'rain', 'thuc', 'floods', 'house', 'amid', 'days', 'wife', 'drowns', 'thua', 'night', 'family', 'continuing']",Vietnam,news article,English

Vodafone Idea and Airtel are offering free voice and data benefits to their subscribers in flood-hit Assam. The telecom operators have sent out press statements detailing the benefits. Close to 30 lakh people in 19 of the state’s 33 districts have been affected by the floods, which also claimed over 70 lives.

Bharti Airtel is giving free credit of talk time along with 100MB to 5GB data in accounts of its Assam subscribers. The validity of prepaid plans will also be extended to help them stay connected and online. In addition, Airtel has extended the bill payment dates for its postpaid subscribers.

Vodafone Idea is offering its 10 lakh subscribers in the area free data benefit of 100MB to 5GB, which the company says has already been credited to their accounts. Free validity is another benefit that Vodafone is offering to its subscribers in Assam.

Vodafone Idea has also said that it organised a flood relief drive in the area, providing food and water to flood victims at the relief camps. The company’s on-ground team of experts is said to be working to restore 2G, 3G, and 4G connectivity as well.

• Delayed and below-average cumulative rainfall has delayed planting by at least three weeks in northern and parts of eastern Uganda. Near-average rainfall is forecasted in May and will likely support the development of late-maturing crops. However, the timing of the first season cereal and legume harvests will likely be delayed through early July, and aggregate production is expected to vary by subregion depending on the local amount and distribution of rainfall. Subnational production deficits are likely in northern and eastern Uganda, where rainfall may not be spread evenly in the crop cycle.

• Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected through at least September in most bimodal areas, driven by carryover stocks from 2020, below-average staple food prices, seasonal agricultural labor income during the March to May planting season, and the anticipated average harvest in July. However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are likely among households in flood-affected areas and some urban areas, where livelihood activities were significantly disrupted in 2020 and income sources are still below pre-pandemic levels.

• In Karamoja, an increasing number of households face widening food consumption gaps and are utilizing negative livelihoods coping strategies, increasing the share of the population that is experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. While food prices are generally stable and below average in most reference markets, the casual labor wage and the price of firewood, charcoal, and goats are declining, resulting in significantly below-average terms of trade and reduced household purchasing power. Below-average rainfall to date resulted in limited on-farm labor opportunities and delayed land preparation and planting, while others lack access to seeds.

• Planned and funded food assistance (cash and in-kind) equivalent to a 60 percent ration has sustained Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes in April. Thereafter, an anticipated pipeline break in food assistance funding may result in further reductions in rations and food security outcomes. Refugees with arable plots are engaging in plowing and planting activities, though some lack access to inputs like seeds as others have yet to recover from the impacts of earlier COVID-19 movement restrictions on food and income sources.

NEW YORK - On that fateful September morning, renowned artist Xu Bing was groggily getting up after a late night at work in his Brooklyn art studio. He turned on the television to find that New York had changed forever.

Xu Bing's display, lines of a poem written in the dust of 9/11, indicates how suddenly life can end. [Photo/China Daily]

He ran outside and watched as the second plane hit. Then he saw the buildings collapse. The scene felt like a movie, too enormous to comprehend, he said.

But in the following days, as the scope of the damage became clear, he ventured into Manhattan to collect dust from the fallen towers because he wasn't sure what else to do.

""9/11 really made me feel that my life was tied to the city,"" he said. ""Before 9/11 I had always felt that I was an outsider in New York, but that day changed everything. The city will always be a part of my life.""

That dust is now part of a new installation called ""Where does the dust itself collect?"", on display at The Spinning Wheel Building in New York.

In a 25-by-20-foot area, Xu has spelled out the outlines of a Chan Buddhist poem: ""As there is nothing from the first, where does the dust itself collect?""

Visitors are invited to view the piece from a raised platform.

Co-hosted by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and Chinatown's Museum of Chinese in America, the exhibition has been timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of 9/11 and will be on display through Oct. 9. Although the exhibit has shown previously in Berlin, Sao Paolo and Wales, where it won the first-ever Artes Mundi Prize, the piece was never shown in New York.

""It's very special and it means a lot to me that I am able to exhibit in New York for the anniversary,"" Xu said. ""I've been reflecting about this show. On my way from China to New York for this exhibition, security was incredibly heavy. We've been dealing with heightened airport security for ten years now. We are so conditioned and adapted to this new reality, but when you really stop and think about it, we've come to live in a truly strange world.""

Xu began conceptualizing the installation in 2002 but struggled with it, he said.

""I think it's very difficult to represent such a traumatizing event. In the face of such enormous tragedy, art becomes weak. On the other hand, there's a traditional Chinese saying that you should use lighter symbolic things to deal with very heavy matters.""

Andrew Horwitz, director of public programs for lower Manhattan council, compared the piece to a ""totem.""

""What I find most compelling about it is that it uses the physical evidence of 9/11 in juxtaposition with this Zen poem and while the dust is tangible and real, the idea of the poem is ephemeral,"" he said.

""It's a balance between the physical world and the non-physical world. It speaks to the ephemeral nature of our lives and how quickly what we know and the world we live in can be reduced to dust.""

Xu said that he chose this poem in particular because of the tension it addresses between the physical and spiritual worlds.

""Which realm is ultimately more powerful or everlasting? I find that very interesting,"" he said.

Xu is best known for his controversial 1988 piece, ""Book from the Sky,"" which featured thousands of nonsensical characters that appeared to be Chinese, printed on panels and scrolls. In 1994 he debuted ""Square Word Calligraphy,"" using English words and letters to create characters that also appeared Chinese in structure and style.

A collection of his work titled ""The Living Word"" is currently on exhibition at the Morgan Library and Museum, and a separate collection called the ""Tobacco Project"" is on display at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts through December.

""Xu Bing is very important, not just as a Chinese artist but as an artist of his generation,"" said Herb Tam, the curator for the Museum of Chinese in America.

""What separates him from other artists in the Chinese avant-garde movement is that he still maintains touchstones of traditional Chinese art. Even though this 9/11 piece doesn't overtly mark itself as being Chinese, it does connect to a deep spirituality that can be interpreted as Asian. [Xu] maintains a provocateur sensibility in the same way that other artists have done, but he's also much more tied into and captivated with the traditional Chinese-ness of where his work comes from.""

Mike Fu, the Events Program Coordinator for Columbia University's Weatherhead East Asian Institute, attended the reception because he was familiar with Xu's work.

""What he does is so provocative and interesting,"" he said. ""He's incredibly influential and well-connected in the art world. I think that his work really forces you to reevaluate your assumptions about culture."" The exhibition also attempts to recognize the effects of the tragedy on Manhattan's Chinatown, said Nicola Salvage, director of marketing and communications at lower Manhattan council.

""I think that people generally focus more on the perspective of the families who were affected by 9/11 directly, and that's understandable,"" she said. ""But people forget that there were many other communities that were affected by the tragedy. Chinatown is such a small, tightly knit community, and the effects on tourism and the lives of the people who live there were underrepresented in the mainstream media.""

In addition to Xu's exhibition, lower Manhattan council is hosting an initiative titled ""InSite: Art + Commemoration,"" featuring free arts events and a multimedia web site honoring the 10-year anniversary, Salvage said.

The New York City government recently gave Xu Bing a piece of 9/11 debris, he said. He hasn't decided what he will do with the piece yet.

""But first, I plan to bring it back to China,"" he said. ""Over a hundred Chinese people died on 9/11, and they also deserve to be honored.""",2011-09-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['chinese', 'exhibit', 'artist', 'xu', 'manhattan', 'piece', 'art', 'anniversary', 'honored', 'dust', 'feels', '911', 'poem', 'york', 'exhibition']",China,news article,English

Traffickers often prey on lone children caught up in chaotic scenes such as Cyclone Idai, they said, while parents might marry off their young girls as they struggle to eke out a life.

At least 678 people have died and nearly 3 million have been affected after Cyclone Idai hammered Mozambique’s port city of Beira on March 14 before moving inland to neighboring Malawi and Zimbabwe, the United Nations said.

Idai’s winds ripped apart homes, schools and medical centers and torrential rains triggered floods that inundated vast swathes of farmland in one of the worst climate-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere.

With the U.N. estimating up to a million children affected in Mozambique alone, aid workers are particularly concerned about orphaned children and those separated from their families who are fending for themselves almost two weeks on.

“In crises like these big, natural disasters, children and parents can easily lose one another,” Rik Goverde from Save the Children charity told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Chimoio, 200 km (125 miles) northwest of Beira.

“Children are out there on their own - without the supervision or care of a trustworthy adult. They can easily fall victim to sexual violence or human trafficking. We are aware and very concerned about it.”

Goverde said that one mother he met had lost three children, swept away in flood waters, while other colleagues had come across children who had seen their parents die.

The charity’s helpline had received about 10 calls from families reporting missing children, he said, though this was likely “just the tip of the iceberg” as some telecommunications and power lines were still down.

Reports of missing children and unaccompanied children are being registered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on their website, he said, with the priority being to reunite families as quickly as possible.

About 350 people registered on the website - either looking for missing relatives or marking themselves as safe. About 24 children are registered as missing, with teams on the ground collecting more names of the lost and missing.

ALREADY STRESSED

Mozambique is a source, transit, and, to a lesser extent, destination country for men, women and children who are trafficked into forced labor and sexual slavery, according to the U.S. State Department’s 2018 Trafficking in Persons report.

Children are often forced to work in sectors such as farming and mining. Women and girls are often lured to cities in Mozambique or South Africa with promises of employment, only to be sold into domestic or sexual servitude, it added.

Experts say post-disaster trafficking has become common in developing nations as an increase in extreme events caused by global warming leaves the already poor even more vulnerable.

The breakdown of social institutions makes it hard to find food and humanitarian supplies, leaving women and children at risk of kidnapping, sexual exploitation and trafficking.

Aid workers say young girls could also be forced to wed as parents who have lost homes and crops are pushed to the brink and seek ways to ease the burden on the rest of the family.

“Mozambique is already among the top 10 countries in the world with the highest rates of child marriage - around 48 percent of girls are married before 18,” said Anne Hoff, Plan International’s Country Director in Mozambique.

“We do know that when there is a drought and there is a lack of food, we tend to see an increase in early marriages. There is a high risk it could happen as the crops have been destroyed and it will be very difficult for people to recover.”",2019-03-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'children', 'parents', 'cyclone', 'slavery', 'missing', 'girls', 'sexual', 'forced', 'workers', 'trafficking', 'women', 'risks', 'abound', 'families']",Mozambique,news article,English

The combined events caused over $360 billion in damage and washed 1.5 million tons of debris, including wrecked cars, buildings and homes, into the ocean. The tsunami also flooded Japan’s Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant, which melted its cores and leaked radiation. More than 18,000 people died, and many others were reported missing.

The California coast experienced over $100 million in damage. Locally, tsunami surges and strong currents caused flooding and minor damage, mainly to the boating community. The County of San Diego Office of Emergency Services and San Diego County’s hazardous materials division also worked with local, state and federal agencies to develop emergency plans to document and handle debris that could potentially wash ashore in the years following.

The events on March 11, 2011 have helped shape local and statewide emergency planning and preparedness efforts and serve as a lasting reminder of the importance of being prepared. While tsunamis are rare along San Diego’s 70 miles of coastline, it is important to know your risks and be prepared. Whether you work, live, or visit the coast, here are some simple and no-cost steps you can take to be this tsunami preparedness week to be ready for tsunamis:

29,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Climate Change: Another hurdle for poverty eradication - SKNVibes.com,http://www.sknvibes.com/news/newsdetails.cfm/88359,"August 1st, 2014 -- Today, most persons consider climate change to be a reality and not a myth. A result of this phenomenon, natural hazards have been identified as having crippling effects on many countries, particularly those already vulnerable; Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS). However, the disasters created in these countries as a result of natural hazards are only one aspect of the detrimental effects of climate change. The gradual changes in the environment, on the other hand, such as increased rainfall, extreme drought and rising sea level heighten the problems faced by those countries already vulnerable to climate change as these significant changes impact on agriculture and tourism, both of which are important to the Greater Caribbean and Sustainable Development.



While agriculture is the major economic land-use activity in the Caribbean, it accounts for a small portion of most islands' GDP.

Notwithstanding this however it still holds great importance. The Caribbean Community Secretariat states that in 2005 agriculture accounted for 35% of total GDP in Guyana, 18% in Dominica, 15% in Belize and 8% in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Lucia, the agriculture sector’s contribution to GDP varied between 3% and 6%. In addition to its contribution to GDP, this sector also plays an increasingly important role in food security in a region typically characterised by increasing importation of food. Agriculture therefore becomes vulnerable to climate change as changes in weather pattern will affect the sector and by extension, those who rely on it.





While the links between climate change and rainfall occurrence are still being debated, the reality is that most countries, particularly those in the hurricane belt, are seeing an increased number of storms, which themselves have increased intensity. The effect of this on countries which dedicate large areas of land to agricultural production for export can be particularly devastating. Recent storms have wiped out the entire sugar cane production of Cuba, banana plantations in Jamaica, St Lucia and Dominica, and decimated nutmeg exports from Grenada. This coupled with the fact that the devastation wreaked on infrastructure curtails the country’s ability to respond. In fact the effects of storms in the region on some island economies have resulted in damages exceeding 200% of country GDP in some cases.





The impact of climate change is also seen in the extreme drought experienced by countries in and out of the traditional dry seasons. The decrease in rainfall has reduced the water available for farming and in some cases has caused the destruction of entire food crops. Rural farming which in some cases is characterised as subsistence farming stand to be affected, causing further hardships on groups already considered vulnerable. In rural Jamaica, 25% of the population lives in poverty and this is where agriculture is the main source of livelihood. Despite the 7% contribution made to GDP by agriculture in Jamaica, it employs over 220,000 of the 1,239,000 people employed. Thus, those already vulnerable to changes in the agriculture sector are even more at a disadvantage with the changes brought on by climate change.

Caribbean SIDS in the Greater Caribbean region also stands to face challenges in the traditional tourism sector as a result of climate change. Traditional tourism (sun, sand and sea tourism) relies on the natural assets of the region; beaches, coral reefs and favourable weather conditions and is a key contributor to regional GDP. Rise in sea level and ocean acidification present real threats to these types of economies. While a lot of attention has been placed on sea level rise, ocean acidification may present even a greater risk to island economies when placed in the context of decreased agricultural production and increased storm intensity. Most Caribbean islands have expansive reef systems which support both the fisheries industry as well as tourism.

Oceans absorb a key climate change gas, carbon dioxide, and as a result become more acidic on a relative scale, because some of the carbon reacts within the water to form carbonic acid. This reduces the amount of dissolved carbonate available for calcium carbonate shell and skeleton formation – important to corals, plankton and shellfish. Corals reefs, already under threat in the region, are likely to have a tough time. The invertebrate species secretes calcium carbonate to make the rocky coastal reefs that form the basis of some of the most productive ecosystems in the oceans. Coupled with bleaching due to warming of the waters it is believed that the reefs could die as corals could become virtually extinct by the end of the century.

Most Caribbean tourism is coastal, with hotels dotting sandy beaches in most countries. Unfortunately the reefs, which are now at risk, provide significant protection from the immense power due to hydro meteorological events such as hurricanes. Without the protection of the reef, the forces caused by the storms damage beaches, thereby reducing the viability of tourism investments. The Inter-American Development Bank states that almost one-third of Caribbean tourism resorts are at flooding risks from sea level rise and increased sea surface temperatures are expected to result in severe bleaching stress to the reefs of the Caribbean as early as the 2030s, surpassing the ability of many areas to recover.

With the impact of climate change on agriculture and tourism being so severe, it is a constant threat to the reduction of poverty in already economically fragile areas. Adaptation strategies need to be employed in order to mitigate the effects and assure the sustainable development of the region. It is thus important that the link between climate change and disaster risk reduction be strengthened





The Association of Caribbean States, through its initiative SHOCS - Strengthening Hydro-Meteorological Operations and Services in the Caribbean SIDS is helping Caribbean countries to be better prepared for such changes arising out of climate change.

Dr Nina Ansary is an award-winning American-Iranian author, historian and expert on Iran. She also sits on the board of the New York-based Centre for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI). In the wake of catastrophic flooding in the beleaguered Middle Eastern nation, the researcher has spoken to Express.co.uk about the dire situation to voice concerns about the Iranian regime’s handling of the disaster which has left hundreds injured and tens of thousands displaced.

The historian questioned the inadequate response of the Iranian authorities, which she contended “do not have the best of interests of the people in mind” after floods ravaged the homes of thousands, with the historic city of Shiraz the worst hit by the devastation. Dr Ansary argued the Iranian regime has “squandered Iran’s greatest asset, its people” and did not heed weather warnings of the floods’ imminent impact on Shiraz. Condemning Hassan Rouhani’s administration she said: “They neglected to evacuate the residents of Shiraz in time so that is why the injury and loss of life were so drastic. “There was no observation of warnings, no evacuations, no precautionary measures. “This crisis has come about due to a lack of infrastructure against natural disasters, which reflects the negligence of the Iranian authorities.” READ MORE: Iran flash floods kill 17 and injure 74 - officials warn 'Stay INSIDE'

The devastating floods have wiped out entire communities

President Rouhani, who claimed the floods were an “unprecedented natural disaster”, was quoted by Iranian state media as saying: “The government will use all means and will compensate all those who have sustained damages to their houses, businesses and farms.” But his supposed words of reassurance come too late for those who blame his callous regime’s inertia in tackling the problem. At least 44 people died and more than 200 were injured, with thousands of homes damaged after the heavy flash floods triggered landslides across Iran, according to the CHRI citing Iran’s state-funded Emergency Services Organization. The devastating flash floods inflicted a huge $500million (£439million) of damage, according to the CHRI, who cited Iran’s Ministry of Agriculture and Jihad, which manages and oversees the country’s agricultural industry. Dr Ansary argued the Iranian government would rather “plunder its resources” than “attend to its own people’s needs”.

She said: “This disaster is coming at a time of heightened political tension in Iran, not to mention dire economic circumstances for the people of Iran from decades of mismanagement by the Iranian government which prefers to fund foreign terrorist organisations as opposed to attend to its own people’s needs.” In a further blow to his own citizens, Rouhani’s deputy attorney general announced a ban on celebrities raising money to help the victims, Dr Ansary explained. And the hardline authorities have also announced a crackdown on social media usage, warning citizens they could be prosecuted if they post about the disaster online. Of the suppressive measure, prominent human rights lawyer Abdolkarim Lahiji told the CHRI: “Not only has the Iranian government been negligent but it has also warned victims’ families and those who have suffered losses that they will be prosecuted if they paint a dark picture of this natural disaster and state relief efforts.

SACKVILLE, Australia (Reuters) - At Ken Anderson's orchard near the banks of the Hawkesbury River in the outer Sydney suburb of Sackville, another few inches of flood water could spell the end for much of this season's orange and mandarin harvest - and possibly the trees as well.

As torrential rains pummel Australia's east, causing the worst floods in half a century, those living near major river systems are suffering the most, with homes, roads and livestock being washed away.

The lower-lying areas are most at risk, Anderson told Reuters at his orchard, which he said had been in the family for 170 years.

""I'll lose a fair bit, because if the water stays on there too much, the fruit will just drop,"" said Anderson, who at 66 is the fourth generation of his family to run the property.

In parts of the orchard, only the top branches of the fruit trees were visible above the water.

""Down in the other section over there, it takes a while for the water to come off so I'll end up losing the fruit there and probably might lose the trees too,"" added Anderson stoically, holding a blue-and-yellow striped umbrella against the pouring rain.

In the state of New South Wales, where the flooding is most severe, a deluge is forecast overnight on Tuesday in some areas despite clearer weather in Sydney.

While damage to properties and livelihoods is widespread, there have been no recorded fatalities from the floods.

Anderson said it had been a difficult few days, working non-stop for the past couple of nights.

""I'm all over it now,"" said the farmer with a slight chuckle. ""I'm coming down with a cold, I think actually, I've been wet a few days.""

Torrential rains have triggered devastating floods and landslides across East Africa in recent weeks, aggravating an already challenging situation as countries in the region battle the coronavirus pandemic.

The destruction caused by the heavy rainfall has killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and has also forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.

This week, officials in Kenya and Rwanda said nearly 200 and 65 people had died in both countries, respectively, with floodwaters and mudslides destroying houses, washing away bridges and straining critical infrastructure.

On Saturday, Kenyan and Uganda suffered nationwide electricity outages, leaving tens of millions of people without power.

Health experts are worried about the implications of the flooding on the countriesâ?? response to the coronavirus pandemic.

â??This is compounding the COVID-19 response,â? Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said.

â??The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.â?

Floodwaters also recently swept away most parts of an entire small town in Somalia and swept away roads, bridges and a hospital in Uganda.

Heavy rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in western Uganda after Nyamwamba River burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, according to officials.

â??What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance, but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?â? Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime ministerâ??s office, was quoted as saying by the Reuters News Agency.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also washed away despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

â??There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldnâ??t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,â? Mucunguzi said.

The Somali region in eastern Ethiopia has also been hard hit by the floods, with more than 100,000 people displaced, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Meanwhile, an unspecified number of people were killed in the semi-autonomous Puntland region in Somalia when flash floods swept away most buildings in Qardho town, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, said Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Kenyatta University in Kenyaâ??s capital, Nairobi.

â??This is a carry-over of what we had last year,â? he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

The floods are coming as swarms of locusts are wreaking havoc across East Africa where millions of people struggle for food.

239,FF-2016-000062-IDN,The dredge report: being an account of an expedition into the hyperreality of the California Delta - TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/25/wow-thats-a-lot-of-dredge/,"It has occurred to me that perhaps TechCrunch pays insufficient attention to slurry, sediment, silt, sludge, mud, and muck; to canals, earthworks, levees, dikes, dredges, and the Army Corps of Engineers; to the vast engineering works, with lifespans measured in decades, that literally reshape our world. So last weekend I boarded a bus hired by the Dredge Research Collaborative.

This wonderfully obsessive and obscure group of infrastructure aficionados, guided by Wired writer and Rhode Island School of Design professor Tim Maly, has held an annual “DredgeFest” event every year since 2013. This year it was a tour of that vast artificial hyperreality just upstream of San Francisco and the Valley — the California Delta.

“We own the only high-rate offloader west of the Mississippi,” Jim Levine says at our first stop, the massive megaproject called the Montezuma Wetlands, with some justified smugness in his voice. “Slurry it up to 15% … pump the sediment 4 miles at 20,000 gallons a minute … last year we took in about a million [cubic] yards … probably half of all the dredging in the bay.”

“Wow,” an awed student breathes in reply, “that’s a lot of dredge.”

The entire Delta is, basically, a lot of dredge. Once it was a huge wetland carved by a network of intertwined, constantly shifting waterways. Then came the 19th-century gold rush. Miners upstream in the Sierra washed away entire rock faces with high-pressure water, creating a gargantuan “pulse” of sediment that filtered downstream, its traces still visible in the San Francisco Bay today. Meanwhile, settlers began to cultivate the Delta. Chinese laborers built the first delta megaproject; a colossal array of levees to (aspirationally) hold back floods.

The descendants of those levees wall the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers today — and the peaty land of the islands behind them has subsided to a depth which in places hits 26ft/8m below sea level. On Sherman Island, where the Sacramento and San Joaquin meet, we stood in those depths, looking what felt like way up to the riverbanks, jokingly advised to look for cracks in the levees.

Of course what really worries Californians is earthquakes. Sherman Island, and its levees, keep the brackish Bay water out of what’s sent south by the California State Water Project. If it were to be inundated by a levee breach, salinity would increase so much that “we’d have to shut down the pumps” carrying water south, said an engineer from Ducks Unlimited (no, really) as he showed us around the site.

If this doesn’t seem like a tenable long-term solution to you, you’re not alone. Governor Brown and co. are currently promoting a $15 billion plan to carry water under the Delta to Southern California, courtesy of two giant tunnels. This is, to put it mildly, controversial. Others have proposed converting farmland back to natural wetlands. Which is of course even more controversial.

There is no such thing as a megaproject without fierce opposition. Even the Montezuma Wetlands project — which, elegantly, tops up subsided lowlands with dredged sediment, to regenerate the kind of wetlands which originally existed — attracted enormous hostility and resistance. The project was birthed in 1991: it did not launch until 2003, after 12 years of legal battles.

Now, in the shadow of a massive wind farm (its existence perhaps prompted by the project’s $150,000/month PG&E bill) a slow restoration of two thousands acres of wetlands is underway, and should continue for at least another decade. In an era when “tech” usually means something obsoleted within a few years, there is a certain grandeur to projects with this kind of scale and lifespan.

Even outside of cities, most of the population of California lives in a fundamentally artificial environment, courtesy of what can be considered an ongoing engineering project that dates back more than a century: the transformation of the Delta and the Central Valley into some of the world’s most productive farmland, while keeping the South alive with water from the North, the Owens Valley, and the Colorado River.

Some of this history has been captured at the Dutra Museum of Dredging (no, really) in Rio Vista in the Delta. (Sorry, hacker tourists; they’re open by appointment only, and prefer groups of 10 or more.) There I learned that the clamshell dredge was one of the cutting-edge world-changing technologies of its day. It’s still in wide use, but of course it’s not “tech” any more. As technology ages, it becomes infrastructure, and grows deeply boring to most.

The friend who invited me out to DredgeFest is a professional infrastructurist himself — except that his is in orbit. One day the descendants of his satellites will be both as unsexy, and as crucial, as the dredges you might glimpse from BART or the bayside from time to time, without really noticing. And why should you? Like most infrastructure, they are much too important to be allowed to be interesting.",2016-06-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['sediment', 'valley', 'san', 'delta', 'techcrunch', 'project', 'wetlands', 'california', 'account', 'levees', 'report', 'water', 'expedition', 'hyperreality', 'dredge', 'really']",India,news article,English

The footage shows a huge chunk of snow sliding down a mountain and falling into the river.

A glacier burst in Raini village of Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on the morning of February 7, resulted in flash flooding and put in danger lives of people living along the banks of river Dhauliganga. According to reports 171 people have been missing since the flash floods occurred and 26 have been declared dead so far in the glacier burst.

The viral video is being circulated with the caption, ""First video of glacier breaking in Chamoli, Uttarakhand this morning"" (Original text: ''आज सुबह उत्तराखंड के चमोली में ग्लेशियर टूटने का पहला वीडियो 7 feb 2021'')

Fact Check

BOOM broke the video into its key frames and ran a reverse image search on a few frames, and found a French website carrying the same video stating that the avalanche occurred in Nepal. The article published on January 17, 2021, included an Instagram video posted by an user called @naren32 who has uploaded the same video of snow sliding down a steep gorge.

We searched for the video on the Instagram profile of naren32 and found a number of videos uploaded in January from the incident- one shorter video of the Nepal avalanche and a longer footage of the same. The caption of the video says, ""Huge Avalanche at Kapuche Lake. Here comes full video of huge avalanche, had to spend overnight at Kapuche lake (Lowest altitude glacier lake in the world) in order to catch this moment and it eventually paid off"".

The same user had also uploaded the footage video on his Youtube Channel, Naren32 Rana on January 11, 2021 with the title ''Huge Avalanche at Kapuche Lake ( Lowest Altitude Glacier Lake In Nepal)''.

BOOM further found news reports on the Nepal avalanche incident and could ascertain that the video is from Kapuche Glacier Lake in Parche in Nepal.

The Weather Channel also reported on the incident. The report stated that there were no casualties but kayakers had to wrap up their activity because of the approaching avalanche.

- Starlink is a company under SpaceX, a space transportations services company, and its offering broadband

- The company will be competing with network providers like MTN Nigeria, Airtel Nigeria, Globacom and 9mobile

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

Lagos State plans to stop being a receiver of processed rice and start processing its own Lake Rice, starting with the Kebbi State government.

33,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Scientists launch technology that can change the weather ... in your photos - PBS NewsHour,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/scientists-launch-technology-can-change-weather-photos,"After analyzing thousands of webcam snapshots of landscapes in various weather conditions, computer scientists at Brown University have developed a system that can automatically change the appearance of weather in nearly any outdoor photo.

The team’s algorithm adjusts 40 different attributes in photos that the researchers determined are connected to our perception of weather. The resulting software can easily alter a lush green landscape to make it appear covered in snow or subjected to drought.

“Programs like Photoshop are really powerful, but you basically need to be an artist to use them. We want anybody to be able to manipulate photographs as easily as you’d manipulate text.” said James Hays, Manning Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brown.

To identify the attributes that enable us to identify weather in photos, the scientists commissioned Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing engine to rate photos based on perceptual and subjective qualities. Does a certain photo show a sunset or a sunrise? Is it gloomy or clear? You can explore an interactive version of the team’s data set at their project website, or use weather attributes to search the catalog of images that went into the development of the algorithm.

The software will be presented in a paper at next week’s SIGRAPH 2014, an international conference on interactive and computer graphics.",2014-08-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['launch', 'manipulate', 'identify', 'software', 'weather', 'technology', 'interactive', 'scientists', 'computer', 'attributes', 'teams', 'change', 'photos']",China,news article,English
847,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,"Southern Africa Food Security Alert: April 5, 2019 - Mozambique - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/southern-africa-food-security-alert-april-5-2019,"Widespread drought and flooding from Cyclone Idai drive high assistance needs through early 2020

In early February, FEWS NET released an Alert on the poor progress of Southern Africa’s October 2018 to March 2019 rainy season. Through the remainder of the season, western and central areas received only light to moderate rainfall. End-of-season rainfall totals were less than 55 percent of normal across most of the region and drought conditions persisted in several areas. In addition, Tropical Cyclone Idai hit the eastern coast of Mozambique in mid-March, resulting in widespread flooding and high-speed winds across central Mozambique, eastern Zimbabwe, and southern Malawi. This resulted in over 850 known deaths, significant displacement, loss of livestock, and destruction of infrastructure and croplands. The ongoing drought coupled with the negative impacts of Cyclone Idai have driven atypically high assistance needs that are expected to persist through at least early 2020, and humanitarian actors and national governments should plan for higher than normal food assistance and livelihood support needs throughout this time.

Rainfall during Southern Africa’s 2018/19 rainy season started nearly a month late, was characterized by extended dry spells between January and March, and concluded with historically low rainfall totals in many central and western parts of the region (Figure 1). Areas of Botswana, northern Zimbabwe, eastern Namibia, southern Angola, and surplus-producing areas of northern South Africa and southern Zambia registered a D3 (Extreme) or D4 (Exceptional) drought according to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Drought Monitor scale.

Conversely, rainfall totals in Malawi and much of Mozambique were already above average prior to Cyclone Idai, which made landfall as a Category 4 storm in central Mozambique on March 14. The cyclone transitioned into a tropical depression as it traveled across central Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe, driving further heavy rainfall through March 21 across these areas and Malawi. Central Mozambique was the hardest hit, receiving more than 300 millimeters of rainfall in a 24-hour period in Beira City with sustained wind speeds over 170 km/hour. Nearly 1.5 million people were impacted, 161,000 people were displaced, and almost 600 people were killed in Mozambique, though many areas remain inaccessible and the full extent of the damage is still unknown. Although Beira port was cutoff for roughly six days, access has resumed. In Zimbabwe, Chimanimani and Chipinge districts were significantly impacted and remain mostly inaccessible following infrastructure damage. An estimated 250,000 people in Zimbabwe were affected, 4,500 of whom were displaced. In Southern Malawi, roughly 860,000 people were affected and close to 87,000 people were displaced.

The widespread drought and flooding following Cyclone Idai have together driven extensive crop losses in many areas of the region and below-average production is likely in most countries, including in South Africa and Zambia, which are key contributors to regional maize supply. Recent field visits conducted by the USDA in collaboration with FEWS NET and partners corroborate drought-related crop losses in southern Zambia and northern Zimbabwe. As a result of flooding and high-speed winds following Cyclone Idai, over 700,000 hectares (ha) of crops were lost in central Mozambique and about 30,000 ha in southern Malawi at the start of the harvest period. In eastern Zimbabwe, most areas remain inaccessible but initial estimates indicate roughly 24,000 ha of crops have been destroyed.

Despite expected below-average 2019 maize production, FEWS NET expects that regional maize supply during the 2019/20 marketing year will still be average due largely to carryover stocks from last year’s bumper harvest in South Africa. Currently, maize grain prices are trending near or slightly above the five-year average across the region and this trend is expected to continue in most areas, and prices are not anticipated to reach the high levels observed in 2016. However, maize prices are expected to be well above average in drought-affected areas with localized supply deficits, flood-affected areas of Mozambique, and in Zimbabwe where both drought and macroeconomic issues are of concern. Should Tanzania and Zambia restrict grain exports to structurally-deficit neighboring countries in an effort to protect their domestic supplies, maize grain availability will be lower than normal in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) Haut Katanga province, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.

Livestock conditions and agricultural labor opportunities have also been negatively affected by the poor 2018/19 seasonal performance. Pasture conditions and water availability for livestock are below average in many areas, including parts of Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, and Botswana, where drought-related livestock diseases and deaths have already been reported. Livestock body conditions are unlikely to improve in drought-affected areas until the start of the 2019/20 rainy season, driving lower livestock prices through much of 2019, and atypically high livestock deaths are possible. In central Mozambique, it is reported that many impacted households lost their livestock in the floods and no longer have access to this source of income. Overall, poor households are expected to have below-average income through at least late 2019 when agricultural labor for the 2019/20 season will be available and the next rainy season drives livestock improvements.

As a result, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are anticipated across the region, with the highest concern in Zimbabwe, central and southern Mozambique, southern Zambia, and parts of Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, and Angola. Additionally, FEWS NET anticipates the 2019/20 lean season will start atypically early in August and needs will be highest at the peak of the lean season in early 2020. Humanitarian actors and national governments should plan for higher than normal food assistance and livelihood support needs through at least early 2020.",2019-04-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['security', 'mozambique', 'africa', 'southern', 'cyclone', 'zambia', 'livestock', 'central', 'drought', 'season', '2019', 'food', 'zimbabwe', 'alert', 'areas']",Mozambique,news article,English

The heavy downpour resulted in heavy traffic gridlock, flooded roads as well as cutting off of a section of roads making the movement of traffic a nightmare.

The enhanced rainfall has been pounding Nairobi since Monday leaving a trail of misery and destruction in its wake.

Thika Road, Mombasa Road, Waiyaki Way and Jogoo Road among others have been characterised by winding traffic snarl ups night and day with distances that normally took less than an hour to navigate now taking more than three hours.

Motorists and commuters alike have had to suffer the consequences of the heavy rains with others forced to spend the night on the road on Tuesday.

""We are stuck in jam that is not moving at Industrial Area for the three and half hours... Can somebody link up with traffic department Embakasi or lndustrial Area to assist,"" said an affected commuter.

The situation has been exacerbated by ongoing infrastructural developments going on across the city with the construction of the Nairobi Expressway playing a major role in the mess.

Motorists have been forced to wade through flash floods occasioned by heavy rains, with Kenya Meteorological Department warning the rains will continue throughout the week.

According to the weatherman, the heavy rainfall being experienced over several parts of the country is set to continue this week and likely to intensify to more than 30 mm in 24 hours.

Highlands West of the Rift Valley, the Lake Victoria Basin, the Central Rift Valley, the Northwest, the South-eastern Lowlands, the Northeast and the highlands East of the Rift Valley, including Nairobi County will be worst affected.

However, the heavy downpour is projected to reduce in intensity on Thursday.

""Due to already high-water levels in rivers and other water retention areas, it is likely that the rains may cause flooding over flood plains and other areas not well drained,"" said the Met department.

""Mudslides and landslides are also likely to occur on hilly areas of the highlands West of the Rift Valley and the highlands East of the Rift Valley due to already saturated soils,"" it added.

1599,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Uganda wants people to leave flooded wetlands - and not come back - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-environment-housing-trfn-idUSKBN23I15P,"ENTEBBE, Uganda (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For the last decade, Silus Musasizi has lived on a wetland on the shores of Lake Victoria. For most of that time, Uganda’s government has been trying to chase him away.

Now, it is the water itself that has driven him from his small house on the edge of Entebbe, a Ugandan town that juts into Africa’s largest lake.

Thousands have been displaced from their homes along the shoreline by the worst flooding since records began more than a century ago. Musasizi, who works as a truck driver, is renting a room on higher ground until the waters recede.

“Homes have been destroyed,” said Musasizi, whose family came here originally seeking cheap land. “My friends are now on the streets.”

The Ugandan government has said people like Musasizi are partly to blame for the floods, and wants them to leave the wetlands for good.

It plans to start evicting people without compensation this month - in the middle of a coronavirus lockdown that has hit the poor hardest.

‘RICH WILL REMAIN’

Alfred Okot Okidi, the top civil servant at the ministry of water and environment, said 700,000 Ugandans had been affected by flooding nationwide, almost all of whom live illegally in the protected zones around lakes and rivers.

Settlement, cultivation and industry were destroying the wetlands, which act as “natural sponges” to absorb excess rainfall, Okidi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The evictions are in line with a directive issued by President Yoweri Museveni, who warned in an address last week that the floods “should be an eternal lesson to all of us”.

That is a message heard with scepticism in the swamps of Entebbe, where houses crumble into the water and men fish in flooded gardens.

Peter Kisakye Zzimula, the pastor of a church on the wetlands, argued that people only build there because they cannot afford to rent property elsewhere.

“Nobody would wish to be here but people are oppressed,” he said. “If you evict them, where will they go?”

The rains over east Africa have been unusually heavy since last year and climate scientists have predicted more such weather in future.

But the flooding is exacerbated by local factors including the destruction of forests and wetlands, said Frank Muramuzi, executive director of the National Association of Professional Environmentalists, a civil society group.

Muramuzi said wealthy investors were snapping up land to grow rice or flowers for sale, and set up hotels and resorts.

“All those establishments are being done by rich people and some them have connections in government,” he said.

“The poor people will be evicted, but the rich people will remain.”

‘GOD HAS COME’

Last year, wetlands covered just 8.4% of Uganda, down from 15.5% in 1994, according to the environment ministry.

In 2014 the government ordered the cancellation of all land titles there, issued illegally by local officials because the law prohibits private ownership of wetlands.

A subsequent survey of four central districts identified 1,700 titles in wetlands, said Collins Oloya, the acting director of environmental affairs at the environment ministry.

But the process has become bogged down in lengthy court proceedings and only 300 titles have so far been cancelled.

Now the rising waters are forcing people out of the wetlands, doing Oloya’s work for him.

“I’m very happy that God has come,” he said.

But the political pressures that have stymied past threats of eviction may do so again, with elections scheduled for next year.

Police fired teargas at protesting vendors last month as they shut down a flooded market on another stretch of shoreline.

“We need to conserve the environment, but at the same time we need to be conscious that we are dealing with human beings,” said Kayanja Vincent de Paul, the mayor of Entebbe.

“It is a hotcake. If you handle it badly, it can burn you up.”

SUSPICION

Tensions are heightened by popular suspicion. Musasizi, the truck driver, believes governments have engineered the floods to grab land from the poor.

“After this water has chased these poor people, more hotels are going to be built here,” he said.

Meanwhile Judith Amojong, another resident, is hoping for divine intervention.

She used to sleep in the local church with a few other homeless worshippers.

One day she foresaw a great flood. “I got a dream where the world was full of water,” she recalled.

Soon after, the waters started seeping under the corrugated iron walls, bringing coldness and snakes.

Amojong, who is now sheltering at the house of a fellow churchgoer, hopes that she will not have to return.

“We are praying God gives us money in order to leave this place because we cannot fight nature, this is fighting God.”",2020-06-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['leave', 'come', 'titles', 'wetlands', 'land', 'musasizi', 'god', 'local', 'flooded', 'uganda', 'water', 'poor', 'environment', 'waters', 'wants']",Uganda,news article,English

As the death toll climbed to 37 in rain-affected Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday undertook an aerial survey of flood-ravaged districts of the state. More than 11 out of 14 districts in the southern Indian state are under water due to incessant rains in the last three days. NDRF, Army and other forces are working on a war footing to rescue people from flood-affected areas as the overall situation remains grave.

On Saturday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to release sufficient funds to the Kerala Government. Meanwhile, CM Pinarayi Vijayan has also appealed to all to contribute generously to restore life in the state. He has also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the next of kin of deceased and Rs 10 lakh to those who lost their property in the Floods. The CM is visiting the flood-affected areas of Idukki, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Wayanad, Kozhikode & Malappuram districts.

Four years ago, three engineers decided to quit their lucrative jobs at the peak of their careers. The reason? They wanted to undertake scientific and mechanised agriculture.

While the initial idea of the Bengaluru-based trio–Ashok Jayanthi, Sriram Chitlur and Srinath Setty, was to find a piece of land close to the city where they could practice organic farming and grow chemical-free food for their families, little did they know it would culminate into an innovative agri-startup, today known as Hosachiguru.

What is Hosachiguru?

Originating from the Kannada terms ‘hosa’ which means ‘new’ and ‘chiguru’ which means ‘sprout’, Hosachiguru is a leading agricultural asset management startup that is running over 30 sustainable green projects on 800 acres of land.

When you think about investments, you might consider buying a plot of land away from the city where you’d spend more of your savings, perhaps building a home that you may or may not live in for the next decade. But what if we told you, despite living in the city, you could invest and buy a piece of land, which could be transformed into a mini-forest and get you returns ?

And you don’t even have to think about its maintenance. Everything will be done for you! Plus, you’ll have organically grown and pesticide-free produce from this mini-forest delivered at your doorstep weekly.

Sounds utopian?

Well, the Bengaluru-based agricultural asset management startup with its latest Eco-habitat project is doing exactly that!

Speaking to The Better India, the trio explains the inception of the company saying,

“When we decided to take up farming ourselves, and hunted for farmland, we travelled across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. It was during this ground research that we realised that procuring, buying as well as maintaining farmland was no child’s play. Either the cost of the land was too high, or it was too remote to be within our reach. But we were passionate about farming and willing to go the extra mile. As a company, we decided to procure 20-30 acres of farmland. We fenced it, dug borewells, sowed seeds, got farm labour, all by ourselves. But slowly our work started piquing the curiosity of those in our social circles. People started asking us for tips.

Sriram Chitlur shares, “It was at the time we thought, why don’t we sell the pieces of land to these people and manage it on their behalf. That’s how we started getting customers on board and started rolling one project after another.”

Whether it is their retail project that helps investors get long-term income from timber cultivation or their upcoming eco-habitat project, their road to success was full of challenges.

The trio travelled across the globe to understand the best-mechanised farming practices. Despite the massive exposure to a wide range of practices across different countries, they decided to come up with the own techniques to ensure that they brought down the cost without compromising on quality, while also ensuring maximum yield and profit.

Srinath observes, “While the labour costs to maintain an acre or two of land is as high as Rs 30,000 – 40,000 a month, we had to innovate techniques and build operations at a scale to ensure the same piece of land only required a labour cost of Rs 5000 a month thus ensuring better returns for our stakeholders.”

How are their methods different from those used by traditional farmers?

Regular farms are designed by the farmers, based on years of knowledge and experience. But one cannot overlook the fact that if a farmer maintains an acre of land, his primary premise is to rely on rainwater and grow cash crops like pulses and brown rice during the monsoons. Many farmers don’t have the scope nor the resources to scale up their operations or use mechanisation for the small piece of land. Plus, the lack of insurance, marketing challenges and uncertainty of climate, only add to their woes.

With the resources and mechanisation available at their disposal, Hosachiguru follows some sustainable and mechanised practices. A classic example of this is how they dedicate a few acres of farmland and turn it into a catchment area for rainwater harvesting with contour bunds, drenches, compartment bunds, soaking pits, mounds etc.

Promotion

In 2016 alone, they were able to save a whopping 1.2 crore litres of water on a 35–acre farm during heavy rains that lasted 45 minutes. This water lasted them for seven months until the dry summers. And so, they have successfully built a system where they are not reliant on groundwater for sustenance.

Besides this, Hosachiguru also uses the method of biodiverse farming to replicate the ecosystem of natural forests with zero residue farming methods, bio-fertilisers, bio-pesticides, live mulching, intercropping, integrated pest management and the inclusion of a diverse variety of herbal plants.

“So all you have to do is own or invest in a piece of farmland, and we will manage it for you with the best agricultural practices. You don’t have to worry about the farm operations, labour, power & water availability, soil conditions, sale of produce etc. You can enjoy the true spirit of the farm by getting chemically free produce at your doorstep,” says Sriram Chitlur.

Additionally, you can also visit the land whenever you please, participate in the farm activities, enjoy the hospitality or just bask in the glory of your mini-forest!

Under its latest eco-habitat project which is spread on 16.5 acres and is an hour away from the international airport in Bengaluru, Hosachiguru is selling quarter acre farm plots.

Each of these plots will be demarcated, have road access, water supply through drip irrigation and underground pipes, access to borewell, centralised water distribution and a nursery to grow fruits and vegetable plants.

This project will also have sustainable homes built using compact stabilised earth bricks (CSEB) to serve as weekend getaways or post-retirement dream homes close to nature.

Today, Hosachiguru has over 100 customers who have bought various farmland projects, and the number is only growing. The average investment required for a project is Rs 15-18 lakh per unit. In the next 365 days, the trio envisions to add another 1,000 acres of land to expand their projects.

Today, Hosachiguru works with over 300 farm labourers living in native villages close to their farmlands spread across the three states. Many of these labourers are uneducated and come from impoverished backgrounds. But the team at Hosachiguru has helped them unlearn unscientific agricultural practices and skilled them in sustainable practices.

These farmhands (which include many landless labourers and several others with small but barren pieces of land) are not only successfully maintaining the day-to-day working of Hosachiguru’s extensive agriculture projects spread over 800 acres of land but are also replicating similar sustainable practices like maintaining biodiversity, multi-crop management, bunding etc., on their land to make it agriculturally viable.

What’s better than investing in a property that gives your life a purpose and ensures food security for your future generations besides transforming the lives of the underprivileged?

1864,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Fire burns Pantanal's upland heart and threatens nature's fragile balance - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/fire-burns-pantanals-upland-heart-and-threatens-natures-fragile-balance/,"After spreading for 9 months across the biodiverse Brazilian Pantanal wetlands, fires have reached the Amolar Mountains. This upland area is at the heart of the ecosystem and shelters traditional communities like Barra de São Lourenço.

Humans and animals, who thrive on the Pantanal’s seasonal cycle of rising and ebbing floods, now see their way of life menaced by an unprecedented wave of drought and fire.

The region’s inhabitants are already suffering from air and water contamination due to smoke and soot, and dread the fires’ aftermath. With the uplands devastated by the blazes, jaguars, other mammals and birds won’t have anywhere to flee during the next cycle of annual floods.

“For me, being a ‘pantaneira’ is loving each stick, each tree, each bird. Is feeling part of it,” says resident Leonida Aires de Souza. But now that much of this remote area has burned, the future is uncertain.

“It has been a hard day. We are in the middle of a fight against the fire in one of the most emblematic communities of [the] Pantanal. For the first time in nine months, the fire is getting close to the houses, threatening people’s lives,” André Luiz Siqueira told this journalist in a rushed Whatsapp audio recording.

The director-president of the NGO Ecoa was in Campo Grande, the capital of Mato Grosso do Sul, giving logistic support to nearly twenty firemen struggling to fight the flames in the Barra de São Lourenço community, along the Paraguai River.

At the same time, Denir Marques was rescuing his 80-year-old mother, nearly forced to drag her from her home. “The fire was close and the wind was really strong, and she didn’t want to get out. Lucky the firemen were able to save her house,” he says.

The scenes described by Siqueira and Marques happened on September 22. No one was hurt, thanks to the joint effort of volunteer firefighters who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with professional fire brigades from state and federal environmental agencies.

More than two weeks later, however, and the fires were still burning on the far side of the Paraguai River in the Amolar Mountains. According to the NGO the Man of Pantanal’s Institute (IHP), the fires were only controlled by mid-October after 90% of the area was consumed by the blazes (120.000 square kilometers or 2.9 million acres).

Eyewitness to a conflagration

The Pantanal is the world’s largest tropical wetland and it straddles the borders of Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia. Brazil contains the lion’s share of habitat, with the ecosystem spreading over Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul states, in the Brazilian central-west.

Barra de São Lourenço is at the heart of this biodiverse territory — sitting on the border of the two Brazilian states, next to Matogrossense Pantanal National Park, and just a few kilometers from the frontier with Bolívia. The village, composed of just 25 families, sits at the confluence of the Cuiabá and Paraguay rivers, a hard to access area, reachable only by a five hour boat trip from the city of Corumbá.

“Some people say we are crazy for living here, in the middle of the bush. In the flood season, there are tons of mosquitoes. But, for me, being a ‘pantaneira’ is loving each stick, each tree, each bird. Is feeling part of it,” says Leonida Aires de Souza, president of the Renascer Women’s Association and a Barra de São Lourenço resident.

This deep sense of belonging, explains Siqueira, is firmly anchored in the founding of this community. “Barra de São Lourenço is a mixture of the cultures, [coming] from the descendants of the black slaves, the Indigenous guató and the survivors of the Paraguay War. They are the traditional Pantanal’s population,” he states.

The war Siqueira refers to was the worst armed conflict in South America, fought from 1864 to 1870 between troops from Paraguay and the Triple Alliance, formed by Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The Indigenous guatós, for their turn, were among the original inhabitants of the Pantanal, along with the Bororo, Paiaguá, Guaikuru and Kayapó Indigenous groups.

Nowadays the guatós populate two Indigenous territories. One is located on Ínsua Island, a few kilometers from Barra de São Lourenço, and was not harmed by the fire. The other Indigenous reserve is the Baía dos Guató, around 200 kilometers away from there, and it had almost its entire area destroyed by this year’s fire.

“My grandmother was a guató,” says resident Denir Marques, proudly. Amid the mix of cultures, some Indigenous traditions remain strong in São Lourenço, including a handcraft in which an aquatic plant called aguapé is braided into beautiful baskets and hats. That art, along with fish and shellfish, is sold to tourists who come from Corumbá and travel up River Paraguai. In the dry season, the people plant watermelon, corn and cassava. During the flood time, they use a technique, called jirau, to increase the height of their houses with timber structures in order to escape the rising water. Now everyone wonders how the aftermath of the fires will impact these livelihoods and activities.

People and jaguars, in tune with the seasons

In the Pantanal, everyone follows the rhythmic seasonal cycle of floods (occurring from April to June) and their ebb (happening from July to December).

At the same time of year that the São Lourenço village dwellers elevate their houses, the animals from the National Park move from the wet bottomlands to the higher ground of the Amolar Mountains.

“Ninety percent of the national park is formed by lowlands that flood in the rainy season. So they [the wildlife] go to the mountains. When it gets drier, they come back to the park. It all works in a very balanced way. That is why the Amolar Mountains and the national park are both considered a natural heritage of humanity,” says Letícia Larcher, who has a doctorate in Ecology. According to the Mato Grosso Fire Department Command, 19.600 hectares (48.432 acres) have already been burnt in the national park, which represents 14% of its territory.

Big, far roaming mammals, especially jaguars (Panthera onca), are the most likely to move from one locale to the other. As a result, the Amolar Mountains possess the world’s second highest P. onca density; in one particular mountainous area, there are an average of ten jaguars per 100 square kilometers (38.6 square miles). Porto Jofre, 100 kilometers (62 miles) to the northeast, boasts the highest density anywhere, with 12.3 jaguars for each 100 km².

“Fortunately, we didn’t find any dead jaguars so far. They may have run to the protected areas of the Bolivian Chaco,” suggests Larcher, the technical coordinator from IHP, the institute that manages the four Private Natural Heritage Reserves (RPPNs) that protect the Amolar Mountains — all the RPPNs were hit by the fire.

Besides the jaguar, the Amolar Mountains are home to other mammals under threat of extinction, like the Brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris), the queixada (Tayassu pecari, a species of pig), the tamanduá-bandeira (Myrmecophaga tridactyla, an anteater species), the tatu-canastra (Priodontes Maximus, a type of armadillo), and the ariranha (Pteronura brasiliensis, from the otter subfamily), along with the mutum de penacho (Crax fasciolata, a bird species). Of these animals the ariranha, or giant otter, is the most at risk, receiving an Endangered listing from the IUCN.

Climate change worsens fires?

Over recent weeks, about fifty men have struggled to curb the area’s blazes. But propelled by high winds, the flames were so strong they could “jump” over 40-meter (130-feet) wide containment lines — areas intentionally burned over by firefighters to deny the fires fuel to feed on.

“I am 53 years old and I was born here. I have seen huge droughts, but I had never seen a fire with such intensity,” says Leonida Aires de Souza. “It is the first time since 1974 that we don’t have a flood,” adds Marques.

According to biologist Débora Calheiros, annual rains have been below average regionally since 2010 — with 2019 and 2020 especially dry. In her view, the Pantanal may already be feeling the impacts of global warming.

“In this part of Brazil, climate change tends to let the weather [get] drier, with poorly distributed rains. In the face of it, the federal government should be working on prevention. But it is doing exactly the opposite. It has dismantled the [nation’s] environmental policy and even extinguished the Secretary of Climate Change and Forests,” notes researcher Calheiros, who has been studying Pantanal river and flood ecology for 30 years.

Larcher suggests that the unprecedented Brazilian fires result from the government’s failure to police environmental crimes across the nation, especially in the Amazon rainforest and Cerrado savanna; the Pantanal wetlands are a transitional zone between those two biomes. “The Amazon deforestation decreases the amount of rain that reaches Pantanal. And there are areas of the Cerrado, which shelter the headwaters of the main Pantanal rivers, which are totally devastated. Everything is interconnected,” Larcher points out.

Add to all these complex problems the reckless and even criminal actions of landgrabbers, irresponsible ranchers and farmers — who reportedly have set many Pantanal fires — and Brazil is looking at a formula for disaster, and one that may intensify in future.

“Everyone knows that since 2019 it has not been raining, [but still] people are setting fires to renew their pastures. Even with the [Bolsonaro government] decree forbidding it. It is a crime,” says Ecoa’s Siqueira.

In Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, ranchers often burn degraded pastures to renew grasses and reduce insect pests. But the burning for agricultural purposes is permitted only during the rainy season, and only with authorization from the State Secretariat for the Environment. In July, 2020, as a result of international pressure, the ban on fires was reinforced by a federal decree and moratorium on burning across the Pantanal and Amazon for 120 days.

That ban, however, didn’t have any practical effect. From July to September, Pantanal fires increased by 210%, soaring from 5,071 hotspots in 2019 to 15,725 hotspots in 2020, according to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Estimates are that over 3.3 million hectares (8.1 million acres) of Pantanal have gone up in flames so far this year. That’s about 22% of the entire region, and approximately six and a half times the size of Grand Canyon National Park. Reports show that most of the fires originated on private property.

Fire threatens future health

Even when such widespread and devastating fires end, their effects may be felt for a long time afterward by people and wildlife. Resident Denir Marques, for example, still recalls how he felt while battling the flames in his community. “We spent days and nights fighting. Those who couldn’t stand anymore would lay down on the river shore to take some rest. I felt ill, with a headache, because the smoke was too strong.”

A study by a Federal University of Alagoas laboratory found that the air in Cuaibá, Mato Grosso’s capital, reached carbon monoxide concentrations 15 times more than what’s acceptable to human health.

“This area of Barra de São Lourenço became the epicenter of the fires, so the smoke stationed there for more than sixty days. They [Firefighters and residents] couldn’t see 100 meters ahead. No one knows the effects of it on their health, especially during a pandemic, in a community that has always been forgotten by the governments and that has precarious access to the health system,” worries Siqueira.

Air quality isn’t the only concern. According to researcher Calheiros, regional water may soon be undrinkable. Excess organic matter, infused in the ashes, speeds the proliferation of bacteria harmful to human health. “When the rains start, probably at the end of October, [conditions] will get worse as more ash will be drained into the lakes and little rivers, and then to the major ones. The governments have to act with urgency to deliver drinkable water and chlorine to those [impacted] communities.”

According to Calheiros, water contamination may also prompt fish mortality. That would aggravate the crises that began in March, as the coronavirus suffocated outback tourism. Barra de São Lourenço’s people make most of their living from selling fish, shellfish and handicrafts to community visitors. Now, of the 17 participants in the Renascer Women’s Association, only four continue working with handcrafts. “We are trying to recuperate the association so our colleagues may live from our work again, from our handcraft. That is our way of living, it is inherited from our ancestral guatós,” says Leonida Aires de Souza.

The same future uncertainty applies to wildlife. Animals not killed outright by the blazes will have to survive in denuded inhospitable habitat, with potentially poisoned waters.

“The fire burned everything, from plants to the colonies of ants and termites. Even if the plants turn green again with the rains, [too] many [habitat] pieces will be missing to have a balanced environment. We still don’t know what is going to happen with these animals, because we don’t have any study that evaluates the impacts of a fire of such dimension,” Larcher concludes.

Three months after Kasese District was hit by floods that, among others, destroyed roads, schools and health centres, authorities are faced with humanitarian challenges.

More than 10,000 people were displaced by the floods and some primary schools, which include Bulembia and Kyanjuki, were submerged. Kilembe Hospital was also submerged while roads and bridges were damaged.

The May floods hit the district after five rivers burst their banks following days of torrential rains. Government then delivered some relief items to support the displaced persons and promised more interventions, which are yet to be fulfilled.

As a result, several people are living in camps where they are facing serious health, financial and sanitation challenges.

Daily Monitor at the weekend Kanyangeya, Nkaiga and Kiraro primary schools that are host to thousands of displaced families.

Kilembe Mines Hospital was immensely affected by the floods and was later relocated to Kasese Town where it is hosted by Kasese Catholic Diocese. This has denied residents of Kilembe the much needed health services. They now have to trek long distances in search of better health services.

Mr Deogratius Isemamba, the chairperson of Namuhuga Ward in Bulembia Division, Kasese Municipality, said close to 100 families are camped at Kanyangeya Primary School, which is congested while pregnant mothers struggle to access health facilities due to the impassable roads that were affected by the floods.",2020-08-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['health', 'primary', 'kanyangeya', 'submerged', 'grapples', 'kilembe', 'kasese', 'displaced', 'floods', 'uganda', 'issues', 'roads', 'sanitation', 'schools']",Uganda,news article,English

Respective National Societies, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), are working to respond to each of these disasters through different means. Some have Disaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREFs) or Emergency Appeals (EAs) launched, and others may require additional support in the future.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger  Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder  with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in NDjamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

In West Coast, Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Ghana have also experienced flooding throughout August-September 2020.",2020-09-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['affected', 'chad', 'sudan', 'flooding', '06', 'bulletin', '2020', 'floods', 'states', 'displaced', 'multiple', 'rains', 'information', 'niger', 'disasters', 'countries', 'africa']",Nigeria,news article,English
696,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Rise in Political Propaganda Is Disturbing - Youth Activist - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907160470.html,"Youth activist and entrepreneur, Nafis Quaye has bemoaned the overreliance on propaganda by political party aficionados as a major contributor to the unhealthy political discourse between parties in the country.

He maintained that ""if care is not taken, the canker of propaganda as being used by opposition political parties, can tear this country apart and cause mayhem, hence causing division among the citizenry.

""Despite differences in political ideologies, politicians and party commentators must strive to elevate discussions and issues to reflect situations on the ground rather than always resorting to unverifiable lies in order to convince sympathisers,"" Mr Quaye stressed.

Sharing his experience on the recent kidnapping incidence of the two Canadians, he lamented that the occurrence affected his business and indicated that ""during that period, I was supposed to come to Ghana from the U.S, with 25 young American citizens who wanted to explore the business environment in Ghana.

""It was rather unfortunate that some politicians mainly from the opposition painted the country in bad light on the internet and most of these students, refused to embark on the trip upon reading those articles, only six students, who were bold enough traveled here,"" he noted.

Another incident he mentioned, was the latest allegation that President Nana Akufo-Addo's daughter, Ms Gyankroma Akufo-Addo, was contracted to airlift the Black Stars Supporters Union to Egypt for the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations and, as a result, bagged US$2.4 million.

Later, a statement from the Youth and Sports Ministry, signed by the sector minister, Isaac Asiamah, denied the claim that Ms Akufo-Addo was in charge of feeding and sheltering the 120 supporters, each of whose travel expenses for the whole AFCON season amounted to US$20,000.

Mr Quaye insisted that ""the claim has resulted in damages and dented the image of the first family as publications have gone wide on various social media platforms on the incident which was not true.

""Going forward, I believe we must learn to do things right, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) party communicators must be quick to respond to such an allegation and make sure it doesn't attract global or national attention.

671,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Watermelons rotting due to lack of market - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9127460/watermelons-rotting-due-to-lack-of-market/,"Large quantities of watermelons are rotting away in the north-eastern regions of Ghana due to a lack of storage facilities and access to ready markets. A number of farmers in the region who were hopeful of cashing on the bumper harvest of this year’s crop season are now counting their losses. Prices for the fruit have gone down in recent times in the area. A large size of the fruit used to sell at GH¢10, now goes for as low as GH¢2 at the farm gate. Even at that price, some of the farmers are unable to attract buyers, leaving the fruits to rot on the farms.

A visit to the area by reporters last week revealed heaps of the watermelon meant to attract buyers along the Nalerigu/Bunkpurugu road but which rotting, while other farmers gave out the fruits to commuters for free.

A farmer at Buguya in the West Mamprusi municipality who cultivated about five acres of watermelon but could not get buyers, said: “…I have not been able to recoup the money I invested, and even though I had a bumper harvest, there are no buyers”

Another farmer at Sakogu in the East Mamprusi municipality claimed that all his investment including money for ploughing and purchasing of chemicals, had gone to waste.

Reacting to the development, the East Mamprusi Municipal Director of Agriculture, Zakaria Hamidu expressed worry over the situation and said large quantities of watermelon went waste each season as a result of the lack of a ready market and storage facilities in the area: “During one of our meetings with stakeholders, we looked at crops that can feed a factory and watermelons came up, but the meeting realized that watermelon is seasonal and if you establish a factory, it means that the factory will have to close down in the off-season.”

The Slovak foreign ministry said there was one Slovak victim, and that the only Slovak national on the passenger list was Pavol Demitra, a Slovak forward who led the national side at last year's world Championship.

Rachunek, who turned 32 in August, played for Ottawa Senators for three years starting in 1997, and later for New York Rangers and New Jersey Devils. He scored an equaliser against Sweden seven seconds from time in the 2010 world championship semi-finals which the Czechs eventually won.

Marek, 31, had become a popular forward in the KHL, playing initially for Magnitogorsk before joining Yaroslavl.

Vasicek won the Stanley Cup with Carolina Hurricanes in 2006, and scored the final goal in the Czech Republic's 3-0 win against Canada in the world championship final in 2005.

Swedish ice hockey player Stefan Liv was also among the 43 perished hockey players on Wednesday, the Swedish Embassy in Moscow confirmed to news agency TT.

The 30-year-old national team goalkeeper, an Olympic and world champion in 2006, was killed along with many of his team mates when the plane came down shortly after taking off for a flight to Belarussian capital Minsk. Two passengers survived but were in a grave condition.

""We are in mourning, and our thoughts are with those close to him and his relatives,"" Swedish Hockey Association chairman Christer Englund said in a statement on the association's website (www.svenskhockey.se).

Liv, who was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings in 2000, played 133 times for Sweden. He also won three Swedish championships with former club HV71.",2011-09-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['killed', 'swedish', 'czech', 'moscow', 'intl', 'national', 'team', 'plane', 'ice', 'slovak', 'world', 'great', 'hockey', 'crash', 'victims']",China,news article,English
1270,FL-2020-000164-IND,Global Economic Recovery must Prioritise Restructuring of Debt for Developing Countries - Inter Press Service,http://www.ipsnews.net/2020/07/global-economic-recovery-must-prioritise-restructuring-of-debt-for-developing-countries/,"Global Economic Recovery must Prioritise Restructuring of Debt for Developing Countries

UNITED NATIONS, Jul 2 2020 (IPS) - Unless there is a restructuring of debt for developing countries, the servicing for this debt will take away valuable resources from these nations that are needed to prevent the further suffering of people during the coronavirus pandemic — particularly with regards to safeguarding the health systems, and protecting the “integrity and resilience of economies”.

This is according to Bogolo Joy Kenewendo, former minister of trade of Botswana, who was speaking to IPS on Wednesday, Jul. 1, after a roundtable discussion at the United Nations over the post-lockdown economy.

In order to prevent economies of developing countries from suffering disproportionately under the current pandemic, it’s crucial that there’s less protectionist thinking and that developed countries approach the economic downturn through means that empower developing countries, said Kenewendo, who is also a former member of the U.N. secretary-general’s high level digital cooperation panel.

“What’s important is that we have debt freeze and restructuring immediately, particularly for the developing countries because our resources are currently on so much pressure with the demand for social welfare to be extended, subsidies to be extended and then having some infrastructure needing to be put in place and paying interest on loans’.

“[This is] really putting a lot of pressure on the fiscal positions of many developing countries,” she told IPS.

At the roundtable titled “Rebirthing the Global Economy to deliver Sustainable Development”, numerous distinguished female leaders spoke on the issue, reiterating solutions that focused on how to accommodate the needs of developing countries.

Vera Songwe, executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, shared an incisive analysis on the importance of removing intermediary parties from trade exchanges during the discussion.

She stated that one of United States tech company, Apple’s, main imports is cotton. However, 80 percent of cotton imports are from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is in a debt crisis.

“The DRC sells cotton at $40 – $80, [but] on the market cotton goes for $400,” she said, adding that one priority for the next steps should be to brainstorm ways in which intermediation can be reduced.

“My posit for trade and the new trade environment is that we do everything we can to take away every intermediary that exists between the original product and the end product,” she said.

Kate Raworth, the senior visiting research associate at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute, brought up the “ecological debt” that high-income countries owe to low-income countries.

She said this kind of debt is much longer term, claiming that advanced regions such as Europe and countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, U.S. and Japan are living “beyond planetary impact”.

“We are destroying the climate system, we are destroying the ecological system, and that is the debt we owe to the lowest income countries of the world because we are undermining all prospects of development for them,” she said in an impassioned speech.

“They will have no fertile soils, no monsoon rains, no stable climate and they will have no capacity to develop.”

Kenewendo told IPS that this is also a matter of the “capital flight” to developed countries that takes place during a crisis.

“The real issue is that there’s a lot of [foreign direct investment] FDI that has been attracted to developing countries and emerging markets,” she said.

“And when there is such a crisis, you find this capital flight back to developed countries or to the west.”

This, she said, means the manufacturing income that developing economies had expected earnings from will suddenly be redirected to developed countries.

“And it’s mainly because during a crisis, people look at the political and economic stability of economies and it might be found that in Africa, for example, our political instability becomes a problem,” Kenewendo said.

These kinds of protectionist policies can really harm low-income or developing countries, and thus advocates suggest that not taking a “beggar thy neighbour” approach that only makes it less efficient.

“Those kind of ‘inward-looking’ policies make the situation more difficult for everybody and they deepen and prolong the crisis for the global economy,” Kenewendo said, adding that it’s crucial that free flow of capital is maintained and a trading relation is established rather than an aid-based relation.

She further noted the importance of digitalisation that the pandemic has highlighted and said it has a massive role to play in our economies going forward.

“Digitalisation is not all about being online, but it’s also about using the mobile technology resources that exist in order to ensure a much broader level of inclusivity in its delivery,” she said.

Citing Songwe’s example, Kenewendo said that in the conversation about reform, it’s key to ensure that “we are incentivising and stimulating investment”.

“It’s very important that we provide capacity for countries to tap into domestic capital and to also make sure that we’re safeguarding [small and medium-sized enterprises] SMEs and the resiliency of the informal sector,” she said.",2020-07-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['kenewendo', 'developing', 'economies', 'economic', 'recovery', 'developed', 'prioritise', 'debt', 'capital', 'restructuring', 'countries', 'cotton', 'global', 'trade']",India,news article,English
1662,FL-2017-000155-VNM,United States announces additional humanitarian assistance in response to flooding in Vietnam - Viet Nam - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-assistance-response-flooding-vietnam,"Friday, October 30, 2020

Office of Press Relations

press@usaid.gov

Today, while in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced the United States is providing an additional $2 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to Typhoon Molave and the ongoing severe flooding that has affected Central Vietnam since early October. This amount brings the total humanitarian assistance from the U.S. Government for people touched by the floods to $2.1 million.

With this new funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is ramping up efforts to meet emergency needs in communities affected by Vietnams historic typhoon season. Typhoon Molave, which made landfall in Central Vietnam on October 28, 2020, is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. Typhoon Molave follows weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1.5 million people and killed more than 130.

In response, USAIDs partners, including the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC), are addressing the immediate needs of the affected families for food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Because the floods have washed away livestock, farms, and infrastructure, USAIDs partners also will provide assistance to these families as they begin to restore their livelihoods.

This assistance builds on USAIDs long-term investments in Vietnam to reduce the risk and impact of disasters. With funding from USAID, for example, the VNRC has been on the front lines in responding to the impact of severe weather throughout this typhoon season.

The United States stands with the people of Vietnam during this difficult time.

1056,FL-2019-000084-IND,Air Pollution and Assam Floods - Scoop.co.nz,https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1909/S00064/air-pollution-and-assam-floods.htm,"Air Pollution and Assam Floods

The North-eastern Indian state of Assam is naturally the most flood-prone state of the country as the monsoon winds blowing from Bay of Bengal hits the sub-Himalayan hills of Arunachal Pradesh to its north lashing the plains with heavy precipitation during the summer. According to the Rastriya Barh Ayog (RBA)—the National Flood Commission, 31.05 lakh hectares of the total 78.523 lakh hectares area of the state is prone to frequent floods. Secondly, the Brahmaputra—the lifeline of the state originates from a glacier at Tibet that carry additional amount of water due to snow-melt in the summer makes the entire valley flooded. There are reasons for the annual havoc of flood and river bank erosion affecting Assam annually, but one more phenomenon has been troubling the region. This is the increasing air pollution felt in the area in last few years.

The Brahmaputra factor:

The incessant rainfall during the monsoon and the very nature of the river Brahmaputra which is very dynamic as well as unstable at the same time are at the crux of the problem of flood in Assam. On its 580,000 sq km basin spreading over four countries—China, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, with diverse environments, the Brahmaputra features among the world’s top five rivers in terms of discharge as well as the sediment it brings. At 19,830 cubic meters per second (cumec), it ranks fourth in discharge at the mouth, behind only the Amazon, the Congo and the Yangtze (Goswami, 2008).

By the time the river enters Assam it deposits vast amounts of this silt, leading to erosion and floods in the plains surrounded by hills. The Brahmaputra losses its velocity suddenly as it falls to a flat plain from a high slope making it to unload the sediments. The river’s channels prove inadequate amid this siltation, leading to floods. The massive earthquake of 1950 left the river to acquire a stable character rising its bed up considerably (highest two meters in Dibrugarh).

Moreover man-made factors like habitation, deforestation, population growth in catchment areas (including in China) have led to higher sedimentation creating temporary sandbars or river islands (locally called Chars) where people have been settling in in the last five decades or so. The sand bars or Chars restrict the space the river has to flow. As rainfall becomes heavy, it combines with all these factors and leads to destructive floods—annually.

Air pollution may be behind intense rainfall:

Research conducted by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur found a link between air pollution and intense rainfall recently. Analysing long-term satellite data between 2002 and 2016 and modelling to understand the association between aerosols and cloud properties, the study found that air pollution particles lead to change in the physical properties of monsoon clouds, which can lead to more intense rainfall, flash floods and unusual gaps in the progression of monsoon rainfall (Nature). “Not all extreme rain events can be linked to aerosols as other meteorological factors also play a role, but cases of extreme and erratic monsoon rainfall in inland areas affected by air pollution may be linked to this phenomenon,” says the study.

Aerosols, particularly black carbon and dust particles, induce “cloud invigoration”, which means cloud cover and thickness increases because of reduction in the size of cloud droplets and other structural modifications during cloud formation. Enhanced cloudiness reflects more sunlight back to space, leading to a cooling effect of the clouds’ surface. Apart from cooling, air pollution-induced cloud properties can also be linked to intense rainfall. It also facilitates thunderstorm-type clouds that have an umbrella type structure. This umbrella structure stops solar radiation and creates cooling, which causes a delay in the arrival of the next thunderstorm. This leads to episodes of intense rain followed by breaks in progression, the study say. Aerosols, whose main sources are fossil and bio-fuels combustion from residential and industrial sector, biomass burning absorb solar radiation, such as soot, cause these disturbances.

Air Pollution Makes Floods Worse

Air pollution can affects health and the World Health Organization estimates that it caused 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 alone. But now another recent study shows that air pollution can trigger floods as well. In July 2013, heavy rainfall resulted in a catastrophic flood in Sichuan Basin, a mountainous area of China. Nearly 2.5 feet of rain fell in just five days which led to the findings that air quality played a role in the valley’s disaster. It was found that in some geographic regions, aerosols absorb heat from the sun, suppressing the chance of rain during the day and stabilizing the atmosphere. At night the warmed, rising air is transported to mountainous areas before it heads higher up into the atmosphere. This causes massive precipitation that can actually make flooding worse (Fan, J., et al. (2015).

Air pollution from soot and aerosol emissions is also making cyclones over the Middle East and South Asia more destructive. Natural differences in wind speed and direction over different heights in the atmosphere, known as 'wind shear', normally keep cyclones in check—effectively tearing the storms apart before they reach a certain size. But emissions from sources such as biomass burning and diesel vehicles have interfered with wind patterns, reducing wind shear and enabling cyclones to grow twice as intense, according to a study published in Nature last week (3 November). Cyclones that occurred between 1997 and 2010 were up to three times more intense than those between 1979 and 1996. It may be recalled that five of the strongest storms during the period occurred after 1998. Aerosol emissions in the region have also grown six-fold since the 1930s, creating a three kilometre-thick layer of pollution over the Indian Ocean, known as the South Asian atmospheric brown cloud, which absorbs sunlight, causing the ocean to cool and affecting wind circulation.

Air Pollution and flood in Assam:

According to a report by Pollution Control Board of Assam (PCBA) in 2015, Guwahati has one of the highest Black Carbon pollution levels in the world. The city’s PM2.5 concentration is more than eight times the WHO standards. Transport and dust are the primary contributors. It is due to the rapid urbanization and poor environment quality control in Guwahati which is giving rise to such high Black Carbon levels. Though Assam does not have heavy industries the entire state is moderately polluted in air. On July 21, 2019, leading doctors of Assam and other North-Eastern States join the movement for launch of Doctors for Clean Air—a campaign for raise awareness about the increasing air pollution and its health impacts in the region. Besides health risks, air pollution is the likely cause of abnormal monsoon and heavy rains and thunderstorms compounding the already existing flood problem of Assam.

In May this year, ahead of the onset of the monsoon at least 23 people lost their lives in storms and lightning strikes. The worst-hit districts are Golaghat, Sivasagar, Dhubri, Sontipur and Cachar. The two natural disasters have also affected around 22,801 families in 18 districts of the state in the current year (Assam State Disaster Management Authority-ASDMA). In May 11, 2018 eight people were killed and several others injured in lightning strikes and thunderstorms in the state. That time two people died in Karbi Anglong district and six others died in lower Assam’s Kamrup, Barpeta and Kokrajhar districts (ASDMA). According to ASDMA Project Officer Kripal Jyoti Mazumdar 64 people died due to lightning and storms till May that year. The spate of severe thunderstorms in these two early summers may be attributable to such aerosol-induced changes as found by IIT-Kanpur’s study and those in Sichuan Basin, China.

Pollutants reduction for flood mitigation:

The studies on atmospheric simulations in Sichuan Basin show that if current industrial emissions are reduced to a level before the China’s economic boom, less precipitation (up to 60% lower) could be predicted. This is due to weakening of the “aerosol-enhanced conditional instability” mechanism. This suggests that air pollutants reduction can effectively mitigated floods in that area. This discovery is also called “aerosol-enhanced conditional instability,” and its flipside is that reducing pollution in places like Sichuan can actually reduce floods. As pollution particles worsen flooding, it could help future weather forecasters predict floods.

In Guwahati industrial emission contributes only 5.29% of PM2.5 concentration in the air. The major contributor has been the transport (36.5%) and dust (27%). To reduce the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere vehicular emissions require a considerable control. A new and effective vehicle policy is very essential to mitigate the increased threat from flood caused by air pollution. Green technology in the transport sector, mostly the adoption of electric vehicles should be seriously considered to control the aerosol induced precipitation but also to make Assam a climate resilient state. Opting to public transport from private vehicles and shifting of public transport to electric power from fossil fuel could contribute effectively in achieving the desired goals to mitigate flood and climate change.

American and Egyptian archaeologists have unearthed what could be the oldest known beer factory at one of the most prominent archaeological sites of ancient Egypt, a top antiquities official said Saturday.

Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the factory was found in Abydos, an ancient burial ground located in the desert west of the Nile River, over 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of Cairo.

He said the factory apparently dates back to the region of King Narmer, who is widely known for his unification of ancient Egypt at the beginning of the First Dynastic Period (3150 B.C.- 2613 B.C.).

Archaeologists found eight huge units — each is 20 meters (about 65 feet) long and 2.5 meters (about 8 feet) wide. Each unit includes some 40 pottery basins in two rows, which had been used to heat up a mixture of grains and water to produce beer, Waziri said.

The joint mission is co-chaired by Dr. Matthew Adams of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, and Deborah Vischak, assistant professor of ancient Egyptian art history and archaeology at Princeton University.

Adams said the factory was apparently built in this area to provide royal rituals with beer, given that archaeologists found evidences showing the use of beer in sacrificial rites of ancient Egyptians.

British archaeologists were the first to mention the existence of that factory early 1900s, but they couldn't determine its location, the antiquities ministry said.

With its vast cemeteries and temples from the earliest times of ancient Egypt, Abydos was known for monuments honoring Osiris, ancient Egypt's god of underworld and the deity responsible for judging souls in the afterlife.

The necropolis had been used in every period of early Egyptian history, from the prehistoric age to Roman times.

ISLAMABAD: Incessant rains lashed Pakistan on Tuesday, killing 13 more people while the water level increased in the rivers across the country, creating a flood like situation.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported widespread rains across the country while the Met Office forecast showed more downpour in the next 24 hours.

The NDMA data showed that 13 more people died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 176 since June 15 when the monsoon season started in the country.

Another 101 have been injured.

So far 72 people have been killed in Sindh, 48 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 19 in Balochistan, 16 in Punjab, 11 in Gilgit-Baltistan region and 10 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to the NDMA data.

The NDMA reported that 1,307 houses were fully damaged due to rains, floods and landslides while another 853 were partially damaged.

The rescue and relief activities were going on and the Army troops were helping the civilian administration.

Due to the unremitting rain for the past several days, water swelled in rivers, creating a low flood like situation.

""River Indus at Taunsa is in medium flood level. River Indus at Guddu Sukkur and River Chenab at Trimmu are in low flood level. All other major rivers are at below low flood level,"" reported the NDMA.

The situation in Karachi remained volatile as the mega city of over 20 million people faced the worst urban flooding in its recent history.

TV footage showed all major areas inundated and efforts have been going on to pump the water out of low-lying areas.

Several posh areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton also could not escape flooding.

The Army and civil administration are working to restore the civic network.

The Meteorological Office of the country in its forecast warned of more rains.

""Widespread thunderstorm/rain with heavy to very heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Kabul and Indus along with Peshawar and Rawalpindi divisions,"" it said.

""Scattered wind-thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy fall is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej,"" it said, adding that rain was also expected in Bannu, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan administrative divisions.

However, on the positive note, the Met Office said that the ""rainfall activity is likely to decrease significantly from 5 September"".

Extreme weather has caused extensive flooding across New South Wales following days of sustained rain and reports are now emerging of ground-dwelling animals such as echidnas and wombats being trapped underground or being hit by cars when moving to higher ground. Situated at Australia's eastern-most point, the vet team is seeing increasing caseloads of native wildlife presenting with injuries from the floods. The not for profit veterinary organization is advising the public to be alert to the perils facing wildlife as recovery and cleanup efforts get underway. (James D. Morgan/Getty Images)

The heavy flooding across New South Wales in Australia have forced thousands of evacuations and affected hundreds of homes and businesses, as well as roads and bridges, but one team is tending to a different group of victims: the animals rescued from the floodwaters.

Byron Bay Mobile Wildlife Hospital is working to heal animals found injured on the ground during the extreme weather event. Some have been affected directly by the flood, while others have been hit by cars while trying to move to higher ground.

From echidnas to cockatoos to bats, the team is doing what they can to return the native animals to health, administering oxygen and injections and treating injuries.

Byron Bay Mobile Wildlife Hospital launched in November as a nonprofit that aims to treat threatened and injured animals in response to Australia's bushfires. When heavy rain caused flooding this week in New South Wales, the hospital was quick to respond.

Advertisement In a Facebook post, the wildlife hospital urged locals to be vigilant for injured or traumatized wildlife, but warned people not to put themselves in danger to attempt an animal rescue. The hospital's website advises people call local animal rescue groups if an injured animal is found.

1580,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"Poor planning, poor governance, poor monitoring flood Karachi - Pakistan - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1577236,"It is the same mess in all cities of South Asia.

It does not always rain in Karachi during the monsoon. When it does, it floods. It was worse this year, with a three-day spell of heavy rainfall in late August leading to least 47 deaths due to drowning, electrocution, as well as house and wall collapses. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared calamity affected. Personnel from the armed forces have been called out to rescue stranded people, distribute food and medical aid.

Many parts of Karachi went without electricity for 50 hours, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to ask, What kind of service is this?. Internet and cell phone networks were disrupted all over Pakistans largest city.

Women, children and the elderly waded through waist-deep sewage to reach rescue boats as rain continued to pelt down; the boats had to navigate around floating furniture, submerged cars, motorcycles, and even shipping crates pushed around by the force of the floodwater.

The meteorological department totalled August rainfall in Karachi at 484 mm (19 inches), with the highest daily rainfall of 130 mm at PAF Faisal Base on August 28.

Last year, through the three monsoon months, the PAF Faisal Base recorded a total of 345 mm of rains; this year in just two months, over 600 mm rain has been recorded there, Sardar Sarfaraz, the Pakistan Meteorological Departments Karachi head told The Third Pole.

The rains are unprecedented; and in all likelihood, this seems like an erratic event, with the last such intense rain recorded in 1931, said Sarfaraz. I cannot say with finality that this rainfall can definitively be attributed to climate change.

Due to the effect of global warming on the hydrological cycle, we will see a continued intensification of monsoons in the coming years, predicted climate expert Imran Khalid, who heads the Environment and Climate Change section of the Islamabad-based Sustainable Development Policy Institute.

Where will the water go?

Khalid wondered, though, if Karachi would have been any better off if there was no climate change? According to him, Karachis woes have their roots in poor governance and planning.

By encroaching and blocking the streams that form the natural watershed, over many decades, the authorities have set us up to fail, he pointed out, terming the flood footage on television a manifestation of decades of apathy and ignorance about the laws of nature.

If you block the flow of water, it will go around you; if it cant go around you, it will continue to rise until it envelopes you. The crises were of our own making, Khalid added, emphasising the need to incorporate laws of nature into urban planning.

Karachi has over 550 big and small storm water drains. But over the years, some as wide as 200 feet have narrowed down to just 30 feet today, due to unauthorised construction, admitted Karachis outgoing mayor Waseem Akhtar, head of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). As he left office on August 30, he said, Karachi is for everyone but nobody is for Karachi.

Going about town to inspect the damage, Chief Minister Shah chided people for building houses in the belly of the Malir river, according to media reports. The entire city is sinking because of your encroachments, he reportedly said.

Noman Ahmed, dean of Architecture and Management Sciences department at Karachis NED University, said some encroachments happened in connivance with different government agencies, while some were organic.

For example, the encroachments on Gujjar Nala was facilitated by the KMC functionaries by providing inappropriate leases, on its edges, in areas that were not supposed to be inhabited in the first place.

The alignment of the nalas [drains] have clearly been demarcated in all land use plans available with the different civic agencies, said Ahmed, and therefore selling plots of land was nothing less than a criminal act.

He would not blame those who had bought the plots. Ahmed felt people had started building on the dry bed of Gujjar Nala because for decades there was nothing more than a thin stream. They occupied the land without knowing how vulnerable they were to sudden inundation, and this is what happened in recent rains.

Architect and heritage consultant Marvi Mazhar also termed unplanned and unregulated growth, lack of monitoring and corruption as major reasons for the havoc the rains wrought on the city of 16 million that had been heavily concretised, with not enough soft ground left for water to be absorbed.

The problem has persisted despite court judgments, including an order from the countrys chief justice that all illegal construction be removed from Karachi  whether on or off the drains.

Terming removal of encroachments a very tricky affair, Ahmed said very often debris left behind by a demolition crew caused more obstruction to water flow than the original buildings had done.

What is to be done?

These drains can actually be added into beautification plans with plantations on either side, and run across the city like in Amsterdam, said Mazhar. Instead, she said, they are seen and treated as an eyesore with garbage thrown alongside them, which invariably slips into the drain thereby choking it. She held both residents and the government responsible for the indifference shown towards Karachis garbage.

Now Prime Minister Imran Khan has said he wants a permanent solution to problems associated with drains, the sewage system and water supply.

Ahmed said the government should come up with a comprehensive policy for not just all the drains but other waterways and spaces where water accumulates. Just working on a piecemeal basis will not get the desired results.

He also pointed out that those evicted in this process must be rehabilitated. The Sindh government has ample land in Karachis suburbs. If done in a step by step manner, not everyone will need to be evicted at one go or at least till the re-demarcation of the nalas takes place.

Many residents feel the collapse of municipal services and consequent problems such as the recent flooding is because Karachi has become too unwieldy to be governed. With 19 different land-owning agencies under the three tiers of government  the city government in the hands of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, the provincial government of Pakistan Peoples Party that holds the purse strings and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf at the centre  the citys problems only get bounced around and the blame game continues.

Same situation all over South Asia

Substitute the names of the rivers, drains and political parties, and the same story is repeated in varying degrees across all the cities of South Asia  Rawalpindi, Mumbai, Delhi, Patna, Kolkata, Dhaka and on and on. For years, residents have been resigned to the mess and vented their ire on social media. Now they have started coming out on the streets  it happened in Kolkata after weeklong power failures in some suburbs following Cyclone Amphan; and it is happening in Karachi now. Perhaps the fact that the hardships have now spread from slums to tony neighbourhoods has something to do with it. The internet is back now, and the phones are working, but the protests continue. Their effect remains to be seen.

But at the ancient temple of Kom Ombo, 400 miles south of Cairo, where archaeologists recently unearthed a stack of decaying mummies, peril takes a more prosaic form: waterlogged foundations.

Decades of flood irrigation in the surrounding fields, which were once desert, have soaked the soil beneath the temple. Water has penetrated the sandstone foundations, combining with salt and heat to scrub some hieroglyphs from the temple walls. The symbols and figures, effectively the lines of an ancient story, are fading to dust.

The solution, according to engineers on a $9 million American-financed project, is some modern drainage. Since October 2017, dozens of laborers have been digging a 30-foot-deep trench around the temple walls in an effort to drain the groundwater and divert it back into the Nile.",2018-09-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['newest', 'egypt', 'bad', 'temple', 'water', 'waterlogged', 'valley', 'walls', 'kom', 'ombo', 'mummy', 'drainage', 'curse', 'ancient', 'unearthed']",Egypt,news article,English

In the next few days, the central region should be prepared for another typhoon, Linfa, which will bring more rains and result in more flooding, state broadcaster Vietnam Television (VTV) reported.

Footage broadcast by VTV showed fishermen being rescued by coastguard and helicopters as strong winds battered the central Vietnamese coast in the central province of Quang Tri.

Floods have cut food supplies to thousands of people. Around 31,000 people have been displaced and more than 33,000 houses submerged and damaged by floods, according to a government report.

1701,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Vietnam suffers through a new normal of extreme weather events - WSWS,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/28/viet-o28.html,"Vietnam is being pummelled by ongoing tropical storms causing major flooding and landslides in its central regions. As of Monday morning, the death toll had reached 130 with 18 people missing, according to government figures. This was up from 119 fatalities on Saturday, with most occurring in the central provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam.

Close to a million people have been severely affected, with many in desperate need of shelter, food, clean drinking water and income support. According to the UN, as of last Thursday, at least 178,000 homes were currently under water.

Flood levels eclipsed the 1979 record by 0.98 metres, hovering at 4.89 metres for several consecutive days in the province of Quang Binh. The amount of rain that fell between October 6 and 13 was two to six times higher than normal in some regions.

Most of the hardest hit have been poor farmers. Agricultural damage has been extensive, with 1,500 hectares of rice fields and 7,800 hectares of other crops being either flooded or damaged. Close to a million head of cattle and poultry have also been killed or swept away.

The government has stated that the damage caused has been the worst in five years. Several highways and local roads are blocked with rocks the size of cars, hampering rescue efforts.

About a third of deaths have been of military personnel.

In one instance, a team of 21 rescuers, most of them military officers, was sent to verify reports of 17 workers buried by a landslide at the Rao Trang 3 hydroelectric plant deep in the jungle. The workers were reportedly asleep when they were buried on October 12.

The rescue team stopped at a ranger station for the night and were buried in a rocky landslide. Of the 13 deaths, 11 were from the military. Only four of the 17 workers at the dam have been recovered thus far and authorities have deployed more rescue forces to the scene.

Days later, a barracks in Quang Tri was consumed by a mudslide in the early hours of the morning, killing 20 military personnel, likely the largest number of military casualties suffered in a period of peace, according to officials.

Scientists believe flooding in central Vietnam is the result of a new normal of weather patterns driven by complex processes.

On an international scale, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDDR) reported recently a 75 percent increase in natural disasters in the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, there were 4,212 major natural disasters. Between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded costing 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy USD$2.97 trillion.

The increase is largely attributed to climate related events such as floods, droughts and storms.

Speaking at a virtual conference, UNDDR chief Mami Mizutori accused governments of abandoning effective measures to deal with climate change, It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction, he said, despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.

In the Asia Pacific, the cyclical la Nina phenomenon is intensifying storms in the region, and is expected to continue until early next year. Cambodia has reported 39 deaths from flooding, with hundreds of thousands affected and 46,216 people evacuated to safer ground.

Vietnam has been hit by three tropical storms and a depression in the month of October. Typhoon Mojave, at present travelling westwards over the Philippines, is also likely to impact in the weeks ahead. It is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds of 130 kilometres per hour. About 9,000 people in the Philippines have fled their homes.

Professor of human ecology at Rutgers University, Pamela McElwee, told the New York Times that the sheer volume of rainfall in Vietnam was, so extraordinarily out of the normal that it shattered the governments midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in its central regions by the end of the century.

She also stated that the construction of hydroelectric dams and poor mountain roads had weakened the soil. The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go.

Christopher Rassi, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross, warned of the economic fallout: We are seeing a deadly double disaster unfold before our eyes as these floods compound the difficulties caused by COVID-19. These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.

The Vietnamese economy relies heavily on its tourism industry which has been drastically cut back during the pandemic. Borders were virtually closed in late March. Apart from an outbreak in Da Nang Hospital in late July, total cases have been kept low and contained at under 1,500, with 40 deaths.

The Asian Development Bank assessed in September that Vietnams economy would grow at around 1.8 percent in 2020, its slowest rate in 35 years and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.

The Stalinist regime in Vietnam has ruthlessly pursued a policy of capitalist restoration for decades. According to its own estimates, economic inequality is worsening. Between 2014 and 2018 the GINI index of Vietnam, a standard measure of income inequality, was 0.4 [where 0 represents absolute equality and 1 absolute inequality]. The figure is regarded as a tipping point with higher numbers frequently associated with social unrest and political instability.

Out of fear of social unrest, the regime has sought to suppress criticism from workers and the peasantry. According to the UN, hundreds of people have been interrogated so far over COVID-19 related Facebook posts. In the lead up to the congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party in January 2021, the government has begun a campaign of censoring dissident and left-wing publications.",2020-10-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'normal', 'storms', 'quang', 'according', 'extreme', 'workers', 'central', 'events', 'military', 'million', 'rescue', 'suffers', 'weather']",Vietnam,news article,English
560,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Ministry Retrieve 500 Excavators From Illegal Mining Sites - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/ministry-retrieve-500-excavators-from-illegal-mining-sites/,"The Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Mr John Peter Amewu, on Wednesday said 500 excavators have, so far, been retrieved from mining sites with 1,148 dredges taken from major rivers in the country.

He said the Ministry would collaborate with the Ministry of Environment, Science, Innovation and Technology, to establish a desk to combat illicit mining and crack the whip on anyone involved.

Mr Amewu said this when he toured some mining sites in the Upper West Akyem Municipality, Atiwa East and Denkyemboar districts in the Eastern Region.

The tour followed a three-week ultimatum the Minister gave to illegal miners to evacuate their machines and leave all mining sites. The ultimatum expired on Tuesday, April 18.

The team, comprising officials of the Minerals Commission as well as some police personnel, visited communities including Akenten, Pianaman, Moseaso and Kubriso.

Some illegal miners who were working on some concessions left the site upon seeing the team.

There were excavators abandoned at the mining sites while others were packed in front of houses.

The Minister called on the Environmental Protection Agency to collaborate with the Minerals Commission in monitoring the various miming sites to ensure licensed mining firms reclaimed the lands concurrently while mining went on.

He said there was the need for a sustained fight against illegal mining and called for collective efforts by all stakeholders including the traditional authorities, land owners, the media, civil society organisations and politicians to help stop the practice.

Mr Amewu gave the assurance that the Government would sustain the fight for the next five years.

Dr Tony Aubynn, the Chief Executive Officer of the Minerals Commission, said the key stakeholders supposed to combat the menace had been complicit and, therefore, called for collaborative efforts to deal decisively with the challenge.

Illegal mining, otherwise known as galamsey, had degraded the environment and polluted water bodies all over the country.

The Abontendomhene of Kyebi, Nana Boakye Dankwa, who later received the Minister and his entourage, charged the Government to sustain the fight against illegal mining and prosecute persons involved.

He said illegal mining had destroyed their water bodies and vegetations and urged the Government to stop a mining firm, Extra Gold, from operating in the area since its activities had destroyed the environment.

1388,FL-2021-000030-IDN,'Virtual rangers' help South African reserve beat poachers - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20210329095539-rqjfw,"More than 55,000 people around the world are helping keep an eye out for poachers under an innovative scheme using mobile phones to stream footage

By Akhona Matshoba and Tanisha Heiberg

JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Reuters) - The animals that roam South Africa's Balule Nature Reserve have a new ally in the battle to keep them safe from poachers - camera phones mounted in protective cases that stream images of their activities to thousands of ""virtual rangers"" worldwide.

With reserves across Africa cutting back on anti-poaching patrols amid a coronavirus-induced tourism lull that has hit funding, Balule has teamed up with handset manufacturer Samsung and tech pioneer Africam to supplement staff numbers with eyes and ears online.

Over 55,000 people have become virtual rangers since the project, Wildlife Watch, went live this month.

""We need more eyes; we need more people helping us,"" said Leitah Mkhabela, a member of the park's all-female anti-poaching unit known as the Black Mambas.

""They can become a ranger while staying at home and they can save a rhino every single day.""

Located in Limpopo province and home to the ""big five"" of rhino, lion, leopard, elephant and buffalo, Balule forms part of South Africa's flagship Kruger National Park.

Mkhabela and her colleagues use the same model of phone for communication and to capture images of suspicious activity during patrols, while other handsets have been installed to monitor perimeter fences.

Swiss-based environmental network, International Union for Conservation of Nature, said anti-poaching patrols have been cut in more than half of Africa's protected sites due to the impact of the pandemic.

One in five rangers has been laid off globally since the pandemic began, said deputy leader of the Wildlife Practice at WWF-International, Wendy Elliott.

Meanwhile, job losses and increased poverty have driven a growth in the hunting of bush meat.

But, to Mkhabela's relief, Balule is striking back.

Viewers of the park's streaming service have already reported hearing gunshots - signalling the possibility of poachers - and alerted rangers to trapped animals needing rescue.

""I want to be the reason my grandkids see rhinos in the years to come,"" said Mkhabela. (Writing by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and John Stonestreet)

93,DR-2015-000134-SOM,The many layers of Caitlin Stasey: 'A lot of people think I'm a really angry person' - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/24/the-many-layers-of-caitlin-stasey-a-lot-of-people-think-im-a-really-angry-person,"Earlier this year, a photo shoot for Fairfax Media’s Good Weekend magazine was cancelled because its intended subject, the actor and activist Caitlin Stasey, declined to be photographed in lingerie. Stasey felt the concept was inappropriately leery for a story about the empowerment of women.

The interview – commissioned in January when Stasey was making headlines around the world with the launch of her new website, Herself.com – was postponed indefinitely. Stasey concluded the magazine had lost interest because she had refused to pose semi-nude.

Her vengeance was swift. She took to Twitter, calling out the magazine and slamming its editor, Ben Naparstek. She published some of her correspondence with Good Weekend, pointing to inconsistencies in Naparstek’s recollection of events, and wrote an essay recounting the events for Jezebel. The piece was illustrated with a topless picture Stasey had supplied herself – a Polaroid captioned with a message to Naparstek in her own handwriting: “FUCK YOU”.

Good Weekend magazine suddenly doesn't have the space to run a piece on me because I wouldn't do a shoot in my underwear @theage @smh — caitlin stasey (@caitlinstasey) July 15, 2015

They wanted to team an interview about my upset over the constant objectification of women with a sexualized photo shoot. I declined.@theage — caitlin stasey (@caitlinstasey) July 15, 2015

When a magazine only wants you if you're nude. Good stuff from @caitlinstasey on @Jezebel http://t.co/q6nvz1ODJT — Gabrielle Jackson (@gabriellecj) July 21, 2015

Good Weekend was widely walloped in the hailstorm of ensuing coverage, both in Australia and abroad. “These kinds of acts perpetuated by men in positions of power against women so often go unanswered,” Stasey said of the episode recently. “My intention was nothing more than to shed light on an issue that I know young women have faced.”

I don't feel what I do is important … we all sit around patting ourselves on the back, and for what? Caitlin Stasey

Her restless social conscience and level of engagement is less remarkable for her age than for her profession. In an industry more associated with ego, vapidity and self-investment, the 25-year-old former Neighbours actor, who broke out at the age of 20 with the Tomorrow, When the War Began movie, increasingly views her career as a distant sideline to her commitment to activism and raising awareness.

“I’ve done some incredible projects I’m really proud of that I really love. But I don’t feel what I do, what we do, is important,” Stasey told me. “The Oscars, the Golden Globes, even the IF awards … I think it’s really self-aggrandising. We all sit around patting ourselves on the back, and for what? Spending millions of dollars while people are dying. It sounds incredibly hypocritical for me to continue to be an actor and to have this feeling but I see it an opportunity to talk about things that I care about. I think that’s the important thing.”

The Good Weekend episode highlighted everything that made Stasey an attractive magazine subject in the first place: her social media celebrity, the fierceness of her feminist crusade, her tussles with the media and her general badassery. It’s also a fitting appetiser for a version of the original interview, published now for the first time.

‘People don’t rally in the streets for happiness’

In the clamorous Twittersphere, where the more moderate voices get drowned out, Stasey’s online presence is regularly pitched at the rabble-rousing volume of revolution. Her style is mutinous and militant; you can sense the pugilistic percussion of her thumbs on her smartphone screen as she bashes out her rallying cries to her nearly 100,000 followers.

For a long time after joining Twitter in 2009, Stasey used the social media platform in the same way most of us do: to post selfies, cat pictures and YouTube clips. These days, Stasey treats Twitter as part-philosophical salon, part-soapbox from which to rail against the evils of the world – climate change, homophobia, child abuse, animal abuse, gluten, religion, racism and (she says) Nickelback.

“A lot of people think that I’m a really angry person,” Stasey said, sipping Glenfiddich in a hotel restaurant in downtown Toronto. “‘Do you enjoy anything? Do you like anything? Are you happy about anything?’ Yes, I am! But I don’t tweet about it. People don’t rally in the streets to engage in happiness. People talk about things they’re unsatisfied with.”



In person, Stasey’s tone more closely resembles that of mellow hippy than furious firebrand. It takes a while to register the profound bleakness of her worldview. Even her most apocalyptic pronouncements – she calls the human race a “cancer on the Earth” – are delivered in polite tones not dissimilar to the received pronunciation English she speaks in the Tudor-era US soapie Reign.

While a local musician performs a yearning rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow at the other end of the room, Stasey laments the corrupt handling of the drought in northern California, the targeting of low-income women to sell their breast milk, the impeding of cancer research by human gene patenting, and the devastation of the natural habit of mountain gorillas, all before our drinks have arrived. Perusing the menu, she admits that she draws the line at the rights of vegetables.

“People always get on me, ‘Well, what about carrots? Carrots have feelings,’” she says. “I’m not about to start eating an animal that has been caged since birth, has been milked until it’s no longer useful, because someone thinks asparagus might be sentient. Because I don’t think that it is.”

She orders the baby kale and quinoa salad, the only item on the menu with no animal products. Something tells me not to order the foie gras. Her disregard for the plight of asparagus notwithstanding, Stasey seems not only well informed about injustice, but also personally affected by it. She speaks earnestly and openly, and doesn’t do do small talk. “This is how I engage,” she says. “I’m acutely aware of my mortality, and the only way I know how to combat it is to try to connect with as many human beings as possible.”

The curse of caring intensely about so much, Stasey herself is burdened by feelings of failure and impotence. During the interview she chides herself for unconsciously using “ablest” words like “crazy”, “lame” and “insane”. She’s not entirely sure if the recently purchased top she’s wearing wasn’t made in a sweatshop. She owns leather products and a Canada Goose jacket – items “heavily endowed with sadness” – from before she went completely vegan in 2014. Even her veganism is a source of guilt, since it means not supporting the cruelty-free meat industry.

I’m acutely aware of my mortality, and the only way I know how to combat it is to try to connect Caitlin Stasey

Her devoted young female following is drawn to the strong female characters she plays as well as the strong female character she is. Stasey’s sense of responsibility to her legion of female fans has, in turn, inspired her feminism. Stasey applies her fieriest energies to speaking out against the fundamental inequality of the sexes: sexism, sex negativity, misogyny, victim blaming, slut shaming and rape culture.

On Twitter, Stasey’s feminism sometimes takes the form of deadpan misandry along the lines of, “My resolution for 2015 – kill all the men.” But Stasey’s actually against a society that favours men, not men themselves. “Feminism is as simple as a woman choosing for herself and being able to do what she believes in. Feminism is nothing more than freedom.”

‘You are a superstar in my eyes’

Last year, Stasey and Toronto-based photographer Jennifer Toole put out a call for women of all body types, nationalities, ethnicities and orientations to participate in a new project to promote female solidarity. Herself.com is the result; a place for women to share their thoughts and ideas on sex, sexuality, gender, feminism, monogamy, masturbation, and much more besides, accompanied by artful nude photographs.



Stasey conceived Herself.com as an alternative to the finitude and fleetingness of typical internet outrage. “I noticed that every time a woman had an opinion about something, she was just shouted down by everyone around her,” says Stasey.

“I wanted to create this one-way flow of information from woman to world about the things they ordinarily aren’t asked. I wanted to ask women what they thought about how the world saw them, because I was witnessing injustice and discrimination and I wondered if other women saw it too. I felt the world should hear that this woman was sexually assaulted, or that she was raped, or that she had an eating disorder.”

Her shrewdly simple act of female solidarity resonated with readers in a way even she didn’t imagine. Stasey’s social media accounts, sites of gushing fan worship any other day, have been overwhelmed with glowing responses to Herself.com. A sample: “Love the idea of @herself.com and have read every single interview twice. Thank you for being open and candid about issues that so often are pushed to the side. You are superstar in my eyes. Thank you @caitlinjstasey and fuck the haters.”

Or: “You are amazing and I truly appreciate all you do to raise awareness of our rights as women!”

One might be forgiven for wondering if a collection of generic template interviews constitutes genuine societal change or, instead, simply offers a reassuring simulacrum of change – even, as Malcolm Gladwell has suggested of online activism, a substitute for it. But Stasey’s own decision to take up feminism was the result of conversations she had tuned into online. Before then, she says, she had been blissfully insulated in the liberal, like-minded company of actors and artists.

‘I’ve always felt like I was gay’

As a child Stasey was a tomboyish child, permanently trudging around in Blundstone boots. She distinctly remembers, as an 11-year-old, the realisation that her friend was wearing a slinky black dress while she was in a T-shirt that had been bought in the gift shop of a zoo. She was also a dark-haired, dark-skinned girl surrounded by girls who, as she tells it, were all blond-haired and blue-eyed. With a British mother, an Australian father and two white names, her peers, even the parents of friends, jokingly called her “blackie”. She absorbed it, rather than correcting them.

Stasey was also confused about her own sexuality. “I’ve always felt like I was gay,” she says. “But when I was 13 I felt like it was sitting on my chest and I couldn’t move and there was nothing I could do about it. I was scared of being gay but I was also scared of approaching women. I couldn’t think of anything more frightening than asking a woman out or kissing a woman or taking a woman home.

“I knew I was different and I knew the world that I was growing up in wasn’t interested in nurturing that.”

She sought out female nude imagery in art history books (“I loved impressionism because it was actual depictions of naked bodies. I couldn’t get into Picasso. I thought, ‘Boobs don’t look like that’”). To the amusement of her family, she doodled her own nude pictures. She was confused to not be able to find her feelings reflected anywhere in her community, in the books she was reading or the television she was watching. And, though she was raised in a secular household, she attended an all girls’ Catholic high school that, though supposedly committed to inspiring its young women, only filled her with Christian shame for her bodily desires.

Stasey began self-harming at the age of 13. She had completed six months filming her first television role in ABC TV’s The Sleepover Club, during which – always gregarious with adult strangers growing up and encouraged by her drama teacher mother – she had become used to the attention of those much older than her. Unmoored from the sense of importance that she had enjoyed her on set, the return to school, and schoolwork, depressed her.

Not long after her 14th birthday, her parents found the razor blades she was using to slice her forearms. Suddenly, she felt silly. “I stopped equating self-harm with self-help,” she says. “It began feeling self-indulgent. Rather than fall deeper into a hole of self-despair, I guess I saw that I had to find a way out to survive.”



She began paying attention to what was happening around her, tuning in to nightly news forecasts and developing what Stasey’s younger sister Victoria refers to as a “precocious interest” in current affairs. “To be honest, she always annoyed us a little bit,” Victoria told me recently. “She was so socially minded and very aware. We’d be watching the news and she’d be commenting on it and trying to get us involved … we’d always just kind of roll our eyes a bit.”

“My dad always said I was really naive and that I wasn’t living in the real world,” Stasey says. “My response to that was I just have an unfailing commitment to a world that I wish we were living in. Because if you live by the parameters of what you exist in, then you might never see change.”

‘It’s important to seem steely’

The turbulence of her adolescence behind her, the Stasey of today is staunchly sex positive. She has railed against the double standards in the censorship of women’s breasts on Facebook and Instagram, spoken out in support of sex work, and raved about the joys of everything from masturbation to casual sex. (For the premiere episode of Reign, she acted out a stairwell masturbation scene that, much to her disappointment, was cut considerably for broadcast.)

For a long time, Stasey’s all-purpose profile picture was a topless photograph of herself, which she used for both Twitter and the dating app Tinder. (Her entire Tinder bio: “Cum at me ladies.”) She now identifies as lesbian despite having almost exclusively dated men. She is currently in a self-described “somewhat open” relationship with Lucas Neff, an American actor. They see other women, together and separately.

She’s also an avid sexter, as her own mother recently learned when she picked up Stasey’s iPad by mistake.

Stasey’s sexual candor occasionally feeds right into the vulturous appetites of the tabloids and their blogging brethren. The Daily Mail, News.com and TMZ – the same outlets that pick apart Stasey’s “social media outbursts” and “bizarre Twitter rants” – frequently tsk and tut in tones of puritan outrage even as they gleefully publish Stasey’s words and pixelate her private parts.

When Stasey criticised celebrity blogger Perez Hilton for publishing leaked photos during the celebrity phone hacking scandal, he responded with “Great tits!” But Stasey refuses to censor herself.

“I think it’s important to seem steely, right? If you appear hurt, then they’ve won. If someone trolls me and makes me feel like shit, if somebody writes an article about me that makes me cry … I’m never going to be silenced by bigots and I’m never going to be silenced by trolls. I don’t want other women, who might be looking to me as a source of comfort, to feel like anything that’s thrown at me has any weight to it. You just have to be fucking boss.”

Women are so often asked to take on roles to portray their entire gender Caitlin Stasey

In movies and television, Stasey has done her best to take screen roles that agree with her politics. Her character on ABC’s Please Like Me pursues a sustainable forestry project all the way to Europe; on Reign, she played the King’s sexually forthright mistress Kenna, whose bohemian tendencies are strongly implied by her beaded headpieces and wristlets. (One of Kenna’s defining moments has been immortalised in a fan-made gif: “You have no idea what it’s like to be a girl in this world,” she says. “Owning nothing, having no power except the effect you have on men.”) Stasey calls Kenna “the clitoris” of the show.

In an industry notorious for retrograde gender politics, Stasey knows her views get in the way of her career longevity. Right now, however, she regularly finds herself going head-to-head with agents and casting directors. “In those scenarios you feel like you have to make yourself as attractive as possible. But I have so little interest in that now.”

“Women are so often asked to take on roles to portray their entire gender,” Stasey says, “much like any member of the LGBTQI community is asked to take on roles portraying their entire community, because they’re standing as a figurehead. Whereas men get to be nuanced, fluid, interesting people who can do shit things and people still love them.”

Even on set, Stasey fights the “well meaning sexism” of crew members calling her “sweetheart” or “darling”, retaliating by referring to them by their eye colour. “I’ll say, ‘Hey, Chocolate Eyes …’ They’re quite taken aback,” she says.

More fundamentally, making the sort of statements that would make any agent squirm, Stasey says she’s no longer really that invested in acting – except insofar as it provides her the platform and free time to be involved with issues closer to her heart. The boundless energy that propelled Stasey to her career in the first place has found a new outlet.

Asked what she sees herself doing in five, 10 years, Stasey responds with fully formed schemes for several lofty humanitarian and ethical projects. None of them involve her being in front of a camera.

Recently, she’s been in talks with photographers in Ethiopia, Somalia and Istanbul about broadening the reach and diversity of Herself.com and highlighting the stories of women in more far-flung locations.

Beyond those plans, she hopes to set up a refuge for women and children leaving abusive relationships; launch an organic restaurant; devise a more inclusive and less transphobic sex education curriculum; care for animals; and run an ethical, trans- and queer-inclusive strip club showcasing more diverse bodies.

If everyone cared a lot about just one thing, it would alleviate the burden from others Caitlin Stasey

She has also considered politics, but isn’t convinced she’d stand a chance at being elected. “I’d be like, ‘Decriminalise all drugs! Decriminalise all sex work! Let’s get more abortion clinics!’”

In her personal life, she wants to “adopt as many children in need as possible” while also regretting how “Angelina Jolie” that sounds.

Stasey has reined in her Twitter activism in the months since Herself.com launched. Every now and then, though, something sets her off.

“The world is fuuuuucked,” she says, her garden party elocution briefly freefalling into something more recognisably Australian. “The world is entirely darkness. But there are moments of light that permeate it: great acts of empathy, of compassion, of charity, ingenuity, creativeness, art and engagement.”

Ultimately, she’s optimistic about the possibility of widespread change.

“People get so overwhelmed by this sense of despair. They just shut it out, like, ‘Fuck it, I want to eat McDonald’s and I want to waste water and I want to leave all the lights on in my house because I’ve only got one life to live. I’m only one person.’ But you can effect real change. I implore people to care as much as they can about something. If everyone cared a lot about just one thing, it would alleviate the burden from others. And from the planet.”

Stasey turns to applaud the musician, who has just performed Paul McCartney’s Blackbird, singing of broken wings learning to fly.

“But yeah, I sound like a drug addled maniac: ‘We should just love each other and live in the mud together!’ But that’s what I’d really like.”",2015-09-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['stasey', 'staseys', 'lot', 'woman', 'person', 'twitter', 'world', 'dont', 'layers', 'angry', 'women', 'sex', 'think', 'caitlin', 'really', 'im', 'way']",Somalia,news article,English

The water rose so high that, despite a wall of sandbags, it overwhelmed the home's foundation and started pouring into her basement.

""I saw this huge wave coming in, and within like five seconds, it was full,"" Guilbault said, standing in front of her yellow, one-storey house on the banks of the Rivière des Prairies earlier this month.

""I had seven feet of water in my basement,"" she said. ""It was a really stressful time.""

Her yard is blanketed in snow and ice right now, but with warmer temperatures on the way, Guilbault and others are bracing themselves for possible flooding.

Preparing for future floods

After an exceptionally snowy winter, Quebec municipalities are again watching the forecast closely, fearing another round of flooding.

In some communities hard-hit by floods in 2017, officials are also thinking long-term, preparing for future disasters.

""As a mayor, I took a position that climate change will have an effect on flooding,"" said Normand Marinacci, mayor of Montreal's L'Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève borough, which includes Île Mercier.

His borough was among the worst-hit areas of Quebec two years ago.

Île Mercier was covered in flood water in May 2017. Situations like this may become more frequent with climate change, experts warn, and it's time to plan for flooding. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)

""There was a lot of stress, and it wasn't easy,"" Marinacci said. ""When you see water pouring in your house, it's very difficult for those people.""

It's something Marinacci hopes never to see again. Several homes in the borough were so badly damaged, they had to be demolished.

The province said it would not permit those homeowners to rebuild, because of the high risk of future flooding.

Earlier this month, the borough took another preventative step when it passed a bylaw extending the no-build zone. The bylaw prohibits anyone from building or expanding on land that could flood within the next 100 years.

""Why take a risk? Why give a permission to a person to build in a zone that is at risk?"" Marinacci asked.

Guilbault opposes the bylaw, which prevents some of her neighbours from renovating their existing houses. It also means some vacant properties can no longer be developed.

The mayor of Montreal's L'Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève borough, Normand Marinacci, said scenes like this, taken in Pierrefonds in May 2017, are something he hopes to never see again. (Conrad Fournier/Radio-Canada)

She's relieved she was allowed to fix her home and stay.

""There is a cost in terms of stress that goes with it, because the water isn't far,"" she said. But in her eyes, it's worth it.

""I'm attached to this place because it's closer to nature.""

In her case, Guilbault said the damage to her house was valued at $150,000, and the province compensated her for part of that.

Now that she has added pumps, rebar-reinforced concrete and lifted the building's foundation, she is confident the house can withstand another flood.

Taxpayers, insurance companies on the hook

The debate around building on flood plains is happening in communities across the country, as local governments try to balance residents' attachment to their homes and the desire to live near water with the realities of future flooding.

""Even with a stable climate, flooding has always been the major natural disaster in Canada and because of climate change, it's going to increase,"" said Alain Bourque, executive director of Ouranos, a Montreal-based climate change research organization.

""It is the most important natural disaster to watch for.""

The Insurance Bureau of Canada has been working with the federal government to try to ensure Canadians are better prepared.

The IBC said insurance companies are losing money from payouts after natural disasters and that taxpayers are also on the hook after events such as flooding, due to public infrastructure repairs and the cost of compensating homeowners.

""You may be able to put a home on stilts or absolutely encase it, but your support services are also at risk,"" said Craig Stewart, president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

""We know that municipalities rely on the tax dollars from developing in these attractive places, but we need to resist the urge to put people in harm's way.""

Adapting to a changing climate

Plumbing contractor Olivier Ishii-Landry's business now focuses mainly on flood preparation and what he calls 'climate change adaptation.' (Alison Northcott/CBC News)

Plumbing contractor Olivier Ishii-Landry is also planning for more floods in the future.

He saved his own home on Île Mercier two years ago by outfitting it with a network of pumps and generators. He said his business now focuses mainly on that kind of prevention — what he calls ""climate change adaptation.""

""It's going to happen more and more often to more and more people,"" he said. ""'I'm there to protect and keep dry a lot of people's most expensive investment.""

Pier-Luc Cauchon, who has lived in the borough all his life, has circulated a petition against the borough's bylaw expanding the no-build zone because he wants residents on the island to have the chance to adapt.

""A lot of people are frustrated,"" he said. ""If you build in a flood zone with the right regulations, you won't receive damage.""

Still, Marinacci, the borough mayor, said it is a necessary change.

""If we want to prevent other events like we lived in 2017, I think it's a good thing to do,"" he said. ""It's a vision for the future.""",2019-03-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['quebec', 'communities', 'marinacci', 'flooding', 'building', 'face', 'flood', 'water', 'questions', 'île', 'change', '2017', 'climate', 'tough', 'mercier', 'future', 'devastating', 'floods', 'borough', 'plains']",Canada,news article,English
593,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Myanmar Oil Pipeline Could Bring Cheaper Crude To China - OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Myanmar-Oil-Pipeline-Could-Bring-Cheaper-Crude-To-China.html,"It’s been an on-again, off-again battle — but one of the world’s largest and most critical new energy infrastructure projects got off the ground this week.

That’s a 770-kilometer crude oil pipeline in the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar. Owned and built by China — and giving that country unprecedented access to crude flows in the Indian Ocean.

The first-ever tanker of oil began loading to the new pipeline on Monday, according to reports from Chinese media. With this initial slug of 1 million barrels to begin transiting across Myanmar, bound for refineries in Kunming, southern China. You can see the route in the chart below.

(Click to enlarge)

China’s new crude pipeline (green line) runs 770 kilometers from the Myanmar port of Kyaukphyu all the way to Kunming

The inaugural oil shipment here comes after years of delays for this mega-project. With China having previously announced commissioning of the oil pipeline in early 2015 — a year after a twin natural gas pipeline (red line in the map above) began operating.

But oil shipments failed to launch at that time. Due to political wrangling between Myanmar and China over commercial terms for oil exports (all of the pipeline’s crude goes to China, with Myanmar simply acting as a transit route).

That caused the pipe to sit empty for two years. Until an agreement was finally hammered out this past Monday between the Chinese and Myanmar governments — opening the door for crude shipments to finally begin.

If the pipeline indeed ramps up to full capacity, this will be one of the biggest developments of the decade for global crude flows. With China now able to receive oil from key producing centers like the Middle East and Africa directly off the Indian Ocean — eliminating days of sailing through the treacherous Strait of Malacca between Indonesia and Malaysia.

That lowers the landed oil price for Chinese buyers. And should incentivize more purchases from Indian Ocean oil nations. It may also lead China’s E&Ps to a greater focus on projects in this region — such as East Africa, Iran and India. Watch for news on the pipeline’s rise to full capacity, and for knock-on shifts in Chinese energy investment.

Here’s to opening the back door.

1031,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Shiraz Floods: Safeguarding Human Rights When Natural Disasters Hit - Center for Human Rights in Iran,https://iranhumanrights.org/2019/03/shiraz-floods-four-ways-to-safeguard-human-rights-in-natural-disasters/,"At least 19 people have died in Shiraz, the capital of Iran’s Fars Province, as a result of flash flooding from a sudden, heavy downpour of rain. State media reports indicate at least 100 others have been injured and thousands of homes have been damaged there. The provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran in the north have also been impacted by flooding.

Research by the UN and humanitarian aid organizations show that natural disasters heighten the risk of grave human rights violations, including discrimination and gender-based violence.

Guidelines adopted in 2006 by a forum of UN and non-UN humanitarian partners, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), promote a rights-based approach to disaster relief efforts. Following are excerpts from those guidelines.

Measures to Prevent Violence and Discrimination

1) “Protection of Life; Security and Physical Integrity of the Person; and Family Ties”

The IASC notes that when necessary, evacuations “should be carried out in a manner that fully respects the rights to life, dignity, liberty and security of those affected and that does not discriminate against anyone.”

This requires communicating the reason for the evacuation in a language that people can understand as well as ensuring families are not separated. Relief actors also have a responsibility to protect people’s security before and after the emergency phase including against gender-based violence.

Preventative measures include:

Identifying and mapping persons particularly exposed to the risk of violence, for instance single women or girls, single parent households, single or non-accompanied children, older persons, persons with disabilities, etc.;

Advocating for additional deployment of law enforcement personnel able to provide the necessary protection to areas or sites at risk of or experiencing instances of gender-based violence, robberies, looting, etc. or a general break-down of law and order;

Conducting awareness raising among persons who are exposed to new specific

protection needs as a consequence of the disaster about these new risks, e.g.

exploitation, trafficking, etc.

Avoiding large or overcrowded collective shelters; and

Including representatives of affected populations, including women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities in the design of camps and collective centres, in particular regarding: Design, location and lay-out of shelter; Lighting, fencing and other security measures; and Safe location of and access to food distribution and water points



2) “Protection of rights related to the Provision of Food; Health; Shelter; and Education”

The IASC states that “humanitarian goods and services should be provided on the basis of assessed needs, without any distinction of any kind other than that of differing needs and without any discrimination as to race, color, sex, language, disability, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, age, or other status.”

Measures for preventing discrimination in natural disaster relief efforts include:

Use of proven assessment tools that include all categories of persons with special needs and allow objective identification of needs;

Specific monitoring whether persons with special needs, older persons, persons with disabilities, sick persons or female-headed households with infants and young children have equal access to food, water, health and other humanitarian services and, if not, giving them priority access, or setting up separate distribution points/separate hours for distribution of goods and for services, etc.;

Systematic inclusion of female-headed households, unaccompanied children, older persons, persons with disabilities and other persons with special needs in the distribution of humanitarian goods;

Securing distribution points against rioters or others ready to use violence; and

Monitoring of risks for beneficiaries after distributions

3) “Protection of Rights Related to Housing; Land and Property; Livelihoods and Secondary and Higher Education”

The IASC guidelines also note that relief efforts should respect and protect the right to property. To do so relief actors should:



Establish photographic records of landmarks and possessions left behind;

Use standard forms to record property left behind by the displaced;

Advocate for the deployment of police forces to areas where destruction or looting may take place; and

Ensure access of owners to effective remedies to bring complaints against persons illegally occupying or using their property

4) Protection of Rights Related to Documentation; Movement; Re-Establishment of Family ties; Expression and Opinion, and Elections

The IASC also states that affected persons and communities should be “allowed and enabled to give feedback and raise complaints or grievances on the disaster relief and recovery response.”

This requires establishing mechanisms and opportunities “for affected persons to conduct peaceful assemblies or to form associations for this purpose” by:",2019-03-26 20:35:32+00:00,"['hit', 'relief', 'iasc', 'rights', 'floods', 'protection', 'distribution', 'violence', 'shiraz', 'natural', 'human', 'disasters', 'humanitarian', 'persons', 'security', 'needs', 'safeguarding']",Iran,news article,English
1471,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Floods, food shortages threaten to push Nigeria into food crisis - Aljazeera.com",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/9/14/floods-food-shortages-threaten-to-push-nigeria-into-food-crisis,"Mal Shehu Ladan took a boat across what was, until this month, a growing rice paddy. Now, like thousands of hectares of rice in Nigerias Kebbi state, it is under water.

Almost all my farm has been flooded. I didnt harvest any rice, Ladan told Reuters News Agency. Its going to be devastating.

Floods early this month across northwest Nigeria destroyed 90 percent of the two million tonnes that Kebbi state officials expected to harvest this autumn, the head of the state branch of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. The loss amounts to some 20 percent of the rice Nigeria grew last year, and the waters are still rising.

Further south, outside Nigerias capital, Abuja, chicken farmer Hippolite Adigwe is also worried. A shortage of maize forced him to sell most of his flock of more than 1,000 birds, and the 300 he has left are hungry. Chicken feed prices have more than doubled, and he is not sure how long he can cope.

Twin crises, floods and maize shortages, come just after movement restrictions and financing difficulties caused by COVID-19 containment measures complicated spring planting.

Some farmers and economists said it could push Nigeria, Africas most populous nation, into a food crisis. Rice is the countrys staple grain, and chicken is a core protein.

There is a real fear of having food shortages, Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.

Nigeria took roughly 4,000 tonnes of millet and sorghum from the regional economic blocs (ECOWAS) strategic stocks last month and released 30,000 tonnes of its own maize. It also gave four companies special permission to import maize.

The prominent Nigerian Economic Summit Group has called for a complete overhaul of agriculture policy.

Problems accessing foreign exchange to import food are adding to shortages. In July, the central bank added maize to a list of items for which importers are banned from using its dollars. Rice and fertiliser were already on the list, along with other items that Nigeria wants to be made locally.

Last week, even as food prices spiked, President Muhammadu Buhari promised that not one cent of central bank dollars would go to food or fertiliser imports, as Nigeria would continue encouraging local farmers over imports.

Importers can use dollars from pricier parallel markets. But these are tough to find due to an oil price crash that has cut Nigerias core source of foreign exchange.

Switching grains

Rice prices had already risen substantially due to a land border closure last year that aimed to stamp out smuggling and boost local production.

The worst is yet to happen. Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex

Peter Clubb of the International Grains Council said the spike drove consumers to eat maize instead. This, along with a disappointing crop late last year and the foreign exchange issues, boosted maize prices to 180,000 naira ($470) per tonne from approximately 70,000 naira ($183) in March.

Farmers sid that consumers grappling with inflation, as well as the first rise in fuel prices since 2016 and a power price spike, can only pay so much more for food.

Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex, said the central banks lending scheme for farmers has significantly expanded output, and can work long term.

But the coming months will be tough. Fertiliser prices hit a record after a COVID-19 outbreak shut down countrys sole urea plant for two weeks, meaning more farmers will skip fertilisers, limiting crop yields.

The worst is yet to happen, Balogun said. It is a problem across grains.

Buhari has pledged more support, and Agriculture Minister Muhammed Sabo Nanono visited the northwest area this weekend and promised to provide farmers with high-quality seeds and to set up a special committee to ensure they have all they need to plant new crops as soon as possible.

Adigwe, the chicken farmer, said he thinks barring foreign food in order to help farmers is not a bad idea, but there are some factors that were not considered.

422,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Winning The Battle Against Desert Locusts - Outlook India,https://krishi.outlookindia.com/story/india-news-winning-the-battle-against-desert-locusts/382244,"Desert locust upsurge could have devastating consequences in vulnerable regions affected by recurrent drought, conflict, high food prices and now fighting COVID-19 pandemic.

For the unsuspecting farmer, the Desert Locust is a formidable enemy. These pests have a voracious appetite with the capacity to devour vast swathes of crops and pastureland on the way, multiply rapidly and can travel up to 150 km/day.

According to some reports, it was the first time since the locust plague of 1926-31 that swarms of locusts took the National Capital Region by surprise in June 2020.

Perhaps for first time, Gurugram too witnessed a locust invasion.

The desert locust upsurge could have devastating consequences in already vulnerable regions. It can cause large-scale crop damage and threaten food security in countries. It can devastate most parts of the world – already affected by recurrent drought, conflict, high food prices – now reeling under the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic.

After spreading to Bihar that time, the insects had entered Nepal and by early July, it swarmed almost a dozen districts in the Himalayan country where the kharif crop cycle was underway.

In the past year, waves of the insidious insect swept across East Africa, Yemen and southwest Asia in massive swarms that contained up to 80 million in a single square kilometre.

The global upsurge of locusts is on the brink of becoming a plague, aided by unusually favourable weather for three years and the international community’s failure to curb their growth.

In India, swarms of locusts invaded Jaisalmer and Suratgarh in Rajasthan and Fazilka in Punjab adjoining the Indo-Pakistan border.

The locusts moved further inside, entering areas of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Fighting The Swarm

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) closely monitors the spread of locusts and plays a crucial role in its control operations.

Using climate data and weather forecasting, a high-tech response is helping countries win battle against Desert Locusts.

Field teams use its ground-breaking eLocust3 tablet to collect crucial data around the world and feed it to FAO's Desert Locust Information Service. The UN body and national authorities then map locust movements.

But, despite the tablets being used in 20 countries, the latest locust emergency meant that demand skyrocketed, and time was too short to train the farmers and pastoralists. FAO was fighting a battle on several fronts and needed a heavier hand to tackle the onslaught.

According to Keith Cressman, FAO's senior locust forecaster, they are constantly looking for cutting edge technologies to harness and adapt them into innovative tools that can be used to improve forecasting and early warning.

Remote communication tools

By January 2020, Desert Locust swarms the size of Paris or New York were sweeping across the Horn of Africa, a region already impacted by poverty and food insecurity. With the pests' ability to multiply 20 times with each generation, every day that passed made the fight more challenging.

Up against the clock, Cressman turned to researchers at Pennsylvania State University's PlantVillage, which provides technological solutions to farmers and had previously created an app to help FAO track another dangerous agricultural pest, the Fall Armyworm.

In less than a month, Cressman and the developers created a simple smartphone app to allow anyone, even with little training, to collect locust data in the field.

But not every farmer has a cell phone and plenty of areas in East Africa are totally isolated from any network. So, FAO also partnered with global GPS supplier Garmin, to modify a satellite data communicator that would overcome connectivity obstacles in areas that have none.

Though FAO now receives up to 2,500 records of data a day, nearly 25 percent of the data is unusable or incorrect and FAO again turned to PlantVIllage to harness artificial intelligence to rapidly identify and remove the unwanted data.

FAO's Desert Locust team then shares this data with control teams on the ground and in the air so they can quickly identify the location of the swarms, and then target and kill them.

Detection from the air

A telephone call from one of Kenya's wildlife conservancies has also led to another technological breakthrough. On the suggestion of one of the rangers, FAO took a digital system, called Earth Ranger, used to monitor the movement of animals, and adapted it for locust monitoring.

Cressman worked with the developers of Earth Ranger, a philanthropic foundation called Vulcan, to fine-tune it specifically for aerial surveillance and locust control.

At the height of the locust response, FAO partnered with 51 Degrees who used this tool to co-ordinate 28 aircraft in the Horn of Africa for surveillance and control operations, giving pilots the precise information they needed to target locusts on the move. The technology was so effective in locust operations in Kenya that FAO soon expanded its application to Ethiopia and Somalia.

FAO is also collaborating with researchers from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the UK Meteorological Office and Cambridge University to develop new ways to improve swarm surveillance, forecasting and control strategies.

A space-age boost to surveillance

Satellites may be the biggest game changer in the fight against Desert Locusts. Since rainfall is a critical component for locust breeding, FAO is using two satellites to identify rainfall and vegetation that might be attract locusts for breeding.

A third satellite which Cressman dubs the ‘Holy Grail of Desert Locust monitoring' goes a step further and can detect soil moisture beneath the earth's surface, conditions which would allow the female locust to lay her eggs.

FAO is working with NASA, the European Space Agency and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre to refine the satellite technology.

Back on the ground, this satellite data is transmitted in real time across cell phones, tablets and other devices so countries can mobilize their control teams and take immediate action to tackle the locust swarms.

Winning the battle

With these operations, the scale of the Desert Locust invasion has vastly diminished in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. In East Africa locust control operations have prevented the loss of 4 million tonnes of cereal and 800 million litres of milk production, while protecting the food security of 36.6 million people and avoiding $1.56 billion in cereal and milk losses.

""While the situation has improved, with few swarms remaining in Kenya and less numerous and smaller swarms in Ethiopia and Somalia, we are still not yet at the end of the upsurge,"" says Cyril Ferrand, FAO's Resilience Team Leader for Eastern Africa.

The threat has also diminished in Yemen, but small swarms have recently appeared in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.

According to FAO, it has won many battles against Desert Locusts, but this war is not over yet.",2021-05-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['data', 'fao', 'locusts', 'africa', 'food', 'desert', 'locust', 'swarms', 'battle', 'winning', 'used', 'control']",Somalia,news article,English

RIYADH - Australia overcame heat and jetlag to ease past Saudi Arabia 3-1 while Japan looked jaded during a 1-1 draw with Uzbekistan in the third round of Asian qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup on Tuesday.

Australia's patchy 2-1 victory over Thailand last week was unconvincing but at Dammam two goals by Josh Kennedy and a penalty from Luke Wilkshire lifted the Socceroos to the top of Group D.

Kennedy opened his account against the Thais and on Tuesday he was at it again, heading a Wilkshire cross into the net just before halftime.

The Japan-based striker added a second goal on 56 minutes after cashing in on Brett Holman's defence-splitting pass.

The hosts pulled a goal back through Nassir Al Shamrani but Kennedy was then fouled in the box and Wilkshire converted his penalty in the 77th minute.

By contrast, Japan's away-match experience was all about toiling for a draw.

Uzbekistan wasted a string of chances against a weary-looking Japan side yet to taste defeat in 13 games since Italian Alberto Zaccheroni took charge in October.

Captain Server Djeparov volleyed Uzbekistan into the lead after eight minutes, celebrating with a triple back flip as the home fans lit flares and roared with delight.

Shinji Okazaki's diving header gave Japan a barely-deserved equaliser in the 65th minute, triggering something of a shootout as both teams suddenly threw caution to the wind.

""Uzbekistan pushed us around a bit,"" Zaccheroni told reporters. ""Give them credit, they are a very good side. We were better in the second half but we must play better than that.""

Japan still top Group C on four points, ahead of Uzbekistan on goal difference.

884,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,What next for cyclone-hit Mozambique? - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2019-05-cyclone-hit-mozambique.html,"Mozambique needs a lot of help to restore its agricultural sector, the head of development agency ADPP says

Mozambique is reeling after an unprecedented two cyclones swept ashore within six weeks, wreaking havoc and leaving hundreds dead and tens of thousands displaced.

As relief efforts continue, Birgit Holm, director of the Mozambican non-governmental development organisation ADPP, discusses the impoverished southern African country's next steps on the road to recovery following Cyclones Idai and Kenneth:

What impact did the cyclones have?

""They have had a very big impact, obviously."" Though the first storm was much bigger than the second, ""that didn't make the second one any better,"" said Holm, who has almost four decades of experience in Mozambique with ADPP.

""We have a situation in several provinces where schools have been destroyed and health clinics have been destroyed—bridges, roads too. In general these two cyclones have destroyed a lot, affecting more than two million people in all.

""It sets back Mozambique, already a country which is very poor and with many different problems, so this has just been disastrous.""

What needs to be done?

""The big need is for those with some means and some funding to go in and rehabilitate all the infrastructure that was destroyed. Because so many people also lost their homes and livelihoods, (but) it's not only a question of infrastructure,"" said Holm.

The path of Cyclone Kenneth and accumulated total precipitation forecast

""It's also about giving input to the people—a lot of it will be agricultural inputs because a great number of the population are working in agriculture. That part really needs a lot of emphasis so they can get tools and seeds.""

What does the future hold?

""In the future, this (kind of weather) is going to increase. I don't think anybody is in any doubt about that,"" said Holm.

""The fact that the two cyclones came within six weeks, it's never happened—ever. And the size of these cyclones and the fact they were so big because of the very high temperatures in the sea, that is not going to be different in the future. It's going to be worse.

""We need to look into how buildings can be reinforced and built to be more resilient. How small-scale farmers can learn to use new techniques, whether it's (to mitigate) droughts or floods.

For several years in Mozambique, ""we've had drought in the south, and people are suffering from that. Then we have floods in the centre and the north. So all these things have to be thought of in a different way from before.

Mozambique homes must be reinforced and farmers must learn how to mitigate droughts and floods, an aid expert says

""There has been years and years of work about mitigating climate change—but it just has to be even more than before... so the population can be prepared for these situations in the future.""

Will the cyclone 'spotlight' help Mozambique?

""It always helps, but you do fear it's just there in the short period of the emergency and then it goes away again,"" Holm told AFP.

""What I hope, and what I hear from some organisations who have come to the country but never had a presence here before, is that some are thinking about continuing and doing longer-term (projects).

""The government is saying this will take at least five years to rehabilitate and get back to where we were—and where we were was not that high a level. So it's really needed and I hope that the organisations and institutions that have these means will start looking at giving Mozambique the help they need. And not only loans—we don't need more loans.""

The International Lake Ontario—St. Lawrence River Board, a joint Canada-United States body, warned Tuesday that people who live near parts of the Ottawa River, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River should prepare for “major coastal flooding."" The warning comes on the heels of one of the wettest Aprils on record that saw Lake Ontario rise 44 centimetres. Flooding has threatened hundreds of residences in the region, and more than 130 homes were evacuated in Gatineau, Que. across from Ottawa as of May 4. Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. Île Mercier, a small island off Montreal, was submerged by floodwaters, while Rigaud, a town in southwestern Quebec at the junction of the Ottawa River and the Rigaud River, declared a state of emergency.

“Water levels are going to go higher, because the inflows are still coming in more than we can release,” said Gail R. Faveri, an engineer with Canada's national hydrological service inside Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the secretary of the joint Canada-U.S. board. ""It's just too much water everywhere"" Inflows, such as snow melt from the upper reaches of the Ottawa River, continue to mix with a high volume of rainfall, adding to the torrent of water, she said.

Faveri’s board is in charge of regulating the flow of Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River. The main control structure for this is the Moses-Saunders Power Dam near Cornwall, Ont. It’s one of four dams between Lake Ontario and Montreal. The board has been adjusting the flow every day, sometimes twice a day, since the beginning of April, she said, to try to provide maximum flood relief to people who live along the shoreline of Lake Ontario and downstream. The dam hasn’t seen this much action since 1993, the last time Lake Ontario was this high. But the system can only handle so much. “This rainfall has been coming up from the Gulf of Mexico, swinging along and hitting Lake Erie, hitting Lake Ontario, going down the St. Lawrence river valley, and in the process hitting Ottawa,” she said, where snow melt has been mixing in with the river. “It’s just too much water everywhere.” Up to 70 millimetres of rain is expected this weekend in Toronto and surrounding areas, the same amount that usually falls over the entire month in the region, according to a Global News meteorologist. Scientists say extreme weather like flooding is likely to become more frequent in some regions due to climate change. Changing climate conditions are likely being caused by human activity, scientists say, and could be mitigated by reducing global consumption of fossil fuels, deforestation and changes to land-use. Faveri said it was difficult to draw a direct connection, but climate models do point to more extreme weather.",2017-05-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['canadas', 'ottawa', 'water', 'river', 'ontario', 'emergency', 'hitting', 'lake', 'climate', 'st', 'lawrence', 'flooding', 'dam', 'board', 'heart']",Canada,news article,English

760,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Back to school in the world's largest refugee camp - UNHCR,https://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2011/9/4e64e2ac9/school-worlds-largest-refugee-camp.html,"First day of school for Somali refugees at the new Ifo 2 Primary School in Dadaab, Kenya. © UNHCR/S.Perham

DADAAB, Kenya, September 5 (UNHCR) - The new academic year got under way on Monday in the world's largest refugee camp complex, with some 43,000 Somali children turning up for classes at Dadaab in north-east Kenya.

Some, particularly those who have arrived in the last three months, are going to school for the first time. But enrolment rates among the estimated 156,000 children of school age are relatively low in Dadaab's camps, which have 19 primary schools and six secondary schools.

Many of those entering school were among the more than 100,000 Somali refugees who have arrived in Dadaab since June after fleeing conflict, drought and famine in their homeland, bringing the refugee population here close to 470,000.

""These children are in strong need of the routine and protection that school provides,"" said Linda Kjosaas, the UNHCR education officer in Dadaab. ""Circumstances here are far from ideal and we should be providing them with much more, but children are happy and, talking to their parents, it is clear that they value education highly.""

At the recently opened refugee site called Ifo 2, boys played football and girls skipped in the courtyard of a brand new primary school on Monday. ""Most of these children have arrived this year from Somalia,"" said the headmaster, Mohammed Abdullahi Bashir. ""We decided to open the school two weeks earlier to give them a chance to catch up.""

So far, about 1,100 children have been enrolled at this school and 11 of the school's 24 classrooms have been filled. ""Every day more children are enrolling,"" Bashir added.

Very few of the new arrivals received any formal education in Somalia. To help them cope, UNHCR's partner, CARE, recently began an accelerated learning programme to teach them basic literacy and numeracy skills. Some 1,500 children between the ages of five and 13 benefitted from this programme.

The schools at Dadaab follow the Kenyan education curriculum. There are also private and religious schools, adult literacy centres and four vocational training centres for refugee and local youth.

With the large influx of refugees from Somalia this year, more than half of whom are children, the demand for classrooms, desks, stationery, textbooks and teachers in Dadaab has increased dramatically - at least 75 new schools will need to be built.

Currently, there is only one teacher for every 100 pupils. In some of the schools, teachers work double shifts, teaching one group of children in the morning and another in the afternoon. Most of the teachers are refugees themselves. For teenagers, opportunities to start or continue formal education are few.

Because of overcrowding, most of the refugees arriving from Somalia this year settled outside the three existing camps with little access to basic services. In recent weeks, UNHCR has been transferring these refugees to two new sites. To date, some 30,000 refugees have been relocated to the new sites, where UNHCR is building temporary schools for 14,000 children.

From boats bobbing on the Great Barrier Reef to hot air balloons hovering over the rainforest, and the hilltops and beaches in between, tens of thousands of scientists, tourists and amateur astronomers watched in awe as the sun, moon and Earth aligned and plunged northern Australia into darkness.



Forecasters were predicting cloudy skies around dawn Wednesday, but it didn't materialise, allowing stargazers to experience it unhindered.



The eclipse began at 05.45 in the far north of the Australian state, with totality occurring at 06.38 on November 14 (20.38 GMT).

'We were coming out this morning and there was a wee bit of cloud around and we were apprehensive,' Adam O'Malley of the Passions of Paradise dive company said by phone from his boat.



'We got a full view - absolutely breathtaking.'

HOW IT HAPPENED

An eclipse occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun, which darkens the sky and causes temperatures to drop. The eclipse will cast its 150-kilometer (95-mile) wide shadow starting at dawn in Australia's Northern Territory and then cross the northeast tip of the country before swooping east across the South Pacific.

The Moon's penumbral shadow produces a partial eclipse visible from a much larger region covering the South Pacific (including Australia and New Zealand), southern South America, and part of Antarctica.

Many worried that they would miss a rare chance to view the celestial phenomenon.

'There will be breaks in (the clouds), but it's just a matter of the luck of the draw whether you get a break at the right time,' said Queensland state Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Andrew Mostyn.

The eclipse cast its 150-kilometer (95-mile) wide shadow starting at dawn in Australia's Northern Territory and then crossed the northeast tip of the country before swooping east across the South Pacific.



No islands are in its direct path, so northern Australia is the only land where the full eclipse could be seen, said Geoff Wyatt, an astronomer with Sydney Observatory.



A partial eclipse was expected to be visible from east Indonesia, the eastern half of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and southern parts of Chile and Argentina.



Totality - the darkness that happens at the peak of the eclipse - lasted just over two minutes.



Among those sweating out the forecast was U.S. astronomer Jay Pasachoff, who traveled to Australia in hopes of viewing his 56th solar eclipse.



Pasachoff, an astronomy professor at Williams College in Massachusetts, and a team of about 50 scientists and students fanned out across the region to improve the odds that at least some of them will see the eclipse.

The group is planning to study the sun's corona, the glowing white ring around the sun that is visible only during an eclipse.



Despite the anxiety over the weather and the long journey to get there, Pasachoff said he wouldn't miss it.



'Just imagine you were a heart surgeon and someone actually told you you could look inside a human heart only for two minutes, and only if you went halfway around the world, he said. 'You would do it.'



Some Queensland hotels have been booked up for more than three years and more than 50,000 people flooded into the region to watch the solar spectacle, said Jeff Gillies, regional director of Queensland Tourism.

Skygazers crowded beaches, boats, fields and hot air balloons to watch the event. Fitness fanatics raced in the Solar Eclipse Marathon, where the first rays of the sun re-emerging from behind the moon served as the starting gun.



Some have already been partying for days at a weeklong eclipse festival.



Scientists will be studying how animals respond to the eclipse, with underwater cameras capturing the effects of sudden darkness on the creatures of the Great Barrier Reef.



'It's an unknown with how they'll react,' Gillies said. 'A little bit of flora and fauna confusion, I would imagine.'



The last total solar eclipse visible in Australia was 10 years ago, in the South Australia Outback.

643,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Daniele De Rossi debut: Boca Juniors signing is the most romantic transfer of the summer - Goal,https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-most-beautiful-transfer-of-the-summer-roma-legend-de/va59uvkia1bb1o6x1mga4q1gs,"The most romantic transfer of the summer – Roma legend De Rossi set to make Boca Juniors debut

The World Cup winner has spurned the usual pre-retirement payday to pursue his dream of winning the Copa Libertadores with the Argentine giants

As a footballer approaches the end of his playing days, the last decision he must make is the stage he chooses for his final flourish. Some, like Francesco Totti or Ryan Giggs, remain faithful to the club which saw them grow from their very first days and bow out where it all began.

Others may choose to drop down a division in a bid to prolong their career a few more years. For South American greats, an emotional homecoming in the vein of Diego and Gabriel Milito, Carlos Tevez or Maxi Rodriguez might be on the cards. There is also the promise of a final huge payday in the shape of China or the Middle East, where the dip in quality is more than compensated by the astronomical wages on offer.

Few, however, choose to take the sort of leap into the dark that Daniele De Rossi opted for this summer. The Roma great and World Cup winner signed terms with Argentine giants Boca Juniors, spurning guaranteed millions to enter one of the most cut-throat, intense footballing nations on the planet.

It might be hard at times, submerged as we are in a sea of unscrupulous agents, contracts barely worth the paper on which they are written and slick commercial operations to find a shred of romance left in football. De Rossi, though, shows that there is still some magic and beauty in the game.

De Rossi's adventure in Argentina begins on Tuesday in the most intriguing of fashions. The city of La Plata plays host to Boca's Copa Argentina last-32 clash against second-tier Almagro, with the Italian set to line up against a group of veterans, young hopefuls and journeymen desperate to cause an upset.

His Superliga debut will probably follow on Sunday at the Bombonera against Aldosivi; with the stadium only open to home fans due to the six-year ban on visitors put in place because of endemic match-day violence between organised hooligan groups. Even that restriction is often not enough to avoid trouble, as Boca experienced first-hand last November when their coach was destroyed by missiles thrown by River Plate fans on their way to the Monumental, and River in turn back in 2015 during that infamous pepper spray attack inside the Bombonera suffered at the hands of a Xeneize supporter.

If that fact gives De Rossi a taste of the instability and difficulties faced in Argentina, another came on Monday: the local currency devalued by more than 25 per cent in a matter of hours and stock markets crashed over 30% on the back of nothing more than the result of the previous day's primary presidential election.

Why, then, would De Rossi forego a quiet, lucrative stroll towards retirement in favour of waltzing merrily into the wolf's lair? His relationship with Nicolas Burdisso, a former Roma team-mate and current Boca director of football, was logically key to pulling off this blockbuster transfer. But there was another, less tangible motive for the elegant midfielder, the chance to step where almost no European has ever dared to tread and conquer South America.

“Those who knew me best saw straight away that all roads inevitably were leading me to Boca,” the 36-year-old enthused in an interview with the club's official website. “Even when I thought I might go elsewhere, in the end it was always Boca.

“Winning a big tournament here would truly be the crowning moment of my career, an incredible dream.”

Given a hero's welcome upon his arrival in Buenos Aires at the end of July, De Rossi has wasted no time in settling in to his new environs. Obligatory trips to the city's famous steakhouses and other local landmarks have been eagerly followed by the local press, while Boca fans were driven wild by his meeting with club legend Diego Maradona.

""The guy is a multimillionaire, he was earning €12 million a year at Roma and now he's coming to our country, where people would kill for a pair of shoes,"" Diego told La Red in his usual inimitable style after that chat.

""He said he came because he saw me in my box at a game when we played in the [Copa] Libertadores or against River Plate.""

The mention of River is far from coincidental to this story. Bruised and humiliated by 2018's final defeat at the hands of their arch-rivals in the unlikely surroundings of Madrid, the pressure on Boca to win their first Libertadores since 2007 is higher than ever this time round.

As well as De Rossi the likes of Argentina international Eduardo Salvio and Venezuela prodigy Jan Hurtado joined in the off-season, as did Brighton's Alexis MacCallister on loan. As fate would have it, victories for both Boca and River in their Copa quarters would set up yet another continental Superclasico, no less a matter of life and death for taking place in the last four.

When the Italian speaks of a “big tournament,” it is the Libertadores he has in mind. The lure and romance of the famous old trophy brought him halfway across the world to Buenos Aires and he does not plan on squandering the opportunity: “I am motivated by playing football and by the passion I feel when I play serious football. This is a club that will allow me to play at an excellent level, just as I like it.”

Tuesday's clash against tiny Almagro represents the first chapter of what will be one of the most gripping football stories of 2019, as De Rossi looks to conquer the hearts of Boca's famously raucous support and end their Copa drought once and for all. His transfer may not have caught the most headlines and it certainly does not rank among the most lucrative in this current window; but in terms of pure romantic appeal few will match it over the summer.",2019-08-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['debut', 'la', 'boca', 'football', 'diego', 'libertadores', 'transfer', 'daniele', 'romantic', 'juniors', 'signing', 'river', 'copa', 'end', 'summer', 'rossi', 'roma']",Ghana,news article,English
1310,FL-2021-000021-IND,"Uttarakhand disaster likely caused by landslide, not glacial outburst, satellite images reveal - ThePrint",https://theprint.in/science/uttarakhand-chamoli-disaster-likely-caused-by-landslide-not-glacial-outburst-satellite-images-reveal/600859/,"Text Size: A- A+

Coimbatore: International geologists and glaciologists studying satellite imagery say the cause of the Chamoli flooding disaster in Uttarakhand appears to be a landslide and not a glacial outburst as widely believed.

The first identification was done by Dr Dan Shugar of University of Calgary, who specialises in high altitude glacial and geologic environments. Shugar used satellite images from Planet Labs, captured before and after the disaster, to deduce that a landslide triggered the catastrophic flash floods along the Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers, as also evidenced by a trail of dust visible in the satellite imagery.

Actrually, it looks like it may have been a landslide from just W of the glacier. See here. Possibly from the steep hanging glacier in the middle of the Google Earth image. pic.twitter.com/6ImcwI91d7 — Dr Dan Shugar (@WaterSHEDLab) February 7, 2021

Earlier reports stated that the flooding was caused by a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), which occurs when a natural lake is formed from a glacial ice melt and the lake is breached. However, available satellite images seemingly do not show the presence of a glacial lake before the flooding event.

No lakes of any size visible on the surface but unfortunately the satellite imagery doesn't show farther upvalley and so can't tell if it was from a large supraglacial landslide that might have broken up the glacier. — Dr Dan Shugar (@WaterSHEDLab) February 7, 2021

Instead, glaciologists and geologists identified a steeply hanging bit of a glacier which likely developed a crack and caused a landslide, triggering an avalanche and the subsequent flooding.

Images from Copernicus’s Sentinel 2 satellite also showed the formation or opening of a crack in the Nanda Devi glacier that is believed to have triggered the landslide.

What likely happened

In all likelihood, a steep, hanging portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off at Trishuli, in what is called a ‘rockslope detachment’. This potentially caused nearly 2,00,000 square metres of ice to drop 2 kilometres vertically, causing a landslide, impacting the valley floor and shattering instantly. This debris, rock, and ice then flowed downslope in the form of an avalanche, identified by the dust trail in the satellite imagery.

This avalanche flowed onto the glacier itself. Such intense flows of rock can cause tremendous heat generation, melting ice and causing transient, slushy lakes and/or water flows.

Additionally, there was likely more ice-cored moraine, or ice covered by sediment, as well as stagnant glacial ice downstream, as identified by Matt Westoby, a physical geography lecturer specialising in glacial analysis in Northumbria University.

These large volumes of ice, spanning nearly 3.5 km, would have further melted due to the heat generated by the landslide and avalanche, leading to the huge volumes of water that flooded the rivers.

It's late, and I'm squinting, but looks to be ~3.5km-worth of stagnant glacier/ice-cored moraine downstream of the point where the avalanche hit the valley floor. If so, there's your source of additional water for flow bulking. pic.twitter.com/cuGMRCxXGC — Matt Westoby (@MattWestoby) February 7, 2021

This theory was confirmed by landslide experts too. According to Dave Petley of University of Sheffield, the event is similar to the 2012 Seti river flooding in Nepal, which was also triggered by a rockslope failure.

Saurabh Vijay, assistant professor at IIT-Roorkee who studies glaciers, identified from satellite images large amounts of freshly fallen snow over the last week that likely contributed to both the avalanche and the volume of water.

Adding Feb 2 image to Feb 6 and 7 images indicates the role of freshly fallen snow cover in inducing massive landslide. Needs further investigation though. @GlacierResearch @BhambriRakesh @irrfank pic.twitter.com/XBEZAzPbrc — Saurabh Vijay (@saurabhvergia) February 7, 2021

While landslide-triggered flows could cause enough heat to form temporary, transient dams of water that get quickly washed away in a flooding event, the event is not a ‘glacial outburst’.

What is GLOF?

A GLOF event is where a naturally formed lake of glacial meltwater is breached, causing a catastrophic release of large volumes of water downstream.

Glaciers on mountain tops and the sides of mountains accumulate ice from snowfall. This ice melts in a process called ablation, adding water to downstream water bodies and rivers. The process is continuous and is a part of the Earth’s natural water cycle.

As a glacier retreats, i.e., reduces in size because of melting, it leaves sediments in the melted freshwater in the form of clay and sand as well as rocks, boulders, and gravel. These deposits often create natural dams called moraines that contain meltwater within.

These natural dams or glacial lakes can overflow or be punctured/breached, leading to flooding downstream.

Breaching of moraines can be triggered by avalanches, earthquakes or a natural collapse of moraines due to excessive pressure from water. Also contributing to GLOFs are anthropogenic (human-induced) activities such as deforestation and pollution, which change local climate. Pollution exacerbates the potential for disasters through the release of black soot particles, which can settle on ice, absorbing more heat and accelerating melting.

Fragmentation of glacial ice can also trigger a breach in terminal moraines or dam boundaries, either through direct impact or by displacement waves, which compromise the stability of the dam. This is what was originally suspected to have occurred in Chamoli.

It is as yet unclear what triggered the original landslide that led to this week’s disaster. Newer satellite imagery, survey data, and further investigations are expected to reveal more information over the next few days.

Award-winning DJ Joe Mfalme has something to celebrate despite all that transpired in his life over the last couple of weeks. While celebrating his wife Ephy Preston, the DJ penned a sweet yet brief message to the love of his life on Instagram.

“Every now and then someone comes into your life and they turn it upside down in a good way, and you are that someone for me! You are my Jaber and I wish you a very happy birthday. To my beautiful 1st lady, I hope this year brings you as much joy and happiness that you have brought and continue to bring into my life”, read the caption.

Mrs Mfalme responded by describing him as her pillar of strength. ""What a wonderful message to wake up to ???? thank you babe????, you are my pillar of strength. I love you????.

Netizens were quick to flood his timeline with birthday messages to his lady upon this.

Dj Joe Mfalme was among those whose jobs were terminated for victim shaming on-air with regards to the case of Wangari Wakimbi on their morning show, Lift Off. His co-hosts, media personalities Shaffie Weru and Neville were also among those fired in a topic that gained nationwide attention. DJ Joe Mfalme [Courtesy]

Trouble ensued for the trio when a video recording of them making insensitive sentiments on the plight of Eunice Wangari Wakimbi, who was pushed off the 12th floor of a building by a man she met on Facebook surfaced online stirring anger among Kenyan netizens and activists.

In a statement dated March 27, Radio Africa stated that the decision was reached after a comprehensive review of the comments made on the station’s Thursday morning show, adding that the topic in discussion was neither approved nor authorized by the management.

According to the statement, the company had established that the conduct of the three constituted gross misconduct leading to a breach of the company’s editorial policy.",2021-04-14 07:16:28+00:00,"['wakimbi', 'lady', 'dj', 'wife', 'strength', 'sweet', 'life', 'message', 'wangari', 'topic', 'joe', 'statement', '1st', 'mfalme', 'pens', 'birthday']",Kenya,news article,English

As the world battles a pandemic, large swaths of the African continent have been â??literally â?? submerged by floods.

Since March, this crisis has left more than 400 people dead in East Africa. A separate round of flooding has hit West Africaâ??s Sahel region.

In Uganda, Catholic Relief services estimates that as many as 580,000 people are affected.

Country director Niek de Goeij says ""It's kind of affecting all kinds of people. You know, in Kampala, our capital city, it affects people who have nice houses on the lakeshore. But if you are in the Mount Elgon area, on the border with Kenya; or you're in the Kasese area, on the border with the D.R. Congo, and youâ??re a smallholder farmer normally benefits from farming on a river bank. And suddenly thereâ??s this raging flash floods that comes down to hills and mountains because of this very intense rainfall â?? you know, you lose everything. You lose your house, you lose your land. And so it's a very diverse group of people that is affected.â?

In the eastern town of Jinja, along the shores of Lake Victoria, radio host and environmental activist John Hillary says flooding doesnâ??t just destroy homes it ruins the very fabric that holds society together.

â??The public hospital, the only public hospital in the Chilembwe region, was completely destroyed. So people as a result of the floods got sick. But they could not get anywhere else to go to because the hospital had been destroyed,â? he said.

De Goeij says heavy rainfall is normal in East Africa â?? what isnâ??t, he says, is their frequency and intensity. And, he says, the pandemic makes it harder for groups like his to respond.

â??It's like a triple crisis in Uganda, right? We have the locusts, we have all the floods. And then, on top of everything else, we have COVID-19. And so it's been, for the affected people, itâ??s been an especially hard year, you know, to be on a lockdown and be affected by floods, and then because of the lockdown, accessing the support and the relief that that they're entitled to,â? he said.

Hillary, who speaks often about climate change on his radio show, says that to him and other activists, this is personal.

â??My mom is a gardener. My grandparents, and many people in my family, are farmers. That's what I've known,"" he said. ""Growing up, I always went with my mom to the garden to dig, and we ate food from the gardens. Over time, we have noticed that, because of what I think is negligence, we have been involved in practices that have completely destroyed our rain cycle, our climate is deteriorating every other day. I'm only 26. I have seen over time my world deteriorating. I don't want to see the same for my children.â?

This, he says, is a living nightmare.

Action Against Hunger, Kenya

In Kenya, Action Against Hunger is helping communities displaced by deadly flooding

When mudslides and heavy rainfall struck the area of Chesegon Center in West Pokot County, Kenya, in April, dozens of people were killed, 2,000 were displaced, and many more lost their livelihoods.

Floods happen quickly, but for families who lost everything, recovery after disaster takes months, even years. Action Against Hungerâ??s teams in West Pokot were there every step of the way to help, even after the waters receded.

With support from the Fields Foundation, Action Against Hunger quickly launched an emergency response to help the neediest families. Our teams distributed crucial supplies, provided lifesaving nutrition services, and promoted healthy hygiene to prevent the spread of disease.

We also installed new handwashing stations and provided primary health services. Additionally, we continue to train and support health volunteers in West Pokot, who work each day to improve hygiene, nutrition, and health in their communities.

HELPING THOSE DISPLACED BY FLOODING

Eveline Kutoyi, a 40-year-old woman, barely survived the floods. The raging waters â?? which carried rocks and logs in the torrent â?? swept her miles away from Chesegon Center, leaving her with bruises and a broken leg.

She recovered from her injuries, but after being discharged from the hospital, Eveline realized she had lost everything, including her farm. While thankful that her life had been spared, she could not escape the pain of her loss and the uncertainty of how to start her life over.

â??I felt like all the wounds on my body were open, I was heartbroken, and my life was frozen,â? she remembers.

Eveline and her four children found refuge with another family, who offered to host them for two months â?? but life was not the same again. They would sleep on rags, recycle clothing, share plates during meals, and share basic items like soap and even bathe without it when they ran out.

In June, Eveline received a jerrican, mattress, bucket, laundry detergent, soap, a dignity kit with feminine hygiene supplies, and a kitchen set from Action Against Hunger and the Field Foundation. To Eveline, they were â??life changers.â?

â??I did not have money to buy soap or [cooking pots] of high quality like the ones I received,"" says Eveline. ""We used to sleep on rags during the cold nights, but life changed when we received mattresses. Iâ??m so grateful to Action Against Hunger for restoring our dignity back.â?

IMPROVING HYGIENE & SANITATION

When the floods hit Chesegon Center, families lost their homes and access to clean water, hygiene supplies, and safe sanitation, as well as health and nutrition services. Living in displacement camps, the most vulnerable populations faced a higher risk of diarrhea, malaria, respiratory infections, and malnutrition.

To prevent the spread of disease among the displaced, Action Against Hunger worked with community health volunteers (CHVs) to spread the word about good hygiene practices, healthy child care and feeding, and COVID-19 preventive measures. The CHVs also helped with active case finding.

Faith Chesuko, who has been working as a CHV for more than three years, found the trainings on handwashing and hygiene very effective. She understood her responsibility to practice what she had learned and pass it on to her community. In her own home, she installed a homemade â??tippy tapâ? for handwashing, a dish rack, and kept everything swept and clean.

All of these changes were the result of her training. â??Initially, the only times I thought it was important to wash my hands were before and after eating but now I understand that there are other critical times for handwashing,â? she says.

Faith enjoys her role as community educator: she visits homes, spreads the word, and feels motivated by her neighborsâ?? trust and willingness to change. With her encouragement, hygiene and sanitation practices are improving. Throughout the village, improvised handwashing stations, compost pits, dish racks, and latrines built with local materials started appearing.

â??The lives of the community members have not been the same since I started teaching them. They now understand the importance of handwashing, the need to have a toilet and the importance of clean and safe water,â? says Faith.

Before her visits, community members would drink water directly from rivers and streams, without treating it. Many families did not have latrines or toilets in their homes and used the forests and fields instead â?? resulting in contaminated water and sickness.

Now, according to Faithâ??s records, diarrhea has significantly decreased. Before, she treated or referred as many as 20 diarrhea cases in a month, but sheâ??s had just six cases in the last two months.

â??I am so grateful for the training I received from Action Against Hunger,â? says Faith. â??It has given me the confidence to walk into houses and share the knowledge. I am excited to save the lives of my community.â?",2020-08-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['hunger', 'hygiene', 'hope', 'action', 'received', 'handwashing', 'community', 'lost', 'health', 'kenya', 'water', 'floods', 'life']",Kenya,news article,English
1100,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Why is basement flooding on the rise across Canada? - Insurance Business Canada,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/flood/why-is-basement-flooding-on-the-rise-across-canada-188720.aspx,"Flooding is also exacerbated by the loss of natural infrastructure and the ageing of municipal infrastructure. Filippi commented: “More and more people are moving into higher density cities and areas. This is causing a loss of natural infrastructure. Many local municipalities in Canada don’t have a lot of money. How do they make their money? They let developers build new homes and they collect taxes from them. But what’s happening is that they’re taking away a lot of that natural infrastructure – the trees, the wetlands and the parks.

“Natural infrastructure allows for more infiltration when there’s major rainfall. If you’re developing or paving over that natural infrastructure, the water is going to go to the lowest common denominator, and that’s going to be the homes at lowest level in that city or municipality. They’re the ones that are going to be flooded first, and they’re the ones that are going to be seeing these costly basement claims. Ageing infrastructure creates similar problems. Municipalities aren’t updating infrastructure enough because they don’t have the money, which again causes water infiltration issues.”

Another key issue causing a rise in basement flooding is the lack of flood protection measures at a household level. This is where the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation hopes its Home Flood Protection Program will start to make some waves. Launched in 2016, the residential flood risk reduction education program helps Canadians by providing free online flood protection resources, training programs, and a nationally applicable flood risk assessment tool.

“A lot of homeowners don’t know how to implement simple flood risk management in their basements,” said Filippi. “According to the IBC, the average cost for homeowners to repair their damaged basement is $43,000. But as more people are finishing their basements, that’s where they’re keeping the lifeblood of their homes – the water heater, the AC, all of this important stuff - which is going to be impacted first in the event of a flood. The basement, which historically used to be a storage area for people is now a new living area as people try to grow the square footage of their home.”

According to the Home Flood Protection Program, there are three steps homeowners can take to reduce their risk of basement flooding and lower the cost of clean-up if flooding occurs. The first step revolves around maintenance and involves things homeowners can do themselves for no additional cost. It includes actions like: removing debris from storm drains, cleaning out eaves troughs, maintaining plumbing fixtures, testing sump pumps, and cleaning out backwater valves.

The second step involves completing simple home upgrades, often for less than $250. That might be installing window well covers, installing flood alarms, extending downspouts and sump discharge pipes at least two metres from the home foundation, and buying watertight containers to store valuable or hazardous materials.

Finally, the third step homeowners can take involves making more complex upgrades, which often requires work with a contractor and can cost over $250. A few suggestions include: installing a backup sump pump and battery, installing a backwater valve, correcting the grading to direct water away from a home’s foundation, and installing window wells. For some of the items in this step, some municipalities offer flood protection subsidies, so homeowners and brokers are advised to check on that before making the investment.",2019-10-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['rise', 'water', 'infrastructure', 'theyre', 'homeowners', 'going', 'canada', 'protection', 'flood', 'basement', 'installing', 'flooding', 'step']",Canada,news article,English
61,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Ugly sight awaits flooded cars' owners at UCLA stadium lot - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ucla-cars-20140806-story.html,"They came in all makes and models — old and new, red, black and phantom gray.

They had names: “Zippy,” “the Philly Mobile.”

And they carried memories — of trips to Disneyland, the beach and big moves to Los Angeles.

But on Tuesday, in an obscure baseball stadium parking lot just west of the 405 Freeway, almost all of the 340 mud-covered cars lined up next to one another had at least one thing in common.

Advertisement

“It’s pretty clear that these cars are not going to be drivable ever again,” UCLA spokesman Tod Tamberg said. “These cars are finished.”

In sharp contrast to the jubilant relief Friday at UCLA Lot 36, Tuesday’s scene was one of disappointment and anxiety. Rather than driving triumphantly off the lot in unharmed cars, the students, staff and campus visitors assembled at Jackie Robinson Stadium could only stare, smell and wait.

University and insurance officials said they expected almost all of the cars — flooded by last week’s catastrophic DWP water pipeline break — to be deemed total losses. Owners had their first chance to see their property in person Tuesday, and what they saw as they pulled onto Constitution Avenue wasn’t pretty.

Most cars were caked with dirt and debris over the hood and up to the windows. Some vehicles had a white layer of paint from the garage ceiling plastered onto their roofs. A few had their windows down and their trunks popped open.

“It feels like Costa Rica,” Kyle Hasenstab, 27, said as he cracked open the door to his Toyota Yaris.

“Oh, it smells!” his wife, Susan, said, before asking, “You want your sunglasses?”

The cars towed to the baseball field were deemed the most damaged of the more than 900 that officials estimate were parked in lots 4 and 7. The two parking structures were flooded when a trunk line ruptured on Sunset Boulevard, sending more than 20 million gallons of water cascading onto UCLA’s campus and nearby streets.

After a lengthy closure, the stretch of Sunset near the university was reopened Monday. On Tuesday, Department of Water and Power Senior Assistant General Manager Jim McDaniel told the board overseeing the department that the pipe that had ruptured showed extensive corrosion both inside and out and had been welded with a technique no longer in use.

Spokesman Joe Ramallo said “the LADWP has accepted responsibility for the event and ... will evaluate claims for damages and will pay for documented, necessary and reasonable losses.”

Adjusters from the department and multiple insurance agencies were on scene assisting vehicle owners with claims.

A claims adjuster inspected Eugene Acosta’s Honda Pilot as the 39-year-old UCLA staffer gingerly slipped on plastic gloves and placed damp jumper cables, a CD case, a stroller and an anti-theft device onto the asphalt.

Acosta came armed with a camera and a spreadsheet listing dozens of his personal effects and their costs.

“You spend hard-earned money for your stuff,” he said. “For a freak accident like this you want to make sure everything is properly replaced.”

The father of two said that immediately after the flood started, he tried to retrieve his SUV from Parking Lot 4 but was knee-deep in water about 15 feet from the vehicle when fire personnel shooed him away. That night, he said, he saw a photo showing a nearby car submerged in window-high water and told a friend: “I just want to cry.”

But by Tuesday, Acosta was busy detailing the damage, stewing over whether he’d get fair market value for his family’s trusty vehicle.

When it was all over, the adjuster told Acosta he was being transferred to a different representative with the total-loss unit. And he could say goodbye to the car: It would be towed away for the last time soon.

“I actually got a day off so today I need another distraction,” Acosta said as his boys squirmed at his side. “We’re going to the zoo.”
