The Fraser Valley was hit with a catastrophic flood that spring, a disaster that left a third of the region overwhelmed by dirty water.

More than 16,000 people were forced from their homes, many of which were destroyed. More than 22,000 hectares flooded.

The Toop family — three back then — had about 100 cows between them. Allan remembers shepherding them to higher ground after the nearby dike broke.

They milked the cows by hand for two weeks before they could go home. Toop, now 87, thought it was an adventure then.

Looking back, he sees the disaster for what it was.

""There was water right up to the eaves in many of the houses,"" he said.

""It was on the murky side, to say the least. I don't want to see it again, I can tell you that.""

This spring marks 70 years since that flood.

In late May of 1948, an enormous snowpack coupled with an unusually warm, late spring sent disastrous amounts of snow melt into the valley. It wasn't long before the Fraser River overflowed.

Abbotsford, Chilliwack and Mission were the hardest hit. Rich farmland disappeared beneath a sea of filthy, brown water. Hundreds of houses were swallowed up.

The Canadian National Railway line and the Trans-Canada Highway rail lines were flooded, cutting southwestern B.C. off from the rest of Canada.

Canadian Armed Forces were dispatched to help fix overwhelmed dikes and lay more sandbags. The Red Cross was called to provide fresh food and clean clothes to sodden evacuees.

When the waters receded two weeks later, people returned home to black sludge coating their walls. Damages came to about $20 million — around $215 million by today's standards.

It would take years for the agricultural region to recover.

Historian Jane Watt interviewed more than 100 people for a book about the disaster, High Water. Many lived through the flood or had family who did.

She said the flood changed the way the region saw the Fraser River. Towns invested more in flood prevention work to prevent another catastrophe.

""People took the river for granted then,"" Watt said. ""Then people start to respect it again.""

Watt said nearly all of her interviewees — like Toop — remember hometown resilience before anything else.

""As much devastation as there was, what people really carry with them nowadays was that kindness and that community gathering,"" she said. ""Across the board.""

Toop still lives in the same area of Chilliwack today. His son and grandson have taken over the family farm.

The valley is preparing for another bad flooding season, with the Fraser River already under a high streamflow advisory.

Allan said his family won't move, even if hell and high water return.

""Oh good God, no,"" he said. ""We're not going anywhere.""",2018-05-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['toop', 'remembering', '70', 'swallowed', 'water', 'disaster', 'river', 'high', 'valley', 'later', '1948', 'flood', 'nearly', 'fraser', 'family']",Canada,news article,English

Asharq Al-Awsat

A collision between a cargo ship and a fishing boat left 17 people missing off Indonesia’s main island of Java, officials said Sunday.

The fishing boat with 32 aboard capsized after hitting the Indonesian bulk carrier MV Habco Pioneer late Saturday off Indramayu district, said the head of the Search and Rescue Agency, Deden Ridwansyah.

Fifteen were rescued from the fishing boat and local fishermen and the navy were searching for the others, said Wisnu Wardana, a spokesperson for the sea transportation directorate general.

The cargo ship, which was loaded with crude oil from Borneo island, was moored after its propeller got caught in the fishing net, Ridwansyah said.

Also Sunday, rescue officials said that at least 23 people were killed and two are still missing after flash floods swept an island in Indonesia's easternmost province.

Hours before people woke to celebrate Easter, torrential rain unleashed flash floods in the Catholic-majority Flores Island.

Mud inundated homes, while bridges and roads in the eastern end of the island were destroyed, according to National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Raditya Jati.

Rescuers are struggling to reach the remote and worst-hit area in East Flores regency.

""The only access there is by the sea from Adonara Island, but the rains -- as well as strong waves -- have prevented any crossing,"" Jati told AFP on Sunday.

Extreme weather is expected to continue in the coming week, he added.

Separately on Sunday, major floods also killed two people in Bima city in the neighboring province of West Nusa Tenggara, according to the disaster agency.",2021-04-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['rain', 'ship', 'sea', 'boat', 'cargo', '17', 'missing', 'fishing', 'indonesia', 'spokesperson', 'island', 'rescue', 'agency', 'collision', 'floods']",India,news article,English
1517,FL-2017-000126-NGA,Flooding as a disaster waiting to happen - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/flooding-as-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen/,"The rains are here again. Rather than being a blessing, the rains have become a curse to many Nigerians, especially to coastal states and communities living along the bank of Rivers Niger and Benue. The federal government has issued a flood alert. Will the 2021 predictions go the way of others? TONY AKOWE reports

Since the devastating flood in Nigeria in 2012, it has become important for the government and its agency to make an annual forecast of possible flood and its impact in the country annually. Since the first forecast was made in 2013, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, working with other government agencies, has consistently warned the nation of impending flood across the country and in most cases, the intensity of such flood. Unfortunately, warnings by the agencies have often been ignored by both the people and state governments and their agencies. This year, the government has said not less than 121 local government areas across 28 states are at highly probable risk of heavy flooding, while another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will experience some level of flooding.

Flooding is categorised into river flooding, coastal flooding as well as flash and urban flooding occasioned by poor drainages, blocked drainages and poor adherence to town planning regulations.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) said flooding accounts for 15% of all natural disaster related deaths across the globe.

Floods have since become annual phenomena not only in flood plains, but also in urban and semi-urban areas. Experts link urban flooding to inadequacies of drainage channels that have become too small to contain excess runoff, the use of river channels as waste repositories thus clogging the channels, poor compliance with or non-existence of land use zoning/building codes, poor waste management practices, and removal of vegetation that create resistance and minimise flood impact. Coastal areas of Nigeria are not spared from flooding as they may be worst hit by flood this year. Interestingly, more states in Nigeria are increasingly suffering from annual flooding due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Unfortunately, Nigeria is located downstream of Rivers Niger and Benue, and therefore abounds with water resources that become a menace by causing flooding and flood disasters, the worst of which was experience in 2012 when hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property loss running into billions of naira including massive farm lands and crops when water was released from the a dam in Cameroon.

A close study of the predictions revealed that all the 20 local government areas in Lagos State (as against 18 in 2020) are likely to be affected with eight of them being at higher risk of heavy flooding. Apart from urban and river flooding, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Delta and Ondo states stand the risk of heavy coastal flooding. In 2020, similar predictions by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency and advice to states and local government areas to take precautionary measure to mitigate the flood fell on deaf ears in most parts of the country. The consequence was the displacement of over 2.3 million people and the death of 69 others. The outcome was also the washing away of farm lands in Kebbi and Jigawa as well as livestock and other valuables. The agency has continuously expressed concern over disregard for town planning regulations leading to people building on flood plains.

Minister for Water Resources Suleiman Adamu, who announced the 2021 prediction on behalf of the agency, said 121 local government areas in 28 states and the FCT as well as another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will likely experience high and moderate flooding in 2021. Acting on information from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, the minister also said there would be heavy coastal flooding in Rivers, Cross Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states. He stressed the need for concerted efforts to mitigate the impact of the expected flood.

He said: So far, the flood levels will be higher than in previous years, but will not attain the levels of the 2012 devastating floods. In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 LGAs in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will fall within the moderate probable Flood Risk Areas. It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the Highly Probable Risk Areas. The states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience river flooding. These states and the number of local government likely to be affected include Abia (9), Akwa Ibom (2), Anambra (5), Bauchi (2), Bayelsa (5), Benue (3), Cross River (2), Delta (8), Ebonyi (4), Edo (1), FCT (2), Gombe (7), Imo (3), Jigawa (9), Kaduna (2), Kano (2), Kebbi (4), Kogi (9), Kwara (2), Lagos (8), Nasarawa (2), Niger (5), Ogun (3), Oyo (7), Rivers (12), Sokoto (7), Taraba (7) and Zamfara (1).

The list of states to be affected by one form of flood or the other in 2021 show that northern and coastal states are at a greater risk of flooding this year, with some states along the River Niger and Benue are also likely to be affected. Adamu said flash and urban floods from heavy inundation were predicted to occur in some major cities, the severity of which would depend on the availability and adequacy of the drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.

He said: The information contained in the AFO 2021 is a Clarion call to all stakeholders, policy makers, Federal, States and Local Governments, Departments and Agencies to rise and set up appropriate mechanism such as clearing the waterways and flood paths as well as maintaining proper water disposal management practices to curtail the ravages of the impending flood and threats of COVID-19. The year 2012 is a landmark in the annals of flood occurrence in Nigeria. It brought with it massive destruction of lives, property and critical national infrastructure. The need arose therefore, to put in place a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront the menace of this disaster of flooding, hence the coming into being of APO in the year 2013. The 2021 Annual Flood Outlook built on the successes of the previous eight (8) years forecasts by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency. The outcomes of these forecasts have been the increased awareness by the citizenry with respect to measures that need to be taken before, during and after floods. This has culminated in the progressive reduction in the severity of flood and its harmful effects on lives and property. The timeliness in the release of these forecasts is quite commendable and deserving of every possible support by all of us.

He believed that mans interaction with natural process has been both helpful and harmful to some degree, adding that the negative impact of mans activities can be observed in the heightened climate change being experienced globally by way of rising temperatures, intensified rainfall, more destructive storms and floods. He maintained that the annual prediction by the agency is designed to create awareness of the inherent dangers of flooding and to inform people about locations that are prone to Flood risk at a particular time and encourage them to take appropriate actions.

Drawing attention to the 2020 experience, the minister said: The year 2020 saw the devastating impact of extreme flood across the country with practically every state of the federation affected in one way or the other. The flood affected 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 349 Local Government Areas (LGAs) within the 36 States were affected and over 2,353,647 people were displaced with a record of 69 deaths. Kebbi and Jigawa States were worst hit with regards to agricultural lands and houses destroyed. Apart from the physical damages, other indirect losses are often overlooked. These indirect and intangible impacts are generally associated with disruption to normal life as well as long term health issues and stress-related illnesses. We must recognise that extreme weather and flooding extents do happen and that we need to be well equipped to respond to them. I am confident that our communities, infrastructure and businesses will be better protected if due attention is given to the information contained in this 9th edition of the Annual Flood Outlook.

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs. Didi Walson-Jack, said: The overall objective of this event is to sensitise the nation (i.e planners, decision and policy makers, farmers, stakeholders) and the general public towards embarking on preventive measures to improve on safety and reduce potential damages to lives and property from predicted flood events.

She said the event was expected to provide ample opportunity for enlightenment campaigns in the media for better Preparedness on flood mitigation, control and management in flood risks locations across the country. She maintained that the accuracy of the predictions over the years have been fairly high and reliable, stressing however that the focus is rather on prevention and mitigation of possible flood disasters by increasing the awareness of the populace and prompting them to take appropriate preventive, adaptive and mitigative measures.

The Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd), stressed the need to strengthen multi-agency approach to disaster risk reduction in the country.

Mohammed said: To enhance flood forecasting and management in Nigeria, NEMA is currently supporting NIHSA in establishing three Automatic Weather Observation Stations which are at various stages of installation located in Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti and Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. These stations will be used not only for hydrological predictions but also to train students in the field of Geography, Engineering, Agriculture, meteorology, climate change and other sciences. He said further that one of the lessons learnt during the 2020 flood after action review meeting is the need for proper utilization of our dams in the country. When dams meant for irrigation purpose are used for dry season agriculture, they acquire more capacities to hold more water in the rainy season. In addition, a timely controlled release of water from dams will reduce panic release of water during rainy season that can lead to further flooding.

The Director-General of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze said government at all levels in the country must take necessary steps to avert a possible disastrous effect of flood in 2021. Nze said as the rains begin to set in, the country was gradually inching towards the peak of rainy season with its attendant flood incidents. He said Nigerias geographical location downstream of all the countries in the Niger Basin places it at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollution from all countries upstream, adding that this explain why persistent flooding has become an annual event since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster.

He argued that the annual flood forecast was to enable states and local government as well as individuals take concrete steps now to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past few years including clearing of blocked drainages and canals, removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinth and floats on water channels. People living along water ways as well as those having socio-economic activities in such areas should be encouraged to relocate o safer areas before the peak of rains, while there should also be an improved system for flood monitoring, flood forecasting and early warnings. He stressed that states must intensify soil conservation measuring techniques on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and encourage ecosystem protection, while also enhancing the enforcement of town planning code to allow for the construction of houses and drainage structures.

He said further that while it was not possible to eradicate flooding, efforts should be made to either reduce or minimise it, adding that state governments must educate their people, insisting that states must make efforts to avoid a repeat of the incidences of 2020 which saw over 450,000 hectare of rice plantation being washed away in Kebbi state alone as a result of flooding. Nzeh lamented that while the agency has continued to give early warning signs, many states in the country have failed to listen to the recommendations of the agency, adding that at the moment, Jigawa state has set up a committee that is working to reduce incidences of flooding in the state in line with recommendations from the agency.

The NIHSAs Director of Hydrogeophysics, Stephen Margima Jabo, said flooding has become a global phenomenon that has increased in frequency over the years. According to him, the effective management of flood risk should be a collective responsibility of all stakeholders from the federal, state, and local to individual levels, adding that the existing synergy between Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, stakeholders and other collaborative agencies involved in flood management and disaster issues should be further strengthened. He said government at all level should also put in place measures for better town planning and effective land use zoning, effective flood disaster management in the changing environment, improved biodiversity and ecosystem management for the enhancement of rapid and sustainable development in the country. States, he said should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers particularly, where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood waters will not be lost to the sea.

The agency said among others that stakeholders in the water sector should carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas by the removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers to improve their conveyance capacities and from dams, lakes and reservoirs to increase their storage capacities for the containment of the incoming floodwaters; there is need for construction of weirs, small reservoirs on tributary, streams and rivers for conservation of flood water to be used during the dry season thereby preventing desert encroachment, increasing irrigation food crop production, improvement of grassland areas, nomadic settlement, peace and sustainable development by relevant government agencies; intensification of soil conservation measuring technics on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and increase ecosystem protection among others; enforcement of Town Planning Codes in the country to allow for the appropriate construction of houses, and drainage structures and constantly freeing the waterways from obstructions and provision of adequate refuse dumping facilities by relevant authorities.",2021-05-11 00:15:10+00:00,"['water', 'flooding', 'happen', 'local', 'flood', 'waiting', 'states', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'country', 'state', 'areas']",Nigeria,news article,English
676,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Cocoa Famers' Cooperative Launched in Kumasi - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907240524.html,"Kumasi — A national farmer cooperative in the cocoa sector has been launched in Kumasi by the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) with support from the Ministry of Agriculture to influence farmers' perception about cocoa farming and encourage them to approach it as a business.

Among other aims behind the formation of the national cooperative is to facilitate the registration of farmer associations into sustainable societies that would work on behalf of their members for their mutual benefit.

Currently, a total of 1,342 cooperatives have been identified by the Cocoa Health and Extension Division, out of which 512 are cooperatives fully registered with the Department of Cooperatives.

A total number of 146,764 farmers comprising 101,796 cooperative members and 45,068 farmers belong to associations which are yet to be registered as cooperatives.

Addressing farmers and other dignitaries at the launch, the Chief Executive of COCOBOD, Mr Joseph Boahen Aidoo, enumerated COCOBOD's plans for the farmers and the cocoa sector, including plans to distribute motorised slashers for weeding through the cooperatives to the farmers and other productivity enhancement programmes.

He said COCOBOD would promote the establishment of individual service providers who would provide pruning, slashing and other essential farming services to farmers to make farming much easier.

According to Mr Aidoo, COCOBOD had plans to improve on the economic fortunes of farmers as they sought increment in producing prices at the world market.

He advised individual farmers to do well to join cooperatives and other unions so as to benefit from all government initiatives.

The Deputy Minister of Agriculture in charge of perennial crops, Mr George Boahen Oduro, indicated that the government was very committed to improving the lives of farmers, especially cocoa farmers.

According to him, cocoa farmers were being cherished by the government as a result of their contribution to the economy over the years, and so it was important for the government to work hard to improve on their economic conditions.

The National Chief Farmer and the President of Ghana Cocoa, Coffee and Shea nut Farmers, Alhaji Alhassan Bukari, who spoke on behalf of the unions noted that the group was for the collective good of all members and called on all farmers to be part.

He advised members to desist from partisan politics which had the potential of breaking the cooperatives and urged executives to follow the laid down rules that governed the association.",2019-07-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['kumasi', 'national', 'mr', 'farmers', 'cooperative', 'farming', 'members', 'launched', 'cocoa', 'cocobod', 'plans', 'ghana', 'famers', 'cooperatives']",Ghana,news article,English
146,Drought Sri Lanka,Ongoing drought; Sacred duty to save water - Opinion - Daily Mirror,http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Ongoing-drought-Sacred-duty-to-save-water-121689.html,"Rice has been Sri Lanka’s staple diet for thousands of years and our country was once known as the rice bowl of the region. But the Agriculture Department has warned that due to the lack of rain Sri Lanka may face a rice crisis by June this year and we may have to import our ‘buth patha’.



Agriculture Director General Rohan Wijekoon has said the lack of water for paddy cultivation is expected to drastically reduce rice production by June this year. According to him, there has already been a sharp drop in paddy cultivation during the current season. Paddy farmers had hoped to cultivate about 800,000 hectares yet they were able to cultivate only about 300,000 hectares last year. The Agriculture chief says that last year, Sri Lanka had a paddy harvest of 2.7 million metric tons — higher than our requirement of 2.2 million metric tons. As a result the buffer stocks will be sufficient till next month. The lack of rain has also reduced water levels in the tanks or ‘wewas’. The Irrigation Department has told the Agriculture Department that it will stop or cut down the amount of water provided to the paddy fields, because it needs to preserve water for drinking and other essential purposes.



Mr. Wijekoon says that farmers who expect to cultivate paddy during the Yala Season from April to September this year may not get enough water from the Irrigation Department as the tank levels are low.



According to the Irrigation Director General S.S.L. Weerasinghe, the water levels of the tanks had gone down to about one-third of the capacity. He says some tanks are filled with mud and silt. Therefore retaining water even during heavy rain is difficult.



Whoever or whatever is responsible for this crisis, whatever the mess up or mismanagement, we need to look at the possible solutions where not only the government but also eco-friendly and responsible citizens could get proactively involved.



For instance the people need to voluntarily and willingly save fresh water. This is not just to reduce our water bills but more so to participate actively in an eco-friendly move to save fresh water at a time when the supplies are running low and we do not have sufficient water for paddy cultivation.

During the past two decades the United States and other big powers have gone to war in Afghanistan and Iraq not just to curb terrorism but more so to gain control of oil and natural gas supplies. World political analysts have warned that in the coming decades worldwide fresh water supplies will be so low that big powers may even go to war to gain control of fresh water resources. Sri Lanka with so many big rivers and may be one of the targets.



While taking measures to prevent any such move to grab our fresh water resources, we also need to take steps to conserve water. If every responsible citizen could consciously save about 10 litres of water a day the overall saving will be millions of litres daily.



Going beyond that, more people need to go for the eco-friendly practice of rainwater harvesting. The internet has details of organisations where rain water experts rainwater could help families to install the equipment at a low cost.



Ages ago our great king Parakramabahu told us that not a single drop of rainwater should be allowed to go waste without using it for cultivation, drinking and other essential purposes. But today millions of litres of rainwater go waste while in times of drought the lives of farmers and others are severely affected. While responsible families need to act on the rainwater harvesting process the government also needs to revive an earlier plan to restore about 10,000 ‘wewas’ which have been acclaimed as marvels of ancient engineering.



This year being the year of poverty alleviation and the launching of the sustainable development strategy, the provision of water for drinking or other household purposes and for agriculture is vital. We urge the national government to provide incentives including tax concessions for household rainwater harvesting and also to give priority to the restoration of the ‘wewas’.",2017-01-05 08:00:00+00:00,"['need', 'rain', 'opinion', 'duty', 'save', 'ongoing', 'water', 'sri', 'drought', 'department', 'rice', 'fresh', 'rainwater', 'responsible', 'sacred', 'paddy']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
822,Drought Sri Lanka,Paul Collingwood: First England captain to win a global championship - Cricket Country,https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/paul-collingwood-first-england-captain-to-win-a-global-championship-26990,"Paul Collingwood: First England captain to win a global championship

Paul Collingwood, born May 26, 1976, was England’s leading ODI run-scorer and captain of the 2010 T20 World Cup-winning team. Jaideep Vaidya goes through the career of the happy-go-lucky all-rounder who was regarded one of the best fielders in the world in his prime.

Paul Collingwood isn’t a remarkable player by a long shot. An all-rounder by trade, he isn’t an awe-inspiring batsman, and neither is he the best of medium-pace bowlers. To be fair to him, he is one of the best fielders in the world, but all these qualities still do not warrant him as many accolades as some of his other mates and compatriots, right? Perhaps not. But Collingwood has a knack of getting the job done by chipping in innocuously here and there and was regarded an inspiring captain. He is the first England skipper to win a World Cup — even if it was the Twenty20 version.

As a batsman, Collingwood isn’t the most flamboyant and stylish strokers around, but he has this delicate way of swishing his blade around that still makes it look graceful. The way he carefully cuts the ball, you feel it’s a surgeon at work with his knife, vigilantly manoeuvring himself around with exquisite dabs and touches. He’s done decently well to score 4,259 runs in 68 Tests at 40.56, including 10 centuries. In One-Day Internationals (ODIs), he’s scored 5,092 runs in 197 matches at 35.36, including 5 hundreds and 26 half-centuries. Not bad for a so-so middle-order batsman, right?

As a bowler, Collingwood was used as filler in the middle overs to give the strike bowlers a breather. However, that didn’t stop him from taking 6 for 31 in an ODI once. While we’re on that, Collingwood had scored a hundred in that game too, against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge, making him the first player in the world to score a century and take 6 wickets in one match. Collingwood beat the previous record of a century and 5 wickets in a match, set by a certain Viv Richards.

Around that time in mid-2005, Collingwood took this catch to show his fielding abilities (do not miss Matthew Hayden‘s expression):

Collingwood started playing professionally for the Durham county in the mid-90s and made his First-Class debut in 1996. In four years, he was voted Player of the Year for the county, and in 2001, his efforts eventually won him an England call-up for the triangular series at home featuring Pakistan and Australia.

Collingwood had an inauspicious start to his England career, managing scores of 2, 9, 0 and 9 in the series and not doing so well with the ball either. It took a tour of Zimbabwe to finally show his true colours as he went on to score two half-centuries and helped England secure a whitewash. This was followed by a longer drought as Collingwood struggled to find his bearings in tours to India and New Zealand, before eventually scoring his first century against Sri Lanka Down Under in 2002-03.

Collingwood’s actual Test debut came in 2003 in Galle against the Lankans, but he would like to tell his grandchildren that it was during the 2005 Ashes. He had struggled to keep a regular spot in the side until the Aussies visited England for what would turn out to be a memorable series.

Even here, Collingwood did not get a chance to feature right until the last Test at The Oval, and that too because Simon Jones was out injured. England just needed a draw to secure a historic 2-1 win and Collingwood helped out with a frustrating 60-run sixth-wicket partnership with Kevin Pietersen on the final day as he must have made the Australians want to tear their hair out with his continuous, relentless blocking.

As England successfully drew the match and clinched The Ashes, Collingwood, along with the rest of the team, was awarded an MBE, after scoring 7 and 10 in the game — a highlight which caught the fancy of Shane Warne who ridiculed him during the next Ashes series Down Under in 2006-07. While bowling to Collingwood, Warne was caught on the stump mic saying, “You got an MBE, right? For scoring 7 at The Oval?”

In the 2006 tour of India, Collingwood became the first player from Durham to score a Test century. This prompted The Times, who had teamed up with Warne in its assessment of Collingwood’s MBE, to print the headline: “MBE? Give this man a knighthood!”

However, the defining tour of Collingwood’s career came during England’s Ashes trip in the Australian summer of 2006-07. Even though the Test series turned out to be a miserable outing for England, who were humiliated 0-5, the only bright spot in their report card was Collingwood, who scored a career-best 206 at Adelaide and shared a 310-run fourth-wicket partnership with Pietersen again. Collingwood thus became only the eighth English double-centurion against Australia and the first since Wally Hammond in 1928-29. In the second innings at Adelaide, Collingwood gave Australia another dose of his blocking and persisted with 22 from 119 balls, but could not prevent England from collapsing to 129, thereby giving the Aussies a 2-0 lead.

In the triangular one-day series that followed, Collingwood was again the rock as England took revenge of their Test series defeat by beating Australia twice in the best-of-three finals. Collingwood, who was coming into the first final at MCG on the back of a match-winning century against New Zealand in the last league match, walked in to bat with England reeling at 15 for 3, chasing 253.

Along with Ian Bell (65) and captain Andrew Flintoff (35) later, Collingwood helped England recover and remained unbeaten on 120 as they crossed the line with 3 balls to spare. In the second final at SCG, Collingwood again top-scored with 70 as England went on to win the match and series by 34 runs via the Duckworth-Lewis method.

Collingwood was rewarded for his heroics by being chosen as Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Wisden described him as having become the embodiment of “the sort of cricketer who not only made the most of his ability but was also determined to keep getting better.”

He was further to be rewarded with the England ODI and T20 captaincy after Michael Vaughan‘s resignation from the two formats following the team’s dismal showing at the 2007 World Cup. The then 31-year-old Collingwood told the BBC: “It is an amazing feeling for me, a great honour. I’ll have to learn the ropes as I go along but one thing is for sure, I want the players to express themselves and to be positive and aggressive.”

However, he relinquished the ODI captaincy after only a year in charge, as he felt it affected his form. Even though England recorded impressive series victories at home against India and in Sri Lanka, they lost both home and away to New Zealand. Collingwood failed to score a single ODI century in 2008, describing it as “the worst year in my career”, before eventually deciding to give up captaincy in the format. “I’ve found the extra workload to be very difficult,” he said. “I feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for England across all forms of the game.”

Collingwood continued to lead the T20 side — a stint which reached its pinnacle when England clinched the World Cup in 2010, which was the first time they had ever won a global ICC event. Even though Collingwood failed to impress with bat and ball, he hit the winning runs in the final against Australia and his captaincy was praised by the media and pundits all over.

Mediocre form in the longer format throughout 2009 and 2010 led him to announce his retirement from Tests after the 2010-11 Ashes, which England won 3-1 Down Under. “I’m very satisfied with the contributions over my Test career,” said Collingwood, as quoted by the Herald Sun. “It must not have been easy for people to watch at times, but I fought hard and gave my all.” Even old foe Warne had words of praise for Collingwood’s selfless Test exit: “Paul Collingwood has been a wonderful contributor to English cricket. I wish him well for the future. I still think making 17 runs in one Test doesn’t warrant an MBE, but I suppose I should let it go.”

Collingwood still continues to be available for England in the two shorter formats, although he last played for the national team back in 2011. If he does decide to end his international career, he will go out as England’s leading run-scorer in ODIs with 5,092.

Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat

Egyptian authorities are on alert for the upcoming flood season, which will start soon, said Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Ati.

Abdel Ati met on Sunday with the permanent Committee for Regulating the Revenue of the Nile River and urged the need to continuously follow up on possible flooding.

Nile waters are higher than average this season.

Mohamed El-Sebaei, spokesman for the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, said the flood season began in August and will last three months.

Flooding will likely begin soon, he said, adding that the ministry was monitoring the accumulation of water at the Aswan High Dam on a daily basis. The ministry has already started the regular maintenance of 117 flood drains.

He said the ministry has spent 600 Egyptian pounds in the past six years to increase protection against floods.",2020-09-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'egypt', 'water', 'egyptian', 'prepares', 'soon', 'irrigation', 'ministry', 'resources', 'nile', 'river', 'season']",Egypt,news article,English
79,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Ethiopia food crisis worsens - eNCA,https://www.enca.com/africa/ethiopia-food-crisis-worsens,"ADDIS ABABA - The number of hungry Ethiopians needing food aid has risen sharply due to poor rains and the El Nio weather phenomenon with around 7.5 million people now in need, aid officials said Friday.

That number has nearly doubled since August, when the United Nations said 4.5 million were in need -- with the UN now warning that without action some ""15 million people will require food assistance"" next year, more than inside war-torn Syria.

""Without a robust response supported by the international community, there is a high probability of a significant food insecurity and nutrition disaster,"" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, said in a report.

The UN children&39;s agency, Unicef, warns over 300,000 children are severely malnourished. (The report below contains an earlier estimate.)

The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which makes detailed technical assessments of hunger, predicted a harvest ""well below average"" in its latest report.

""Unusual livestock deaths continue to be reported,"" FEWS NET said. ""With smaller herds, few sellable livestock, and almost no income other than charcoal and firewood sales, households are unable to afford adequate quantities of food.""

Ethiopia, Africa&39;s second most populous nation, borders the Horn of Africa nation of Somalia, where some 855,000 people face need ""life-saving assistance"", according to the UN, warning that 2.3 million more people there are ""highly vulnerable"".

El Nio comes with a warming in sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, and can cause unusually heavy rains in some parts of the world and drought elsewhere.

Hardest-hit areas are Ethiopia&39;s eastern Afar and southern Somali regions, while water supplies are also unusually low in central and eastern Oromo region.

Food insecurity is a sensitive issue in Ethiopia, hit by famine in 1984-85 after extreme drought.

Today, Ethiopia&39;s government would rather its reputation was its near-double-digit economic growth and huge infrastructure investment -- making the country one of Africa&39;s top-performing economies and a magnet for foreign investment.

Still, nearly 20 million Ethiopians live below the $1.25 poverty line set by the World Bank, with the poorest some of the most vulnerable to weather challenges.

Ethiopia&39;s government has mobilised $33 million (30 million euros) in emergency aid, but the UN says it needs $237 million.

Minster for Information Redwan Hussein told reporters at a recent press conference that Ethiopia is doing what it can.

""The support from donor agencies has not yet arrived in time to let us cope with the increasing number of the needy population,"" he said.",2015-10-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['million', 'aid', 'rains', 'world', 'food', 'ethiopia', 'number', 'warning', 'weather', 'worsens', 'unusually', 'need', 'crisis']",Somalia,news article,English
535,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka supplies US aircraft carrier as counterbalance to Beijing - Taiwan News,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3626878,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- Despite China's mounting clout due to the mountains of debt it has piled on Sri Lanka, the tiny island nation stood up to Beijing by supplying a U.S. aircraft carrier last week.

As part of what is being described as a ""temporary cargo transfer initiative"" that began on Jan. 24, Sri Lanka provided supplies to the USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). The gesture appears to be an attempt to balance Colombo's ties with Beijing, as it moves full steam ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with Sri Lanka being the key linchpin in a network based on massive debt.

On Jan. 23, the U.S. 7th Fleet published an article in which it described a cargo plane's mission to obtain supplies from Bandaranaike International Airport near Colombo:

""A C-2A Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft from Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 30 (VRC-30) operated from Bandaranaike International Airport near Colombo. The C-2A received a variety of supplies transferred earlier in the week from a U.S. Navy C-40A Clipper logistics aircraft and then flown back to John C. Stennis.""

The supplies included spare parts, tools, personal mail, paper goods, and other items. Lt. Cmdr. Brett Learner described the exchange as the second time the Sri Lankan government had provided supplies for the ship and emphasized the strategic significance of the gesture: ""The opportunity to conduct a temporary cargo transfer in Colombo for a second time provides a resource in a strategic location in the Indian Ocean that we can leverage while in the area.”

The article indicated that, rather than merely kowtowing to Beijing's one-sided BRI, it is seeking to position itself as a strategic hub in the Indo-Pacific for many nations. The article cited U.S. Ambassador Alaina B. Teplitz as saying, ""Sri Lanka’s leaders have outlined their vision for the country’s regional engagement that reflects its location at the nexus of the Indo-Pacific and seizes the opportunities that this unique position presents.""

Teplitz also expressed the interest of the U.S. in working with Sri Lanka in providing more services and goods for U.S. military and commercial ships traversing the region as it seeks to counter Beijing's BRI. ""We are happy to support this vision through a range of mutually beneficial initiatives, such as contracting Sri Lankan services and goods to support U.S. military and commercial vessels that often transit the Indo-Pacific’s busy sea lanes,"" said Teplitz.

After Sri Lanka racked up more than US$8 billion in dept to state-controlled Chinese companies, the country formally handed over the port of Hambantota to China for 99 years in 2017, alleviating only US$1.1 billion of the debt owed to Beijing. In January of this year, a Chinese state-owned company completed a US$1.4 billion land reclamation project near the country's largest shipping hub, the Port of Colombo, in a move likely designed to secure a choke hold on the port.",2019-01-28 08:00:00+00:00,"['near', 'port', 'supplies', 'counterbalance', 'lanka', 'sri', 'goods', 'described', 'colombo', 'beijing', 'carrier', 'support', 'strategic', 'aircraft']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

The comparison rankles supporters of Israel but the growing Palestinian Boycott, Disinvestment and Sanctions movement draws on the struggle to isolate racist South Africa Pro-Palestinian supporters hold placards reading Boycott Apartheid Israel during a protest to condemn the ongoing Israeli air strikes on Gaza, in Durban, South Africa, this week. Photograph: Rajesh Jantilal/AFP/Getty Images Ask an older generation of white South Africans when they first felt the bite of anti-apartheid sanctions, and some point to the moment in 1968 when their prime minister, BJ Vorster, banned a tour by the England cricket team because it included a mixed-race player, Basil DOliveira. After that, South Africa was excluded from international cricket until Nelson Mandela walked free from prison 22 years later. The DOliveira affair, as it became known, proved a watershed in drumming up popular support for the sporting boycott that eventually saw the country excluded from most international competition including rugby, the great passion of the white Afrikaners who were the base of the ruling Nationalist party and who bitterly resented being cast out. For others, the moment of reckoning came years later, in 1985 when foreign banks called in South Africas loans. It was a clear sign that the countrys economy was going to pay an ever higher price for apartheid. Neither of those events was decisive in bringing down South Africas regime. Far more credit lies with the black schoolchildren who took to the streets of Soweto in 1976 and kicked off years of unrest and civil disobedience that made the country increasingly ungovernable until changing global politics, and the collapse of communism, played its part. But the rise of the popular anti-apartheid boycott over nearly 30 years made its mark on South Africans who were increasingly confronted by a repudiation of their system. Ordinary Europeans pressured supermarkets to stop selling South African products. British students forced Barclays Bank to pull out of the apartheid state. The refusal of a Dublin shop worker to ring up a Cape grapefruit led to a strike and then a total ban on South African imports by the Irish government. By the mid-1980s, one in four Britons said they were boycotting South African goods  a testament to the reach of the anti-apartheid campaign. By then it was well entrenched in universities as one of the great left causes of the day, alongside the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and support for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. The musicians union blocked South African artists from playing on the BBC, and the cultural boycott saw most performers refusing to play in the apartheid state, although some, including Elton John and Queen, infamously put on concerts at Sun City in the Bophuthatswana homeland. A policeman watches anti-apartheid demonstrators outside the Waldorf Hotel in London where South African cricketers are staying in 1965. Photograph: Clive Limpkin/Getty Images The US didnt have the same sporting or cultural ties, and imported far fewer South African products, but the mobilisation against apartheid in universities, churches and through local coalitions in the 1980s was instrumental in forcing the hand of American politicians and big business in favour of financial sanctions and divestment. By the time President FW de Klerk was ready to release Mandela and negotiate an end to apartheid, a big selling point for part of the white population was an end to boycotts and isolation. Twenty-seven years after the end of white rule, some see the boycott campaign against South Africa as a guide to mobilising popular support against what is increasingly condemned as Israels own brand of apartheid. As South Africa showed, building popular support for action takes years  and those who back the campaign face a far more effective opponent in the Israeli state. For all that, significant shifts in attitudes toward Israel, particularly in the US and within the Jewish diaspora, have presented campaigners with their best prospects to date for building a boycott and they are looking to the anti-apartheid movement as the example. One of the most important changes is the breaking of the taboo on comparisons with South Africas racist system. Israels leading human rights group, BTselem, issued a report in January called: A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea: This is apartheid. Human Rights Watch in the US followed in April, accusing Israel of crimes of apartheid. For years, Israel and its supporters have dismissed claims of similarities as antisemitic on the grounds they imply that the Jewish state is a racist enterprise. Israel continues to claim to the outside world that the occupation is temporary, even as it entrenches control ever more deeply, and that the Palestinians only have themselves to blame for failing to negotiate their way to an independent state.But the increasing focus on campaigns for racial justice in the US has contributed to a shift in focus from arguments about two states to abuses of individual human rights. *** The anti-apartheid boycott movement had credibility in good part because it was called for by South Africans even if it never had universal support among the countrys black population, in part over fear of loss of jobs. The African National Congress president, Albert Luthuli, made the call in 1958. The following year the Boycott Movement, later renamed the Anti-Apartheid Movement, was launched in London. Among the speakers was Julius Nyerere, future president of newly independent Tanzania. We are not asking you, the British people, for anything special. We are just asking you to withdraw your support from apartheid by not buying South African goods, he said. The South African government is fighting against history and they are bound to lose. We know that the liberation struggle will triumph in South Africa. If you have confidence then we are going to win! Nyerere was right. But it took another 30 years. Palestinians walk next to a giant statue of Nelson Mandela in the West Bank city of Ramallah in March. Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images The Palestinian campaign, the boycott, divestment, sanctions (BDS) movement, is not led by political leaders but civil society, which does not have the same standing in the kind of international forums where the ANC had leverage. On the face of it, that is a weakness. But the absence of the ageing and compromised Palestinian Authority leadership has opened the way for a younger generation usually much better at communicating how the Palestinian experience fits with growing global demands for racial justice. Add to that the wave of protests by a new generation of Palestinians inside Israel and the occupied territories, united by anger at two systems built on discrimination. White South Africas apologists, who included conservative politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, cast the ANC as a violent anti-democratic movement and a front for the Soviet Union. Britains rightwing tabloids looked around other parts of the African continent and asked why South Africa was being picked on when Idi Amins Uganda was so much worse. But millions of ordinary people saw through that for what apartheid was  a crime against the humanity of every South African subjected to its racist laws and practices.Israel has worked hard to keep the focus on Hamas and it routinely disparages critics by asking why they are singling out the Jewish state when its Arab neighbours are less democratic and more oppressive. But the events of recent weeks have shown the extent to which that tactic is increasingly ineffective, particularly amid international criticism of the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes to make way for Jews in East Jerusalem. By the 1980s anti-apartheid was one of the great left causes of the day alongside the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and support for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, as seen at this rally in Trafalgar Square. Photograph: David Oneill/Associated New/Rex And while Israel claims the BDS movement has no credibility and little support, its actions suggest it believes something else. Pro-Israel groups have worked hard to persuade US states to pass anti-boycott laws and to codify the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, with its ambiguous examples of when criticism of Israel is unacceptable. The long and terrible history of boycotts of Jews, particularly in Europe, adds a dimension to the campaign that South Africans did not have to consider. But it is no longer enough in itself to dismiss sanctions outright as too reminiscent of the 1930s.A group of more than 200 Holocaust scholars around the world has pushed back with with the Jerusalem Declaration which said that comparisons between Israel and apartheid, and calls for a boycott, are not in themselves antisemitic. Netanyahu has not helped himself by allying with Donald Trump or the far right in Europe such as the Hungarian president, Viktor Orbn, who has long trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories. Still, the challenges for the boycott movement are clear. Fifa  world soccers governing body  rejected demands for action over six Israeli league teams based in Jewish settlements on the grounds that the issue was too political . Which points to popular action leading the way, as happened against South African apartheid.

Some called for the Eurovision Song Contest to be withdrawn from Tel Aviv in 2019. The New Zealand singer Lorde cancelled a concert in the city three years ago after fans urged her to join the artistic boycott of Israel. A pro-Israel group placed an advert in the Washington Post calling her a bigot. Three years ago Argentina cancelled a World Cup warm-up match with Israel after the players voted to boycott the game. The appearance of Palestinian flags at English Premier League and FA Cup matches in recent days suggests there is support for such action. It is an even larger challenge to persuade big business to show its disapproval of Israeli policies. Yet even in the face of pressure from Trump, parts of the American private sector stood against further restrictions on voting rights in the US and pulled funding for Republicans who backed the mob that stormed the Capitol in January. The movement also has important friends, among them black South Africans who were at the forefront of the struggle against apartheid. On Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa, a trade union leader who led the ANCs negotiations with the white regime, said the forced removal of Palestinians to make way for Israeli settlers and the destruction of homes in Gaza brings back very terrible memories of our own history and apartheid. This, for us, is very close to our own suffering under apartheid. When we see those images, we cant but help to side with the Palestinians, he said.

214,FF-2016-000062-IDN,64 dead in Indonesia landslides as La Nina brings heavy rains - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2016/06/64-dead-in-indonesia-landslides-as-la-nina-brings-heavy-rains/,"Central Java was hit the hardest, with 59 people confirmed dead in the province.

At least five people were killed in the Sangihe Islands in Sulawesi.

An environment ministry adviser is calling for natural resource extraction in Java, the world’s most crowded island, to be reigned in.

Last year, an extended dry season brought on by El Nino set the stage for one of the worst natural disasters Indonesia has seen, the devastating forest and peatland fires that burned an area the size of Macedonia.

This year, an extra-wet dry season brought on by La Nina is bringing calamity in a different form: floods and landslides.

At least 64 people were killed this month in landslides and flash floods and thousands more were displaced, the nation’s disaster management chief, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said on Friday.

Central Java caught it the worst, with 59 dead in the province, including 43 casualties in Purworejo district, which has declared a state of emergency.

At least five more died in the Sangihe Islands in North Sulawesi.

Ninety-nine people have been killed by landslides this year, Nugroho said, and more than 2,000 had died or gone missing since 2005.

The landslides, he added, were expected to peak from December to March 2017.

The government has installed Landslide Early Warning Systems in parts of the country, but many of them are not working well, according to Nugroho.

Community and local government preparedness were also low, he said, based on surveys by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) and UNESCO.

He called for the government to raise the National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s budget.

“Ideally, 1% of the budget would be earmarked for dealing with national disasters,” he said. “Now it’s .02-.07%.”

Massive development on Java, the world’s most crowded island, has tended to neglect the environment, according to Soeryo Adiwibowo, a Bogor Agricultural Institute professor and senior Environment and Forestry Ministry advisor.

In the 19th century, Java’s forests spanned 10 million hectares, an area the size of South Korea. By 1989 they covered only 1 million hectares, and in 2005 they spanned 400,000 hectares.

Deforestation creates the condition for landslides because trees hold the soil in place.

“Natural disasters will continue to increase if the carrying capacity of the environment is not taken into account,” Adiwibowo said.

The area around Java’s South Coast Road was shaping up to be a new growth center, he added.

A 2008 study by Adiwibowo and colleagues, which found that Java was being dangerous overexploited, “did not get a good response from the government,” he said.

The professor said the cement industry should not continue in Java and asked the government to issue a negative investment list for the island to clamp down on natural resource extraction.

“China already made a negative investment list, including for the cement industry, so now they’re all flocking to Java.”

And it is dangerous.

Awash in bad information, people have swallowed hydroxychloroquine hoping the drug will protect them against COVID-19  even with no evidence that it helps (SN Online: 8/2/20). Others refuse to wear masks, contrary to the best public health advice available. In January, protestors disrupted a mass vaccination site in Los Angeles, blocking life-saving shots for hundreds of people. COVID has opened everyones eyes to the dangers of health misinformation, says cognitive scientist Briony Swire-Thompson of Northeastern University in Boston.

The pandemic has made clear that bad information can kill. And scientists are struggling to stem the tide of misinformation that threatens to drown society. The sheer volume of fake news, flooding across social media with little fact-checking to dam it, is taking an enormous toll on trust in basic institutions. In a December poll of 1,115 U.S. adults, by NPR and the research firm Ipsos, 83 percent said they were concerned about the spread of false information. Yet fewer than half were able to identify as false a QAnon conspiracy theory about pedophilic Satan worshippers trying to control politics and the media.

Scientists have been learning more about why and how people fall for bad information  and what we can do about it. Certain characteristics of social media posts help misinformation spread, new findings show. Other research suggests bad claims can be counteracted by giving accurate information to consumers at just the right time, or by subtly but effectively nudging people to pay attention to the accuracy of what theyre looking at. Such techniques involve small behavior changes that could add up to a significant bulwark against the onslaught of fake news.

Wow factor

Misinformation is tough to fight, in part because it spreads for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes its bad actors churning out fake-news content in a quest for internet clicks and advertising revenue, as with troll farms in Macedonia that generated hoax political stories during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other times, the recipients of misinformation are driving its spread.

Some people unwittingly share misinformation on social media and elsewhere simply because they find it surprising or interesting. Another factor is the method through which the misinformation is presented  whether through text, audio or video. Of these, video can be seen as the most credible, according to research by S. Shyam Sundar, an expert on the psychology of messaging at Penn State. He and colleagues decided to study this after a series of murders in India started in 2017 as people circulated via WhatsApp a video purported to be of child abduction. (It was, in reality, a distorted clip of a public awareness campaign video from Pakistan.)

Sundar recently showed 180 participants in India audio, text and video versions of three fake-news stories as WhatsApp messages, with research funding from WhatsApp. The video stories were assessed as the most credible and most likely to be shared by respondents with lower levels of knowledge on the topic of the story. Seeing is believing, Sundar says.

Video sells WhatsApp users looked at three versions of a story that falsely claimed that rice was being made out of plastic  in (left to right) text, audio or a video showing a man feeding plastic sheets into a machine. S.S. Sundar, M.D. Molina and E. Cho Participants tended to rate the video version as more credible than the audio or text versions. The effect diminished for users who were highly involved with the topic of the false story, suggesting that video is a particularly compelling medium for those who may not be knowledgeable on the topic at hand. Perceived credibility of a message based on format and issue involvement T. Tibbitts T. Tibbitts Source: S.S. Sundar and E. Cho/Penn State and M. Molina/Michigan State Univ.

The findings, in press at the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, suggest several ways to fight fake news, he says. For instance, social media companies could prioritize responding to user complaints when the misinformation being spread includes video, above those that are text-only. And media-literacy efforts might focus on educating people that videos can be highly deceptive. People should know they are more gullible to misinformation when they see something in video form, Sundar says. Thats especially important with the rise of deepfake technologies that feature false but visually convincing videos (SN: 9/15/18, p. 12).

One of the most insidious problems with fake news is how easily it lodges itself in our brains and how hard it is to dislodge once its there. Were constantly deluged with information, and our minds use cognitive shortcuts to figure out what to retain and what to let go, says Sara Yeo, a science-communication expert at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Sometimes that information is aligned with the values that we hold, which makes us more likely to accept it, she says. That means people continually accept information that aligns with what they already believe, further insulating them in self-reinforcing bubbles.

Compounding the problem is that people can process the facts of a message properly while misunderstanding its gist because of the influence of their emotions and values, psychologist Valerie Reyna of Cornell University wrote in 2020 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Thanks to new insights like these, psychologists and cognitive scientists are developing tools people can use to battle misinformation before it arrives  or that prompts them to think more deeply about the information they are consuming.

One such approach is to prebunk beforehand rather than debunk after the fact. In 2017, Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues found that presenting information about a petition that denied the reality of climate science following true information about climate change canceled any benefit of receiving the true information. Simply mentioning the misinformation undermined peoples understanding of what was true.

That got van der Linden thinking: Would giving people other relevant information before giving them the misinformation be helpful? In the climate change example, this meant telling people ahead of time that Charles Darwin and members of the Spice Girls were among the false signatories to the petition. This advance knowledge helped people resist the bad information they were then exposed to and retain the message of the scientific consensus on climate change.

Heres a very 2021 metaphor: Think of misinformation as a virus, and prebunking as a weakened dose of that virus. Prebunking becomes a vaccine that allows people to build up antibodies to bad information. To broaden this beyond climate change, and to give people tools to recognize and battle misinformation more broadly, van der Linden and colleagues came up with a game, Bad News, to test the effectiveness of prebunking (see Page 36). The results were so promising that the team developed a COVID-19 version of the game, called GO VIRAL! Early results suggest that playing it helps people better recognize pandemic-related misinformation.

Take a breath

Sometimes it doesnt take very much of an intervention to make a difference. Sometimes its just a matter of getting people to stop and think for a moment about what theyre doing, says Gordon Pennycook, a social psychologist at the University of Regina in Canada.

In one 2019 study, Pennycook and David Rand, a cognitive scientist now at MIT, tested real news headlines and partisan fake headlines, such as Pennsylvania federal court grants legal authority to REMOVE TRUMP after Russian meddling, with nearly 3,500 participants. The researchers also tested participants analytical reasoning skills. People who scored higher on the analytical tests were less likely to identify fake news headlines as accurate, no matter their political affiliation. In other words, lazy thinking rather than political bias may drive peoples susceptibility to fake news, Pennycook and Rand reported in Cognition.

When it comes to COVID-19, however, political polarization does spill over into peoples behavior. In a working paper first posted online April 14, 2020, at PsyArXiv.org, Pennycook and colleagues describe findings that political polarization, especially in the United States with its contrasting media ecosystems, can overwhelm peoples reasoning skills when it comes to taking protective actions, such as wearing masks.

Inattention plays a major role in the spread of misinformation, Pennycook argues. Fortunately, that suggests some simple ways to intervene, to nudge the concept of accuracy into peoples minds, helping them resist misinformation. Its basically critical thinking training, but in a very light form, he says. We have to stop shutting off our brains so much.

Push in the right direction Nudging Twitter users to think about the accuracy of a nonpolitical headline resulted in users temporarily sharing more information from more trustworthy media outlets (blue dots toward the right) and less from less trustworthy outlets (blue dots toward the left). Dot size is proportional to the number of tweets that link to that website prior to the accuracy nudge. Effect of an accuracy nudge on news sharing T. Tibbitts Source: G. Pennycook et al/Nature 2021

With nearly 5,400 people who previously tweeted links to articles from two sites known for posting misinformation  Breitbart and InfoWars  Pennycook, Rand and colleagues used innocuous-sounding Twitter accounts to send direct messages with a seemingly random question about the accuracy of a nonpolitical news headline. Then the scientists tracked how often the people shared links from sites of high-quality information versus those known for low-quality information, as rated by professional fact-checkers, for the next 24 hours.

On average, people shared higher-quality information after the intervention than before. Its a simple nudge with simple results, Pennycook acknowledges  but the work, reported online March 17 in Nature, suggests that very basic reminders about accuracy can have a subtle but noticeable effect.

For debunking, timing can be everything. Tagging headlines as true or false after presenting them helped people remember whether the information was accurate a week later, compared with tagging before or at the moment the information was presented, Nadia Brashier, a cognitive psychologist at Harvard University, reported with Pennycook, Rand and political scientist Adam Berinsky of MIT in February in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

How to debunk Debunking bad information is challenging, especially if youre fighting with a cranky family member on Facebook. Here are some tips from misinformation researchers: Arm yourself with media-literacy skills, at sites such as the News Literacy Project (newslit.org), to better understand how to spot hoax videos and stories.

Dont stigmatize people for holding inaccurate beliefs. Show empathy and respect, or youre more likely to alienate your audience than successfully share accurate information.

Translate complicated but true ideas into simple messages that are easy to grasp. Videos, graphics and other visual aids can help.

When possible, once you provide a factual alternative to the misinformation, explain the underlying fallacies (such as cherry-picking information, a common tactic of climate change deniers).

Mobilize when you see misinformation being shared on social media as soon as possible. If you see something, say something. Source: The Debunking Handbook 2020; News Literacy Project

Prebunking still has value, they note. But providing a quick and simple fact-check after someone reads a headline can be helpful, particularly on social media platforms where people often mindlessly scroll through posts.

Social media companies have taken some steps to fight misinformation spread on their platforms, with mixed results. Twitters crowdsourced fact-checking program, Birdwatch, launched as a beta test in January, has already run into trouble with the poor quality of user-flagging. And Facebook has struggled to effectively combat misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on its platform.

Misinformation researchers have recently called for social media companies to share more of their data so that scientists can better track the spread of online misinformation. Such research can be done without violating users privacy, for instance by aggregating information or asking users to actively consent to research studies.

Much of the work to date on misinformations spread has used public data from Twitter because it is easily searchable, but platforms such as Facebook have many more users and much more data. Some social media companies do collaborate with outside researchers to study the dynamics of fake news, but much more remains to be done to inoculate the public against false information.

Ultimately, van der Linden says, were trying to answer the question: What percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to have herd immunity against misinformation?",2021-05-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['spread', 'resist', 'detect', 'pennycook', 'video', 'misinformation', 'social', 'bad', 'users', 'flood', 'media', 'counter', 'fake', 'information']",Pakistan,news article,English
101,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Edward Said Remembered - Dissident Voice,https://dissidentvoice.org/2015/09/edward-said-remembered/,"September 25 was the 12th anniversary of his death

Edward Said was an amazing individual and an incredible speaker, writer and academic. He is gone, but the power of his ideas lives on. I was fortunate to meet Edward Said on a few occasions.

There is a bit of a story about how I first met Edward Said. After Canadian’s Concerned for the Middle East (CCME) was refused ratification by the University of Western Ontario Student Council in December 1982 a number of academics at UWO sought to bring a few speakers to campus to broaden the access to ideas on the Palestinian issue and in support of academic freedom and free speech.

I was the graduate student representative to the University Community Centre Directorate (UCCD) from 1985-1987. Habeeb Al-Aidroos, the director of the UCCD, and I helped raise money to bring Professor Edward Said to campus and the next year Professor Noam Chomsky. However, the main credit goes to the Dean of Arts, Tom Lennon, who controlled the money for a prestigious lecture series at UWO.

Before that occurred Edward Said was invited to give a series of lectures to some graduate English students by Professor Balachandra Rajan, who was a world recognized authority on English Comparative Literature on India. He was the author of Under Western Eyes: India from Milton to Macaulay (Duke University Press, 1999). Professor Rajan was a personal friend of Edward Said.

Nobody noticed that Edward Said was coming to Western University. The title of his talk was extremely academic and obscure. The day before Edward Said was scheduled to speak one of the posters caught my eye. I quickly contacted the local Arab community and students interested in the Middle East. The Vice-President Academic for the University of Western Ontario, Tom Collins, somehow heard about what I was doing and came to the talk and sat beside me during the talk wondering what the heck I was up to. We knew each other because I had served on the UWO Senate and had been the University Student Council Vice President Education several years earlier.

When the talk was set to start many students and members of the local Arab community poured into the lecture Hall. I had also contacted the local media who expressed no interest in Edward Said and the obscure topic of the lecture. That was the case until I told them that Edward Said was a member of the Palestinian National Council. Unfortunately that was the day after the Achille Lauro hijacking which occurred on October 5, 1985. A bit of a media circus resulted from my telephone calls. It also generated a great deal of media coverage. There was a magnificent picture of the extremely handsome Edward Said published in the London Free Press.

Edward Said graciously agreed to meet with the local Palestinian and Arab community and us students after his talk. So myself and the many extra visitors patiently sat through the academic lecture and Edward Said returned and met with the community. It was a wonderful meeting and exchange. Professor Rajan and I later became good friends after my uninvited intervention.

A few months later in 1986 I attended the Middle East Studies Association (MESA) Conference in Boston. One of the main events was a debate on American Middle East policy on Israel and Palestine between Edward Said and journalist Christopher Hitchens (who I also had a memorable meeting with but that is another story) and renown Middle East historian Bernard Lewis and Leon Wieseltier who was the Literary Editor of the New Republic.

There were over 5,000 professors and graduate students, all highly informed on Middle East issues, in this massive hall. I thought that the breakdown would be 50-50 as to who would support Israel and who would support the Palestinians. I was surprised that based on applause the support in the room was about 95% pro-Palestinian and 5% pro-Israel. Edward Said was excellent as was Hitchens. They clearly won the debate. The transcript of the debate was published in the Journal of Palestine Studies.

When I was at the MESA Conference I had a chance meeting with Edward Said. He said to me, “What the hell are you doing here?” I explained I was a graduate student in Political Science specializing in Middle East studies and attending the conference. He remembered me from the stunt I pulled at the University of Western Ontario. Apparently I made some impression on Edward Said from my actions at UWO.

The next year Edward Said came back to the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario and gave a series of lectures on the latest book he was writing and also gave a political talk on Palestine. Hanny Hassan, a prominent member of the London Arab community, hosted a reception for Edward Said at his house for members of the community and student activists like myself. Again an excellent opportunity to socialize with Edward Said and members of the community.

The next year, in the fall of 1987, Professor Noam Chomsky came to the University of Western Ontario and gave three lectures on linguistics and also a lecture on politics of the Middle East. Again the Dean of Arts and the UCCD, with Habeeb’s and my support, provided the funding.

At the time I had started first year law at the University of Windsor and returned to UWO to attend the Chomsky lectures. As always with Chomsky the lectures were excellent. Chomsky also met with a very small group of academics and university officials over dinner to which I was also invited. It was an intimate three hour conversation with Noam Chomsky and truly one of the highlights of my life. To this day when I ask for assistance for some political fight Chomsky always helps.

A number of years later the University of Windsor hosted an academic conference on Edward Said and his works. I attended the conference. Edward Said was there and his health was clearly failing but the mind was still as strong as ever. Edward Said died not long after, but his writings are still widely read and his ideas and impact are as powerful as ever.

In many respects the attempt to ban CCME and the Palestinian viewpoint at the University of Western Ontario opened many doors and exposed over a thousand people to the radical idea that Palestinians’ deserved human rights. It brought Edward Said and Noam Chomsky to the usually conservative quiet University of Western Ontario.

On the CCME issue in the end we won the support of many Jewish academics and rabbis, many organizations including the American Anti-Arab Discrimination Committee (ADC) and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. The Globe and Mail (a national newspaper in Canada) also wrote a supportive editorial. And finally with the support of the Ontario Human Rights Commission CCME won the right to present speakers as an officially ratified student club with full access to the universities facilities and to present opinions supportive of the Palestinians at UWO.

I wrote an article which covers much, but not all of this issue, which can be found on my web site or any library that carries American Arab Quarterly now known as Middle East Affairs.

We must remember the important contribution Edward Said has made to the academic world and the Palestinian cause and work hard to make the dream of an independent Palestinian State come true.",2015-09-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['edward', 'support', 'east', 'university', 'remembered', 'community', 'chomsky', 'academic', 'ontario', 'western', 'middle']",Somalia,news article,English

(Photo: PTI)

Indian Army's access to the contested Barahoti area at the Line of Actual Control in Uttarakhand has not been restricted even though some roads and bridges have been washed away in the recent floods.

An alternate route to the borders that often see transgressions in the Barahoti area has ensured the forward locations are not cut off for the army, sources said.

Barahoti is part of the central sector and is considered a sensitive area.

The flood has ravaged parts of the Chamoli district and some bridges have been swept sway. ""The bridges and roads will be restored quickly but access to Barahoti from an alternate route is there,"" said an official.

Barahoti is an 80 sq km contested area along the Line of Actual Control with China in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. It is about 400 km from the state capital of Dehradun and 100 km from Joshimath, the location of a brigade headquatres.

In 1958, India and China listed Barahoti as a disputed area where neither side would send their troops. In the 1962 war, the PLA did not enter the 'middle sector' including parts of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh and were active focused in the western (Ladakh) and eastern (Arunachal Pradesh) sectors.

Officials said military infrastructure and installations have not been damaged in the floods.

The last big incident of hostility in Barahoti took place in 2017 during the Doklam standoff when Chinese troops transgressed into Indian territory forcing Indian shepherds out leading to some tensions.

The Army with the Indo Tibetan Border Police has been in action carrying out relief work while divers from the Indian Navy have also been pressed into action.

Two columns from the Army comprising 400 troops from Joshimath and Auli were deployed and another 200 are on standby.

Army's Engineering Task Force and medical teams are also on ground have also been on the ground.

While the Army has deployed two Cheetah helicopters the Indian Air Force has been carrying out sorties in to assist in rescue and relief operations.

Two bridges at entrance of Malari valley near Tapovan have also been washed away but the main road between Joshimath to Tapovan is intact.

859,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,2016 Strategic Response Plan: Mozambique - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/2016-strategic-response-plan-mozambique,"Summary

Mozambique is experiencing its most severe drought in more than 30 years. The drought is affecting approximately 1.5 million people in seven provinces in the Southern and Central regions of the country. Due to the seriousness of the situation, the Government extended the institutional red alert for the most drought-affected provinces of Tete, Sofala, Gaza, Inhambane, Manica, Zambezia and Maputo.

The revised strategic response plan is targeting about 1.2 million people affected by drought with food security and other interventions in the seven provinces affected until the end of March 2017. The plan also includes a contingency for 190,000 persons that may be affected by floods and cyclones during the same period.

The HCT developed the SRP in April 2016 to support the Government in responding the current drought. The plan was reviewed in November 2016 and has three strategic objectives, namely:

Provide immediate life-saving and life-sustaining assistance to the most vulnerable members of the populations affected by droughts in the form of food assistance and agricultural inputs, the availability of clean water and nutrition supplements.

Support the restoration of livelihoods of the drought-affected population through Early Recovery and resilience-building activities

To promote continued access to education services and ensure coordination and mainstreaming of protection initiatives in drought response interventions.

In terms of funding, the total cost to implement the current plan is estimated at US$ 211 million. The drought emergency response is valued at US$ 179 million. A contingency amount of US$ 32 million has been budgeted for the possible floods/cyclones emergency response. The total funding available for the drought response is 121 million US$, leaving a gap of approximately US$ 58 million. The emergency response will ensure that the most vulnerable members of those affected by drought and other extreme weather phenomena are prioritized in the delivery of assistance.

Efforts will be made to ensure that farmers are provided with seeds and other agricultural inputs, to ensure that they are able to plant their crops when the rains arrive and reap an abundant harvest in March of 2017. Furthermore, food assistance is planned to be provided to the most affected population in the seven provinces.

The protection cluster will provide advisory support to governement and humanitarian actors so that the response is gender-sensitive. They will also advocate for an appropriate response for targeting the most vulnerable and excluded.

The nutrition cluster will engage in active screening and case management of malnourished cases (both children and pregnant and lactating women) at the community level, and support infant and young child feeding in emergencies.

The education cluster will provide support to school feeding in prioritised areas, temporary learning spaces and teaching and learning materials for children and teachers affected by drought, flood, cyclones and/or military conflict. The cluster will further coordinate preparedness interventions and assess the current response capacity to respond to possible emergencies.

The WASH cluster will work to improve the access of potable water of households affected by drought through (i) water trucking where there were no other response options, (ii) drilling new boreholes where waters tables have dropped significantly, (iii) distribution of chlorine water treatment product (certeza) and (iv) rehabilitation/upgrading of existing community water points.",2016-12-31 08:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'response', 'plan', 'affected', 'support', 'drought', 'ensure', 'million', 'strategic', 'cluster', '2016', 'vulnerable', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English
628,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Liverpool transfer news: Reds set to sign goalkeeper Adrian to replace Simon Mignolet - Goal,https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-close-in-on-ex-west-ham-goalkeeper-adrian/s7xqqsgayd7y1f1q48odvui96,"Liverpool close in on ex-West Ham goalkeeper Adrian

The 32-year-old, who is a free agent following his release by the Irons this summer, will move to Anfield to replace the departed Simon Mignolet

Liverpool are set to sign former West Ham goalkeeper Adrian on a free transfer, Goal can confirm.

The Reds have moved quickly to bring in the Spaniard following Simon Mignolet’s £8.2million ($10m) switch to Club Brugge.

Adrian had been in talks with Real Valladolid after leaving the Hammers in June, but will now move to Merseyside to be the understudy to Reds No.1 Alisson.

He arrives with plenty of experience, having spent six years in the Premier League with West Ham, where he made exactly 150 appearances in all competitions.

He will become the third signing of a low-key summer at Anfield, following the arrivals of teenage duo Sepp van den Berg and Harvey Elliott.

Liverpool considered other options, including Southampton’s Alex McCarthy who they looked at and turned down the chance to sign Jack Butland from Stoke City.

Andy Lonergan, who has trained with Jurgen Klopp’s squad during pre-season, will not be offered a permanent contract despite impressing staff with his attitude and professionalism.

Instead they have opted for Adrian, whom Goal revealed they were keen on in May, with the 32-year-old set to secure his move ahead of the new Premier League campaign.

Mignolet completed his switch to Brugge on Sunday, flying to Belgium immediately after the Community Shield defeat to Manchester City on penalties at Wembley.

The 31-year-old made 204 appearances for the Reds after arriving from Sunderland in 2013, but featured only twice last term as Alisson established himself firmly as No.1 and requested to leave should a suitable offer be received.

Liverpool will receive an initial fee of £6.4m for the Belgian, with an additional £1.8m potentially due in add-ons. Mignolet has signed a five-year contract, and will go straight into Brugge’s squad for their Champions League qualifier with Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday.

As for Adrian, he will be on the bench when Liverpool begin their Premier League season against Norwich at Anfield on Friday.

Liverpool’s goalkeeping options have been hit by injury this summer, with youngsters Caiomhin Kelleher and Viteszlav Jaros both missing the bulk of pre-season, although both are expected back in full training by the end of the month.

Liverpool will welcome back Sadio Mane to full training at Melwood on Monday, while they will also monitor the fitness of James Milner, who missed the Community Shield due to a tight muscle.",2019-08-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['premier', 'goalkeeper', 'west', 'transfer', 'sign', 'reds', 'liverpool', 'adrian', 'anfield', 'mignolet', 'training', 'following', 'simon', 'set', 'league', 'ham', 'summer', 'replace']",Ghana,news article,English

Big banners and posters supporting the constitutional amendments have been put up across Egypt before the parliament takes its official vote on April 14 and the national referendum that is yet to be announced.

The amendments include extending the presidential term from four to six years in Article 140 of the constitution, which could allow President Sisi to stay in power until 2034, and a quota specifying at least 25 percent female representation in parliament as well as an “appropriate representation” of the youth, farmers, workers and Copts.

The amendments also give the president new authorities over appointing members of the judiciary and increase the army’s role in “safeguarding the constitution and the ideals of democracy, and maintaining a civil state.”

There is suspicion regarding the funding of these posters, yet it is most likely by members of the House of Representatives in the parliament who support the amendments and pro-state political parties, such as the Nation’s Future Party (NFP).

Around 485 members of the parliament who support the amendments have already held hundreds of seminars in various governorates in Egypt, in which they explained the need to participate and vote for the constitutional amendments.

Meanwhile, the parliament is still preparing the ground for the final constitution vote on 14 April, after organizing several hearing sessions throughout last month.

After the hearing sessions were concluded, the Legislative and Constitutional Affairs Committee met this week to finalise a draft of the amendments.

The amendments must first be approved by two-thirds of the members of the House, then it proceeds to a national referendum to be fully enacted into law.

Who is for the amendments?

The parliament took a provisional vote on 14 February, which saw an overwhelming majority (485 out of 596) approve the constitutional amendments.

Parliament speaker Ali Abdel-Aal defended the proposed changes, arguing they will reinforce stability and move Egypt forward on the road to political reform and democratisation.

“When we compiled the first draft of the current 2014 constitution we were under heavy pressure. We had been given one month, and we were doing our job at a time of curfew and terrorist threats,” he said.

“Haven’t we seen many states, some of them members of the UN Security Council, amend their constitutions to increase the presidential term? We also want to have a strong president who can deliver stability and development. And it is up to President Al-Sisi to decide whether he wants to run.”

The Egyptian Federation of Investors held a conference entitled “Constitutional Amendments, Stability for Investment”, which stated that the amendments will ensure more stability and a better investment climate, adding that Sisi’s rule saw greater economic achievements and gains for investors.

Mohamed Rifaat, who works for Amirty for Investment, told Egyptian Streets that as an investor, the current government introduced more flexibility in the laws and created a stable environment that encouraged more investment.

The Egyptian Cultural Club and the Coptic Association in the United States also held a seminar in New Jersey on Saturday for the Egyptian community to discuss and support the constitutional amendments.

MP Margaret Azer noted that President Sisi’s era as “the golden age for Egyptian women.”

“We are talking here about a real representation of Egyptian women in various fields,” Azir added.

Who is against the amendments?

However, a number of leftist and secular parties as well as several human rights organisations have expressed their objections to the constitutional amendments.

The Egyptian Social Democratic Party, the Karama (Dignity) Party, the Conservatives Party, the Tagammu Party and the Reform and Development Party all denounced the amendments during the hearing sessions on 27 and 28 March.

Mohamed Anwar Al-Sadat, head of the Reform and Development Party, said the amendments “serve the interests of one person”, and described the debate surrounding the amendments as “pre-packaged”.

“The media has been effectively prevented from reporting the dialogue. The only figures allowed to appear on television are those who support the amendments. There has not been a single opposition voice in the national media.”

“The current amendments are an attack on the principle of the rotation of power. They are there to allow one figure to stay in power. They also place the president of the republic as head of the Higher Council for Judges, undermining any separation of powers,” Mohamed Farid Zahran, head of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, said.

Eight Egyptian human rights NGOs have also rejected calls to amend the constitution, and called on “free Egyptian voices to push on against Al-Sisi’s commitment to the provisions of the 2014 constitution and to leave office as soon as his second and final term ends in June 2022”.

The organisations added that running for presidency for only two terms “is – almost – the only gain won by the democratic movement on 25 January 2011,” and that the amendments represent a real threat to the political and social stability of the country.

Nazra for Feminist Studies also wrote a research paper titled “The Constitutional Amendments Do Not Establish A Democracy that Supports Women in Politics,” expressing its concern for the democratic transition in Egypt.

“Separating the proposed amendments to Article 102 from the rest of the constitutional amendments and centralizing only raising women’s quotas may not truly empower women,” the paper stated.

“The myopic focus on women’s quotas irrespective of the larger democratic atmosphere governing it may exclude many women, rather than boost their representation and empower them.”

“Symbolic” rights for women cannot replace their active participation as important social actors playing a role in a true pluralist democracy, rooted in a firm belief in women’s diversity and voices and the values of pluralism, equality and freedom for both women and men.”

Two notable actors, Amr Waked and Khaled Abul Naga, attended a Congress panel criticising proposed amendments to Egypt’s constitution in Washington in late March.

Following the panel, the two actors were expelled from The Egyptian Actors Union and were accused of “high treason”, as the two actors unilaterally spoke to “external powers” to back the “agendas of conspirators” aiming to undermine Egypt’s security and stability.

A number of youth who were part of the Jan 25th 2011 revolution also expressed opposition.

“I personally believe that supporting it is equal to betraying the revolution and its martyrs,” one source who preferred to stay autonomous told Egyptian Streets, “I also do not think it is completely democratic, I remember that around 20 people were detained for starting a campaign called “?? ? ????? ?? ????” against the constitutional amendments.”

ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 28 Nigerian states are at risk of heavy flooding this year, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said Thursday.

This year's flood projections will, as expected, vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country, and rivers are likely to exceed flood level with some low-lying areas to be inundated, said the NIHSA in a statement following an earlier survey.

Out of the 774 local government areas in the country, it said, some 102 local government areas across 28 states are at risk of flooding -- one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria, which has a devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on floodplains for livelihood.

Although the projections showed that the floods this year might not be as severe as in previous years, it was important to begin to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns for preparedness, the agency said.

In March 2012, 32 of Nigeria's 36 states were affected by flooding, in which more than 360 people were killed and almost 2 million displaced.

A. SITUATION ANALYSIS

Description of the disaster

First spell of heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan Province from 6 August and continued until 7 August 2020 with intermissions. Continuous rain over a period of 24 hours caused massive flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu districts of Sindh province, with Tehsil Johi in Dadu district as the area greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods are not only damaging infrastructures and houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh has declared 80 villages in Dadu district as Calamity Affected Areas.

The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad, Jafferabad and Jhal Magsi districts where Jhal Magsi and Jafferabad districts as the most affected areas according to the rapid need assessment report. On 18 August 2020, the Government of Baluchistan also declared emergency in Jhal Magsi district. Besides the recent floods, COVID-19 outbreak is also a threat to the affected population. However, the number of positive cases reported so far in the targeted district are on lower side. As of 7 September 2020, Dadu district reported 1,184 positive cases, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad (Baluchistan) 328 and 71 reported positive COVID-19 cases respectively.

Another heavy spell of Monsoon rain started in most part of the country on 20 August 2020 and continued until 3 September 2020 with intervals. This resulted in urban flooding in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, while flash floods reported in district Shangla, Swat and flooding in Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Karachi experienced heaviest rains in almost a century, killing at least 41 people in the city. Thousands of people were trapped due to waterlogging in low-lying slums. In some part of the city people were without electricity for days as urban flooding badly affected infrastructure. The second spell of flooding has displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Despite the best efforts of the government, the living conditions of the displaced are appalling, with very limited access to safe water and food and with limited shelter. In the meantime, they have no safe water or livelihoods.",2020-10-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['n', 'dref', 'monsoon', 'mdrpk019', 'pakistan', '2020', 'water', 'operation', 'report', 'province', 'flooding', 'updates', 'karachi', 'floods', 'district', 'sindh', 'affected', 'reported']",Pakistan,news article,English
1237,FL-2020-000164-IND,Arizona could see first taste of monsoon season on Thursday - AZCentral,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-weather/2020/07/02/weather-arizona-could-see-first-taste-monsoon-season-thursday/5364559002/,"The Phoenix area could see its first taste of the monsoon season on Thursday with scattered thunderstorms forecast throughout the Valley before making way for hot temperatures over the holiday weekend.

Some parts of Maricopa County could see thunderstorms on Thursday evening, although James Sawtelle, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix, said Thursday morning that it will primarily hit the southeastern and southwestern corners of the state.

Storms developed over Pinal County, the Weather Service tweeted about 7:30 p.m.

People driving on Interstate 8 between Casa Grande and Gila Bend should watch for hazardous driving conditions due to strong winds, dust and heavy rain.

""We could see slight chances of some blowing dust moving onto the Valley, sort of during the rush hour and early evening period, due to some isolated thunderstorm activity, mainly south of the Valley,"" Sawtelle said

Even without a storm, the Phoenix area saw a colorful sunset full of pinks and oranges characteristic of monsoon season.

These weather patterns are especially common in the early week of July due to monsoon conditions ramping up, Sawtelle explained. The increased moisture present during the course of the monsoon season increases the chances of afternoon and evening thunderstorms.

The closer you get to Tucson, the more your chances of getting caught in a dust storm will increase, Sawtelle said, though the chances are still fairly low.

The National Weather Service in Tucson warned of possible flash flooding, including near the burn scar of the Bighorn Fire in the Catalina Mountains and other areas affected by the still-burning wildfire.

""There is a remote possibility that we could see a renegade isolated storm make it up a little bit further north, but not a really good chance of that,"" Sawtelle added.

The high temperature at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was 104 degrees on Thursday, according to the Weather Service.

The heat will return starting Friday with a high of 106 before climbing above 110 over the weekend and into the beginning of next week.

Things will cool down again during the second half of next week with a high of 103 degrees expected to start next Thursday.

The National Weather Service of Phoenix tweeted, ""Hot weather will linger into next week. Stay hydrated!""

The Irrigation Ministry is designing flood protection facilities on the basis of the highest rainfall recorded in the last 100 years, Abdel Aty said.

He added that the ministry has an operations room with all officials of the country, working 24 hours and monitoring every site in Egypt to prepare for any rains and floods.

Red Sea Governor Ahmed Abdallah said that the cost of the first phase of the protection measures from the flood hazards in the cities of the province amounted to LE 400 million.

He explained that these projects included the construction of dams and storage lakes from Ras Ghareb in the north to Halayeb and Shalateen in the south, which will contribute to increasing the capacity of the reservoir.

In his review of flood protection projects, Abdallah said that global climate change has changed the map of the four seasons, resulting in natural disasters beyond the capabilities of the Great Power, resulting in loss of lives and infrastructure in billions.

1384,FL-2021-000030-IDN,"After a year of COVID-19, muddy mission work feels blessedly normal - Christian Chronicle",https://christianchronicle.org/muddymission/,"Campus ministry forgoes the beach to serve in flood-stricken Kentucky. ""They were loving every second of it,"" minister says.

After a year of lockdowns, nasal swabs and Zoom lectures, it’s understandable that college students would be sorely tempted to head for the beach.

But 13 members of the RiverHawks for Christ campus ministry in Tahlequah, Okla., picked a different destination for their spring break — eastern Kentucky, the heart of the Cumberland Plateau. There, in the small towns of Jackson and Beattyville, they spent the better part of a week ripping rotted drywall and floorboards from homes devastated by floods back in March.

“They worked hard — came back muddy and tired,” said John Albright of Churches of Christ Disaster Response Team, who coordinated the work.

But after a year of COVID-19, “they were loving every second of it, absolutely,” added campus minister Tyrel Hatfield. “It was great to feel a little bit normal again.”

RiverHawks for Christ, a ministry of the South College Church of Christ in Tahlequah, serves nearby Northeastern State University. The church’s previous campus minister, Wade Bullard, planned to lead a group from the ministry on a spring break mission trip last year. They were going to help the Disaster Response Team organize its warehouse in Ohio.

‘They were loving every second of it, absolutely. It was great to feel a little bit normal again.’

The pandemic canceled those plans and turned the 2020 spring break into the longest — and arguably the worst — spring break ever. Classes, church services and ministry activities all moved online.

So did the final weeks of Andrea Stone’s high school career. Stone, who goes by Andy, grew up in the pews of the Stonewall Church of Christ in southern Oklahoma. She earned her diploma virtually before moving 150 miles northeast to Tahlequah last fall for her freshman year at Northeastern State.

“Classes have been real iffy,” she said. “Some days you go to class as normal, but at the drop of a hat anything can change.” If a classmate is diagnosed with COVID-19 or has been exposed to someone with the virus, classes may have to move online. For Stone, checking email before class — to see “whether you’re going to class or not” — is the new normal.

She didn’t know a soul when she arrived on campus but quickly found a home with RiverHawks for Christ, which hosts devotionals and Bible classes in addition to other activities with the South College Church of Christ.

Despite the uncertainty of the pandemic, the campus ministry has “been very regular,” Stone said. “We have stayed together and have been able to meet.

“It’s an escape from the panic of the virus. I find my solace here.”

Jackson, KY, USA

She was eager to join the mission trip to Kentucky — even though it meant a week of pulling up old, damp floorboards from homes. She quickly learned what it sounds like when a board pulls free with all of its nails intact — meaning she wouldn’t have to rip them out of the studs one by one.

“That’s the greatest sound in the world,” she joked, “when the nails come up with the board.”

Albright coordinated the Oklahomans in addition to church groups from California and Alabama who came to help in eastern Kentucky. They helped distribute boxes of food and cleaning supplies provided by Churches of Christ Disaster Relief Effort in Nashville, Tenn.

The area where they served was at the western edge of the McCoy family’s land during the infamous Hatfield-McCoy feud of the late 1800s. Albright made sure to point that out to Tyrel Hatfield, who brought three of his children on the trip — one of them a Northeastern State student. Hatfield, a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University, has served with the South College for 20 years and recently took on the role of campus minister.

Thankfully, no feuds broke out during the trip, joked Albright, who worships with the Clear Creek Church of Christ in Hixson, Tenn.

However, he does remember the Oklahomans singing with at least one of the homeowners they helped.

They also worshiped — and sang beautifully — with one of the Churches of Christ in the area, Albright said. When they weren’t working, the team slept on the floor of the church’s classrooms.

In addition to singing, “we prayed with people,” Hatfield said. “They were the mission, not the homes.”

Stone said that focusing on others helped take her mind off the pandemic. It also “brought us closer, as a family, to God,” she said.

Hatfield added, “I couldn’t think of a better way to spend spring break.”",2021-04-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['trip', 'campus', 'ministry', 'kentucky', 'feels', 'mission', 'normal', 'church', 'muddy', 'break', 'work', 'blessedly', 'college', 'christ', 'hatfield', 'spring', 'covid19']",India,news article,English
1603,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Heavy rains wreak havoc in Napak district - Independent,https://www.independent.co.ug/heavy-rains-wreak-havoc-in-napak-district/,"Napak, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Several houses were left flooded and many plants swept away by running water after a heavy downpour that lasted for seven hours on Wednesday morning.

The most affected sub-counties include; Lotome, Ngoleriet, Kangole town council and Matany with many families affected as well. The floods covered the newly constructed road of Moroto, Soroti near Presidential state lodge in Moruling.

Betty Nangiro, one of the affected residents of Kangole town council told Uganda Radio Network (URN) that her houses are full of water and all her food has been soaked in water. “I don’t know where to start from, because right now I don’t have anything to give to the children for supper because all the food has been soaked in water,” said Nangiro.

Another resident Joseph Lokol told URN that floods have swept away eight of his birds and two pigs that he received from the Operation and Wealth Creation programme. “I don’t know where the floods have taken my eight birds and two pigs. I had a lot of hope to see the pigs change my situation in the long run,” he said.

Simon Kotol, the vice-chairman LC1 of Kangole chini told URN that many birds have been washed away by running water. He said the floods would worsen already starving families who have been facing a big challenge to afford food. “We have been receiving rains but this is too much and abnormal am sure many families are going to be affected,” he said.

Jimmy Tebanyang, the LCV councillor for Ngoleriet sub-county in Napak district appealed to development partners and the office of the prime minister to come and support the flood victims. He said although the people of Napak have been eager to have rain, the current rains are too much that they are washing away plantations.

The State Emergency Service said evacuated residents of Pitt Town North, Pitt Town Bottoms, Cornwallis, North Richmond, Agnes Banks, Gronos Point and Freemans Reach should not return until authorities give the all-clear.

“Even as flood waters recede, utilities will continue to be impacted and there will likely be extensive debris including hazardous materials and potentially unsafe roads,” the SES said in a statement on Sunday.

The SES warned flood water can contain sewage, debris and dead animals so locals must avoid entering it, playing in it or driving through it.

Evacuation orders on the NSW mid-north coast and near Moree have now lifted, with eight “all clear” return notices issued as river levels fall.

Rapid damage assessments were taking place through western and north-west Sydney in areas such as Penrith, The Hills and Hawkesbury. Some 3,500 assessments have been carried out to date.

“The teams out in the field are working closely with the community and local services to begin the recovery process,” Allison Flaxman of the SES said.

On Sunday, a major flood warning remained in place for the Barwon River in north-west NSW, as well as moderate flood warnings for the Bogan River in the state’s central west and the Macintyre and Weir Rivers near the Queensland border.

The SES has received more than 23,000 calls for help from the public, and volunteers have attended more than 13,000 jobs since the floods began.

Grants and bank loans will be made available to businesses in flood-affected areas to fund their recovery, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced.

Morrison said on Saturday that a loan scheme would be extended to flood-affected small and medium businesses.

He said the federal government would underwrite 80% of bank loans of up to $5m for small and medium businesses in the flood-affected areas, with repayments to start two years into the loan.

The measure is an extension of a support program available for Covid-affected firms.

“This is about backing the businesses and producers that are backing themselves to get back on their feet,” Morrison said.

The loans are on top of a recovery grants program jointly funded by the federal and NSW governments. Small businesses can get up to $50,000 and primary producers up to $75,000 if they’ve been affected by floods.

As tens of thousands of people across NSW returned to their homes over the weekend, an emergency services taskforce was tackling the cleanup, including Australian defence force personnel, the NSW Rural Fire Service and Fire and Rescue NSW.

The Australian Red Cross warned of a lack of access to mental health help, and urged people affected by the floods to take steps to protect their psychological wellbeing as well as their physical health.

Meanwhile, the search for an elderly woman continued after police pulled her empty car from the swollen Barrington River on Thursday.

Tourists urged to keep NSW Easter plans

Tourism operators hit by recent heavy rain are hoping the upcoming Easter break gives them a much-needed boost.

At the Discovery Park at Forster on the mid-north coast of NSW, which was inundated by this past week’s “rain bomb”, manager Jane Ticehurst said they are gearing up for the holiday.

Ticehurst said she was expecting a full house for the Easter break, which means accommodating about 1,000 guests.

All of this past week’s guests had to be cancelled and rebooked so staff could concentrate on cleaning up after flooding.

The property sits above the Wallamba River, and while some locals said the waterway was at its highest level in memory, the park’s infrastructure escaped relatively undamaged.

Despite some facilities like the boardwalk going under water, Ticehurst said she was feeling fortunate.

“Our team has been impacted in a whole number of ways, from a housekeeper who has lost everything in her property, to most of the team who were landlocked and couldn’t get to work,” Ticehurst said.

“We did have to cancel Easter for everyone last year because of Covid. We’re certainly hoping not to impact Easter this time round.

“The whole of this area has been impacted heavily in the last 18 months, fires followed by Covid and the flooding.

“I guess we can look forward to getting back up and running.”

The NSW Tourism Industry Council executive manager, Greg Binskin, said while some caravan parks along rivers had been hard hit, most operators were pushing ahead with Easter plans.

“[The floods] have been another setback in what’s been a pretty tough 24 months [but] a lot of them are confident they will get cleaned up and ready to be welcoming visitors again,” he said.

He said while the past two years have been tough for operators, domestic tourism has also prompted an uptake in visitors, with international borders still shut.

Binskin said with the jobkeeper wage subsidy ending, programs like the NSW government’s Dine and Discover hospitality voucher scheme – which gives patrons money towards meals and entertainment – would help businesses get back on their feet.

The tourism boss urged people to continue with their Easter plans.

“It’s always a great extended long weekend. We’d urge people to continue to head into regional areas and support your fellow Aussies,” he said.",2021-03-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'nsw', 'residents', 'recedes', 'told', 'floods', 'river', 'stay', 'evacuated', 'sydney', 'easter', 'impacted', 'areas', 'ses', 'debris', 'businesses', 'flood', 'cleanup']",Australia,news article,English

(PTI Photo)

Assam floods: Animals in the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in Morigaon district of Assam under Guwahati Wildlife division have been bearing the brunt of heavy flooding in the larger parts of the sanctuary as incessant rains continue to lash the northeastern state. While many of them seek refuge in the remaining highlands in the park, hunger pangs have driven others out of the forest area. As per an estimate, around 85 per cent area of Pobitora is flooded with water.

A video posted by news agency ANI showed the plight of flood-hit animals. One-horned Indian rhinoceros, which is listed as ‘Vulnerable’ on the IUCN Red List, can be seen taking refuge in the isolated highlands in the otherwise flooded wildlife sanctuary. Its movement has largely got restricted owing to heavy flooding. The one-horned rhinoceros are running helter-skelter for safety, only to risk their lives from predators or from poachers and starvation too.

Many animals flocked together in groups to safeguard against nature’s agony. Haunted by scarcity of food, most of the wild animals have moved to the park’s numerous highlands. A number of other animals have moved to the Karbi hills, an area vulnerable for poaching.

Heavy rains and floods have damaged or submerged almost all the roads connecting to the forest camps in Pobitora. The forest personnel use country boats to take stock of the situation in the park. The floods have hit the anti-poaching operations in the park as many of the anti-poaching camps are submerged under water. The state government has deployed Special Rhino Protection Force personnel to protect fleeing rhinos from poaching.

The latest video from inside the park has come after the images of a fully grown Royal Bengal Tiger ‘relaxing’ on a bed inside a shop in the flooded Kaziranga National Park went viral on social media and thrown spotlight on the plight of animals as the state battles the deluge. Over 95% of the Park is submerged, rendering animals shelterless and forcing them to look for refuge in human habitations and highlands.

According to news agency PTI, the calamity has claimed the lives of 129 animals in the Kaziranga National Park, including 10 rhinos, 62 hog deer, eight sambhar deer and an equal number of wild boar, five swamp deer, two porcupines, an elephant and a wild buffalo till Saturday since July 13. Many animals were killed after being hit by vehicles while crossing the national highway 37 to reach the highlands in nearby Karbi Anglong district.",2019-07-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['bear', 'wildlife', 'near', 'guwahati', 'brunt', 'rhinoceros', 'state', 'submerged', 'highlands', 'floods', 'assam', 'pobitora', 'animals', 'sanctuary', 'watch', 'wild', 'park']",India,news article,English
1385,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Parametric insurance comes of age - Insurance – general - Nat CAT - Asia Insurance Review,https://www.asiainsurancereview.com/Magazine/ReadMagazineArticle?aid=44424,"Climate change, natural catastrophes and environmental stress from urban densification are all contributing to a new risk landscape in Asia Pacific. Taken together, they act as a ‘threat multiplier’ that increases the impacts of existing industry exposures.

In recent years, a diverse range of perils dominated losses across the region. The year 2020 saw comparatively less Pacific tropical cyclone activity than the climatological average, yet total economic loss from cyclones exceeded $26bn, according to top brokers’ recent climate and Nat CAT reports.

This was largely due to record-breaking super typhoons: Goni (Rolly) in the Philippines, with the strongest wind speed at landfall (195 mph/315 kph) ever recorded and Ampham, the strongest storm on record to form in the Bay of Bengal, impacting India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Notably, droughts in China and Vietnam at the start of the year were followed by extensive flooding throughout the region, impacting 19 countries with total losses exceeding $55bn. After two years as the lead bearer of Nat CAT loss in the region, Japan also sustained significant $8.5bn in economic damage due to flood, namely in the Kyushu Islands.

The country was hit with less typhoon-related loss than the devastating Jebi, Trami, Hagibis and Faxai of the 2018 and 2019 seasons, but sadly marked the 10-year anniversary of the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami. Wildfires, extreme weather, including major hail events in Australia, all rounded out a recorded total $102bn in economic losses due from Nat CAT, down slightly from the total $107bn of 2019.

Hardening market accentuates protection gap challenges

With significant year-over-year recorded losses, the Nat CAT protection gap in APAC keeps widening with only 23% of losses insured in 2018, falling to 19% in 2019 and further to only 12% in 2020.

Hardening market conditions from 1 January 2021 renewals indicate that this gap is likely to continue to grow. The past two renewal seasons have seen the trend in increasing property prices continue, ranging from 5-15%, with magnified impacts on highly Nat CAT exposed assets. More recently brokers also report further restrictions by reinsurers on terms and conditions, especially policy extensions such as non-damage business interruption covers.

With continued hardening, pressure mounts on Nat CAT deductibles and availability of competitively priced capacity, while corporates are urged to contain their premium spend. The current trend is expected to continue for at least the next 12-18 months and reinforces the role of the broker in thorough programme engineering.

This market evolution around Nat CAT has dealt a particularly heavy blow to the hospitality industry, as well as other assets that face limited market capacity, e.g. overhead telecommunications overhead transmission and distribution (T&D) lines, transportation infrastructure and offshore property.

Use of parametrics is increasingly common to cover Nat CAT

Thankfully, as budgets and market capacity tighten, the growth of innovative risk transfer alternatives - such as parametric insurance - are also picking up speed. Driven by the availability of high quality data and new technologies, these alternatives are quickly becoming mainstream and cost-effective solutions to keep corporate and public sector clients covered in all market conditions.

For example, when a client experiences rate hikes in their property programme, their broker can suggest carving out their Nat CAT risks to a parametric cover. Often we see that this increases traditional player’s risk appetite, thus easing negotiations and enabling placement of their remaining programme.

The parametric cover also allows brokers to preserve their clients’ Nat CAT limits at an affordable premium. It provides swift liquidity of predetermined amounts in the event of a triggering natural event - cyclone, earthquake, drought, heavy rainfall, extreme weather, etc. - introducing much needed transparency following the unsettling lessons in coverage exclusions that the market learnt with COVID-19.

APAC: Parametrics in action

Infrastructure – How to cover a highway in the most earthquake- and cyclone-exposed region of Southeast Asia

Pain point: The traditional product offering, with double digit rate increases, was prohibitively expensive and did not offer lender set limits. Additionally, the nature of the asset, including various structure categories (bridges, tunnels) made it difficult for the client and broker to find capacity.

Solution: We designed a parametric combined earthquake and cyclone cover for the entirety of the highway that took into account the changing soil nature and civil infrastructure along the route, adjusting payout for earthquake or wind speed severity accordingly. Earthquake exposure is measured in near-real time using peak-ground-acceleration recordings while cyclone activity is monitored using official data from JTWC. The highway got covered to the full required limit with bespoke terms that satisfied both risk management and financial parties.

Manufacturer – Covering flood while accounting for flood barriers, a challenge addressed by parametric insurance

Pain point: An electronics manufacturer in Thailand with significant flood exposure and heavy losses from 2011, now has its premises protected by a dike fortified riverfront. The risk accumulation, loss history and changing landscape due to the installation of flood barriers, made it difficult to find capacity for high value assets.

Solution: A parametric flood cover was designed to take into account client installed flood barriers. Custom tailored to the client’s risk exposure, the structure swiftly pays out when river water levels overtop the dike at predefined thresholds, as measured by on-site IoT gauges. Descartes monitored their exposure in real-time, notifying the client and providing quick indemnification if the policy triggered.

Distributed assets – T&D lines in the eye of the cyclone

Pain point: By nature, overhead T&D networks have extensive exposure to cyclone risk, making them heavily impacted by premium rate hikes when market conditions harden. Their locational distribution also adds an additional challenge to traditional loss adjustment.

Solution: Our parametric models precisely mapped the grid and network of T&D lines, providing a granular assessment of their cyclone exposure. Hand-in-hand with the client’s in-house risk management, we designed payout structures for each wind speed based on the modelled impact to the network, flexibly matching the client’s budget and ensuring a full-limit cover. Remote, near real-time monitoring of wind data allowed for payment within just a few days following a triggering cyclone, without undergoing the hassle of loss-adjustment on these wide-spread assets. Carving-out these heavily exposed assets also facilitated the traditional placement of the rest of the client’s programme. A

Huawei Tech Investment, also known as Huawei Indonesia, a local arm of the Chinese tech giant, has launched a series of campaigns to give back to the Indonesian community, recognizing a need to create shared value and support economic, social, and environmental progress.

Huawei had launched the “I Do” campaigns last year to tackle many issues, Jacky Chen, Huawei Indonesia's chief executive officer (CEO), said on Thursday.

“Through “I Do Contribute,” we strive to find ways out through the latest technologies to accelerate Indonesian economic recovery in the post-pandemic scenario. We also launched a program to cultivate 100,000 Indonesian digital talents for 5 years to build a solid foundation for future-ready human capital,” he said.

A team of Huawei technicians took on the task to restore Jakarta's communication network early last year when the capital experienced the worst flooding in more than 154 years that saw 50 deaths and 170,000 displaced from their homes.

The initiative was under Huawei's ""I Do Care"" campaign that also provides relief aid for the flood victims.

“We shared our happiness to the needy during Ramadan by paying visits and donations to 30 orphanages in 15 cities across the archipelago,” Jacky said.

Under “I Do Collaborate,” Huawei worked with the government, business communities, and key stakeholders to accelerate digital transformation in Indonesia.

During the pandemic, Huawei's “I Do Create” campaign enhanced government institutions', enterprises', and hospitals' operation with the implementation of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and cloud computing platform.

The company had also given more than 1,000 cloud accounts for free to 500 universities across Indonesia to support the “Never Stop Learning” initiative in distant learning and digital transformation, Chen said.",2021-04-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['chen', 'transformation', 'digital', 'launched', 'shared', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', 'tech', 'support', 'huawei']",India,news article,English

The Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom has called for the immediate relocation of all persons who were displaced by floods in the districts of Buliisa, Hoima, Kagadi and Kikuube.



More than 2000 homes have been submerged by floods from the rising water levels of Lake Albert in the four districts over the last nine months. Records show that up t0 38,000 people were displaced affected in Buliisa district alone, especially in the areas of Wanseko, Katanga, Kawaibanda, Butiaba, Boma, Kigangaizi, Tugombili and Walukuba.



Also affected are the areas of Bugoigo, Kamagongoro, Kigungu, Serule, Piida, Waisoki, Triangle and Magali in Butiaba Sub-county, Kabolwa and Kigoya landing sites in Kigoya sub-county. In Kagadi district, the floods have swept through the areas of Kabukanga, Rwebigongoro, Nkuse and Ndaiga.



Those affected in Hoima are Tonya, Kijangi, Kaiso, Rwentali, Hoimo, Fofo, Mbegu, Waaki and Kiryamboga among others, while the affected areas in Kikuube include Nkondo, Sebigoro, Ususa, Senjojo, Wangjok, Busiki and Nsonga.



Andrew Byakutaga, the Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom Prime Minister says the situation has gone out of hand, and that the government needs to intervene and save the lives of people that are now at risk. The flood victims are currently occupying churches and schools, whole others are sleeping in the cold.

Francis Kazini, the Kikuube LCV Chairperson wonders why the government has not taken appropriate action to have the flood victims relocated.



In August, The Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom petitioned the government to immediately extend relief food to thousands of people affected by floods in the region.

1597,FL-2011-000132-UGA,'No One Is Coming': Residents Face Devastation After Floods - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/no-one-coming-residents-face-devastation-floods/,"KASESE, UGANDA — Around 1 a.m. on May 7, 2020, Lorna Bambu heard screams.

Frightened voices told her, her seven children and their neighbors to run. Heavy rains had soaked western Uganda’s mountainous Kasese region the day before, and now the area’s rivers had burst their banks. Torrents of water rushed into the valley, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.

Bambu, 37, tried to escape. “I was stuck. The water was to my knees, and my hands held two of my youngest children,” she says. “We held onto whatever we could until help came in the morning.”

Bambu’s house was swept away in the flooding, but she and her children survived. Her husband was not so lucky. “My husband, who was at a bar when it happened, tried to get to us but was injured by a moving log,” she says. “As we could not get medical help in time, he died.”

The Kilembe Mines Hospital, the region’s primary medical center, which serves more than 20,000 residents, would normally have been accessible by an easy 15-minute walk. But the flooding destroyed the hospital and made area roads impassable, cutting off the region from other health care facilities.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Water, rocks and mud swept through the Kilembe Mines Hospital and destroyed the medical center. Staff members were able to evacuate patients, and the hospital has reopened on a provisional basis at a new location.

The flooding affected more than 100,000 people in the region. At least 1,200 were left homeless and 18 were killed, says Godfrey Kabbyanga, mayor of the Kasese Municipal Council.

The dire situation is a consequence of environmental changes, as well as growing political and socioeconomic concerns. As a result, disasters like this are likely to become more common in the years ahead.

“In Kasese, rivers have been known to flood periodically since the 1940s,” says Evelyn Mugume, environment officer for the Kasese municipality. Climate change is causing snow in the mountains to melt, she says, increasing the frequency and severity of the flooding. Local residents also have been illegally building homes and farms along the banks of River Nyamwamba, one of the main rivers in the region, making the land too unstable to control the floodwaters.

“Areas along the riverbanks are supposed to be managed by government, but people have got to own plots there,” Mugume says. “They have degraded this land, because not all of them know how to manage it. Politicians use lip service to protect illegal occupants. They do not advocate enough for environment protection.”

The government has put forward plans to restore the riverbanks by constructing barriers to protect infrastructure and calling on residents to plant bamboo and reeds, which can help control erosion.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Flooding from River Nyamwamba cut off one of the main roads in the Kasese area, affecting thousands of residents. Local officials are still assessing damage in the region and deciding how to proceed with reconstruction.

But Centenary Robert Franco, a member of Parliament who represents the Kasese municipality, says the responsibility for managing the land lies elsewhere.

“It’s not my duty to protect the environment – there are organizations for that,” he says. “We do not make these people stay on the land.”

Local residents say they are aware of efforts to restore the riverbanks, but the plans don’t put food on their tables, leaving them with no choice but to continue to build and farm along the river. “I cannot grow bamboo on the small land I have,” says Bera Edith, 36, a mother of five whose house was destroyed in mudslides last May.

Since the flooding, Bera, Bambu and approximately 900 other residents of the region have been living in tents and semipermanent houses in the Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp for internally displaced people.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda The Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp houses approximately 900 people from the Kasese region. Conditions in the camp have been deteriorating, and residents have appealed to the government to provide better accommodations and sanitation.

Conditions in the camp are deteriorating, according to Sikabyahoro Jimmy, the camp’s chairman.

“Many have symptoms of typhoid and malaria, and there are no drugs in the nearest health center,” he says. He adds that aid workers at the camp have been overwhelmed and that the last delivery of supplies was in October.

“There is no food, the hospital is far,” he says. “We have called for help, but no one is coming.”

Centenary says the government is aware of conditions in the camp and is trying to get the displaced residents food and other necessities, and permanently resettle them in areas less prone to flooding. But finding available land to house them has proven challenging, and many Kasese residents say they would like to return to their original homes, despite the risk of flooding.

Kabbyanga, Kasese’s mayor, says local officials are still working to assess the damage to the area. For Bambu and other Kasese residents, however, rebuilding has become a way of life.

“The mountains do get angry, but sometimes you get a rainbow after the storm,” she says. “I just hope to never experience the rage of the rivers again. I pray that for my children as well.”",2021-01-26 08:00:00+00:00,"['devastation', 'camp', 'rivers', 'coming', 'land', 'help', 'region', 'residents', 'kasese', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'hospital', 'face']",Uganda,news article,English
961,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Did the 10 Plagues of Egypt Really Happen? Here Are 3 Theories - TIME,https://time.com/5561441/passover-10-plagues-real-history/,"When the Passover holiday begins — on the evening of April 8 in 2020 — Jewish people around the world will celebrate by retelling the biblical story of the Exodus from Egypt — including the 10 plagues that God inflicted on the Ancient Egyptians.

As the Passover story tells it, after Pharaoh refuses Moses’ entreaties to let the enslaved Israelites go free, God sends a series of ten plagues to pressure the Egyptian ruler. Each time, Pharaoh promises to free the Israelites, but reverses his decision when the plague is lifted — until the last one. The plagues are: water turning to blood, frogs, lice, flies, livestock pestilence, boils, hail, locusts, darkness and the killing of firstborn children.

The question of whether Bible stories can be linked to archaeological discoveries is one that has long fascinated scholars. The ten plagues are no exception, and over the years scientists have been curious about whether the story of the plagues may have been based on some event that can be proved to have happened. Here are three of the major theories to know.

Volcanic Eruption

This theory argues that the plagues were really the fallout of volcanic eruption on the island of Santorini in the south of Greece around 1620-1600 BCE. Microbiologist Siro Trevisanato, author of The Plagues of Egypt: Archaeology, History and Science Look at the Bible, argues that ancient Egyptian medical texts support this idea.

Winds would have carried the volcanic ash to Egypt at some point over the summer, and the toxic acids in the volcanic ash would have included the mineral cinnabar, which could have been capable of turning a river a blood-like red color, Trevisanato holds. The accumulated acidity in the water would have caused frogs to leap out and search for clean water. Insects would have burrowed eggs in the bodies of dead animals and human survivors, which generated larvae and then adult insects. Then, the volcanic ash in the atmosphere would have affected the weather, with acid rain landing on people’s skin, which in turn caused boils. The grass would have been contaminated, poisoning the animals that ate it. The humidity from the rain and the subsequent hail would have created optimal conditions for locusts to thrive. Volcanic eruptions could also explain the several days of darkness — which means nine plagues are accounted for.

Trevisanato also found an ancient Egyptian account of the children of aristocrats lying dead in public and archaeological data matching the account. He believes that, amid all this destruction, firstborn children could have been sacrificed out of desperation, in the hopes that such a meaningful sacrifice would lead their gods to stop punishing them.

Red Algae

This theory — put forth by scientists like John S. Marr, an epidemiologist who wrote a 1996 journal article featured in the New York Times — argues that red algae could have sucked oxygen out of Egypt’s waterways, killed the fish and turned the water red. Just as in the volcano theory, frogs then leapt out looking for food, and died. Without frogs to eat the insects, the pests proliferated and feasted on corpses, a feeding frenzy for flies and locusts. The paper argued that the lice could have been a type of insect called culicoides, which can carry two diseases that could explain the livestock deaths: African horse sickness and Bluetongue. The boils on humans could have been caused by glanders, an airborne bacterial disease spread by flies or tainted meat.

In this theory the darkness is coincidentally caused by a sandstorm. The darkness would have left the crops — well, whatever crops were left after the other problems — moldy, and the mold could have produced airborne toxins that might explain widespread childhood death.

Climate Change

This addendum to the algae theory points out that, for red algae to flourish in the first place, there needs to be slow, sludgy, warm water. In 2010, research on stalagmites —elongated mineral deposits that form out of calcium in precipitation — suggested that there had been a dry period towards the end of the rule of Pharaoh Ramses II. That change would have dried up the Nile and significantly slowed down the flow of water, according to paleoclimatologist Augusto Mangini. These conditions are ripe for the growth of the bacterium Oscillatoria rubescens, more colloquially, Burgundy Blood algae, according to biologist Stephan Pflugmacher.

But ask someone who’s celebrating Passover, and they’re likely to say that the question of whether scientists can prove the plagues really happened in ancient history is irrelevant to the holiday.

“To me it doesn’t matter whether scientists are able to find a historical basis for something that happened around 3,500 years ago. The central message is that God brought the plagues on Egypt in order to free the Israelite slaves,” says Jerusalem-based Rabbi Yonatan Neril. God was teaching the ancient Egyptians a lesson about justice, he says, and when they refused to do the right thing and free the Israelites, they suffered the consequences.

However, Neril — as the co-founder and executive director of the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development — does say that science has a key role to play in how the story of the plagues is told and received today. That’s because he sees another lesson in it, one for the era of man-made climate change. The pollution of Ancient Egypt’s water echoes water-pollution and water-scarcity issues today. Frogs, with their very sensitive skin, are an indicator species, meaning that their suffering is seen by scientists as a marker of a larger imbalance in society around them. And to Neril, the parallels don’t stop there.

“The Egyptians were very happy to have a free source of labor in the form of Israelite slaves. When God said this needs to stop, they were reluctant to change,” he says. “Fossil fuels, in the past 150 years, have replaced slave labor as the key driver of human society. There’s a Pharaoh within us that wants to continue to do something that’s not right.”

Correction, April 18:

The original version of this story misstated Yonatan Neril’s affiliation with the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development. He is the founder of the organization, not a co-founder.

The National Hurricane Center in Miami issued advisories Tuesday for Hurricane Iselle and Tropical Storm Julio.

Iselle could be hitting Hawaii by Friday and Julio two or three days after that, said James Franklin, the chief of hurricane specialists.

“There’s enough uncertainty in the track that it’s too soon to talk specific impacts,” Franklin said.

Iselle is expected to weaken.

“Right now it’s a major hurricane but it will not be able to maintain that strength,” he said. “But it still could be at or near hurricane strength.”

The outlook for Julio is more uncertain.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu is taking over responsibility and would issue any hurricane watches or warnings.

Two big storms so close together in the eastern Pacific are rare but not unexpected in years with a developing El Nino, a change in ocean temperature that affects weather around the world.

“It’s certainly pretty rare,” Franklin said. “The central Pacific doesn’t see nearly the activity that the Atlantic sees.”

When an El Nino develops, “those are the kinds of years you see more activity,” he said.

1856,FL-2017-000067-BRA,UPDATE 2-Brazil's central bank to flood lenders with fresh liquidity - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-brazil-banks-idUSL1N2BG0IX,"(Adds more measures, central bank president quotes)

BRASILIA, March 23 (Reuters) - Brazil’s central bank on Monday said it planned to inject 1.2 trillion reais ($233.81 billion) into the country’s financial system to counteract the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, with more than half that amount comprising loans to banks.

Under the program, lenders will be able to package their loan portfolios into long-term deposits to be acquired by the central bank in a move aimed at freeing up 670 billion reais for fresh loans.

The bank loans are part of a raft of steps the Brazilian central bank announced aimed at keeping consumers and companies borrowing amid the coronavirus outbreak that it said would collectively make available the equivalent of 16.7% of Brazil’s gross domestic product in fresh cash.

“This is the biggest liquidity injection ever announced by the central bank,” Central bank President Roberto Campos Neto said in a conference call with reporters. “We understand that the acquisition of long-term deposits backed by banks’ loans will allow money to get to companies.”

New regulations governing the letters of credit backed by loans will be released soon, Campos Neto added.

Shares in Brazil’s biggest lenders were underperforming the Bovespa stock exchange index, amid concerns on credit deliquencies amid the coronavirus outbreak, with shares in Itau Unibanco Holdings SA and Banco Bradesco SA down 8% and Banco do Brasil SA losing 9%.

The central bank also cut long-term reserve requirements to 17% from 25%, freeing up 68 billion reais currently in compulsory deposits with the central bank to banks.

It also announced measures allowing small and mid-sized lenders to issue up to 2 billion reais in special long-term bonds guaranteed by a privately held deposit insurance fund, limited to an amount equivalent to its shareholders’ equity.

The central bank estimates the measure will allow banks to extend up to 200 billion reais in new loans.

The central bank said it will also extend loans backed by corporate bonds to financial institutions between March 23 and April 30 to add liquidity to their investment funds.

The Brazilian central bank last week allowed lenders to offer firms and households in good financial shape increased loans and better terms over the next six months, besides lowering capital requirements.

Campos Neto added the central bank may further lower reserve requirements and announce other additional measures if necessary.

83,DR-2015-000134-SOM,"Campus exceeds goal for water savings, seeks to do more - UC Santa Cruz",https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/AASHE-water-award.html,"Like cities across California, UC Santa Cruz has been working hard to further reduce its water usage in the midst of the state's historic drought.

In the past fiscal year, the campus cut water use by 27 percent, exceeding the city's Stage 3 Water Emergency reduction goal of 25 percent, and water managers continue to look for ways to save even more.

The campus and its efforts were recognized as a top performer in conserving water and protecting water quality by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education and is featured in its 2015 Sustainable Campus Index.

The success is the result of hard work from people across campus who stepped up to help lower campus consumption in a variety of ways - reducing irrigation, encouraging behavior modification, sharing more information with users, and installing low-flow faucets, toilets, and pumps.

""Conserving water on campus is everyone's job,"" said Elida Erickson, interim director of sustainability. ""In addition to reducing usage, the campus is looking at ways to harvest and reuse water.""

Since spring 2014, a group of staff and students, has met monthly as the Water Working Group. Members come from all parts of campus - labs, the farm, the arboretum, housing and more. Santa Cruz Water Department conservation manager Toby Goddard offers an update on the city's usage and the status of the San Lorenzo River and the Loch Lomond reservoir.

The group shares campus usage and savings, and explores ways to do more.

In a recent meeting, Energy Manager Patrick Testoni reported that the campus is off to a strong start for the 2015-16 year, lowering its summer months' usage by a cumulative 24.3 percent.

""Achieving water reduction targets on campus requires effective engagement of students, staff, and faculty,"" Testoni said, ""and our success speaks to the collaborative approach we have had between these groups on campus.""

The Water Working Group put together a list of projects that could quickly reduce usage. The projects included laboratory equipment and ultra-low-flow toilets and faucets retrofits in some of the busiest campus areas.

Additionally, low-flow shower heads were installed in campus residence halls along with reminders to aim for a 5-minute shower.

The campus also has invested in cellular broadcasters connected to its 400 water meters that allows it to track usage across campus by the hour. This level of detail also alerts water managers to identify potential leaks. Several have been detected - and fixed - since the retrofits began in May.

Campus water use per capita has declined for more than a decade. The campus baseline use - a three-year average from fiscal years 2003-2005 - is 14,200 gallons per person a year.

In fiscal year 2012, the campus used 9,100 gallons per person, a 36 percent reduction from the baseline. Today's per capita use is at about 8,400 gallons per year, a 40 percent decline from the baseline.

Today, total annual campus water use is 20 million gallons less than 20 years ago, even though campus population has grown.",2015-10-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['gallons', 'group', 'water', 'seeks', 'goal', 'toilets', 'working', 'reduction', 'usage', 'savings', 'fiscal', 'ways', 'campus', 'exceeds']",Somalia,news article,English
1218,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Kabbalah of Information: 'The Theory of Evil - Part I' - The Jerusalem Post,https://www.jpost.com/kabbalah/kabbalah-of-information-evil-does-not-abide-with-you-psalms-55-658259,"Introduction

The following will introduce the fundamental principles of the Kabbalah of Information regarding the structure and functioning of Creation, based on an analysis of events described in the Torah and the Nevi’im (Prophets). There will be a particular focus on the concept of Evil in Creation.



When studying the Torah, it is important to approach the text as a single whole: each letter, each word, and each story is interconnected.



In addition to the 613 commandments that are explicitly listed, the Torah also contains a wealth of other teachings and lessons. In order to uncover these lessons, one must reveal the hidden links, parallels, and patterns that exist between the events described in the Torah.



This task requires knowledge of the Kabbalah.



Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, a 2nd-century Tannaitic sage and disciple of Rabbi Akiva, described the stories in the Torah as the garments, the commandments as the body, and the Kabbalah as the soul of the Torah.



This article will attempt to analyze the following interconnected stories through the lens of the Kabbalah of Information:



> The Flood

> Abraham’s descent into and ascent from Egypt

> The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the salvation of Lot

> Jacob’s flight from Laban with his family

> The Exodus



The links between these stories will be traced according to the following considerations:

1 - All of the individuals mentioned in the stories above suffered from a higher evil that they could not overcome on their own.

According to the Kabbalah, the higher the root of the animal soul, the lower it may fall. It is believed that the souls of the most malevolent villains are initially formed at a higher level of revelation of the information conveyed by HaShem (the Almighty). In other words, they are very powerful. This is true of the antediluvians, the Pharaoh of the time of Abraham, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and Laban, the Pharaoh of the Exodus period, and Esau. This seemingly paradoxical fact requires further clarification, which will be provided in the following sections.

2 - All of the stories mentioned above involve the direct intervention of HaShem with miraculous deliverance.

3 - None of the individuals in any of the stories listed above broke from evil entirely:





— Noah took a grapevine with him on the Ark.

— Hagar accompanied Abraham and Sarah out of Egypt.

— Lot’s wife looked back while leaving Sodom.

— Rachel stole Laban’s teraphim as Jacob fled with his family.

— When Moses delivered the children of Israel from Egypt, they were joined by ‘a great mixed multitude’ of Egyptians.



4 - All of the aforementioned events had incredibly negative and irreversible consequences.





Each story will be reviewed below in further detail, followed by a general overview from the standpoint of the Kabbalah of Information.

1 - Chapter 1:

And There Was a Severe Famine in the Land, and Abraham Descended to Egypt; or the Pharaoh’s Revenge.



A brief description of the events in this story:



The Torah tells us, “And there was a famine in the land, and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there because the famine was severe in the land.” The Torah tells us, “And there was a famine in the land, and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there because the famine was severe in the land.”

As they approach Egypt, Abram (Abraham) asks his wife Sarai (Sarah) to pretend to be his sister. Pharaoh takes Sarah to the palace and bestows on Abraham herds of animals, menservants, and maidservants.

The Midrash B’reishit Rabbah gives the following description of the event: “Rabbi Levi said: All that night the angel stood with a staff in his hand and hit. If she said ‘Hit,’ he hit; if she said ‘Leave,’ he left.”

Pharaoh realizes that he has been deceived, returns Sarah to Abraham, and gives him money. Abraham and Sarah return to the Holy Land.

After some time, we learn that they are accompanied by Hagar, an Egyptian woman who had become Sarah’s handmaid.

This story has elicited much commentary, but the sages remain divided in opinion.

For example, Rashi wrote in his commentary that the famine was meant to challenge Abraham’s faith: “To test him, whether he would think ill of the words of the Holy One, blessed be He, Who ordered him to go to the Land of Canaan, and now He was forcing him to leave it.”

Therefore, Abraham is commended for not questioning the will of HaShem and descending into Egypt.

This interpretation is shared by Abraham ibn Ezra.

Ramban, however, held the polar opposite opinion.

In his commentary on the Torah, he writes, “And know that [our patriarch] Abraham sinned a great sin inadvertently, by bringing his wife the saint in a compromising situation, due to his fear that he be killed.” He further suggests that Abraham should have trusted HaShem to save both him, his wife, and all that they owned, as HaShem had the power to aid and to protect him. Ramban insists that Abraham’s descent from the land where he had been guided was a sin as he should have known that HaShem would have kept him from perishing during the famine. “Because of this action,” he concludes, “It was decreed that his descendants be exiled to Egypt at the hand of Pharaoh.”

The belief that Abraham’s descent into Egypt would lead to the exile is also expressed in the Zohar.

It is later revealed that Hagar also left Egypt with Sarah and Abraham. It is important to note that the Torah provides information about Hagar immediately after describing the prophecy of the exile to Egypt.

Who was Hagar, and how did she become part of Sarah and Abraham’s household? The Torah does not say. However, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in the Midrash B’reishit Rabbah explains that: “Hagar was Pharaoh’s daughter. When he saw the deeds on behalf of Sarah in his house, he took his daughter and gave her to her, saying, ‘Better that my daughter be a maidservant in this house than a mistress in another house.’”

This author believes that by analyzing the consequences of Hagar joining Abraham and Sarah’s household, another explanation for the event may be provided.

Pharaoh ruled the most powerful empire on earth. A small tribe enters his land, headed by a ‘shepherd.’ The shepherd has a very beautiful sister. Pharaoh takes the sister to his palace and bestows immense riches on her brother. From Pharaoh’s point of view, there is nothing unlawful about his actions.

However, it becomes apparent that the ‘shepherd’ has tricked him by disguising his wife as his sister. This event is followed by the punishment described above and the departure of Abraham’s family from Egypt, taking great riches.

What might Pharaoh have felt in this situation?





Firstly, he might have felt extreme humiliation (undeserved, from his point of view). It is worth noting that this punishment would have felt particularly shameful, as it was caused by a woman. This is reaffirmed, for instance, in Judges: “And Abimelech came up to the tower, and fought against it. And he went close to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. And a certain woman cast a piece of an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. And he called hastily to the young man, his weapon bearer, and said to him, ‘Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ And his young man pierced him, and he died.”

At the same time, Pharaoh must have also been overcome with fear and hatred. Fear because he could feel that the Higher Power was on Abraham’s side. Hatred because of how deeply he had been humiliated. It would be reasonable to assume that Pharaoh wanted to seek revenge, but he could not afford to do so openly out of fear of the Higher Power. Thus, he decided to give away his daughter Hagar to serve as a handmaid. In this author’s opinion, Pharaoh understood that Hagar, a princess who owned countless slaves herself, would never be content as a simple handmaid in the household of Abraham and that sooner or later, this discontent would become manifest. Therefore, Pharaoh set the scene for potential conflict within Abraham’s household, and the events that followed would confirm the success of his plan.



The success of Pharaoh’s plan can be evidenced by the following arguments:

1 - The Torah provides information that Hagar left Egypt with Sarah and Abraham directly after disclosing information about the exile to Egypt.

2 - It is safe to assume that Sarah had several maidservants, including some from Ur Kaśdim (Ur of the Chaldeans), where her family lived. However, the servant that she gave away to become Abraham’s wife was Hagar the Egyptian. This fact also raises questions, as we know from the Torah that the men from Abraham’s family traditionally married their relatives (see Isaac or Jacob).

3 - Hagar becomes pregnant, which instantly elevates her over Sarah. Sarah loses importance in Hagar’s eyes. In the Midrash Bereishit Rabbah, we read: “Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeyahu in the name of Rabbi Hiya bar Abba said:...Hagar would tell them: ‘My mistress Sarai is not inside what she is outside: she appears to be righteous, but she is not righteous, had she been a righteous woman, see how many years have passed without her conceiving, whereas I conceived in one night!’”

4 - The fact that Sarah offered Hagar as Abraham’s second wife indicates that she (Sarah) had absolute confidence in Hagar’s loyalty to her, which, in turn, must mean that Hagar reaffirmed her devotion and love towards Sarah. However, as soon as Hagar conceives Abraham’s child, her behavior changes dramatically, and she starts to despise Sarah, essentially betraying her (this is Pharaoh’s plan in action).



5 - Sarah accuses Abraham of being too passive and invokes the Judgment of HaShem (Havaya) between them.



The Midrash quotes Rabbi Tanhuma as saying in the name of Rabbi Hiyya the Great and Rabbi Berehiah, who in turn spoke in the name of Rabbi Eleazar, that “He who invokes judgment shall not escape judgment either. Sarah was intended to live as long as Abraham, but because she told Abraham, ‘May the Lord judge between me and you!’, forty-eight years were cut from her lifespan.” The Midrash quotes Rabbi Tanhuma as saying in the name of Rabbi Hiyya the Great and Rabbi Berehiah, who in turn spoke in the name of Rabbi Eleazar, that “He who invokes judgment shall not escape judgment either. Sarah was intended to live as long as Abraham, but because she told Abraham, ‘May the Lord judge between me and you!’, forty-eight years were cut from her lifespan.”

6 - Considering that calling upon HaShem’s Judgement is a very extreme measure, one may assume that Abraham and Sarah had a major argument and completely failed to understand each other, which pushed Sarah to seek HaShem’s aid.

Preliminary Conclusions



Hagar, an Egyptian maidservant, creates a rupture in Abraham and Sarah’s family, which results in Sarah’s lifespan being shortened by forty-eight years. It should be noted that HaShem considers interpersonal relationships more important than our relationship with Him. There are two facts in the Torah that prompt this conclusion:



1 - Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because they violated the laws of hospitality. 1 - Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because they violated the laws of hospitality.

2 - The builders of the Tower of Babel were not destroyed, even though they intended to wage war on HaShem Himself. Instead, they were merely scattered across the earth because they had been a close-knit group and had treated each other with respect.

When people are arguing and divided, they are spiritually incapable of properly serving HaShem. Therefore, the conflict over Hagar diminished the spiritual level of Abraham and Sarah’s service. This will be discussed in further detail later in the article.

However, this is not the full extent of the negative consequences suffered by Abraham’s household due to the descent to Egypt and Hagar’s presence.

Abraham gives Hagar back to Sarah, who starts mistreating her. Hagar flees from Abraham’s home. This escape was an extraordinary feat on Hagar’s part, as runaway slaves were punished by death at the time.

This bold escape indicates Hagar’s strength of character; she was a princess through and through. Upon reaching a well in the desert, Hagar encounters an angel sent by HaShem (Havaya). The angel orders her to return to Sarah and informs her that she will have a son, whom she should name Ishmael.

Hagar addresses HaShem (Havaya) by saying, “You are the God of seeing (El Roi)!”, then names the well Lachai Ro’i. E-l is the name of HaShem that corresponds to the merciful aspect of Creation. Hagar returns to Abraham’s household and gives birth to her son, Ishmael.

In so doing, HaShem answers Abraham’s plea for an heir. However, because of Abraham’s descent to Egypt, it is Hagar, the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh, not Abraham’s first wife Sarah, who becomes the mother of his firstborn child. Abraham and Pharaoh are now kin, and the Pharaoh’s bloodline will continue through Ishmael. The sages note that Ishmael’s descendants have been among the worst enemies of the Jewish people.

‘HAGAR GIVING Ishmael Water From the Miraculous Well in the Desert,’ Charles Paul Landon. After some time, Sarah urges Abraham to cast out Hagar and Ishmael, saying, “The son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son.”

A later passage in the Torah states, “But the matter greatly displeased Abraham, concerning his son.” It is not hard to imagine the extent of Abraham’s distress. After all, he was to banish his firstborn son. However, HaShem appears to him under the name El-im, which stands for judgment. This is especially important. HaShem commands Abraham to do as Sarah tells him and promises that He will protect Ishmael.

The appearance of HaShem to Abraham under the name El-im signifies that every action performed by those in this story will be subject to judgment and bear the consequences.

Abraham banishes Hagar and Ishmael, leaving them all but empty-handed. They receive no more than a piece of bread and a waterskin, in effect sentencing them to near-certain death in the desert. This decision on the part of Abraham requires an in-depth analysis. In the Kabbalah, Abraham embodies the attribute of Chesed (loving kindness, charity) at the absolute level. He was known to welcome total strangers into his home, offer them food and drink, and encourage them to embrace HaShem. In light of the above, it is quite clear that sending Hagar and Ishmael into the desert is a direct contradiction of Chesed.

Commenting on this event, Rashi explains that Abraham did not give Ishmael any gold or silver because he hated him for his wicked deeds. However, this statement directly contradicts another one of Rashi’s comments, where he elaborates on the command HaShem gave to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.

The Torah says, “And He said, ‘Please take your son, your only one, whom you love, yea, Isaac, and go away to the land of Moriah...’”

Rashi interprets this passage as follows: He [Abraham] said to Him, “I have two sons.” He [God] said to him, “Your only one.” He said to Him, “This one is the only son of his mother, and that one is the only son of his mother.” He said to him, “Whom you love.” He said to Him, “I love them both.” He said to him, “Isaac.”’

It seems that these two comments by Rashi seem to contract each other. The first speaks of hate, the second of love.

There is another explanation behind Abraham’s uncharacteristic behavior. To understand, one must look at the words said by Sarah to Abraham: “Drive out this handmaid and her son, for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son.”

From these words, it can be concluded that Sarah is not just telling Abraham to exile Hagar and Ishmael; she is also forbidding him from giving them any property. This is why HaShem will later appear to Abraham as El-im (judgment). Sarah may have been motivated by the fact that Abraham owed all of his wealth to the suffering that she endured in the house of Pharaoh and the house of Abimelech.

From the above events, we can conclude that Sarah never forgave Hagar for her betrayal. She had to put up with her presence, because she had been unable to bear a child. With the birth of Isaac, the situation had changed.

Sarah knew that Isaac and Ishmael could not live together because there would be continued strife and rivalry between them. From that point of view, the decision to banish Hagar and Ishmael was correct. However, to send them empty-handed into the desert, especially that given that Ishmael was ill, was unnecessary cruelty.

Thus, we witness yet another negative consequence of Abraham’s descent to Egypt: he is forced to banish his firstborn child into the desert empty-handed. This causes Abraham immense pain.

After some time, HaShem commands Abraham to take Isaac up the mountain and bind him as a sacrificial offering. This raises the question: was this command linked to any of the previous events? Rashi cites the sages who believed that this could have been due to Satan’s complaint to HaShem that Abraham was not making the customary offerings. Another theory stipulates that this event was instigated by Isaac boasting to Ishmael that he was ready to sacrifice himself to HaShem. The very fact that the sages were trying to determine the reason behind the binding of Isaac affirms that they could not (or would not) conceive that this extremely painful challenge could not be the result of some past misdoing.

This urges the consideration of another version of the above-mentioned events based on the ‘measure for measure’ principle. Sarah tells Abraham to cast Ishmael, the son of Hagar, into the desert, while he, according to the sages, was sick and bereft of any source of sustenance, effectively dooming him to perish. HaShem, under the name El-im (judgment), assuages Abraham’s anguish, telling him that He will take care of Ishmael. HaShem then performs a miracle to save Ishmael.

According to the ‘measure for measure’ principle, HaShem instructs Abraham to take Isaac, the son of Sarah, to the mountain and bind him as a sacrificial offering. However, Abraham had earlier been given the prophecy that Isaac would become his heir. Abraham passes the test, proving himself worthy. HaShem miraculously saves Isaac, yet we can imagine how Sarah felt when she learned of HaShem’s command. The story of the binding of Isaac (Aqeidah) contains multiple explicit and implicit lessons that will be examined further on.

The following is one of several arguments (which will be provided below) in favor of the opinion that the Aqeidah was linked to Ishmael’s exile:

1. Hagar flees Abraham’s household and meets an angel of Havaya. The angel tells her that she will give birth to a son and that she must name this son Ishmael, then commands her to return. Hagar names the well Lachai Ro’i.

2. The passage that describes the meeting between Isaac and Rebecca specifies that Isaac “was on his way, coming from Be’er Lachai Ro’i.” In his commentary, Rashi suggests that Isaac must have traveled to the well “to bring Hagar [who had been given the new name, Keturah] to Abraham, his father, that he should marry her” following Sarah’s death.

The story of Abraham’s funeral mentions that Isaac returns to Lachai Ro’i after burying his father. Rashi does not provide any commentary on this event.

Based on the aforementioned points, it can be concluded that Isaac did not merely travel to Lachai Ro’i in order to fetch Hagar. Rather, he lived there. In this case, the question is: what is the connection between Isaac’s residence near Lachai Ro’i and the Aqeidah? This author believes that there is, in fact, a direct connection.

In the Torah, Isaac asks Abraham, “Where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” To which Abraham replies, “G-d [referred to as El-im, judgment] will provide for Himself [yir’eh-lo] the lamb for the burnt offering.” When Abraham raises his knife over Isaac, he is stopped by an angel of Havaya (in this instance, the name Havaya appears as the emanation of mercy).

A further passage reads, “And Abraham named that place, The Lord [Havaya] will see, as it is said to this day: On the mountain, the Lord will be seen.” This signifies that the Temple will be built in that spot, and Havaya will see the offerings made here by the Jewish people. The location will, therefore, become a place where the information conveyed by Havaya will be made particularly clear.

The Lech-Lecha reading that describes Hagar’s flight states: “And an angel of the Lord [Havaya] found her by a water fountain in the desert [...] and she [Hagar] called the name of the Lord [Havaya], Who had spoken to her, ‘You are the G-d [E-l] of seeing’ [...] Therefore the well was called Be’er Lachai Ro’i [The Well of Seeing].”

The name HAVAYA symbolizes the entire Sefirot system and may represent both mercy and judgment, whereas E-l represents a specific Sefirah: the attribute of Chesed (loving kindness, sharing). Therefore, we see that an angel of Havaya appears to both Abraham on the Mountain and to Hagar, near the well. References to both of these locations given by Abraham and Hagar are almost identical, but in the second story, the name E-l is added.

This prompts the conclusion that the Lachai Ro’i well must have been a powerful place of revelation, where a significant amount of information from HAVAYA was disclosed (albeit not as powerful as the location of the future Temple).

In his commentary on the seventh reading of the Vayeira, the Lubavitcher Rebbe notes that Isaac gained the sacred status of a burned offering: the kind of sanctity that no other man had ever achieved before.

This leads to the conclusion that Isaac must have been highly receptive to the information conveyed by HAVAYA. Furthermore, this is likely why he settled near the Lachai Ro’i well.

In light of the above, it may be concluded that the binding of Isaac is linked directly to the events involving Hagar and Ishmael.

From the above, we can see that taking Hagar from Egypt caused a chain of painful events which affected Abraham, Sarah, and all the Jewish people.

Noah

Noah was part of the sinful pre-flood generation and could not have changed his circumstances on his own. Thanks to the miraculous intervention of HaShem, Noah and his family were spared from the Flood.

HaShem gave Noah clear instructions regarding what and whom he was allowed to take aboard the Ark. However, the Torah later mentions that Noah also took a grapevine. HaShem had not commanded him to do this, but neither had He explicitly prohibited it.

Either way, the presence of this very grapevine would be one of the factors that would provoke the devastating events revealed later in the Torah.

There are several interpretations of the nature of the forbidden fruit eaten by Adam and Eve. According to one interpretation, the forbidden fruit was a grape. There is significant reason to believe that this was the case.

Therefore, grapes indirectly caused the original sin and helped evil infiltrate the world. The grapevine prompted the downfall of Noah, who might have otherwise become the new Adam. Another argument in support of this theory could be the fact that the Nazirites were prohibited from consuming any food or drink involving grapes.

As such, a ‘pattern of Abraham’ is clearly evident. Like Abraham, Noah is miraculously freed from evil but does not sever his ties to evil entirely. The consequences for this are well-known.

The question naturally arises as to why Noah took a grapevine, even though HaShem had not instructed him to do so. Moreover, why was it a grapevine specifically, rather than another kind of fruit or seed?

The answer is obvious. Noah took something that he was fond of and feared losing in the Flood.

This conclusion is confirmed by subsequent events.





Lot’s Wife

In this story, Lot and his family cannot free themselves from the power of the people of Sodom, who are great sinners. Once again, HaShem intervenes miraculously. He saves Lot and his family but forbids them from looking back. Lot’s wife disobeys HaShem’s command. She looks back and is transformed into a pillar of salt.

This is yet another example of the ‘pattern of Abraham’ — the ties to evil have not been severed entirely.

It must be noted that the act of transforming a living human being into an inanimate object does not occur anywhere else in the Torah. This requires an explanation, which will be provided in a later chapter.

Jacob and Laban

In the story of Jacob and Laban, Jacob is forced to serve Laban, a sinful practitioner of magic, for twenty-one years. He decides to flee, but Laban pursues him. HaShem intervenes on behalf of Jacob and his family. He comes to Laban in a dream and tells him, “Beware lest you speak with Jacob, either good or evil.” This miraculous salvation is confirmed by Laban himself, who tells Jacob that he could have inflicted great harm upon him, but refrained from doing so, as commanded by HaShem. One would think that this means Jacob severed his ties with evil. However, this would be incorrect. Rachel stole Laban’s teraphim, which he used for black magic (meaning that they still bore a spiritual connection to him). There are numerous explanations as to why Rachel stole the idols, but we shall not dwell on them here. What matters is the sheer fact that another person’s property was stolen. The Torah tells us that HaShem, through Moses, instructed the children of Israel to destroy their idols, just as He Himself had destroyed the idols of the Egyptian gods. However, He never gave any command to steal idols, much less hold on to them.

Rachel did not tell Jacob that she had stolen the idols, knowing that he would never approve.

The story later takes a tragic turn: Laban accuses Jacob of theft. Outraged, Jacob wishes death upon the thief, not knowing that the true thief was, in fact, Rachel. She dies shortly afterward.

The “pattern of Abraham” emerges again, as the ties to evil were never truly severed.





The Exodus

As the children of Israel were fleeing Egypt, “a great mixed multitude” of Egyptians accompanied them. HaShem had commanded Moses to deliver the children of Israel from Egypt but had neither instructed nor prohibited that he take in anyone else who might join. That was Moses’ own decision. The consequences of his decision proved catastrophic for both the children of Israel and the entire world.

Marc Chagall’s ‘Moses Beholds All the Work,’ from The Story of Exodus (1966) When the Torah was first received, Moses, the Jewish people, and the rest of the world were elevated to the highest spiritual level. However, the Egyptians that left the land with the children of Israel later initiate the sinful cult of the golden calf. Along with the Jewish people, they create an idol out of gold and pray to it.

HaShem prepares to destroy the Jewish people until Moses prays for forgiveness, and HaShem chooses to reverse His decision. He does not reverse it entirely, however. Instead, He informs Moses that, rather than being personally present, He would be represented by an angel, signifying a significant spiritual downfall for the Jewish people. Moses continues to plead with HaShem not to send an angel but to remain with the Jewish people Himself. Moses knows that angels cannot think for themselves. They are, in a way, information-sharing programs. Furthermore, Moses also knows that the Jewish people would surely continue to commit sins in the future, and an angel, being an informational program, would dispense divine judgment, but have no capacity to forgive them. Only HaShem can grant forgiveness. This is reaffirmed in the works of the great Kabbalist scholars: Gates of Light by Joseph Gikatilla and The Palm Tree of Deborah by Moses Cordovero.

HaShem concedes to Moses’ pleas but reminds him that the Jewish people have not been fully absolved of their sin and that punishment is yet to follow.

The ties to evil have not been severed, and we see the “pattern of Abraham” once again.

Conclusion

The parallels identified above between events that affected different people at different times reaffirm that these stories contain an important lesson, which, in turn, requires a detailed examination through the lens of the Kabbalah of Information. This examination will be attempted in the following chapters. To achieve this, themes must be addressed in relation to the creation of information, the information space, the role of different informational worlds in Creation, the concept of the soul and its roots, the concept of evil.



I will also attempt to explain the idea of the concealment of God in the informational space. I will attempt to answer the question why the roots of the souls of the great evildoers come from a very high level. I will analyze the dynamics of the character of the Patriarchs with an emphasis on their interaction with evil and evildoers. The commandment of the Red Heifer also will be discussed.

Furthermore, subsequent chapters will provide an explanation for one highly important fact: the similarity between the command not to look back on Sodom, given by the Lord to Lot and his family, and the command not to leave the house until the morning after the Passover sacrifice, given by Moses to the Jewish people.

The ministry of water resources and irrigation has announced a state of public alert for dealing with the rainy season, stressing the readiness for the protection facilities against the dangers of torrents.

“Over the past few years, the ministry has been carrying out a plan for establishing dams and artificial lakes to avoid flooding catastrophes that often badly impact some cities in southern Egypt,” Mohamed Ghanem, spokesperson of the ministry of water resources and irrigation told Xinhua in a recent interview.

“We have founded a large number of dams in Sinai, Red Sea and Matrouh provinces and other areas with a cost of 127 million U.S. dollars,” Ghanem said, noting that there are still some other projects under construction.

He explained that several artificial lakes for reserving the water have been established in front of the dams and proved effective especially in the Bedouin areas in Sinai over a long period of time.

He added that the government not only works to prevent the torrents from destroying the water facilities but also aims at controlling the watercourse for people living near the dams and lakes.

Meanwhile, Ahmad Fawzy, professor of water resources with the Cairo-based Desert Research Center, said that the country’s preparedness plan works on increase the water storage by diverting the course of the torrents to the Nile River, the canals and the ground tanks.

He explained that redirecting the water required establishing more dams, cleaning the sewers and torrent trajectories to turn the rainfalls into a blessing for the farmers.

“The heavy rainfalls have negative effects on the substructure system in Egypt,” he added, deeming that climate change will cause more rains in the coming years.

Egypt saves around 1 billion cubic meters of water annually from the rain and torrents, which constitutes less than 2 percent of the country’s renewable water resources, according to Abbas Sharaqy, professor of water resources at Cairo University.

He said that Egypt has a fixed share of Nile water over the past 50 years despite the double increase of the population, and the government has to protect the people from the dangers of flood and make best use of the water storage.

He said rainfalls threaten the cities along the Red Sea and the provinces of Upper Egypt from October to March each year and their impacts depend on the quantities of rains, the degree of downhill, and the distance from the towns.

He hailed the government precautionary plans over the past years, however, he called for establishing a speed emergency unit to deal with the torrent dangers.

On Tuesday, the Egyptian army announced that the people and military defense forces have implemented joint exercises in cooperation with the country’s executive bodies for tackling the crisis of forecasted rainfalls, floods and torrents in several provinces.",2020-11-25 08:00:00+00:00,"['egypt', 'challenges', 'water', 'rainfalls', 'plan', 'adopts', 'provinces', 'torrents', 'dams', 'resources', 'ministry', 'tackle', 'rain', 'past', 'measures']",Egypt,news article,English

808,Drought Sri Lanka,Daimler rolls out Fuso truck for exports from Chennai unit - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/daimler-rolls-out-fuso-truck-for-exports-from-chennai-unit-113052300549_1.html,"German automobile maker Daimler AG to start exports of FUSO trucks from its Oragadam facility, near Chennai. The Fuso range belongs to Japan-based Mitsubishi FUSO Truck and Bus Corporation (MFTBC).

Daimler India Commercial Vehicles Pvt Ltd (DICV), the Indian subsidiary of German automobile maker Daimler AG, on Thursday rolled out FUSO range of trucks from its plant. The company is planning to export to Asia and Africa.

“The FUSO range of trucks made in India is only for exports. Sri Lanka will be first export market for the trucks. This year we will export around 1,000 vehicles out of India. The Indian plant has enough capacity to cater to the Indian market for DIVC's BharatBenz as well as the export markets for FUSO,” Albert Kirchmann, head-Daimler Trucks Asia and president and CEO, MFTBC.

He added, the integrated Asia business model draws on the synergies of two Daimler outfits, DICV and MFTBC.

The new business model for Asia will enable Daimler AG to unlock full potential among MFTBC and DICV, said Kirchmann.

The trucks rolled out of DICV’s plant– BharatBenz and FUSO -- have local content upto 90%, said Marc Llistosella, Managing Director, DICV.

“Daimler’s Asia strategy is not to counter balance the excess capacity in India. We are leveraging existing production network for global market,” he said.

Kirchmann said the combined target of MFTBC and DICV is to double annual sales to 290,000 units by 2020 while declining to give any breakup of figures between the two entities.

Besides, Fuso and Bharat Benz, the company has set a target to sell 500,000 vehicles by 2015.

The FUSO trucks range manufactured at DICV’s plant here consist of five models spanning medium/heavy duty (25-49 tonne) and light/medium duty (9-16 tonne).

After Sri Lanka the FUSO trucks will be exported to Bangladesh, Zambia, Kenya and Brunei this year.

1014,FL-2018-000134-IND,Red alert in Kerala - The Statesman,https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/red-alert-in-kerala-1502673332.html,"Nature’s fury has taken a heavy toll in Kerala with more than 40 deaths and rendering thousands of people homeless. The Union government has come to the State’s aid with an immediate relief of Rs 100 crore.

Climate change may be one of the causes for the unprecedented rains causing the worst floods in the State since 1924. The Disaster Management Authority has declared a red alert in Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad and Wayanad districts.

Ten columns of the Army together with the Air Force, Navy and NDRF personnel were assisting in rescue and relief operations. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who accompanied Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas, demanded an immediate relief of Rs 1,200 crore.

He estimated the damage caused at Rs 8,316. Heavy rains and flash floods have damaged crops in thousands of acres. The opening of flood gates of 22 dams on a single day last week added to the misery of the people. The government has opened 1,026 relief camps to provide shelter to those whose houses have been washed away or damaged.

The authorities waited a bit too long to open all the five sluice gates of the Idukki arch dam to conserve as much water as possible.

The State Electricity Board justified the delay stating the purposes of dams were power generation, irrigation, potable water supply and flood management. The Board gave priority to saving maximum water for power generation and ignored the importance of flood management and safety of the dam.

The Kerala government has been remiss, as many other States in the country, in preserving and safeguarding flood plains of the rivers and allowed construction activities. The north-west monsoon is also the landslide season. About 5,600 sq km of the State’s total area is prone to landslides.

Scientists attribute human intervention like building highrises, construction of roads and stone quarrying for causing landslides, especially when there is prolonged heavy rain. The disaster management plan published in 2016 by the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, says construction of highrises and resorts have been on the rise in the vulnerable area.

Those who promote unscientific development activities should be held accountable for the landslides. According to a study, Kerala has about 6,000 quarries. The use of explosives to blast rock in quarries causes rapid landscape changes leading to landsides.

Quarrying and construction should not be allowed in landslide-prone areas. Not only the Western Ghats, but also the estuarine mangroves should be preserved to minimize natural calamities. The weather office has warned of heavy to very heavy rains in the next couple of days. Kerala places its hopes on the Union government to come to its rescue.",2018-08-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['management', 'kerala', 'relief', 'water', 'flood', 'states', 'state', 'heavy', 'red', 'construction', 'alert', 'union']",India,news article,English
1486,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Flood-Ravaged Nigerian Communities Unprepared for More Rains - VOA News,https://www.voanews.com/africa/flood-ravaged-nigerian-communities-unprepared-more-rains,"ENUGU, NIGERIA - Nigeria will experience torrential downpours and massive flooding this month, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency warns.

Nigeria is approaching the peak of its rainy season, and flooding is expected to hit 15 out of its 36 states this month. The agency has issued a red alert because of above-normal water levels on the country's two largest rivers, the Benue and the Niger.

In August, many communities along the rivers were cut off due to collapsed bridges and impassable roads. Four students were killed when a pedestrian bridge fell at a university in the northern region.

FILE - Houses partially submerged in flood waters are pictured in Lokoja city, Kogi State, Nigeria, Sept. 17, 2018.

With thousands of houses and hectares of farmland and produce destroyed along with schools and shops, the economic impact of this year'sflooding is expected to be high. The country's emergency management agency is stepping in to distribute items like cement bags, blankets and hygiene products.

Peter Odjugo, a professor of geography at Nigeria's University of Benin, works with the Nigerian Meteorological Society. He has been tracking the extreme weather patterns and says the government has repeatedly failed to take preemptive measures to reduce the impact of flooding.

""What they prefer doing or what they are doing now is services after the impact, rather than preventing it from occurring,"" he said.

Odjugo suggests that the silt be removed from the rivers to increase the volume of water they can hold. He also recommends that town planners enforce regulation on where buildings are constructed, saying this is a glaring weak spot across the country.

City regulators look out for buildings being constructed near waterways. Such buildings are often marked with an X, designating an order to stop construction work.

Stella Ojeme, the director for information in the Federal Capital Territory Administration, says that even in the nation's capital ofAbuja, enforcing building codes is a challenge.

""Most of our people will go, buy white paint, paint off the stop work mark,"" she said. ""First of all, you find people [building] where they shouldn't build. You find people build on flood plains. You find some people dump their refuse in the gutter.""

Odjugo says climate change is making a real impact in Nigeria, but the government has not made the issue a priority.

Additional challenges

Additionally, the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency says its weather data collection equipment is being vandalized and stolen.

Clement Eze, the agency's director general, spoke at a workshop last month, asking the public to help stop the illegal activity, as it is hindering the agency's ability to forecast extreme weather.

""We can no longer take readings, maybe accumulated or about a week or two,"" he said. ""Or if there are no resources, it can even take more than six months before we can go back and replenish or repair and this equipment is imported from outside Nigeria.""

During Nigeria's worst flooding in 2012, the Niger River reached a record high level of 12.84 meters. Two million Nigerians were forced from their homes and 363 people were killed, according to the National Emergency Management Agency.",2019-09-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['floodravaged', 'flooding', 'month', 'stop', 'unprepared', 'buildings', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'nigerian', 'rains', 'communities', 'impact', 'services', 'rivers', 'weather']",Nigeria,news article,English
568,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,The fall in commodity prices is curbing military expenditure across Africa - Quartz Africa,https://qz.com/africa/968950/the-fall-in-commodity-process-is-curbing-military-expenditure-across-africa/,"Subdued prices for oil and other key commodities in recent years has started to filter through to Africa’s military budgets. Defense spending fell to $37.9 billion in 2016 from $50.2 billion in 2014. This marks the second consecutive year of decline in spending, after 11 straight years of increases, a new report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute found.

The Institute also recorded a drop in military spending in Central America, the Caribbean, and South America, while defense budget allotments increased in Asia, Europe, and North America.

Until recently, Africa has been home to some of the world’s fastest-growing economies. Political stability and demand for commodities attracted investors and supported the emergence of tech-savvy entrepreneurs. But the crash in recent years in prices for commodities like oil, gold, diamond, and timber has slowed this momentous growth. Many economies are also facing mounting pressure from the effects of violent extremism and an unprecedented drought and famine affecting millions.

In sub-Saharan Africa, cuts in military spending were most dramatic in Angola. The top oil producer has the second largest military in Africa after Algeria, and spent $6.1 billion on it in 2013. That figure dropped to $3.2 billion in 2016, largely due to falling oil prices. South Sudan, once East Africa’s biggest spender on defense, cut its budget by more than half to $525 million last year.

Algeria increased its budget just 2.3% last year compared to the previous year, spending $10.6 billion, its lowest level (pdf) since 2007.

On the whole, Africa has become more peaceful in recent years, and its military spending is often a signal of something other than an attempt to shore up national security from outside forces. In many cases, it’s the result of an attempt to stifle internal dissent. In others, it’s a response to internal strife caused by extremism, such as with Mali and Kenya, who have increased spending over the last few years to help with their fight against armed Islamist extremists.

It can also be read as an attempt to project power. Botswana, which has no threat of extremism and has never experienced a civil war, spent $536 million upgrading its defense infrastructure last year, compared to $384 million the year before.

SIPRI cautioned that a comprehensive and completely accurate overview of military spending on the continent might not be possible. Defense spending in Libya was not made public, for example, and the data didn’t reflect the billion of dollars in bilateral military aid provided to countries like Egypt and Ethiopia by its allies. Military budgets also continue to be plagued by corruption allegations, raising questions about the reliability of published spending figures. For instance, Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari ordered the arrest of the country’s former national security advisor in 2015 for allegedly pocketing up to $2 billion from fraudulent arm dealings.",2017-04-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'oil', 'prices', 'budgets', 'africas', 'global', 'slump', 'increased', 'military', 'squeezed', 'defense', 'recent', 'commodities', 'million', 'billion', 'spending']",Ghana,news article,English

Days of torrential rain have spawned massive flooding in eastern Australia, forcing the evacuation of some 40,000 people. In the country's arid central section, it has sent waterfalls down the side of the country's majestic Uluru rocks.

Barely a year after devastating bush fires burned through tens of millions of acres in Australia, the country is grappling with one of its worst floods after weather systems converged over Queensland and New South Wales, dumping more than 20 inches of rain in a single day in one area north of Brisbane.

Meanwhile, one area of New South Wales received nearly 40 inches in a week — which Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said had already exceeded the average autumn rainfall less than a month into the season.

The floods, which have submerged houses, stranded cattle and cut off towns, have inundated vast areas along the east coast from roughly Mackay, about 600 miles north of Brisbane in Queensland, to Bega in New South Wales, some 260 miles south of Sydney.

The premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, said Wednesday that residents in Sydney's western regions are under new evacuation orders.

""What we still have to be aware of is the fact that thousands and thousands of people are still on evacuation warnings, that the rivers will continue to swell, that catchments will continue to experience flows of water not seen in 50 years and in some places 100 years,"" she told reporters in Sydney, Reuters reported.

On Wednesday, the bodies of two men were recovered from flooded vehicles. One man, 25, died when his car was submerged in northwest Sydney. He reached an emergency operator and was on the line for 44 minutes until contact was lost, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Near Alice Springs in central Australia, tourists have flocked to Uluru, also known Ayers Rock, to catch a rare glimpse of cascading waterfalls at the reddish-orange rock formation. Park officials said 46 millimeters (1.8 inches) of rain fell there over the weekend – about a sixth of the average annual rainfall in the region. While the event isn't unprecedented, it is uncommon.

""Rainwater on the rock's surface causes it to change [color]. From dark burgundy to shining silver and even black, every side of Uluru takes a different shade, making this spectacle a photographer's delight. Following the rain, desert plants bloom and many animals emerge to mate and feed,"" staff at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park said on Facebook.

Although rivers were expected to crest on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned that the flooding, which has been concentrated along the eastern seaboard, would not remain ""just a coastal event.""

The Warragamba Dam, on the western outskirts of Sydney, has been spilling the equivalent of the city's famous harbor in water each day. It's expected to continue its overflow for at least another week, threatening highly populated areas, Morrison said. ""We advise that the rain and flood situation does remain dynamic and extremely complex,"" he said.

Darren Osmotherly, who owns the Paradise Café Pizzeria in Portland in North South Wales, west of Sydney, told Reuters that damage to his restaurant would likely top a half-million Australian dollars ($380,000).

""We've had bush fires and COVID and so many dramas this year. No one can go anywhere,"" he said, adding that the return of sunny skies on Wednesday didn't mean the danger was over.

""People get the illusion that it's stopped flooding, but you've got 17 hours of water to come,"" he told Reuters. ""The deluge of rain we had yesterday isn't here yet. ... Got to be careful.

Photo by VnExpress/Hoang Tao.

Ho Van Rao's lush green fields in Quang Tri were buried under more than two feet of boulders, sand and other debris.

The field was the primary source of income to feed his family of three.

As he inspected the damage done by the prolonged flooding central Vietnam has had to suffer, he noted that some paddy sections had been swept away by floodwaters, while his tapioca field, cultivated over the past 10 months, was buried in rubble.

""We dont know what to plant to make a living,"" said Rao, a 46-year-old resident of Huong Son Commune in Quang Tris Huong Hoa District. Two wet bags of grains they have are all thats left for the next six months, he said, adding that on sunny days, he would put them out to dry.

The Huong Son Commune has over 192 ha of paddy fields, but around 90 ha were buried under rocks and wood rotting deposited by the floods, rendering them unusable and irrecoverable. Le Trong Tuong, chairman of the Huong Son Peoples Committee, said residents were facing food shortages in the future for people.

In Quang Binh Provinces Bo Trach District, Le Xuan Uyen, 56, sees his field buried under mud and soil a meter deep, meaning he cannot plant new saplings for the winter-spring season without putting in significant time and efforts to clean the place up.

Worse still, the soil the fields are buried under has toxic properties that would kill paddy if theyre planted, he said. ""We are worried because we have missed the season for planting, and we dont know what to plant anyway.""

The Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences said the top soil layer that covers several areas in Bo Trach District is actually heavy clay layers, which would make it difficult for cultivation if left as it is. Farmers should switch to different plants to adapt to the new layers, the academy has suggested.

Around 1,650 ha of fields in Quang Tri were inundated in the past month. Provincial authorities are now cooperating with the people to salvage the buried fields to prepare for the winter-spring planting season in just a month, said Ha Si Dong, deputy chairman of Quang Tri. But as the fields are large, ample time, it would take a lot of people and equipment to complete the job, he added.

Recovery efforts should be completed by mid-December so new saplings can be planted for the winter-spring season on time, Quang Tri authorities have said.

Quang Binh and Quang Tri were among several central Vietnam localities struck by heavy rains, flooding and landslides triggered by numerous storms and tropical depressions in recent months.

Forty years ago this summer, a small group of atmospheric and ocean scientists met in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to project the future impacts on Earth's climate from atmospheric release of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from fossil fuel combustion. Frank Press, head of the United States Office of Science and Technology Policy and Science Adviser to President Carter, requested that the National Academy of Sciences conduct the study for the benefit of policymakers. On the basis of then-current trends, the 1979 committee, led by Jule Charney of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, assumed that atmospheric CO 2 concentrations would reach double the preindustrial values sometime in the first half of the 21st century. They calculated that as a result, the average global surface temperature would increase by 3° ± 1.5°C, with the greatest warming at high latitudes—the first assessment of its kind. The Charney committee also noted in the models a lag on the order of decades between CO 2 release and the resulting temperature rise. This delay, from disequilibrium effects with the ocean, masks pending temperature increases long before they are apparent.

Fast-forward to 2019, and these calculations of the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of CO 2 have proven to be remarkably on target. Indeed, on the basis of today's more sophisticated climate models, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms the climate sensitivity proffered by the Charney report. Furthermore, the lag between emission and resulting temperature increases has contributed to society's inaction on a degree of warming to which the planet is already committed from existing emissions. Four decades later, time is running out to control greenhouse gases. What else can scientists do to spur action to avert the worst impacts of climate change?

Back in 1979, without insight as to what revolutions might reshape the world economy their grandchildren would inherit, or how the biosphere might create feedbacks, the Charney committee focused on what they could estimate: the radiative effect of CO 2 in the atmosphere; the negative feedback from clouds; and the ability of the oceans to absorb atmospheric heat. Since then, our scientific understanding of the impacts of climate change has grown well beyond just surface temperature change, and we have deepened our knowledge about the roles of clouds, oceans, aerosols, and other non-CO 2 greenhouse gases. In particular, the science of attributing changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events to climate change drivers has been building credibility.

Whether the extreme event is a heatwave, flood, drought, wildfire, or hurricane, demonstrating to the public how climate change is amplifying the negative impacts of these events can spur more immediate action, even before the most catastrophic warming is upon us. Opinion polls reveal that a majority of Americans are worried about extreme heat, flooding, drought, or water shortages. However, even those who do view climate change as an important national issue rank it well down the list after health care, jobs, and the economy. Geoscientists must work collaboratively with health care professionals, economists, and engineers to link the changing impacts of extreme events and their aftermath to climate change while the effects are still being experienced. This approach could well convince people that climate change is about health, jobs, and the economy.

The Charney report demonstrates the power of scientific prediction. Since its release, scientists have built a formidable evidence base on climate change. At no time since 1979 has the science backed down from its dire predictions for the prospects of human civilization to prosper in a world warming well beyond limits encountered in all of human history. The scientific community must better connect the issues with what now matters to the public, so that the evidence is acted upon for the benefit of society.",2019-08-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['charney', 'change', 'atmospheric', 'scientists', 'extreme', 'temperature', 'impacts', 'warming', 'climate', 'science', 'co2', 'times']",Ghana,news article,English

- This comes after his bench role at the AFCON 2019 going on in Egypt

- The 33-year-old striker has played in seven Nations Cup tournaments for Ghana

Ghana's all time top scorer Asamoah Gyan is set to retire from international football following the Black Stars elimination from the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

The Black Stars could not end Ghana’s 37-year AFCON drought following their round of 16 defeat to Tunisia and lost 5-4 on penalties after the game ended 1-1 on Monday, July 8.

""I could call this tournament, my last having represented Ghana at this level for seven times,"" Gyan told GNA Sports

""Though I have not yet taken a concrete decision yet, I am still considering it, because we have young ones in the team that need to be given the chance to blossom in the national colours,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Ghana Football Association's ex-president, Nyaho Tamakloe believes head coach Kwesi Appiah's decision to bench Asamoah Gyan contributed to Black Stars' abrupt exit.

Gyan had earlier kicked up a storm after announcing his retirement before AFCON.

The former Sunderland player was livid after Appiah stripped him of captaincy and handed the armband to Andre Ayew, after seven years of Gyan being skipper.

However, calm was restored after Ghana President Akufo-Addo intervened and convinced the 33-year-old to rescind his decision.

Gyan played the role of general captain of the team off the pitch, owing to his vast experience and his unmatched achievements for Black Stars.

He did not get much of a chance to shine for Ghana in Egypt and spent most of his time bench warming.

The four time Africa champions will have to wait a little longer to end their AFCON title drought and may have to do it without their all time top scorer.

1162,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Southern New Brunswick still flooded but waters are slowly receding - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/southern-new-brunswick-still-flooded-but-waters-are-slowly-receding-1.4398679,"FREDERICTON -- Officials in New Brunswick are urging patience while floodwaters are receding, saying there's a long way to go before the response can become a recovery effort.

The province's Emergency Measures Organization says that while water levels are slowly dropping along the Saint John River, communities from Fredericton to Saint John remain above flood stage.

Heavy rain caused the river level to rise slightly in Fredericton on Saturday night, but the forecast is for it to fall below flood stage by Thursday.

Greg MacCallum, the provincial EMO director, said it's important that people remain patient.

""The precipitation that we got has to work its way through the system. It's a slow thing to get this much water out of the river basin, so we once again are asking people to be patient,"" MacCallum said Sunday.

The Trans-Canada Highway remains closed between Oromocto and River Glade, forcing motorists travelling between Fredericton and Moncton to make a long detour through Saint John.

EMO spokesman Geoffrey Downey said while water levels are dropping, a lot of debris on the highway still has to be removed before it can reopen.

Ahmed Dassouki of the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure said there were 84 road closures across the province as of Sunday afternoon.

Even though water has begun to recede, he warned people against driving on flooded routes.

""They could be undermined, or there could be debris. You don't know what's down there,"" he said.

MacCallum cautioned residents from trying to return to their homes or check on cottages too soon. He said it is still not safe to be on the water.

""We don't want people putting themselves in harm's way and compounding the problem by making a move too early.""

He said some homeowners may be worried about looting, but that has not been an issue.

""I want to reassure people that in those areas where people have evacuated -- even if it is just the occasional homes -- we are maintaining a security presence on boats throughout the day and night,"" MacCallum said.

So far this year, 437 households comprising 1,095 individuals have registered for help with the Canadian Red Cross, and 487 of those people have been given accommodation in hotels. Other evacuees have opted to stay with family and friends.

The Red Cross has begun distributing free household clean-up kits.

Bill Lawlor, New Brunswick director of the Canadian Red Cross, said a fundraising effort was launched Friday, but he didn't know how much was raised over the weekend. A similar effort last year raised $1.6 million.

""Each household, if they were evacuated, received $300 of emergency cash injection to help offset some of the expenses incurred through their displacement. In the second round, a smaller number of families received $975 that was more of a transition and returning back to your home,"" he said.

Lawlor said in the third round, which is still underway, eligible households could received up to $50,000 to help repair and rebuild.

He said the third round has taken time to process because homeowners must first determine what they could get in disaster financial assistance and insurance.

Members of the military have been assisting with flood efforts in New Brunswick by helping to fill sandbags and provide access to flooded areas.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan is expected to tour some of the affected areas around Saint John on Monday.",2019-04-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'red', 'brunswick', 'saint', 'river', 'slowly', 'waters', 'fredericton', 'way', 'received', 'round', 'flooded', 'southern', 'maccallum', 'john', 'receding']",Canada,news article,English

NAINITAL: The Rishiganga hydroelectric power project which was washed away after the glacier burst in Raini village and where several workers are still feared trapped had been red-flagged by local villagers as an ""impending disaster"".

In 2019, a village resident named Kundan Singh had filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Uttarakhand high court (HC) alleging unfair and environmentally hazardous practices by the private firm involved in the project. It was alleged that the firm was ""using explosives and blasting the mountains for mining"". The blasting, the petition said, had damaged the sensitive areas around the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve.

Singh had said that all the waste material from the project was being dumped into the Rishiganga river adding that despite complaints from the villagers, no action was taken. ""Moreover, it was also noticed that the blatant stone crushing activity was being carried out on the riverbed

""It flouted all norms that the government had laid down for stone crushing activity in this area.... Even though the villagers complained to the authorities about the violations, no credible action was taken,"" Singh said in the petition.

Based on the PIL, the court had observed that use of explosives may ""result in destruction of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, and the Valley of Flowers"". Therefore, the court banned the use of explosives in the area, and in June 2019, directed the member secretary of the pollution control board and the district magistrate to constitute a joint inspection team and visit the site.

However, the report, a copy of which is available with TOI, exonerated the firm and said that it found no proof of illegal mining or blasting. ""During the inspection, there was no proof of any illegal mining being done on the spot and no evidence could be collected,"" read the report.

However, the court was informed that there still was some muck around the barrage and power house which was yet to be cleared. On July 26, the court had listed the case for further hearing in August. There hasn't been a single hearing after that and the case is still pending in the HC.

1152,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Liberals pledge $150M for climate change preparedness flood mapping | News - Daily Hive,https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/liberals-flood-insurance,"The federal Liberals unveiled promises Wednesday to help homeowners prepare for damage from climate change with low-cost national flood insurance and zero-interest loans for green home renovations.

Leader Justin Trudeau was in the yard of a home in Delta, BC, in greater Vancouver, to announce additional climate-change-related measures.

“We recognize that people are facing increased flooding because of the effects of extreme weather events and increased impacts of climate change,” Trudeau said.

Trudeau said helping people figure out whether or where to rebuild after a flood is a difficult conversation, so his mitigation plans will start with $150 million to complete flood mapping in every province and territory, to identify land that’s at greater risk of inundation.

He is also promising a low-cost flood-insurance program, delivered via the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and a national plan to help homeowners relocate if they are at risks for repeated flooding.

“We recognize first of all that many people can’t get insurance, flood insurance any more,” he said. “We know that the government does need to step up.”

Parts of eastern Ontario, western Quebec, and New Brunswick were hit with major flooding for the second time in three years last spring, prompting a number of experts and governments to suggest climate change requires a rethink of disaster planning. Quebec Premier Francois Legault said earlier this year his government was capping flood compensation at a total of $100,000, but would offer people $200,000 in one-time help to move to less flood-prone areas.

For those who have suffered floods or forest fires that forced them from their homes, or left them unable to work, Trudeau said a re-elected Liberal government would create a national employment-insurance disaster-benefit program.

“If you’ve just been through a wildfire or a flood you should be focused on rebuilding your life, not on how to pay for the damage or how to pay the bills after time away from work,” Trudeau said.

He was flanked by a number of BC Liberal candidates, including Carla Qualtrough, his public-services and procurement minister, in whose riding the announcement was made.

Trudeau also announced plans for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to provide interest-free loans of up to $40,000 for homeowners or landlords to make green renovations, ranging from new windows and furnaces to the addition of solar panels or geothermal energy systems. The government would also support training programs for workers to do the renovations.

The Liberals claim the total cost of all the measures announced Wednesday would be $370 million starting in 2020-21, rising to $432 million by 2023-24, most of which would come from CMHC. The Liberals said about $70 million would come from general revenues in 2020-21 to pay for the training program and flood mapping, dropping to $20 million by 2023-24.",2019-09-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['liberals', 'change', '150m', 'homeowners', 'trudeau', 'insurance', 'million', 'national', 'flood', 'preparedness', 'climate', 'help', 'mapping', 'pay', 'pledge']",Canada,news article,English
933,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Did the Egyptians create a canal and a port to bring stone to the Great Pyramid? - The Boston Globe,https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/10/06/did-egyptians-create-canal-and-port-bring-stone-great-pyramid/xtoi4NzlTz9PYRo2QnmG0M/story.html,"The Egyptians, consummate engineers, cut waterways from the Nile through floodplain that now is covered by sand and the urban sprawl of Cairo, Lehner believes. Illustrations developed by Lehner show water within several hundred yards of the Great Pyramid, a startling vision to anyone who has long thought of them as being surrounded by dusty desert.

Mark Lehner, director of Ancient Egypt Research Associates, says his research indicates that, when the Nile River was in flood, Egyptians could steer boats laden with stone to a major port city at the pyramid complex.

A Boston-based archaeologist has developed a theory that the Egyptians delivered stone to the pyramids at Giza through a system of canals and harbors, shedding more light on the mystery of how ancient people — sorry, not aliens — built the massive structures.

“The Egyptians were basically using the Nile as a huge hydraulic lift,” he said in a telephone interview.

Lehner was one of the experts featured on a BBC documentary on Sept. 24, “Egypt’s Great Pyramid: The New Evidence,” that rounded up recent research finds. The release of the film generated breathless headlines across the world, saying that the mystery of the pyramids had been “solved.”

Lehner, 67, who has an office in Brighton and splits his time between his hometown of Milton and Egypt, has been studying and conducting digs at the pyramids for 45 years. He said his theories have been known among fellow archaeologists, but the documentary has generated “quite a bit of interest.”

He said his discoveries and another major discovery by a French archaeologist detailed in the documentary may not have solved the mysteries of the pyramids, but they have opened a “ new window” onto how they were built.

Peter Der Manuelian, professor of Egyptology and director of the Harvard Semitic Museum, said he knew of Lehner’s work. He said Lehner was known for “fine scholarship and good archaeological technique.”

“He has been exploring this area for many years,” he said.

It was long thought that if the Nile were in flood, the Egyptians could have used water transport to get stones closer to the pyramid, Der Manuelian said.

But Lehner has gone a step further, Der Manuelian said, excavating the area and “giving us a better understanding of the ancient landscape.”

The pyramid complex at Giza includes the Great Pyramid, two smaller pyramids, the Sphinx, and other structures. All are believed to have been built in a 70- to 80-year period about 2500 BC, said Lehner.

“This was an age of experiment ... an innovative time,” said Lehner.

The pyramids’ cores were mostly built from stone that was quarried right at the site, said Lehner. But there is other stone in the pyramids that had to be brought from afar, including granite from Aswan 370 miles to the south and white limestone from Tura, across the Nile.

How that stone got there is the piece of the mystery that Lehner’s theory sheds new light on.

The Nile’s current channel runs five miles from the pyramids, a long distance to drag heavy blocks of stone. Far enough to make you wonder if spaceships and tractor beams, or mystical levitation, may have been involved.

Lehner believes the channel may have run closer to Giza in ancient times and, when the Nile was in flood and spread across its floodplain (the river is now tamed by the Aswan Dam), Egyptian engineers may have seen a way to bring water even closer.

“They dug canals and basins into the floodplain as ambitiously as they quarried the high plateau and built pyramids, tombs, and temples,” he said in a 2014 report on his company’s website.

The blocks hauled by boats would have weighed as much as 15 to 17 tons. Stone could have been offloaded in two places, Lehner said, one close to the Sphinx site and one close to a small temple linked to the Great Pyramid by a causeway.

Lehner has built his theory by looking at archaeological evidence, traces of ancient features on the current landscape, and core drilling samples that revealed deep and solid clay and silt, which he took to be evidence of former river channels and artificial basins.

The waterway theory is bolstered by another discovery Lehner has made. He found and excavated a settlement on the rim of the Giza plateau, uncovering evidence of a major port that he dubbed the “Lost City of the Pyramids.”

Another astonishing piece of the puzzle of the pyramids that has come to light in recent years also dovetails with his theory, said Lehner.

Mark Lehner leaning on the Great Pyramid Susan Hutchison

Archaeologist Pierre Tallet in 2013 found rolls of papyrus in caves on Egypt’s Red Sea coast that were written by men who appear to have participated in the building of the Great Pyramid. The rolls included the journal of an unknown official named Merer who described leading a large team making deliveries. Merer mentions stopping at Tura, the source of the pyramids’ white limestone, filling his boat with stone, and delivering it to Giza.

“Pierre Tallet has done a wonderful job with these texts,” said Lehner. He said his own discovery and Tallet’s find “cross-confirm” each other.

White limestone was used for the flat, smooth outer casing of the pyramids, though most of it is now gone. “Merer and his men were bringing the siding” for the pyramid, Lehner said. “It’s just an everyday account of an employee working on the pyramid.”

Lehner said Tallet once came to give a presentation on his findings to his team and displayed an image of the papyrus that included multiple mentions of the name of Khufu, the pharaoh who is believed to have commissioned the Great Pyramid.

It was clear, Lehner said, that “here’s a guy delivering stone to the Great Pyramid.”

After the presentation, Tallet said to Lehner, “This should put the nail in the coffin of the alternative theorists” who have attributed the building of the pyramids to extraterrestrials or the lost citizens of the legendary civilization of Atlantis.

“We kind of looked at each other and then shook our heads and then said, ‘No, it’s not going to stop all that,’” Lehner said.",2017-10-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['port', 'theory', 'great', 'lehner', 'create', 'bring', 'built', 'egyptians', 'nile', 'stone', 'pyramid', 'pyramids', 'ancient', 'canal']",Egypt,news article,English

Joseph Painstil and Joseph Aidoo were instrumental for the Belgium side as they clinched the 2018-19 Juplier Pro league.

Ghanasoccernet.com can confirm Joseph Aidoo is on his way out of the club with a deal agreed between his club and La Liga side Celta Vigo.

Genk agreed to release their powerful centre-back on Thursday after the club's representative travelled to Spain to seal the deal for the club who helped them clinch the title.

The amount involved in the transfer is regarded as one of the most profitable for Genk for the defender who joined their club under two seasons ago from the Swedish league for a fraction of the amount.

Aidoo, who is currently with the Ghana national team in Egypt, also agreed for the move to be sealed as his representatives also travelled for the meeting to seal his part of the deal.

The defender was sent details of the Celta Vigo via his e-mail before he agreed to all the terms after hours of negotiations.

Aidoo will travel to Spain at the end of Ghana's campaign at Africa's flagship football competition to seal the deal before he is unveiled to the fans of the club.

Celta Vigo will cough out a whopping $10 million to sign Black Stars defender Joseph Aidoo who helped Genk to win the Belgian league title last season.

Vigo who battled relegation for the most part of the 2018/2019 season is looking to boost their squad for the upcoming season and have identified the defender as a good addition to their current squad.

Aidoo’s campaign in the Belgium top-flight last season impressed Celta Vigo but his impressive showing with the Ghana national team in Egypt heightened their desire to sign him before other clubs swoop for his signature.",2019-07-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['vigo', 'exit', 'aidoos', 'defender', 'aidoo', 'season', 'agreed', 'genk', 'joins', 'confirms', 'club', 'paintsil', 'joseph', 'team', 'seal', 'celta']",Ghana,news article,English

Three days of extremely high rainfall may have been the biggest factor in triggering the massive floods in Assam that that have already affected 57 lakh people, forced 1.51 lakh to relief camps and left 30 people dead this month.

Rainfall data shared by the Regional Meteorological Centre in Guwahati with NDTV reveals that Assam received 95 per cent more rain than normal on July 13 and 127 percent more on July 14. The excess rainfall sharply spiked on July 15 - by 224 per cent.

""While Arunachal Pradesh got 4 per cent more than normal, Assam and Meghalaya got normal rains and in other states, there is 13 per cent deficiency still. On 6th July, northeast had a rain deficit of 38 per cent. It rains heavily between 13th to 16th July,"" said SO Shaw, a top official at the Guwahati weather office.

On July 16, the water level of the Brahmaputra in Guwahati reached very close to its highest level of 51.46 meters recorded during the devastating floods of 2004.

""More of the major tributaries that contribute to the flood potential of the Brahmaputra as well as cause floods in their own catchment have reached peak flood level all almost at same time,"" said Parthajyoti Das, a Guwahati-based environment scientist.

The Assam State Disaster Management Authority also warned in a bulletin that the Brahmaputra and its tributaries are flowing above the danger mark in various places in the state, including in Guwahati.

However, since there has been no rain in the last 24 hours, flood waters have started receding in parts of upper and central Assam.

826,Drought Sri Lanka,Banking on lies - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/banking-on-lies-113042600846_1.html,"Businessmen love their pictures next to their message on brochures and websites. The message of Sudipta Sen, the disgraced chairman & managing director of the Saradha group, on his website comes from an empty chair. ""Saradha Group has brought a new renaissance,"" the thought bubble says. Sen despised being photographed, so that he couldn't be easily identified when the going got rough. That explains why West Bengal's most-wanted is also its least known. There are numerous stories around him; there is a touch of Bollywood in all of them. One goes that in the 1970s, Sen had a brush with the Naxal movement and spent long years in prison. He got plastic surgery done and emerged as a land shark two decades later. His passport gives an address (Survey Park in Kolkata) where he is known as Shankar. Residents say they haven't seen him since he fled the neighbourhood 18 years ago ""after a scandal"".

Some say he has three wives, others say he has six. If you believe in the official word, you'll go with three because that's what Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said. Another account says his family lives in Noida, near Delhi. Sen has made a plea to the authorities that ""his family members should not be harassed in any manner till the last day of their lives"" and has acknowledged that he has left his ""family and children in a helpless condition"". It is possible that one of the wives, peeved at Sen's dalliance with 20-something Debjani Mukherjee, who had joined Saradha Tours & Travels as a receptionist and telephone operator in 2008 but became the executive director in no time, tipped off the police after he went absconding. Sen was nabbed at Sonmarg in Kashmir in the company of Mukherjee and Arvind Chauhan, his driver who also ran his business in Jharkhand.

He may have been a ladies' man but there aren't many who can claim to know him well. An 18-page note, written by Sen on April 6 when he was on the run, is the only document that gives an insight into his fuzzy mind. Though his passport says that he was born to Ranu Kana and Nripendra Narayan Sen, the note, which he sent to the Central Bureau of Investigation, says he is the only son of Sarada Devi, wife of Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, the 19th-century mystic. ""I have started my business not to become a rich man,"" the letter typed on white paper bearing Sen's name, Kolkata address, three cellphone numbers and email says, ""but to establish the ideas and ideologies of Maa Saradha (sic), to help poor and needy people, and to give better life to the people of rural and semi-urban areas of India."" At least we know how the 165 companies of his Saradha group got their name.



* * *

Till recently, Sen, who, in the letter, traces his roots to a ""very lower middle-class family"", owned a business that claimed to build residential projects, operate tours, own a motorcycle factory and run a clutch of television channels (Channel 10, Tara Muzic and Tara News) and newspapers (in Bengali,andin English andin Urdu). The cash came from public deposits. Sen offered fixed deposits, recurring deposits and monthly income schemes. The returns promised were handsome. In fixed deposits, for instance, Sen promised to multiply the principal 1.5 times in two-and-a-half years, 2.5 times in 5 years and 4 times in 7 years. High-value depositors were told they would get a free trip to ""Singapur"".

Saradha Realty was the company most active in collecting money from depositors. Agents as well as depositors found Saradha's growth blinding. The company's website claims it has nine ongoing projects and says, somewhat ironically, ""Base of business - land which doesn't cheat anyone (sic)."" Sen had even told agents that he was building a township in Sri Lanka, and its advertisement would frequently pop up on his television channels. His 18-page note lists properties in the Northeast, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa.

Did these properties really exist? Some agents of Saradha admit they were taken for site visits to Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district and Jaguli in Nadia district, where two high-end residential projects were being built. In hindsight, they say something was amiss. ""We were bemused to see that only three or four people were working at the site which was being developed as a township. Sen said it would take 20 years to develop the projects as the company had so many businesses and it was not possible for him to oversee all of them,"" says Abradeep, a Saradha agent. Another site where agents were taken frequently was the factory of Sen's Global Motors in Hooghly. As many as 150 people would be made to pose as workers in an operational motorcycle factory, though it had stopped production in 2011. If that wasn't convincing enough, politicians and film stars added a heady blend of power and glitz that made Saradha look infallible. Mithun Chakraborty, Sen said in his letter to CBI, was appointed the brand ambassador for one of his television channels for a fee of Rs 20 lakh per month, though the actor ""did not participate in any function of the channel except one talk show"".

Then there were the politicians. ""We believed this group would never fail so long as Trinamool Congress was in power,"" Abradeep says. In the past few days, footage of Transport Minister Madan Mitra has been flashing across television channels in which he tells a gathering of Saradha agents at Netaji Indoor Stadium that he wishes the ""Saradha Parivar"" grows rapidly so that the next gathering can be held at Salt Lake Stadium which can seat 120,000 people. Some agents who are now protesting against Sen on the streets of Kolkata have brochures with Chief Minister Banerjee's pictures! In the brochures Banerjee can be seen inaugurating Sen's Kalom newspaper. When Sen launched Sakalbela, Banerjee sent a message that said: ""We will have to pass the dark night to begin our journey in the light of dawn."" Incidentally, when Banerjee issued a diktat on the newspapers public libraries should stock, Saradha's Sakalbela found a place on the list. Sen, reportedly, spent Rs 1.86 crore to buy paintings done by Banerjee, contributed handsomely to the Chief Minister's Relief Fund, and provided the six ambulances Banerjee donated to Kolkata Police in 2011. On her part, Banerjee has said that she didn't know Sen or Saradha - the two came to her notice only after the scandal broke out.

Still, Sen blames politicians for his misfortunes. His note is a long list of allegations against people like Trinamool Congress MPs Kunal Ghosh and Srinjay Bose, Matang Singh of Congress and Nalini Chidambaram, Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram's lawyer wife. The allegation against Nalini Chidambaram is that she forced him to invest large sums of money in a television channel owned by Manoranjana Singh, Matang Singh's estranged wife. Sources close to the lawyer have been quoted in news reports as saying that it was Sen who was interested in investing in the venture and she advised her client against it.





* * *Investigators suspect this could be Sen's ploy to divert attention from his misdemeanours. Sen's note tries to paint himself as a helpless victim of manipulative business associates (""I shall be committing suicide any moment not because I am physically or mentally sick but because I am feeling helpless because of unscrupulous persons and cheats in the society.""), though at times it admits that he indulged in fraudulent practices (""All the shareholders and directors appearing in the articles and memorandum of my companies are dummy (sic). Even my cook Hemant Pradhan is also included in the names of the directors, though he doesn't even know the meaning of director.""), and had a strange way of doing business (""In June 2008, my two drivers, Ratan and Dipu, came to my Shakespeare Sarani office and brought one man…."").

Depositors say Sen's companies were prompt with payments in the first year. Trouble started in January when his employees didn't get their salaries on time. Then agents were told to make payments for maturities with fresh collections or make adjustment against renewals. ""Sen asked us, why can't you keep running the show for a month? He promised he was trying to sell his cement business to arrange for the money. We too decided to help him in bad times,"" says Abradeep. But what caused the bubble to burst? Sen has said in his note that the foray into media and the huge payouts to Trinamool Congress MPs, who he says had assured him protection from the state government if there was trouble, did him in. According to Sen, the payout to politician and others worked out to Rs 33 crore every month.

To his agents, Sen had said he has lost a great deal of money in a real-estate project. To some other agents, Sen had said he was forced to give Rs 1,200 crore to Reserve Bank of India and Rs 600 crore to Securities Exchange Board of India to keep his business afloat, which had eroded all his wealth. Said-ul-Islam was one of the few agents to have spoken to Sen last on April 15, after which his cell phone was switched off. ""Sen sought time from us to arrange the money needed to meet redemption as one of his projects where he had invested all the money had run into trouble. I was convinced and even sympathetic to Sen. It was all a farce,"" recalls Islam. Sen says that he has returned Rs 2,000 crore and his dues till 2026 are about Rs 2,206 crore. However, he has said in his note that his net liabilities would not be more than Rs 400 crore. Banerjee has set aside Rs 500 crore for the depositors; a part of this money will come from a higher duty on cigarettes.

While Sen is in prison, it is left for his agents to face the ire of the depositors. Kalipada Naskar, 60, looks disturbed as he stands facing Saradha's registered office in Salt Lake's Sector V. He became a Saradha agent a year ago after he was told that he could earn up to Rs 15,000 a month in commissions and also get retirement benefits. Ever since Sen's business went belly up, depositors have hounded Naskar and 300,000 other Saradha agents. Some call him names, others threaten him with dire consequences. ""I am helpless, I am sick,"" says Naskar. A few blocks away, about 15 people have assembled outside another office of Saradha. These are the depositors who have come to inquire about the fate of their investments. The crowd includes old and young people, mostly poor.

It's a heart-wrenching scene. These are the people who had voted Banerjee to power two years ago. She owes it to them. Just asking people to smoke more won't help.",2013-04-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['rs', 'banerjee', 'note', 'saradha', 'sens', 'sen', 'agents', 'business', 'lies', 'crore', 'money', 'banking']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
267,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Increased urban development in Australia could make future floods worse - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/22/increased-urban-density-in-australia-could-make-future-floods-worse,"Around 70,000 people currently live on the Hawkesbury Nepean floodplain. The need to protect these residents and their properties is the reason why these floods require an emergency response.

If people were relocated from the floodplain, such floods would be witnessed as little more than the natural phenomena that have occurred here for millions of years. Floods replenish floodplains with nutrients and groundwater tables with water.

But it is not our plan to relocate people from the floodplain. Instead, the New South Wales government has plans to increase the floodplain population from around 70,000 to 200,000 people by 2050.

If we are intentionally putting people on a notorious floodplain, we will carry a burden of responsibility to protect them as much as we can. This means we must find ways to reduce the frequency of both minor and major flooding events.

Adding an extra 14 metres to the height of the Warragamba Dam wall is an option currently favoured by the NSW government. This would create an additional capacity of around 1,000 gigalitres volume, which could be used to capture large flood events and release them later, once it is safe to do so.

WaterNSW modelling suggests this current event could deliver 1,500GL to Warragamba Dam. In that case, 1,000 GL of storage would help delay a spill for a couple of days, but the inflows would still produce a spill of the last 500GL. Whether that would significantly reduce the peak flood heights on the Hawkesbury-Nepean would depend on whether the delayed spill coincides with peaks from other tributary inflows. It’s all about the timing.

Every drop of water that the urban environment can retain to reuse later ... is a flood mitigation success

WaterNSW estimates that only about half the water in the Hawkesbury Nepean system has come from the Warragamba spill. The remainder came from other tributaries, including the upper Nepean River and the Grose River. Effective flood mitigation requires that the timing of any Warragamba spill be such that it does not coincide with peak flows from these sources.

There is another important source of water to the river, which might easily be overlooked, and for which timing is also very important. This is the urban runoff from highly built-up areas such as Penrith. Like spills from Warragamba, the timing of urban runoff will determine the significance of these flows in contributing to flood peaks.

Areas with lots of impervious surfaces, such as roofs, roads and footpaths, convert rainfall into runoff very rapidly and efficiently. This runoff drains to urban stormwater systems, which deliver the water to local waterways. In western Sydney, these local waterways include the Hawkesbury Nepean River and other tributaries that run into it, such as South Creek and Eastern Creek.

Prior to urban development, undeveloped land is composed primarily of “pervious surfaces”, such as bushland and grassy fields. Being “pervious” means water drains down through the soil and into the groundwater table. Water moves underground and much of this groundwater might eventually make its way to Hawkesbury Nepean River. However, it will do so very slowly, arriving gradually and long after the flood peak has passed.

As urban density increases, the proportion of impervious surfaces also increases. This means stormwater will be more rapidly generated and quickly transferred to waterways. By increasing urban density in western Sydney, we could easily further exacerbate the flood risks for the region.

The good news is that there are steps we can take to design our urban environment in a way that minimises the impacts of impervious surfaces. This is often referred to as “water sensitive urban design” and the advantages can extend well beyond flood mitigation.

A city with good water-sensitive urban design is one that is designed for rainwater to be captured, slowed, reused and percolated into the ground. Plentiful pervious surfaces are essential, including back yards, gardens, verges and parklands. With new technologies, even footpaths and driveways can now be made from relatively pervious materials.

Runoff from impervious surfaces should be directed toward the available pervious surfaces to maximise infiltration opportunity. Since infiltration rates are limited, storage is required to hold water until more infiltration capacity becomes available. Storage can be provided by household rainwater tanks, as well as wetlands, lagoons and ponds.

In a large rainfall event, every drop of water that the urban environment can retain to reuse later or infiltrate to groundwater is a flood mitigation success. In this way, appropriate urban design can enable further urban development while not exacerbating already serious flood risks.

In times of drought, cities that incorporate water sensitive urban design contribute by maximising the beneficial use of rainwater, thus reducing demand on limited drinking water supplies. Furthermore, water-sensitive cities tend to be highly liveable cities, with plentiful green space and parkland for recreation.

Whatever the future has in store for western Sydney, the future residents will be better served by water-sensitive urban design than by the catastrophe of another impervious concrete jungle.",2021-03-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['future', 'khan', 'water', 'worse', 'spill', 'pervious', 'floods', 'design', 'river', 'nepean', 'australia', 'urban', 'warragamba', 'stuart', 'development', 'surfaces', 'increased', 'flood']",Australia,news article,English
908,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Seeds of Climate Resilience in Mozambique – Food Tank - Food Tank,https://foodtank.com/news/2017/04/seeds-of-climate-resilience-in-mozambique/,"U.S. President Donald Trump may still deny the harsh realities of climate change, but no one in southern Mozambique has any doubts. They don’t have much food either.

The drought of the previous two years broke last October, but with a vengeance. While much of the country received more normal rains, the southern part of Mozambique got intense storms. The first, with thunder, lightning, and hail, hit in October just as farmers were bringing in the last of their irrigated winter crops and beginning to plant maize and other rainy season crops for the coming summer. The second hit in late March, taking down trees, maize, and other crops in the community of Bobole, again flooding one of the area’s more productive associations in the lowlands along the river.

They have irrigation from a rehabilitated colonial system of drainage ditches, which allows a second growing season to supplement the summer rainy season. The system wasn’t well maintained and blockages caused the floodwaters to overflow the banks of the ditches into farmers’ fields. Even their nicely cultivated raised beds, constructed to keep waters from directly covering crops, succumbed to the rush of water.

They lost a lot of maize, the native yellow variety they had purified through careful selection under the direction of Brazilian volunteers brought in by UNAC, the Mozambican national farmers union. When I was there last year, I saw the women who run these associations using yellow maize seed from their community seed bank to grow out enough seed under irrigation so farmers who lost their maize in last year’s drought would have something to plant when the rains came. Now, at least in the lowland areas, much of that maize was lost.

So too were the hardy staples that sustained farm families during the previous two years of drought—sweet potato and cassava. These root crops still produce when rains are poor, drawing water from deep in soils that farmers have improved over the years with the introduction of agro-ecological practices—raised beds, incorporating crop residues into the soil, intercropping, rotating crops, and applying composted manure instead of chemical fertilizer. In the lowlands, though, the floods drowned even the root crops. In a walk through the Saturday vegetable market we saw small cassava roots, and much of the sweet potato had come in from nearby villages across the river.

Mohammed, the Kenyan-born extension worker who has helped bring agro-ecology to Marracuene, said many farmers have land both in the lowland areas that flooded and upland areas that saw good rains. He said that food security in the area was not in a crisis stage, though the government came in February this year to distribute maize.

“Marracuene always has maize,” said Mohammed, “but not this year.”

In the fields of the Farmers Association “Popular,” we found a strapping middle-aged woman working with her son and a hired hand to hoe her raised beds into shape for winter planting. Florentina Samuel took time out to talk with us, wiping sweat from her brow. Her farm hadn’t been wiped out by the floods, though they had destroyed her cassava crop. She invited Mohammed to pull up a withered stalk. He shook off the dirt to reveal one spindly root.

She said her family certainly suffered hunger, but she was able get an early maize crop before the heat wave and to use her irrigation to grow cucumbers and okra when few other farmers did. She got good prices in the market, which allowed her to buy rice.

Mohammed told us that she is relentless in maintaining her irrigated vegetable plots, to grow cash crops. As if to prove the point, she pulled freshly harvested okra from an old plastic watering can and fetched a plastic bag of healthy cucumbers from her nearby field. My companions from Maputo readily paid the higher market price to Florentina for such fresh out-of-season produce.

She didn’t seem daunted by the wave of bad weather, and she attributed some of her optimism to the agro-ecological farming she has adopted.

“The soil is better now, softer, and good for different crops.” She reached into her newly turned soil and showed us the organic matter from last year’s crop residues. “We are still suffering, but if this next crop is good we will be okay.”

The relentless changing climate

I was struck by the string of bad luck farmers have suffered here, but then I realized that the changing climate is changing the odds against farmers like those in Bobole and Popular. Most of the luck left to these farmers is bad luck. Mohammed, who has been working with area farmers since 2010, confirmed the intense realities of the changing climate.

“There has been a big change,” he nodded, “in rainfall patterns and in temperatures.”

He detailed the recent history in his time there, pointing out the dizzying range of impacts climate change is having on vulnerable farmers. When he arrived in 2010, he said the rainy season was what people were used to, with rains arriving in September or October and lasting into the Mozambican summer, when temperatures rose into the low 90s Fahrenheit. Crops could tolerate that with enough moisture.

The first change he noticed was in 2012. The area got an unusually heavy first rain in early September, well before the rains usually came. That cost farmers some of the irrigated winter crop, which was still in the ground.

In 2014, the rains didn’t come in September or October, so crops went in late, and temperatures in the summer rose dramatically, reaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Maize plants baked in the dry heat, reducing harvests. The winter season, which relies on irrigation, was affected as well, and in ways I wouldn’t have imagined. The Incomati River, which fills the irrigation system with water, fell so low in the drought that the Indian Ocean four miles downriver from Marracuene, flowed up the dried riverbed. Irrigation canals in parts of the region filled with salt water, destroying crops and land.

The next year was even worse, part of the well-documented El Niño weather pattern that parched much of Southern Africa. Mohammed said there were no rains at all in much of the area and temperatures reached 106, unheard of in the region. Drought-tolerant crops like sweet potato, cassava, peanuts, and cowpeas, fed farm families when maize harvests failed.

How many climate shocks could these poor farmers take? We are still finding out.

They regrew their yellow maize seeds successfully last winter season, under irrigation, resupplying farmers with seeds for the rainy season. Along came the floods, first in October of 2016, then again in late March. To add insult to injury, Mohammed said they saw record temperatures in January and February, searing heat over 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

“Crops actually burned,” Mohammed said, shaking his head. “The leaves of maize plants were brown and dry, and farmers had to plant their maize all over again.”

Drought and flooding are the evil twins of climate change for farmers in much of the global south. Across Southern Africa, farmers have seen rainy seasons shorten, rains fail, and extreme weather bring catastrophic flooding. Add record-breaking heat to that destructive mix, and it is a wonder that farmers still till their fields.

“Farmers now feel that storms and bad weather can happen at any time. But they never run away,” Mohammed told us with a smile. “They survive.”

In large part, these farmers survive because of the resilience borne of agro-ecology, a conscious strategy of their national farm association, and supportive NGOs like ActionAid, to help farmers adapt to climate change.

Adaptation funds lacking in new climate finance

They could certainly use more international support. In the last decade, rich countries have begun contributing to global climate funds to help developing countries mitigate climate change by reducing emissions and adapt to climate changes as they occur. According to a recent article by Saleemul Huq, farmers like those in Marracuene have been short-changed as the tens of billions of dollars in climate financing are disbursed.

“Most of the funding has gone to support mitigation actions in a few of the larger developing countries such as China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa,” he writes, “while only a small proportion has gone to the most vulnerable and poorest developing countries…for adaptation.”

How small a proportion? According to a recent report from the International Institute for Environment and Development, just 10 percent of climate funds have reached the most vulnerable people in developing countries.

Fortunately, the global board of the Green Climate Fund, the principal international initiative, recently agreed that 50 percent of its funds should be allocated to adaptation, and half of that should go to the poorest and most vulnerable countries. This meets the first demands of the 2014 Kathmandu Declaration on climate finance—to prioritize vulnerable countries for adaptation—but it leaves open whether the funds will find their way to the most vulnerable communities, such as the farmers in Marracuene.

Farmer seed banks to avert climate disaster

Such assistance can’t come soon enough. In response to the latest crisis in Mozambique, UNAC is responding with a national campaign to build emergency stockpiles of native seed varieties for key food crops. Marracuene’s maize seed bank saved many area farmers last year after the drought, restoring a maize variety that has proven resilient in most droughts and produces well without purchased inputs such as chemical fertilizer.

“The Marracuene farmers showed us this could work,” said Bartolomeu Antonio, UNAC’s Director of Rural Development. “We saw how effectively peasants could rescue and improve native seeds.”

UNAC and its farmers have mapped and identified key native seeds. They selected cassava, sweet potato, maize, and onion varieties from Zambezia Province, for example, and now plan to collect and grow out seeds, in collaboration with government agricultural experts, to create a national seed bank. They are also encouraging UNAC’s local members to follow Marracuene’s lead and create their own seed banks.

Only 15 percent of small-scale farmers in Mozambique purchase certified seed; the vast majority depend on seeds saved from crop to crop or exchanged with neighbors. When climate change calls, farmers can lose their seeds as they lose their crops, and they scarcely have resources to purchase replacements.

“We have to protect farmers from losing their seeds,” warns Bartolomeu, “and our seed bank can prevent climate change from becoming a climate disaster.”

(Str/Xinhua/IANS)

Even as the countrys financial capital Karachi battles intense monsoon flood, experts have warned that Pakistan lacks modern weather forecast radars for timely prediction of flooding. Over the last one week, intense monsoon downpour over Karachi has plagued the city with waterlogging, flash floods and power cuts.

Karachi recorded a whopping 230 mm rainfall in a single day on August 27, making this August the wettest August in 89 years. Overall, at least 39 people have been killed so far in several parts of the country this week.

Monsoon death toll spike to 134

The death toll from rain-related incidents across Pakistan has increased to 134, the country's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in a report.

Sharing the data of casualties from June 15 to August 29 on its website, the NDMA said on Saturday that rescue and relief operations were being carried out in the affected areas by concerned departments of the government, army and non-governmental organizations, reports Xinhua news agency.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was the worst hit where 48 people were killed and 42 others injured, the authority said. Meanwhile, Chief Minister of Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah told a press conference on Friday that 80 people were killed in rains in the province with 47 fatalities in provincial capital Karachi alone.

He said 604-mm rainfall was recorded in Karachi during August, breaking the years-long record of heavy rains in the city during the month. The torrential rains have caused a disastrous situation in Balochistan province where scores were left homeless after their houses were swept away by flash floods triggered off by lashing rains.

The NDMA has provided tents, food items, blankets, mosquito nets, among others, in the affected areas. The authority said scattered thunderstorms and rain with isolated heavy falls are also expected in parts of the country on Sunday. More rainfall is expected later next week.

This year, the meteorological department forecast more than usual rains during the ongoing monsoon season and concerned departments have issued advisories for the general public to take self-precautionary measures.

Pakistan lacks modern flood warning system

Advertisement Despite the annual devastation caused by urban flooding in cities and flash floods in the mountainous areas of Pakistan, the country has neither an effective telemetry system nor authorities said. The monsoon winds are the major source of downpour in the country during the months of July-September.

""The country still does not have an effective aviation system to deal with flood disasters and other catastrophes,"" the National Monsoon Contingency Plan 2020 compiled by the Natural Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) revealed on Saturday.

According to the plan, Pakistan has a medium and long term forecast system capable of accurately predicting the weather for a period of only 7 to 15 days while the seasonal weather forecast accuracy rate is also not more than 65-70 per cent, The Express Tribune reported.

The report indicated that the country is relying on old technology for the weather forecast, which makes it difficult to create standard and accurate atmospheric predictions. There is no telemetry system for flash flood warning in the mountainous regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), South Punjab, Pakistan occupied Kashmir and Balochistan.

Telemetry is the automatic recording and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources to an IT system in a different location for monitoring and analysis.

923,FL-2016-000114-EGY,How Volcanoes Caused Violent Uprisings in Cleopatra's Egypt - National Geographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/volcanoes-Nile-flood-climate-Egypt,"Twenty-three hundred years ago, when Euclid and Archimedes wandered Alexandria, and Cleopatra's family controlled the Egyptian throne, revolts and territorial disputes were common. These uprisings have often been attributed to ethnic tensions over Greek rule—the Ptolemaic dynasty, of which Cleopatra was the last ruler, was of Macedonian origin.

A new study published in the journal Nature Communications by an unusual team of historians, statisticians, and climate scientists suggests another surprising factor may also have played a role in the region's unrest: “hydroclimatic shocks” triggered by faraway volcanic eruptions.

""There's a school of thought that what really drives history are the decision of great leaders—the kings, the emperors, the popes,"" says co-author Francis Ludlow, a climate historian at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. ""I think part of what this paper shows is that you can't just brush off influences from the environment.""

Until the late 19th century, when the first dams were built on the Nile River, Egyptian farmers were utterly dependent on the annual monsoon. The heavy summer rains it brought to the Ethiopian highlands would push the Nile over its banks downstream, prepping the land for planting wheat and other crops. The Nile floods are so important they’ve been recorded accurately since 622 AD.

Ludlow and his colleagues have found that massive volcanic eruptions, whose fallout is recorded in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, are associated with failures of the Nile floods. The team’s climate modeling indicates that the clouds of sulfurous gases from the eruptions not only cool the Earth, by reflecting sunlight back toward space, but also cause a drop in tropical monsoon rainfall, sometimes for years.

Systematic flood records hadn’t yet begun to be kept in the Ptolemaic period, which extended from 305 B.C. to Cleopatra's death in 30 B.C. But written records make it one of ancient Egypt's most richly documented periods, with the Rosetta Stone detailing priestly proclamations, and lengthy notes on papyrus confirming wars, uprisings, land transfers, and family squabbles.

The unrest reflected in those written records can be linked to the eruptions recorded in the ice cores, the researchers find.

In this region, ""once you go in a few kilometers from the coast, there is no rainfall— you're effectively in Saharan territory,"" Ludlow says. ""When there's not a sufficient flood, you get food insecurity. People start to abandon land. They migrate to urban areas seeking food. That increases tensions, food riots. And all of this you can trace.""

An Eruptive Period

The research was the brainchild of Joe Manning, a Yale University history professor, and Ludlow. Manning, a mountaineer and rock climber, was interested in paleoclimatology and started hosting informal gatherings of historians and climate experts. One evening, after a few glasses of wine, Manning and Ludlow, who was then also at Yale, started talking about volcanoes.

Ludlow opened his computer and showed Manning data from recent ice cores. Those data allow scientists to peg the dates of major eruptions almost to the year, going back 2,300 years.

""I thought, 'some of those spikes look awfully familiar,'"" recalls Manning, the study's lead author and an expert in the Ptolemaic dynasty.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The planet during the last century has largely escaped significant eruptions. But explosions on the scale of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo disaster—the biggest in modern times—sometimes occurred two or three times a decade during the Ptolemaic period. Manning recognized some of the dates as periods of important uprisings.

After further research, the team showed that internal uprisings repeatedly came in the wake of these eruptions, sometimes peaking the second year. The authors suspect some of the lag time could reflect short-term coping efforts, such as Cleopatra’s release of stored grain after two eruptions in 46 and 44 B.C.

Interestingly, the researchers didn't find any link between eruptions and the start of wars—but they did see a correlation between eruptions and wars ending.

For example, 200 years before Cleopatra's reign, during one of the many Syrian wars between Egypt and the Seleukid Empire, Ptolemy III's army had advanced all the way to Babylon on the Euphrates. Writings from one Roman historian state that Ptolemy was then abruptly called home. Another papyrus claims he returned to quell domestic sedition, which also happened to coincide with two major eruptions.

""This seems to be the only credible explanation for why he would abandon such an incredibly successful military campaign,"" Ludlow says.

The scientists are quick to say they aren't suggesting the actions of an entire Egyptian dynasty were driven even largely by distant volcanoes. But, they argue, it's hard to ignore the likelihood that volcanic eruptions were at least a significant contributing factor.

""When you see a shock to the river—no flooding for two to three years in a row—you suddenly see a lot of responses,"" says Manning. ""Sometimes we think we're seeing fear and panic.""

Says Ludlow, ""We're very conscious that there are indeed other things that drive a complex event like a revolt. But we were able to systematically show that in almost every case—way more than just chance—revolts seemed to follow on the tail of eruptions.""

A Faraway Trigger

Scientists don't know precisely where all the eruptions occurred, whether in Alaska, Russia, the tropics, Iceland or someplace else entirely. The climate models suggest that volcanoes in the far northern hemisphere may have the largest impact on Egypt, because they tend to push the tropical rain belt to the south, reducing rains in the headwaters of the Nile.

Residents of Alexandria would not have known, of course, what was happening, but one ancient text refers to the sun being obscured, the Earth being scorched and a lack of flooding and seeds. ""My reading of that is that it's describing a volcano,"" Manning says, even though ""they don't understand that a volcano is erupting in Alaska and perturbing rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands.""

Repeated failures of the Nile floods may have forced families to sell land, because poor yields left them unable to pay taxes. One revolt, following an eruption in 209 B.C., came amid writings proclaiming that ""most of the farmers were killed and the land has gone dry.""

In fact, by the time of Cleopatra's defeat at the hands of the Roman navy, historical records show that Egypt had been hit by repeated lack of floods and faced ""famine, plague, inflation, administrative corruption, rural depopulation, migration and land abandonment."" While many factors contributed to the Ptolemaic dynasty’s decline, the authors note that Cleopatra’s death came on the heels of the third largest volcanic eruption of the last 2,500 years.

The two centuries that followed—during which the Roman empire rose to its great heights—were a quiet period for the planet’s volcanoes. The most recent century has also been relatively calm. That raises questions about how well a world in which 70 percent of the population still depends on monsoon rains may be prepared for the next major volcanic eruption.

The new research also sheds light on another current debate—about proposals for “geoengineering” solutions to counteract global warming. One such solution would be essentially to mimic volcanic eruptions by shooting aerosols into the sky to block the sun.

Sandbags protecting a neighbourhood in the Lacroix Bay area near Pembroke, Ont. were overwhelmed in recent weeks when the Ottawa River rushed in, leaving residents completely surrounded by water.

Now, they can only access their homes by boat.

“It’s a challenge,” resident Lynda Rose told CTV News. “We all take turns using the boat.”

Rose only visits her home on weekends to drop off groceries and other supplies for her husband, who stayed back to help other residents and care for the family cat.

“The army is in every day. They come in and ... make sure that we have medication -- whatever we need,” she said.

The region declared a state of emergency due to the floods at the end of April. The isolated community is a mix of permanent homes and cottages.

Kevin Collins said the waters just keep rising.

“It will take two weeks to even go down to 2017 levels where you might be able to start using the road again,” he said.

How quickly the waters recede will depend on how much it rains, and more is in the forecast.

The Ottawa River Regulating Committee said on Saturday that residents of the Mattawa area could face even higher water levels this weekend. Levels are expected to peak on Saturday in Pembroke, Westmeath and Lac Coulonge.

The City of Pembroke declared a state of emergency on Thursday and soldiers from a nearby base were deployed Saturday to protect homes. Soldiers worked together to build a sandbag wall at a park near the water.

About 25 homes are at risk. Shawn Bergeron’s is one of them. His family built a retaining wall around their home after flooding in 2017, but now the wall is under water.

“It’s very scary,” he said.

Pictures of rescue operations of flood victims in Assam are viral on social media. But there are a few unrelated images which have been passed off as pictures of the Assam flood.

Recently, a picture of a man with a calf on his shoulder wading through knee-deep water has gone viral, linking it to the Assam floods.

""Humanity. Pray for Assam"" is the caption written in English on the viral image posted on Facebook by user, ""Are bhai bhai bhai"".

The archived version of the post is here.

The picture was posted on Facebook on July 19, 2019 and has been shared by more than 4,000 users till the time of writing this article.

India Today Anti Fake News War room (AFWA) found this to be a misleading claim.

The viral image is not from Assam. The viral image has been widely used by news media in Bangladesh recently to report on the flood in the neighbouring country.

Several other Facebook pages like ""Namo Bharath - Narendra Modi For PM"" and ""Bakchod page"" also posted the same content on July 19, 2019.

Simple reverse image search on the viral picture throws up several Bangladeshi news portals which have carried this image in their stories related to flood in that particular region.

Dhaka Times used this picture in their article published on July 18, 2019 regarding the flood situation of Gaibandha area in Northern Bangladesh.

Other Bangladeshi websites like Bangladesh Journal and PBA also used the same picture recently in their stories on Bangladesh flood. But none of them has mentioned the exact location of the picture.

AFWA has not found this viral picture in any credible mainstream media website in India which are reporting on Assam flood situation, other than the social media platforms.

We have contacted news websites of Bangladesh who have carried this picture to know the exact location from where the photograph was taken. We will update our article as soon as we get any response from these websites.

It has been reported widely on mainstream and social media that many people have braved flood water to rescue trapped animals in Assam, but this particular viral image of a man rescuing a calf by carrying it on his shoulder is not from Assam.
