259,FL-2021-000025-AUS,"Morning mail: NSW floods worsen, Australia exports 'negative climate policy', Trump returns - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/22/morning-mail-nsw-floods-worsen-australia-exports-negative-climate-policy-trump-returns,"Good morning, it’s Monday 22 March, and this is Imogen Dewey with the main stories today: extreme rain and floods are still wreaking havoc in New South Wales, the pandemic is surging again in Europe, and Trump might be returning to social media.

Horses and livestock were seen floating along rivers and washing up on beaches yesterday, as the mid-north coast faced a once-in-a-lifetime deluge. Hundreds of houses were damaged and thousands of residents evacuated as several dams spilled over (now the subject of “bitter dispute”). The downpour is expected to head inland today, and premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned thousands more people could be displaced in coming days. The state’s emergency service has said it will be working beyond Easter on the post-flood clean-up effort and restoration of key services; the as-yet-untallied bill looms on the horizon. “It’s devastating,” said one local in Raymond Terrace, north of Newcastle. “I’ve never ever seen anything like this.” Communities along the Hawkesbury River in NSW are bracing for once-in-a-generation flooding that could displace residents and disrupt utilities for months.

As Australia’s miners urge Europe to define nuclear power and fossil fuels with carbon capture as “sustainable”, the Minerals Council of Australia has been accused of trying to export its “negative approach to climate policy”. The Royal Swedish Academy of Science has meanwhile warned that measures for a healthier, more resilient planet – including reducing fossil fuel emissions – are being jeopardised by fake news on social media about climate change and biodiversity loss. In Canada, the main Conservative party has voted not to recognise the climate crisis as real.

As the Therapeutic Goods Administration approves Australian manufacturing of the AstraZeneca vaccine, a senior health official has said Australia will consider shortening the length of hotel quarantine for international arrivals – or shifting towards home quarantine once more people are vaccinated. Britain’s vaccine program is facing a two-month delay in the event of an EU export ban, derailing plans to reopen as its infection rate stalls. Cases are rising again across Europe, with Germany and Belgium poised to tighten their lockdowns and leaders cancelling plans to meet in person.

Donald Trump will soon use “his own platform” to return to social media, an adviser said on Sunday, months after the former president was banned from Twitter for inciting the US Capitol riot.

After the director of the FBI said the shootings in Atlanta – in which eight people were killed, including six women of Asian descent – did not appear to have been racially motivated, Georgia senator Raphael Warnock said on Sunday: “We all know hate when we see it.”

Joe Biden has joined European leaders in condemning Turkey’s withdrawal from a landmark international accord designed to protect women from violence. The country also faces a currency crisis, after president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan sacked the country’s central bank chief.

Philippine troops have killed a leader of the Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom group and rescued four Indonesian hostages held since last year, the military said yesterday.

China Conference Highlights Food Safety and Sustainable Agriculture

The deleterious effects of GE foods and their related pesticides were aired at the Food Safety & Sustainable Agriculture Forum 2014, held in Beijing on July 25-26.

""China is taking a lead in assessing agricultural methods for local and imported foods, and GMOs are under intense scrutiny as to their safety,” said GE Free NZ president Claire Bleakley who attended the forum.

“China with over a billion people is taking safe food production very seriously and cleaning up its supply chain. There is a strong move toward sustainable agro-ecological methods of food production and processing, with significant implications for New Zealand producers and exporters.""

A particular concern for food safety discussed in Beijing is the rising level of pesticides related to GMOs entering the food chain. [1]

The international conference included genetic researchers, university professors, medical doctors, veterinarians, livestock farmers, arable farmers, agricultural consultants, leaders and community groups from China, Taiwan, U.S.A, Russia, U.K., France, Denmark, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil and Peru. [2]

Dr. Vandana Shiva and Dr. Hans Herren talked about examples of existing food production systems for agro-ecological sustainability, with an emphasis on non-pesticide land use methods. The importance for seed diversity and the ability of such systems to provide long-term resilience in times of drought and flood was highlighted.

Agro-ecological methods increase yields and nutrition for those who are living in areas of weather extremes and where food can be scarce. It is also important for farmers to be able to retain sovereignty over their food systems by saving seeds that have acclimatised to specific growing conditions.

Dr. Shiva showed how successfully protecting seed diversity and organic systems provides resilience for farmers and communities. In India, GE crops have been a disaster for farmers especially those who embraced GE cotton in areas reliant on direct rainfall. Crop failure has led to disproportionate levels of farmer suicide.

Pig farmer, Mr. Ib Pedersen, fed his animals GM soy and found that the adverse effects heavily impacted his ability to farm economically. Animal health deteriorated to the extent that the animals were suffering from constant diarrhoea, irritability, and reproductive disorders leading to severe defects, congenital malformations, and death.

Mr. Gloeckner, dairy farmer, who was initially happy to trial GE corn on his stock, was shocked to find his animals died after eating the corn. He had to sell his farm and has been devastated economically and emotionally by this experience. Chinese investigative journalists reported similar stories from farmers in China.

Scientists from France and Australia and the USA reported on their animal research with GE foods with results showing severe gut inflammation, liver and kidney problems and tumour development.

The clinical report by Dr. Vazquez, paediatrician from Argentina, was chilling; his practice has seen a tripling in cancer rates, deformities, abortions and children born with tumours, Downs syndrome, and Spina bifida, all in areas where herbicide-tolerant GE crops are grown.

Zen Honeycutt, Moms across America, tested the levels of RoundUp residues (RoundUp’s active ingredient Glyphosate is a registered antibiotic), in the urine of mothers and children. She spoke of concern for the health of children and adults because of constant exposure to the antibiotic properties of RoundUp herbicides in GE food.

Dr. Stephanie Seneff presented her research into the link between glyphosate and autism, as well as increases in allergies, gut disorders and mineral deficiencies. [3]

“This growing body of scientific evidence of harm is shocking. The very seeds that have sustained people's health for millennia are now, because of GE foods, causing a lifetime of deformities and chronic disease,"" said Claire Bleakley.

“The deleterious effects of GE DNA may be worse than a nuclear catastrophe due to the long term persistence of the engineered genes in the environment causing intergenerational adverse effects on complex living systems.""

Evidence discussed at the conference constitutes a direct warning for New Zealand.

The government, agricultural producers and exporters must heed the rising rejection of GE foods in markets such as China, and support New Zealand’s current GE-Free status by investing in agro-ecological, sustainable methods that support a safe food system.

The company had been comparatively slow to raise prices, possibly because the margins on K-cups are so high that they could absorb coffee price increases for a time.

The gross margin on K-Cups can approach 50% in some cases, huge for any industry, let alone food retail.

The increase will go into effect November 3rd. Behind the jump is a massive increase in the price of green coffee, which is up more than 50% over the past year, after a drought and disastrous harvest in Brazil. The prices have soared, stayed high:

The price increase comes ahead of the company’s rollout of its new Keurig 2.0 machine, which will come with the ability to detect knockoff unlicensed pods, and to brew carafes of coffee instead of just a cup.

In its most recent earnings call, the company said it had locked in its coffee supply through 2015.

At least 49 families were hit on Flores, in the east of Indonesia’s sprawling archipelago, Raditya Jati, a BNPB spokesman said in a statement on Sunday.

“Dozens of houses were buried in mud in Lamanele village... residents’ houses washed away by the flood,” Raditya said, referring to the eastern part of Flores.

On Adonara island to the east of Flores, a bridge collapsed and rescuers were battling heavy rain, strong wind and waves, he added.

In neighbouring East Timor, a two-year-old child was among at least three people killed in a landslide on the outskirts of the capital, Dili, a Reuters witness said, although there was no official toll of casualties or deaths.

“Heavy rains and overflowing water have drowned people’s homes and have also claimed the lives of several victims,” East Timor deputy prime minister Jose Reis said in a statement.

“There are roads that have collapsed, trees have fallen, and made it difficult to access some areas,” he said, calling the incident the worst in East Timor in 40 years.

Power supplies were cut and the presidential palace was flooded as heavy rain and strong winds have lashed Dili since late on Saturday.

Calling it a “heart-breaking” situation, actor Akshay Kumar was among the first to donate Rs 2 crore for the same. The actor gave a crore each towards the Assam Chief Minister’s Relief Fund, and for the rescue work in Kaziranga National Park.

“Honestly, jab maine paise diye, I didn’t feel good. But I felt really good when I got a call from the Assam Chief Minister (Sarbananda Sonowal), who told me that, ‘aapke donation ke baad, bahut saare aur bhi logon ne donation diya.’ That made me happy. I really feel that our nation is an amazing one. If there’s ever any problem, you just have to start something and then there’s a ripple effect. You know, when I worked on ‘Bharat Ke Veer’ app, you can’t imagine how many people made donations. India is a large-hearted nation. We just need a little push,” says the actor.

Recently, an Assamese singer, Bornalee Deuri thanked Akshay on the Kapil Sharma Show for his donation. Says Akshay: “One of the images that really affected me was of a mother holding her baby on her shoulders and wading through the flood waters. There was no expression of sadness or stress on her face. And that’s a dangerous sign. What all she must have gone through that she forgot all her sorrows. When I come across such photos, I am like, ‘it can happen to my wife or my daughter.’ Aisi photos bahut choobhtin hai. That’s why I did what I did,” he says.

Animals’ plight, too, has “moved” Akshay. “I also saw some images of animals like rhinoceros, who were drowning, dying and screaming. We should all come together during such times – regardless of whether you can donate Rs 2 or 5 lakhs. That’s how a country is made. And humanity is all about that. I admit that God has given me a lot of money, so I give away without thinking twice. Kahaan leke jaane hai paise,” he wraps up.

Work-wise, Akshay – whose latest film, Mission Mangal has crossed Rs 100 crore mark In India today – has an envious line-up ahead – Housefull 4, Good News, Sooryavanshi, Laxmmi Bomb and Bachchan Pandey followed by Prithviraj Chauhan. “See, agar yeh films chal gayi toh [line-up] accha hai. Otherwise, koi kucch nahi kar sakta with any sort of line-up of films. You know, a great man had once said, ‘you will keep going up and down, and down and up in life.’ So, it’s all good, as long as I enjoy the journey,” says the actor.

An image of trucks and cars on a flooded road has been shared in multiple social media posts claiming to show a submerged highway in Nigerias southern Ogun state following a recent heavy downpour. This is partly false; while the location is correct, the photo has been circulating since at least 2019.

The image appears in numerous Facebook posts, including this one published on March 24, 2021, with more than 500 shares.

Sango Ota is a town in Nigerias southwestern Ogun state and is home to the countrys former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. The majority of inhabitants in the region are Yorubas, a large ethnic group in the west African country.

The rest of the post, translated from Yoruba into English, pleads for the intervention of state officials and then declares end Nigeria now.

The photo it refers to shows submerged vehicles on a flooded road, and features alongside an almost identical claim in this Facebook post with more than 800 shares, as well as on Twitter.

However, the image has been circulating online for more than a year.

721,Drought Sri Lanka,Allegations of War Crimes in Sri Lanka Shake Indian Government - New York Times,https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/allegations-of-war-crimes-in-sri-lanka-shake-indian-government/,"Photo

NEW DELHI– The Congress Party faced a new crisis on Tuesday after a southern political party threatened to withdraw from the governing coalition if India did not join an international push to investigate alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka.

The possible pullout would leave the beleaguered United Progressive Alliance still in control of the Indian government, but it marks the latest case of arm-twisting by fractious government allies ahead of national elections scheduled for next year.

The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, or D.M.K., the opposition party in the state of Tamil Nadu, withdrew five ministers from the governing coalition in order to pressure the government to adopt a resolution in Parliament declaring that genocide and war crimes have been committed against Tamils by the Sri Lankan army and administration. But the party has yet to make the withdrawal official by sending a letter to the president announcing the party’s resignation.

This week, the United Nations Human Rights Council, which includes India, is expected to vote on a United States-backed resolution that urges Sri Lanka to deliver on promises to investigate allegations of a mass slaughter of Tamil civilians as the country’s civil war ended in 2009 and also cites reports about possible continued atrocities. The D.M.K. has called for the United Nations resolution to explicitly accuse Sri Lanka of genocide.

Political parties in Tamil Nadu have often voiced their concerns about the welfare of the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka, the island nation off the south Indian coast, where Tamil rebels, known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or L.T.T.E, fought to gain autonomy for the Tamil regions of the country.

The D.M.K. said it wanted an independent international body to investigate what it describes as a genocide committed by the Sri Lankan government during the country’s bloody 26-year civil war, The Hindu newspaper reported, citing a statement in Tamil by the party’s chief, Muthuvel Karunanidhi. Human rights activists say that more than 40,000 Tamils died during the war.

Palaniappan Chidambaram, India’s finance minister and a senior leader of the Congress-ruled governing coalition, said the D.M.K.’s absence would not cause the government to collapse.

“The government is absolutely stable and enjoys a majority in the Lok Sabha,” he said, referring to the lower house of Parliament. Mr. Chidambaram, who is from Tamil Nadu, was also one of three senior Congress leaders who visited the D.M.K. chief on Monday, hoping to resolve the issue.

“This is not a crisis,” he emphasized as he addressed reporters Tuesday morning.

The D.M.K. said it was withdrawing 18 legislators from the coalition in the Lower House of Parliament, but the Congress Party, which leads the United Progressive Alliance, looks unlikely to be toppled. That’s because in order for the government to fall, a “no-confidence” vote would need to pass the lower house with a simple majority. Of the lower house’s 540 seats, the Congress Party controls the lion’s share with 203 seats and has enough additional support from outside parties, including 43 seats from two political parties in the state of Uttar Pradesh alone, to defeat any such vote.

Mr. Chidambaram said that the president of the Congress Party, Sonia Gandhi, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have been briefed about the D.M.K.’s demands and that all political parties are already being consulted on a possible Parliament resolution on the issue.

“We’re examining the text of the final draft that came up before us last night,” Mr. Chidambaram said, but he added that he was not aware of what stand each political party would take on the issue.

“We are fully committed to the cause of the Lankan Tamils and an impartial inquiry should happen into the allegations of atrocities against them,” Mrs. Gandhi said Tuesday, according to the Press Trust of India. Mrs. Gandhi’s husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was killed in 1991 by a female suicide bomber believed to be associated with the L.T.T.E. in Sri Lanka.

Mr. Karunanidhi said the D.M.K. would reconsider the pullout if its demands are met, a position Mr. Chidambaram said Congress members have noted.

The D.M.K. is the second major political ally to threaten to yank its support from the governing coalition. In September, the All India Trinamool Congress, which governs the state of West Bengal, pulled out of the alliance, protesting a package of fuel price increases and pro-business economic changes.

Analysts say that the current standoff maybe just politics as usual as the D.M.K. struggles to draw attention to the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka, a deeply emotional issue in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Over the past week, thousands of students across Tamil Nadu, including in Coimbatore, Tirunelveli and Salem, have fasted , picketed and boycotted classes as they demand an independent investigation into the Sri Lankan government’s treatment of Tamils.

Indian police has issued arrest warrants for hundreds of university students in Chennai who were demonstrating against the Sri Lankan treatment of Tamils.

The recent upheaval in Tamil Nadu has been sparked by the recent release of disturbing photographs of the body of the former Tamil rebel leader’s 12-year old son, who appeared to have been shot at close range in the chest, and a report on the continued abuse of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Many of the 72 million citizens of Tamil Nadu relate to and support Sri Lankan Tamils, with whom they share a common language.

Since 2010, some 50 weather observation stations have been built with these items by African universities in Benin, Ghana, Togo and eight other countries — with support from Germany.

Wouldn't it make more sense to use the money on planting trees to slow down global warming? No, said German Research Minister Anja Karliczek in an interview with DW. Karliczek was in the Ghanaian capital Accra, where she pledged €25 million ($27.6 million) in additional support to regional climate change project WASCAL (West Africa Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land).

How warm was it in Dassari?

""First of all, we need a database as a foundation on which we can base our research,"" said Karliczek. ""So far, we have had little data collection in these latitudes.""

This observation station in Ghana sends fully automated data

The WASCAL database helps researchers find out, for instance, how high the temperature was five years ago in northwestern Benin. Near the town of Dassari at 4 p.m., it was 32 degrees, with 60 percent humidity and a light wind of three meters per second. The intensity of solar radiation, the condition of the ground and many other parameters can also be measured.

Conditions becoming more extreme

It is only with this knowledge of exactly what climatic conditions prevail, that preparations can be made for extreme weather conditions, Karliczek said. ""The drier it gets here in West Africa, the more we have to use research to make new planting possible."" Among other things, WASCAL is working on more precise rain forecasts for farmers or on finding out how much more water will be needed when the climate warms up by two degrees.

Germany's Research Minister Anja Karliczek in Ghana

With their relatively weak economies, African countries hardly contribute to climate change. However, heat, drought, floods, in short the consequences of climate change, are likely to hit the continent particularly hard. Many African countries, especially in the Sahel region, already suffer from extreme climate conditions and are poorly prepared for the consequences of climate change.

Climate doctors in action

That is why the WASCAL project includes the training of young scientists. Ten doctoral programs and two master's programs have been introduced at several West African universities.

""We already have more than 250 graduates who are now experts in climate change and water supply, in adapted land use, or climate change and security,"" WASCAL spokesman Nii Commey told DW. These experts now work across West Africa to prepare political and economic players for climate change.

Training rather than migration

The WASCAL experts are highly regarded, says Research Minister Karliczek. ""The climate experts we train can bring a wealth of knowledge especially when working in public administrations."" In addition to promoting university education, Karliczek would also like to boost vocational training in the field of climate protection in West Africa in the future.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Farming — a way of life Climate change has a disproportionate impact on communities which depend on the natural environment for their day-to-day needs. In Eritrea, it's estimated about 80% of the population are subsistence farmers, mainly growing sorghum, maize and teff. Such subsistence farmers are especially vulnerable to shifting weather patterns that can devastate food production and livelihoods.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Forced to reap early During the past few years, Eritrea, like the rest of the Horn of Africa, has experienced fluctuating weather patterns exacerbated by the ocean warming trend, El Niño. Rains fell unexpectedly in Eritrea in October last year resulting in the government advising farmers to reap early.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Vulnerable food supply ""Had they not reacted, or reacted based on the traditional harvest, they would probably lose their harvest,"" says Peter Smerdon with the World Food Programme. While El Niño is a complex and naturally occurring event, scientific research suggests that global warming could be making this cyclical event occur more frequently and intensely.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Climate change consensus Most of the world’s scientific communities agree that long-term significant changes in the earth’s climate system have occurred and are occurring more rapidly than in the past. Continued emissions into the earth’s atmosphere are projected to cause further warming, impacting Africa in the form of increased temperatures and greater seasonal rainfall variability with more frequent extremes.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Economic ramifications for all ""People in wealthier countries should be worried about the effects of climate change in the Horn of Africa,"" says Challiss McDonough from the World Food Programme ""Climate change is one of the main drivers of global hunger, second only to conflict, so, for donor countries, investing in climate and disaster risk reduction makes economic sense.""

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Still standing Pictured on the local Eritrean 5-Nakfa banknote, the sycamore tree has significant symbolism in Eritrea. Elders used to gather under these huge, hundred-year-old trees to discuss important community issues and laws. Many trees were cut down during colonization and war. Those that remain now have to contend with the effects of climate change.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Beaches under threat ""One impact of climate change in a coastal region is rising sea levels that impact lives along the coast and increases the likelihood of flooding or flood-related disaster such as high tides that could wash out a crop,"" Smerdon says. ""Also, salt-water intrusion due to climate change can increase erosion and increase salinity of soils and thereby damage soil content and fertility of land.""

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Corroding coral Eritrea’s stunning coastline includes coral reefs, offering a potential boon for tourism – if they survive in their present state. ""Until a few years ago, this piece of sea was full of corals, but then last year they all died,” an Eritrean diver tells DW. ""The temperature of the sea was too high."" At the same time, local fisherman rely on the ocean's resources to trade in fish and shells.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Trying to find a path The weather pattern changes in Eritrea are evident elsewhere. ""While working in Central America, East Africa, and the Middle East, I’ve always talked to elder people, especially those in agriculture, and the message from them is consistent,"" says Sam Wood with Save the Children in Ethiopia. ""Weather patterns are becoming less predictable and when rain comes, it is too much or too little.” Author: James Jeffrey, Milena Belloni



""The practical side must then come directly from industry, so that the young people are able to connect,"" said the minister. ""These are the things we have to push for, so that development in Africa speeds up and pressure is not created for a new wave of migration."" She calls for more aid for Africa overall for climate protection.

Fundamental criticism

Lisa Badum, climate policy spokeswoman for the Green Party in the German parliament, the Bundestag, can only agree with that. ""It is not enough to travel through the country with a green cloak; we really need to act now,"" Badum told DW. ""The drastic nature of the climate crisis has still not been understood by Germany's federal government.""

CO2 emissions from Germany are contributing to sub-Saharan Africa's drought and slower economic growth due to climate change, said Badum.

With that, according to Badum, Germany would really help the world in the fight against climate change.",2019-08-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['crop', 'change', 'early', 'shifts', 'harvest', 'west', 'data', 'farmers', 'drought', 'climate', 'patterns', 'africa', 'using', 'prevent']",Ghana,news article,English

1228,FL-2021-000030-IDN,How to make sure Biden's infrastructure plan can hold up to climate change – and save money - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/how-to-make-sure-bidens-infrastructure-plan-can-hold-up-to-climate-change-and-save-money-153869,"The Biden administration is proposing a massive infrastructure plan to replace the nation’s crumbling bridges, roads and other critical structures. But to make those investments pay off, the U.S. will need designs that can endure the changing climate.

Most U.S. infrastructure is designed to stand for decades, including through what engineers expect to be rare storms and floods.

However, extreme storms that were considered rare a few decades years ago are already becoming more common. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was the Houston area’s third “500-year flood” in three years, and it was followed by two more major flooding events.

Building infrastructure today that will be strong enough to manage the extreme scenarios the nation might see a century from now can be expensive. But what if infrastructure were instead designed to meet shorter-term needs and also be easily adapted later for the future climate?

I’m a hydraulic and coastal engineer who has been working on infrastructure design in the Netherlands, where dams and storm surge barriers are being designed to be adaptable. The methods there hold lessons for the U.S. as it prepares for a wave of new construction.

The problem with building for 100-year floods

Bridges in the U.S. are typically designed to allow the unimpeded passage of floods that have a 1-in-100 chance of happening each year. Similarly, a dam spillway might be built to handle a 10,000-year flood, and stormwater drains for two-year rainfall events.

These “return periods” are traditionally calculated using a method based on historical statistics that assume the climate doesn’t change much.

In a warming climate with more extreme rainfall, worsening droughts and rising sea levels, these historical statistics can underestimate the intensity of future floods. That puts critical infrastructure, homes and lives in danger.

Putting adaptive design to work

The Dutch are masters of flood control. When about a third of a country sits below sea level, it becomes a necessity. U.S. engineers have been turning to them for advice in recent years as understanding of climate change and its impact on storms and sea level rise increases.

The Netherlands’ innovative designs, like the giant gates of the Maeslant flood defense, are getting noticed, but equally important is how the Dutch use adaptive designs to prepare for the future and keep costs under control.

To see adaptive design at work, look at the renovation underway of the Afsluitdijk, a 20-mile-long dam that protects Amsterdam’s port from storm surges on the North Sea.

When the dam was completed in 1932, it drained river water to the sea by gravity at low tide. However, sea level rise, combined with the need to keep the water level in Amsterdam’s port low to protect the city, are making drainage by gravity alone increasingly ineffective.

To update the dam, the Dutch have built pump stations for draining water into the North Sea. Importantly, the new design reserves enough land to expand the existing pump stations or build new ones when future storms and sea level rise make it necessary.

Lessons as the U.S. plans new coastal protections

Several U.S. cities, including Houston, New York and Boston, are now considering hurricane defense systems, and the future protection they will actually need to prevent flooding is unknown at this point.

By using adaptive design, they could include room for expanding those defenses as the climate changes.

That might mean building earthen dams and levees wide enough to allow for raising them when necessary, and reserving land for widening and heightening of coastal dunes that form part of the system and for adding pump infrastructure.

Crucially, movable storm surge barriers, which typically make up a short section of a barrier system, offer protection only from sporadic hurricanes and not from long-term sea level rise. The movable barriers may eventually need to be replaced with a dam, shipping lock and drainage pumps – that, too, can be planned for.

By starting with an adaptive design, the U.S. can save billions of dollars compared with having to build new systems decades down the road. The recent renovations of California’s Folsom Dam, built in 1955, illustrate that cost. A new spillway completed in 2018 cost $900 million – with inflation, that’s about the original cost of the entire dam.

Adapting for Mississippi River flooding

When Dutch engineers plan new levees, storm surge barriers and river locks, they consider what are known as the Delta Scenarios – four possible futures for flood risk and sea level rise, ranging from moderate to extreme global warming. These scenarios create a framework for adaptive design.

For example, a complex of locks on the Meuse River, used to raise and lower ships and barges as they travel up- or downstream, needs to be replaced or rehabilitated. A new lock complex must have enough sluice gates, which can be closed or opened to allow high water through after storms, so the water doesn’t flood surrounding farms and cities. The accompanying weir – the low dam that raises the river’s level – must be high enough to retain enough water for ship operations during times of drought.

Building a tall weir with many sluice gates, and raising riverbank levees to match, would allow the lock complex to manage future climate scenarios, but that would be expensive. With adaptive design, the complex can instead be built to be easily modified later to meet changing climate needs. That includes reserving space for additional sluice gates, and designing gates that can be made taller by welding on additional components as needed.

On the Mississippi River and its tributaries, many of the old lock complexes that raise and lower the barges carrying agricultural products and industrial materials are now undergoing replacement. Using similar adaptive design techniques would be a cost-efficient way to face an uncertain future.",2021-03-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['adaptive', 'design', 'climate', 'level', 'money', 'water', 'hold', 'sure', 'flood', 'save', 'future', 'dam', 'bidens', 'infrastructure', 'change', 'sea', 'plan']",India,news article,English

There is also urban/flash flooding, and these are caused by poor drainage systems or even non-existing drainage systems in many major cities in Nigeria. Lastly is coastal or tidal flooding for states that are within coastal areas such as Ondo, Lagos, Bayelsa and Rivers.

Now, it is important to state that our Annual Flood Outlook is a scientific prediction done using historical data physically collected in the field, some of them over 40 to 50 years ago. So, we use it to project and see what is going to happen tomorrow. And from what we have seen using international standards to predict, we have said that not less than 121 Local Government Areas in Nigeria, in 27 states actually, will be affected by flooding in the course of the year. Also, about 302 LGAs will experience different magnitudes of flooding. And about 351 LGAs may have a lesser severity of flooding. But like I said, it is a prediction, which we monitor closely by weekly publications. We are talking about the issue of climate change and so what you see today may not be what will happen tomorrow. So, as a result of that, we will be updating the media, states and others on what they are likely to observe in the course of the year.

How are you interfacing with the states with respect to predictions in the AFOs?

We will be doing sensitisation programmes and will downscale it to the states. We will tell the governors that these are the locations in your state that are likely to be affected in the course of the year 2021. We informed the public through the press some months ago, as preparatory to the unveiling of the 2021 AFO. And by protocol, it is the Minister of Water Resources who interfaces with the governors on behalf of the agency. Last year, for instance, the minister sent letters to each of the state governors in Nigeria and detailed the states that would be affected by flooding in that year. But what they did with it is another cup of tea.

Also, we go through other systems in the states such as their emergency management agencies, water resources and environment ministries. We interface with them directly, but what they do with our information is another issue.

Are you satisfied with what states are doing about the recommendations in the AFOs?

Frankly speaking, they are not doing as much as we expect from them, otherwise, the level of devastation that happens year in year out could have been avoided or eliminated. Weve been telling the state governors that the tempo of political activities they embark upon during election periods should be deployed against activities that encourage flooding. Go to the grassroots, you have councillors in LGAs. They should be able to cascade this information and domesticate it in their own locations. But often time, it doesnt happen. However, when a disaster occurs, they are quick to complain and cry out to high heavens and maybe get some support from the humanitarian ministry. But in terms of ameliorating the impact of flooding before it occurs, they dont seem to be doing much.

I recall in 2016/2017, I engaged some state emergency management agencies one-on-one and we were told not to come to tell them what will happen in the course of the year except we are coming with relief materials. But we told them that that was not our jurisdiction. Ours is to inform you about what is likely to happen in your own state. If it happens, you have the National Emergency Management Agency that can support you, not NIHSA.

What are states likely going to face by failing to abide by the recommendations in the AFO?

Going by the law establishing the agency, the agencys powers begin and stop at predicting and releasing the message. We dont enforce anything. Each state has its own regulatory body, such as the urban planning department and emergency management agencies. They also have environmental laws and ministries that are supposed to be the regulators to ensure that the dictates of our prediction are followed. I may then say that NEMA could now insist by saying, Since you failed to do the needful, dont run to us for relief materials. This is because, if you recall, when the flood was very severe in 2012, the Federal Government gave out a lot of money. Some states got about N4bn to N5bn, depending on the degree of devastation.

Maybe such decisions could be taken by NEMA so as to encourage states that are doing well in terms of adhering to the predictions to ensure that lives and property are not lost. We, as an agency, cant enforce anything; we cant force any governor to do the needful. But the governors on their own should in the spirit of humanity protect and help those who voted them into power.

Are you collaborating with sister agencies on climate issues?

In fact, our relationship with one of them, NiMet (Nigeria Meteorological Services Agency) is very superb and cordial. First of all, at the international level, the meteorological agency is Nigerias permanent representative with the World Meteorological Organisation, and that falls on whoever is the Director-General. Also, whosoever heads the hydrological agency in any nation is an adviser to that permanent representative. So, in that wise, there is a very good collaboration between NIHSA and NiMet; for instance, we requested rainfall data from NiMet. And this was one of the major inputs in the model to use for predictions. They provide us those data at no cost. And once they are releasing their own predictions, such as the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction, which is now called Seasonal Climate Prediction, they inform NIHSA.

So, we collaborate a lot; they provide us with data that help us to do our prediction alongside other river measurements that we do by ourselves. We use so much data  about 12 of them, but the rainfall data are among the major data.

What are some of the recommendations in the 2021 AFO, and what advice do you have for farmers?

Farmers should heed our predictions. They should also abide by our warnings. Those who farm within the river banks should ensure that their crops have early maturity. This is to ensure that before the onset of the rainy season or flooding, the crops would have matured and be harvested. Flooding doesnt come with the rains immediately, rather it is when the soil is saturated and its moisture content becomes high that flooding will begin to take place. So, if there is a way they can be helped to plant crops that can mature easily, it should be done, so that before the flooding starts they can harvest. And after the flooding, heavy nutrients are now brought within the flood plain, which can lead to enhanced yields when the farming starts again.

The Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, for instance, once mentioned that because of the heavy nutrients that the floods brought, they were able to regain what they lost in one of the farming seasons. That governor is very active, he works with us and comes from time to time to ask what could be done to improve farming activities in his state.

What are some of the things states should be doing now, considering the looming flood?

Like I said in our press briefing in March, there is still time for states, LGAs and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021. We made it clear at the briefing that as the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin, which covers nine countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote DIvoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season, with its attendant flood incidents. Nigerias geographical location, downstream of all the countries in this basin, places it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollution from all the countries upstream.

We know that the persistent flooding and flood disasters have become an annual event in Nigeria since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster in recent history. In 2012, hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property losses running into trillions of naira.

It is in the light of the above that NIHSA wishes to urge the states and the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly menace of flooding in the past years. We recommend that the three tiers of government should consider clearing drainage systems and canals and also embark on projects for improving hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows. They should carry out the removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinths and floats on water channels and on all avenues for river runoffs. We also encourage people living along the waterways and those having socio-economic activities on flood plains to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains.

768,Drought Sri Lanka,5 Ways China Could Become a Democracy – The Diplomat - the Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2013/02/5-ways-china-could-become-a-democracy/,"Advertisement

Speculating about China’s possible political futures is an intellectual activity that intrigues some and puzzles many. The conventional wisdom is that the entrenched Chinese Communist Party (CCP), so determined to defend and perpetuate its political monopoly, has the means to survive for an extended period (though not forever). A minority view, however, holds that the CCP’s days are numbered. In fact, a transition to democracy in China in the next 10 to 15 years is a high probability event. What stands behind this optimistic view about China’s democratic future is accumulated international and historical experience in democratic transitions (roughly 80 countries have made the transition from authoritarian rule to varying forms and degrees of democracy in the past 40 years) and decades of social science research that has yielded important insights into the dynamics of democratic transition and authoritarian decay (the two closely linked processes).

To be sure, those believing that China’s one-party regime still has enough resilience to endure decades of rule can point to the CCP’s proven and enormous capacity for repression (the most critical factor in the survival of autocracies), its ability to adapt to socioeconomic changes (although the degree of its adaptability is a subject of scholarly contention), and its track record of delivering economic improvement as a source of legitimacy.

To this list of reasons why the Chinese people should resign themselves to decades of one-party rule will be a set of factors singled out by proponents of the theory of predictable regime change in China. Among many of the causes of the decline and collapse of authoritarian rule, two stand out.

First, there is the logic of authoritarian decay. One-party regimes, however sophisticated, suffer from organizational ageing and decay. Leaders get progressively weaker (in terms of capabilities and ideological commitment); such regimes tend to attract careerists and opportunists who view their role in the regime from the perspective of an investor: they want to maximize their returns from their contribution to the regime’s maintenance and survival. The result is escalating corruption, deteriorating governance, and growing alienation of the masses. Empirically, the organizational decay of one-party regime can be measured by the limited longevity of such regimes. To date, the record longevity of a one-party regime is 74 years (held by the former Communist Party of the Soviet Union). One-party regimes in Mexico and Taiwan remained in power for 71 and 73 years respectively (although in the case of Taiwan, the accounting is complicated by the Kuomintang’s military defeat on the mainland). Moreover, all of the three longest-ruling one-party regimes began to experience system-threatening crisis roughly a decade before they exited political power. If the same historical experience should be repeated in China, where the Communist Party has ruled for 63 years, we may reasonably speculate that the probability of a regime transition is both real and high in the coming 10-15 years, when the CCP will reach the upper-limit of the longevity of one-party regimes.

Second, the effects of socioeconomic change –rising literacy, income, and urbanization rates, along with the improvement of communications technologies — greatly reduce the costs of collective action, de-legitimize autocratic rule, and foster demands for greater democracy. As a result, authoritarian regimes, which have a relatively easy time ruling poor and agrarian societies, find it increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible to maintain their rule once socioeconomic development reaches a certain level. Statistical analysis shows that authoritarian regimes become progressively more unstable (and democratic transitions more likely) once income rises above $1,000 (PPP) per capita. When per capita income goes above $4,000 (PPP), the likelihood of democratic transitions increases more dramatically. Few authoritarian regimes, unless they rule in oil-producing countries, can survive once per capita income hits more than $6,000 (PPP). If we apply this observation and take into account the probable effect of inflation (although the above PPP figures were calculated in constant terms), we will find that China is well into this “zone of democratic transition” because its per capita income is around $9,100 (PPP) today, comparable to the income level of South Korea and Taiwan in the mid-1980s on the eve of their democratic transitions. In another 10-15 years, its per capita income could exceed $15,000 and its urbanization rate will have risen to 60-65 percent. If the CCP has such a tough time today (in terms of deploying its manpower and financial resources) to maintain its rule, just imagine how impossible the task will become in 10-15 years’ time.

If this analysis is convincing enough for us to entertain the strong possibility of a democratic transition in China in the coming 10-15 years, the more interesting follow-up question is definitely “how will such a transition happen?”

Again, based on the rich experience of democratic transitions since the 1970s, there are five ways China could become democratic:

Advertisement

“Happy ending” would be the most preferable mode of democratic transition for China. Typically, a peaceful exit from power managed by the ruling elites of the old regime goes through several stages. It starts with the emergence of a legitimacy crisis, which may be caused by many factors (such as poor economic performance, military defeat, rising popular resistance, unbearable costs of repression, and endemic corruption). Recognition of such a crisis convinces some leaders of the regime that the days of authoritarian rule are numbered and they should start managing a graceful withdrawal from power. If such leaders gain political dominance inside the regime, they start a process of liberalization by freeing the media and loosening control over civil society. Then they negotiate with opposition leaders to set the rules of the post-transition political system. Most critically, such negotiations center on the protection of the ruling elites of the old regime who have committed human rights abuses and the preservation of the privileges of the state institutions that have supported the old regime (such as the military and the secret police). Once such negotiations are concluded, elections are held. In most cases (Taiwan and Spain being the exceptions), parties representing the old regime lose such elections, thus ushering in a new democratic era. At the moment, the transition in Burma is unfolding according to this script.

But for China, the probability of such a happy ending hinges on, among other things, whether the ruling elites start reform before the old regime suffers irreparable loss of legitimacy. The historical record of peaceful transition from post-totalitarian regimes is abysmal mainly because such regimes resist reform until it is too late. Successful cases of “happy ending” transitions, such as those in Taiwan, Mexico, and Brazil, took place because the old regime still maintained sufficient political strength and some degree of support from key social groups. So the sooner the ruling elites start this process, the greater their chances of success. The paradox, however, is that regimes that are strong enough are unwilling to reform and regimes that are weak cannot reform. In the Chinese case, the odds of a soft landing are likely to be determined by what China’s new leadership does in the coming five years because the window of opportunity for a political soft landing will not remain open forever.

“Gorby comes to China” is a variation of the “happy ending” scenario with a nasty twist. In such a scenario, China’s leadership misses the historic opportunity to start the reform now. But in the coming decade, a convergence of unfavorable economic, social, and political trends (such as falling economic growth due to demographic ageing, environmental decay, crony-capitalism, inequality, corruption and rising social unrest) finally forces the regime to face reality. Hardliners are discredited and replaced by reformers who, like Gorbachev, start a Chinese version of glasnost and perestroika. But the regime by that time has lost total credibility and political support from key social groups. Liberalization triggers mass political mobilization and radicalism. Members of the old regime start to defect – either to the opposition or their safe havens in Southern California or Switzerland. Amid political chaos, the regime suffers another internal split, similar to that between Boris Yeltsin and Gorbachev, with the rise of a radical democratizer replacing a moderate reformer. With their enormous popular support, the dominant political opposition, including many defectors from the old regime, refuses to offer concessions to the Communist Party since it is now literally in no position to negotiate. The party’s rule collapses, either as a result of elections that boot its loyalists out of power or spontaneous seizure of power by the opposition.

Should such a scenario occur in China, it would be the most ironic. For the last twenty years, the Communist Party has tried everything to avert a Soviet-style collapse. If the “Gorby scenario” is the one that brings democracy to China, it means the party has obviously learned the wrong lesson from the Soviet collapse.

“Tiananmen redux” is a third possibility. Such a scenario can unfold when the party continues to resist reform even amid signs of political radicalization and polarization in society. The same factors that contribute to the “Gorby scenario” will be at play here, except that the trigger of the collapse is not a belated move toward liberalization by reformers inside the regime, but by an unanticipated mass revolt that mobilizes a wide range of social groups nationwide, as happened during Tiananmen in 1989. The manifestations of such a political revolution will be identical with those seen in the heady days of the pro-democracy Tiananmen protest and the “Jasmine Revolution” in the Middle East. In the Chinese case, “Tiananmen redux” produces a different political outcome mainly because the China military refuses to intervene again to save the party (in most cases of crisis-induced transitions since the 1970s, the military abandoned the autocratic rulers at the most critical moment).

“Financial meltdown” – our fourth scenario – can initiate a democratic transition in China in the same way the East Asian financial crisis in 1997-98 led to the collapse of Suharto in Indonesia. The Chinese bank-based financial system shares many characteristics with the Suharto-era Indonesian banking system: politicization, cronyism, corruption, poor regulation, and weak risk management. It is a well-known fact today that the Chinese financial system has accumulated huge non-performing loans and may be technically insolvent if these loans are recognized. In addition, off-balance sheet activities through the shadow-banking system have mushroomed in recent years, adding more risks to financial stability. As China’s capacity to maintain capital control erodes because of the proliferation of methods to move money in and out of China, the probability of a financial meltdown increases further. To make matters worse, premature capital account liberalization by China could facilitate capital flight in times of a systemic financial crisis. Should China’s financial sector suffer a meltdown, the economy would grind to a halt and social unrest could become uncontrollable. If the security forces fail to restore order and the military refuse to bail out the party, the party could lose power amid chaos. The probability of a collapse induced by a financial meltdown alone is relatively low. But even if the party should survive the immediate aftermath of a financial meltdown, the economic toll exacted on China will most likely damage its economic performance to such an extent as to generate knock-on effects that eventually delegitimize the party’s authority.

“Environmental collapse” is our last regime change scenario. Given the salience of environmental decay in China these days, the probability of a regime change induced by environmental collapse is not trivial. The feed-back loop linking environmental collapse to regime change is complicated but not impossible to conceive. Obviously, the economic costs of environmental collapse will be substantial, in terms of healthcare, lost productivity, water shortage, and physical damages.Growth could stall, undermining the CCP’s legitimacy and control. Environmental collapse in China has already started to alienate the urban middle-class from the regime and triggered growing social protest. Environmental activism can become a political force linking different social groups together in a common cause against a one-party regime seen as insensitive, unresponsive, and incompetent on environmental issues. The severe degradation of the environment in China also means that the probability of a catastrophic environmental disaster – a massive toxic spill, record drought, or extended period of poisonous smog– could trigger a mass protest incident that opens the door for the rapid political mobilization of the opposition.

The take-away from this intellectual exercise should be sobering, both for the CCP and the international community. To date, few have seriously thought about the probability and the various plausible scenarios of a regime transition in China. As we go through the likely causes and scenarios of such a transition, it should become blindingly clear that we need to start thinking about both the unthinkable and the inevitable.",2013-02-13 08:00:00+00:00,"['democracy', 'political', 'regime', 'democratic', 'collapse', 'party', 'rule', 'transition', 'financial', 'regimes', 'china', 'ways']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

She said the UNDP plans to build an additional 4,000 houses next year, helping 20,000 people gain access to information on climate change and natural disasters, she said, adding that her agency would continue to support Vietnam in natural disaster management over the next decade.

Tran Quang Hoai, head of the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority, said the houses built by the UNDP in central Vietnam were still standing after the regions historic storms and floods in October and November, which had demolished over 1,500 houses and damaged 240,000 others.

La Thi Kim Ngan, deputy head of the National Institute of Architecture, said that authorities and investors need to create a comprehensive model for housing complexes, complete with infrastructure like electricity, clean water and waste management systems.

Flood resilient houses can become homestay accommodations and help the region develop economically, she added.

Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said his ministry was cooperating with the architecture institute and the Ministry of Construction to develop appropriate and safe housing models to withstand natural disasters.

It is estimated that by 2025, Vietnam would have around 30 million people living in areas prone to natural disasters. Many of them are likely to be poverty stricken.

Rapid urbanization and economic development can intensify natural disaster risks for Vietnam's coastline and wipe billions of dollars off its economic growth over the next decade, a World Bank report warned in October.

Around 11.8 million people in coastal provinces face the threat of intense flooding, and over 35 percent of settlements are located on eroding coastlines. Each year, an average of $852 million, along with around 316,000 jobs in sectors like agriculture, aquaculture and tourism, are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding, the report said.",2020-12-18 08:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'needs', 'proof', 'flood', 'disaster', 'undp', 'coast', 'management', 'development', 'natural', 'vietnams', 'million', '100000', 'houses', 'coastal']",Vietnam,news article,English

While not all Malians may be in need of international protection, many from the northern region (Timbuktu, Gao, Kidal, Taoudenni and Menaka), central region (Mopti), some parts of the southern region (Koulikoro, Ségou and Sikasso) and border areas with Niger and Burkina Faso are likely to need asylum.

Persistent violence amongst armed groups and inter-communal clashes continue to affect northern Mali, and have now spread to other regions. Some armed groups affiliated with Coordination des mouvements de l’Azawad (CMA) and the Platform, a loose coalition of militias, have failed to respect the 2015 Peace and Reconciliation in Mali agreement. The conflict has been further escalated by Islamist extremist groups.

The ongoing insecurity has weakened the authority of state institutions in some parts of the country, particularly in the northern and central regions. Civilians, politicians and civil servants and security forces are being targeted and killed. Nearly 200 peacekeepers have been killed since 2013, making it the deadliest peacekeeping operation in the world. People who collaborate with national or international defence forces subsequently find themselves targeted for attack.

Local populations, particularly in the central regions, report widespread human rights violations including summary execution, disappearances, torture and arbitrary arrest. Smugglers and traffickers are able to operate with impunity.

The crisis has had a devastating and disproportionate effect on children. Children are being forcibly recruited by armed groups, kidnapped and killed. More than 285,000 children are being denied an education due to school closures, predominantly in the Mopti region. Girls are being raped and sexually assaulted.

Humanitarian access is severely restricted, creating significant difficulties in providing sufficient access to health, water and sanitation. Drought and desertification in the Sahel have exacerbated the already scarce availability of food.

An estimated 3.4 million Malians are in need of humanitarian assistance, approximately 2.9 million of whom are in areas of the country affected by the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, nearly 140,000 Malian refugees have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries, mainly Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger since 2013.

Within this context, UNHCR urges States to provide access to territory and asylum procedures to people fleeing the conflict in Mali. Nobody from the conflict-affected regions should be forcibly returned to Mali. The remaining parts of the country should not be considered as an appropriate alternative to asylum until such a time that the security, rule of law and human rights situation in Mali has significantly improved.

1476,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Floods will soon be no more in Kampala - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/oped/commentary/floods-will-soon-be-no-more-in-kampala-3366224,"By Guest Writer More by this Author

Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has significantly dealt with the challenge of flooding in the City.

A year ago, Kampala was experiencing floods at certain black spots that made navigation at those points impossible to go past for several hours after a downpour.

These locations included; Clock Tower on Entebbe Road that often covered the Fire Brigade headquarters parking; Mulwana Road in Bugoloobi Parish; at the Electoral Commission head office on Jinja Road; and the Bwaise communities in Kawempe Division. The floods disrupted navigation in the city, damaged both business and household property as well as affecting livelihoods in vulnerable communities.

KCCA embarked on an aggressive drainage infrastructure development programme in line with the Kampala Drainage Master Plan (KDMP) and the Kampala Capital City Strategic Plan 2020/2021-2024/2025 whose strategic goal is that “by June 2025 Kampala will be an inclusive, liveable, resilient and well planned city that provides economic opportunities to all”. The strategic plan is anchored on four pillars; Economic growth, governance and citizen engagement, quality of life and city resilience.

Some of the projects done or in progress include the construction of the Lubigi and Nakamiro channels with a combined stretch of 5.88Km at Shs82.7B launched in August 2020 by President Museveni. The two channels will solve the flood water menace in the low lying areas of Bwaise, stretching into Kawala in Rubaga Division.

The Clock Tower area and Mulwana Road flooding has been significantly dealt with by downstream interventions on Nakivubo Channel in the Kanyogoga swamp catchment area in Makindye and Nakawa divisions.

Here KCCA is desilting and widening the channel by removing gravel and other sediments that affect the breadth, depth and flow of water. The box culvert constructed on Mulwana Road plus widening and constructing the open drain that feeds into Nakivubo channel is already proving that the area shall be floodless when works are completed. The drainage works under the Kampala Flyover Project are to further solve the stagnation challenge at Clock Tower.

Other drainage improvement works including construction of St Dennis Channel that flows through Kulekana and Nakinyuguzi Channel in Salaama Parish, both in Makindye Division. In Central Division, KCCA is working on Kitamanya’agamba drain (below the Law Development Centre) in Kagugube Parish. In Rubaga Division, Nabulagala Channel and the box culvert along Sentema Road have been constructed, hence mitigating the flooding incidences.

Also in Rubaga Division, interim interventions on sections of Nalukolongo Primary Channel are ahead of the planned reconstruction once funds are obtained for both the channel works and remaining compensation of persons.

One of the key challenges affecting the efficiency of drainage channels is garbage. There is a lot of irresponsible dumping of garbage (polythene, plastic bottles and trade refuse) that ends up blocking the drainage system once it is swept away by surface water run-off or when dumped in the channels causing surface runoff build up and stagnation (floods). Whereas KCCA has emergency teams at the drainage channels during the rain, we appeal to the public to responsibly manage waste.

Another challenge is the illegal developments and encroachments on drainage reserves of primary and secondary channels. Some developers have constructed over the drains while others have illegally diverted the course of drainage channels. Consequently, the capacity of these drains has decreased and maintenance affected resulting in flooding as seen in Bugolobi, Nalukolongo Kamwokya, and Kansanga areas.

The KDMP was developed to improve the old, dilapidated and inefficient existing drainage systems. It recommends both structural and non-structural measures.

Sorting out Kampala’s drainage challenges may not be a fortnight or season’s work but great strides have been taken for one to confidently note that the floods are no more in Kampala, save for the temporal stagnation that usually clears within 10 to 15 minutes after a heavy downpour.

• Torrential rains are being experienced across Uganda. According to the Uganda National Meteorological Department (UNMA), abovenormal rains will continue until the end of the year.

• At least 38 people have died due to floods and landslides in Bundibugyo, Bududa and Sironko districts, and over 150 people have been injured. At least 300,000 have been affected and an estimated 65,000 people are displaced, according to Government sources.

• The floods and landslides have left a trail of destruction, including damaged homes, infrastructure, agriculture and livelihoods.

• The Government of Uganda, with the support of humanitarian partners, is responding to the most urgent needs of people affected.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Due to heavier than normal rains since September—enhanced by the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)—several districts in Uganda have been experiencing flash floods (mostly in urban areas) and landslides (in rural/hilly areas).

According to preliminary estimates from a rapid assessment conducted by the Office of the Prime Minister in the most affected sub-regions of Mount Elgon and South Western Uganda in early December, at least 300,000 people have been affected, including 65,000 people reportedly displaced by the impact of heavy rains since September 2019. Over 21,500 hectares of crop and plantations are reportedly damaged in these areas. As of 17 December, 38 people have reportedly lost their lives, including in the mountainous Bundibugyo district in the western region and the Mount Elgon area in eastern Uganda. Water systems in Bundibugyo have been destroyed, exacerbating the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the week of 16 December, three suspected cholera cases were reported in Bundibugyo district.

GENEVA, 16 November (UNHCR) - The UN refugee agency has helped more than 80,000 internally displaced Yemenis return to their homes in the south of their country, the first significant fall in the number of displaced in the area since fighting erupted 18 months ago.

""In southern Yemen, UNHCR is seeing growing numbers of internally displaced people returning to their homes,"" UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told a news conference. ""Over the past four months, and working with the Yemeni authorities, we have helped more than 80,000 people go home, and further returns are on-going. ""

The decline in displacement follows the re-establishing of government authority in the southern province of Abyan in July.

""This is the first significant displacement decline since May 2011 when fighting between government troops and militants erupted in the south of Yemen,"" Edwards said.

Initially, returns were slow due to the widespread presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance, as well as extensive damage to infrastructure. In many cases people also wanted to see more evidence of improved security. However, after de-mining by the Yemeni government and other improvements in security more families are now making the decision to return.

Many of the returns have been from Aden, where more than 23,000 of the 25,000 IDPs who were sheltering in schools and other public buildings have now returned to Abyan. This has allowed normal teaching to resume, although schools still need repairs after having served as IDP sites for over a year.

The 1,500 IDPs still living in Aden schools will be relocated into eight buildings that UNHCR, with the agreement of the government, is rehabilitating to serve as temporary accommodation.

The government has been covering transportation costs - around US$70 per family -- for people returning to Abyan. Security personnel man checkpoints along the route to ensure safe passage, and in Abyan itself UNHCR and other agencies are providing further support.

As the lead international agency responding to IDP and returnee needs for shelter UNHCR has distributed shelter repair kits to some 32,000 people, and non-food items packages to 33,000 people. These packages include mattresses, blankets, kitchen sets, plastic sheeting and tools. UNHCR plans to help 180,000 people in Abyan with shelter and non-food relief kits.

""Currently, the challenges include widespread damage to property and infrastructure, a still fragile security situation, and patchiness in provision of public services,"" said Edwards. ""Continuing international support and stable security will be essential for returns to become sustainable, and particularly if internal displacement in southern Yemen is to be brought to an end during 2013.""

Meanwhile in northern Yemen more than 300,000 people are still displaced from a conflict that has been running on and off since 2004 between Yemeni government forces and al Houthis. Insecurity continues to hinder returns there, while tribal clashes earlier in 2012 generated over 6,000 new IDPs in the northern governorates.

Despite the challenges it faces, Yemen remains one of the most generous refugee hosting countries with over 232,000 refugees, mainly Somalis. While 2011 saw a record new influx of 103,000 refugees and migrants, so far in 2012 there have been over 90,500 new arrivals, mainly Ethiopians.

UNHCR Yemen carries out its crucial humanitarian interventions throughout the country with nine offices and some 200 national and international staff on the ground, In 2011 UNHCR's national implementing partners Society for Humanitarian Solidarity (SHS) received the Nansen award for their life-saving assistance to the thousands of refugees and migrants who arrive on the shores of Yemen every year after crossing the Gulf of Aden by boat.",2012-11-16 08:00:00+00:00,"['security', 'displaced', 'unhcr', 'yemen', 'shelter', 'internally', 'yemeni', 'abyan', 'schools', 'southern', 'return', '80000', 'returns']",India,news article,English

No state deserves to have a governor like Samuel Ortom. Man has been picking up the wrong battles and doesn't know how to carry out his duties as a governor. I won't be surprised if his people reward him with a Senate seat in the next election after all these stunts.

Meanwhile, Governor Ortom on Monday, May 17 urged residents of Benue state to defend themselves against armed invaders.

The governor said those who don't have weapons required by the law, should go to their neighbours and get one.

Legit.ng had earlier reported that the Ortom-led administration on Thursday, May 6 approved the establishment of vigilante groups to combat the high rate of insecurity in Benue state.

Governor Ortom informed residents of the state when he briefed journalists attached to his office on the outcome of a recently expanded stakeholders meeting held at the new banquet hall of the Government House, Makurdi.

1059,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Aqua dams: Exploring preventative tools for future flooding in Canada - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/aqua-dams-exploring-preventative-tools-for-future-flooding-in-canada-1.4412093,"As the water begins to recede in regions of Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick following weeks of widespread flooding, attention has turned to future prevention and what tools are proving most effective at keeping residents and their properties safe.

While sandbags are the most commonly used line of defence against invading water -- due to their relatively low cost and availability -- they’re not always the most reliable, according to flood management experts.

The sandbags can become saturated with water if they’re exposed to it for too long, Tamsin Lyle, a principal engineer at Ebbwater Consulting, told The Canadian Press last month. She said the sandbags become relatively ineffective during prolonged flooding events and they can easily spring leaks.

So what are the alternatives?

When the Ottawa River reached historic highs at the end of April, a couple of neighbours in the hard-hit community of Cumberland, located in Ottawa’s east end, pooled their resources to buy an aqua dam.

The large rubber tube fills with floodwater to provide a protective barrier, but it’s not cheap.

The neighbours spent $70,000 to purchase the aqua dam and the investment appears to have paid off, as the homes remained relatively dry with only minor flood damage in the basements.

“The barricade seems to be holding up very well,” Genevieve Landry told CTV News Ottawa of the aqua dam they purchased.

The aqua dam also appears to be more convenient, only taking approximately 45 minutes to fill a 30-metre section.

The Cumberland residents are not the only ones trying out the rubber tubes. The province of Manitoba spent millions of dollars on 300 aqua dams to use during the devastating floods there in 2011. Arranged side-by-side, the rubber tubes would have covered nine kilometres of land.

The city of Courtenay, B.C., located on the east coast of Vancouver Island, bought its first aqua dam in 2015.

“It’s probably, compared to some of the other things we could do, a much lower cost, and if it works, a beneficial sort of system,” Mayor Larry Jangula said.

Back in Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson said it’s up to the province to purchase protective flood barrier equipment, such as aqua dams.

On the national level, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale entertained the idea while visiting the aqua dam in Cumberland.

“It obviously seems to have performed remarkably well for one particular neighbourhood so yes, we need to look at all of those possible innovations for the future,” he told reporters last week.

Landry said she welcomes the government taking inspiration from the aqua dam she purchased with her neighbour.

“Clearly, our government or authorities are seeing this as a priority as an urgency,” she said.",2019-05-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['told', 'ottawa', 'water', 'future', 'tubes', 'sandbags', 'preventative', 'canada', 'rubber', 'aqua', 'relatively', 'flood', 'dams', 'tools', 'flooding', 'dam', 'exploring']",Canada,news article,English
399,DR-2021-000054-SOM,"IDPs washed out by rain and floods struggle for food, shelter in Somalia’s Bakool region - Radio Ergo",https://radioergo.org/en/2021/05/08/idps-washed-out-by-rain-and-floods-struggle-for-food-shelter-in-somalias-bakool-region/,"(ERGO) – Habibo Mohamed Duwane’s family has been sleeping under a tree for the past two weeks after their flimsy hut in Gargaar internal displacement camp in El Barde, in southern Somalia’s Bakool region, collapsed in heavy rain.

“The whole hut came down after it rained from 9pm to 4 am in the morning. We are in great hardship and we haven’t managed to get a place to shelter from the rain,” said Habibo.

Habibo, whose husband is jobless, earns about a dollar a day from the sale of firewood, which she collects and carries on her back from the forest. She manages to cook once a day for the six children.

They have lived in the camp for four years since losing all their 75 goats in the drought in 2016-2017 in their village of Kahan Dhuure, 50 km away from El Barde.

The Gu’ rainfall has badly affected 245 of the 500 IDP families living in three camps, two of which are on the outskirts of El Barde.

Hasno Mohamoud Dhalow, a widowed mother of seven in Bananay IDP camp, 10 km from El Barde, told Radio Ergo she has been sheltering under a tree after flooding washed away their shelter and belongings.

“Our cooking pots and cups were washed away by the floods, we only managed to salvage the rugs which were soaked. But they were also washed away after we placed them out in the sun to dry,” she said.

Hasno has been buying food on credit from local shops for the past year. The shops stopped giving her credit in February after she accumulated $623 in debt. She now begs food from the market to feed her children.

“Some of the shop owners have forgiven me the debt, but they said they won’t give me any more credit. But there are those who are asking for their money daily,” she said.

Hasno migrated from the rural area of Beledweyne in Hiran region after their farm dried up due to the severe drought of 2011-2012, which destroyed the livelihoods of many farmers in the country.

Ali Mohamed Abdi, the chairman of Gargaar IDP camp, informed Radio Ergo that 145 families have been left without shelter by the floods.

“We ask well-wishers to assist these families with food, tents to shelter and even utensils,” he said.

He noted that the IDP families depended on humanitarian aid, but since the outbreak of COVID19 no assistance has been provided to the destitute families.",2021-05-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['away', 'region', 'washed', 'idps', 'floods', 'credit', 'camp', 'shelter', 'food', 'ergo', 'somalias', 'idp', 'struggle', 'families', 'bakool', 'el', 'rain']",Somalia,news article,English
426,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Building back better from COVID-19 and building lasting peace across Africa - Mirage News,https://www.miragenews.com/building-back-better-from-covid-19-and-building-563106/,"Thank you, State Councillor Wang, for convening this timely debate.

As we’ve heard today, this devastating pandemic presents fresh challenges to building a lasting peace across the African continent. The virus indeed has disproportionately impacted those affected by conflict, particularly women, children, refugees and internally displaced persons.

The challenges of recovery are numerous and interconnected. And that’s why we must work together through a comprehensive approach across human rights, peace, security and development.

The UK has worked with all our international partners for equitable access to COVID vaccines for people around the world. Under our G7 presidency, the G7 has doubled contributions to COVAX, and we’re proud to be one of the largest bilateral donors, committing $770 million.

More than 160 million people are at risk of being excluded from these vaccination campaigns because of instability and conflict. A multilateral approach is the only viable way to ensure that rapid, equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, including in conflict affected areas through vaccination ceasefires.

However, as we consider pandemic recovery, we need to look beyond vaccines and consider how to ensure everyone – particularly women, girls, the young, the excluded – has the opportunity to build their potential. This requires increased access to healthcare and ending preventable deaths. It requires quality education, which is why the UK is part of and is indeed the largest global donor to the Global Partnership for Education, reaching 24 million children since 2015 – the majority of which are in Africa. We look forward to the Global Education Partnership’s replenishment Summit in July with our Kenyan friends, and we call on all countries to step up their efforts in this regard.

Addressing health and education shortcomings will reduce poverty, but we must also address the undeniable links between poverty and conflict. By 2030, 80 per cent of the world’s extreme poor will be living in fragile states. Climate change will continue to magnify this trend, driving food insecurity, drought and exacerbating conflict. That’s why we’ve already pledged over $15 billion of international climate finance over the next five years.

There’s a chance to support Africa not only to recover from the pandemic, but rebuild better than before. Unleashing the potential women and young people is central to this. Health and education and climate support not only will change lives for the better, but it will only do so if it’s not undermined by conflict.

So we must address the underlying grievances that cause people to take up arms. Development gains and fragile peace can be lost if large parts of the population are marginalised or human rights are not respected. That’s why in Somalia, for example, the UK places such importance of promoting full, equal and meaningful participation of women and community leaders in elections and also in peace processes.

That’s why ending horrendous levels of sexual and gender based violence that we’re witnessing in Tigray is so, so urgent.

Peace can only be built from the foundations of strong institutions, the rule of law and open, inclusive societies. The UN and African Union are working stronger together than ever before. Early interventions, including by the African Union, will need to be coupled with long-term engagement and development programmes by the UN and its partners.

We’ve seen this in Sudan, where Prime Minister Hamdok continues to make progress towards peace, prosperity and democracy.

In Mali, the UK is supporting UN stabilisation efforts and increasing the meaningful participation of women in the peace process through our peacekeeping deployment, and also by working with UN agencies to strengthen civil-military cooperation.

The UK also strongly supports the sustaining peace agenda, which builds an inclusive cross-pillar approach to peacebuilding that draws on expertise of the whole UN system. We’re proud to support the Peacebuilding Commission and Peacebuilding Fund, to which the UK has been a top donor, having donated £220 million since its inception.

To conclude, there is more to do if we’re to reduce the dangers that poverty, marginalisation and the pandemic pose to African peace and development, and global stability more generally. We need countries to come together to support an integrated approach to post-pandemic recovery, because only by working together can we address the underlying drivers of conflicts and achieve a lasting peace for Africa – a peace we all want.",2021-05-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['conflict', 'africa', 'support', 'pandemic', 'lasting', 'approach', 'education', 'women', 'global', 'african', 'building', 'covid19', 'better', 'peace', 'uk']",Somalia,news article,English
178,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Egypt: These walls can speak – Cairo's Mohamed Mahmoud graffiti - Amnesty International,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/11/egypt-these-walls-can-speak-cairo-s-mohamed-mahmoud-murals/,"During more than three decades of Hosni Mubarak’s rule, the walls lining Cairo’s streets stood in stark silence, obscuring from view arbitrary detentions, torture and countless other human rights violations.

But after his ousting in early 2011, some of the walls became a canvas for popular expression as artists inspired by the “25 January Revolution” unleashed a creative uprising of their own in an area near Tahrir Square, the main focal point of the protests.

Ever since, the capital’s Mohamed Mahmoud Street – one of the main arteries leading from the Interior Ministry into Tahrir Square – has effectively become an open-air gallery showcasing street art about a wide range of social issues.

Graffiti became increasingly popular after the “25 January Revolution”, and colourful murals began to appear across Cairo. Mohamed Mahmoud Street has become the centre of this activity. Its walls depict a plethora of the issues still affecting daily life in the new Egypt – the more than 12,000 unfair military trials of civilians, the battle against the sexual harassment of women, and abuse by the security forces of peaceful protesters.

It has also become a bitter reminder of the need for accountability for the 17-month rule of the military council that replaced Mubarak. During this period more than 120 protesters were killed as a direct result of unnecessary and excessive use of force by the security forces – more than 50 of them on Mohamed Mahmoud Street itself.

For six days starting on 19 November 2011 Egypt’s riot police, the Central Security Forces (CSF), violently suppressed protests in Mohamed Mahmoud Street, leaving 51 people dead.

The protests started after the security forces violently suppressed a sit-in of those killed or injured in the uprising in nearby Tahrir Square. Clashes erupted and images of dead bodies of protesters left on a pile of refuse were aired on television. Protesters flooded into Tahrir Square and nearby Mohamed Mahmoud Street.

At the time, Amnesty International blasted what it called a “brutal and heavy-handed response to protests [that] bears all the hallmarks of the Mubarak era”.

The paintings that sprang up in the wake of that violence took on an ever-deeper significance for Egyptians, as they criticized the then-ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces for ongoing abuses and clamoured for change as elections approached.

Today, they are a reminder of how little has changed, and how much needs to be done to hold the security forces to account. Despite the scale of the violence, only one CSF officer is facing trial. Meanwhile, 379 protesters are being tried – it remains to be seen whether they will benefit from a recent presidential amnesty.

Although the Egyptian authorities have on several occasions attempted to paint over the murals, many remain as a testament to the tumult and triumph during and after the “25 January Revolution”, as well as a memorial to the dozens who were killed in Mohammed Mahmoud a year ago.

“The concrete barriers along Mohammed Mahmoud Street were meant to block freedom of assembly. Today, they serve as a whole new outlet for freedom of expression – the creative criticism of the authorities,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Programme Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.

“A year after the protests that left such a deep impact on Egypt, many of these colourful murals remain not just as a memorial, but as a vital chronicle of the historic changes still taking place in the country. They serve as a daily reminder that the events of November 2011 still need to be addressed – and the need for accountability for the abuses of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces.”

1058,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Beyond sandbags: Quebec looks for ways to limit future flood damage - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-flooding-future-1.5107822,"Standing in the wreckage-strewn yard of the home he's rented for the past six years, Alain Robert has had enough.

""I'm going up in the mountains,"" Robert said Tuesday in Sainte-Marie, in Quebec's Beauce region.

""I won't have to deal with this anymore. There comes a time when you have to take a decision and move to higher ground. Forget about the river, and start all over again.""

Climate change means floods like those that have devastated parts of Quebec this spring are likely to become increasingly common — and everything from viewing riverfront property as prime real estate to the way bridges are constructed will need to be re-examined.

For a tenant like Robert, it's easy enough to walk away.

For people whose dreams and life savings are tied up in a home built on a flood plain, leaving home for good is a tougher sell.

Enticement to leave

Quebec Premier François Legault tried to make that decision a little easier earlier this week, when he toured Pointe-Gatineau, a flood-damaged neighbourhood of Gatineau on the Ottawa River across from Canada's capital.

Legault said the province will offer a cumulative total of $100,000 to any home damaged by flooding — effectively putting a lifetime limit on government compensation. Alternatively, the province will offer residents up to $200,000 to give up their homes.

Quebec Premier François Legault said the province will limit the lifetime compensation it will pay for flooded properties to $100,000 — and give homeowners the option of walking away and pocketing up to $200,000. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

While Legault stopped short of saying there would be any mandatory evictions, the increased likelihood of flooding means living by a river will be problematic over the long term, said Pascale Biron, a professor of geography, planning and environment at Concordia University.

""They are flooded, and that's costing a lot of money for all of us, because at the end of the day we compensate as a society,"" Biron said.

""In addition, it's preventing water from being stored naturally in these areas. So really, encouraging these people to move from these critical areas will be beneficial to the people living downstream.""

The idea is to provide ""freedom space for rivers"" in the form of parks or wetlands, she said. The term is used by geographers to denote an area naturally equipped to absorb flood waters.

Flooding vs. property taxes

Experts have for years been warning about the potential consequences of building on flood plains. But municipalities have been reluctant to shut down a source of property tax revenue.

Now, though, it appears a shift is underway.

Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said Tuesday her city and surrounding municipalities are looking at ensuring neighbourhoods are more ""resilient"" when it comes to flooding.

""We're looking at water parks and doing landscaping in a certain way,"" she said. ""But it's not a one-fit-for-all, let's put it that way. We need to be cautious about that.""

At the federal level, Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne said he is willing to fast-track reviews of projects that could help communities in Quebec and elsewhere deal with floods as part of an offer to provinces and cities.

Rethinking the riverside

Daniel Oligny, the head of a consulting firm that helps municipalities with emergency preparedness services, agreed towns and cities were readier this year for potential flooding. Critical questions remain, however.

""We will have to redefine the way we manage the urbanization of our cities and communities,"" he said.

""We will have to think, what is our relationship with the rivers? Where can I live while seeing the river without being on the river?""

While planning has been better this time, Biron said the government still needs to come up with a clear approach to flooding, overseen by a single ministry.

Public Security Geneviève Guilbault, surrounded by mayors and local MNAs from the Beauce region, toured the flood-stricken town of Sainte-Marie, Que., Tuesday. (CBC)

Right now, the ministries of Public Security, Environment and Municipal Affairs all play a role.

""It's more difficult to have a coherent plan when you are splitting the various tasks in relation to flood preparedness,"" Biron said.

Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault said the Quebec government will explore all options, after the water recedes.

""It's certainly not today that we'll be making those sorts of decisions,"" she said Tuesday, on a tour of the flood damage in Sainte-Marie.

""But if there are things that can be done, obviously we'll do them,"" said Guilbault. ""It's 2019, and we are concerned about the health and safety of our citizens — and avoiding floods in the first place would be the first step.""",2019-04-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['ways', 'water', 'future', 'flooding', 'biron', 'river', 'quebec', 'sandbags', 'floods', 'way', 'flood', 'damage', 'robert', 'looks', 'limit', 'security']",Canada,news article,English

At first, it looked like a gigantic shadow in the sky. Before Bhawan Rana, the village head of Raini village in the northern Indian hill state of Uttarakhand, could understand what was happening, he saw heaps of dirt rolling down the hills.

“That was when I realised what had happened, and sounded an alert for evacuation,” Rana told VICE World News, recounting how he witnessed the Himalayan glacier burst on Sunday.

A chunk of the Himalayan Nanda Devi glacier broke off, triggering an avalanche and flash floods that destroyed two hydropower plants. At least 28 people have died and more than 200 are missing.

Rana and his family live in a village about 50 meters away from one of the projects. He is part of an indigenous community that had sounded an alarm over the project in 2019 by filing a public interest litigation. Their petition, a copy of which has been shared with VICE World News, highlighted the possible damage to the ecologically sensitive Nanda Devi biosphere park, and the potential impact the plant’s blasting and stone crushing activities would have on the environment.

“Our biggest fear came true,” said Rana. Many members of his community have retreated into the nearby forest, fearing the flood situation getting worse.

“Officials running the hydropower plant cut vast areas of trees and would dump the run-off mud into the river, instead of disposing it upstream as per environmental norms,” Sangram Singh, a contract worker from the community who was one of the petitioners, told VICE World News. Singh said locals were most worried about landslides and flash floods, following the 2013 Kedarnath disaster in the same area that killed 169 people. Roughly 4,000 are still missing and are presumed dead.

The court had asked local authorities to respond to the allegations raised in the litigation and investigate the effects of stone crushing activity on the environment, ultimately banning the use of explosives in the area.

“But despite our protests and alarms, they did not pay heed to us and allowed the company to operate,” said Singh, adding that blasting activities at the hydropower plant could have over time contributed to the melting glacier. Singh also speculated the presence of a radioactive weapon near the glacier that may have caused it to burst.

In July, 52 environmental organisations and activists across 12 Himalayan states of India, drafted a letter to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, highlighting how regulatory decisions and industrial projects could cause ecological damage in the world’s youngest mountain range. “The government has classified the Himalayan region under the climate vulnerability index. It means that any project in the region would exacerbate landslides, groundwater drying up, and glaciers melting,” Manshi Asher, an activist from Himdhara Environmental Research and Action Collective, and one of the 52 signatories to the letter, told VICE World News in September.

Meanwhile, experts speculate that the glacial burst is an effect of climate change. “We identified 26 lakes which had the potential to form flash floods in a 2019 study,” Anil Kulkarni, a glaciologist and professor from the Indian Institute of Science, told VICE World News. “When we ran our model on the Nanda Devi glacier following the disaster, we realised that a huge depression had formed near the glacier’s terminus (the point where it ends). Under appropriate pressure, this huge lake could have broken out and caused the massive floods.”

For communities from the Raini village, the only way forward from the destruction they have witnessed is through financial compensation and responsible development of the region that follows environmental norms. “We saw the apathy of nature, and lost many members of our community in the process,” said Singh. “We can’t let this happen again.”",2021-02-10 08:00:00+00:00,"['raised', 'glacier', 'vice', 'near', 'village', 'himalayan', 'told', 'world', 'deadly', 'flash', 'following', 'burst', 'singh', 'ago', 'alarm', 'locals']",India,news article,English

Winemakers Jeffrey Stambor (center) and Trevor Durling see double as they taste the Rarity.

Tireless adventurer W. Blake Gray tries some new things in the morning – and likes one of them.

I had a $1000 bottle of wine for breakfast. I'm going to tell you all about the wine: how it was made, what it tastes like, and why it worries me about Napa Valley's most iconic wine. But I want to linger on that image for a moment: omelets and a $1000 bottle of wine.

The wine has the most basic name possible for a $1000 Napa Cab: ""Rarity"". It's as if a brothel were named ""Sex"": the name tells you exactly what you're overpaying for.

How did I end up having it at breakfast? I was invited by Treasury Wine Estates to come to a hotel room to pay homage to the $1000 wine in a one-on-one tasting with the winemakers. The hotel's location was inconvenient; I didn't want to go. But the wine sounded so mockable: a $1000 wine called ""Rarity"", of which 1500 magnums were made (thus making it more like a brothel named ""Love"".) I had a big problem: I wanted to taste it and make fun of it, but I didn't feel like schlepping across town. I am that lazy.

So I asked if there was any way the winemakers could meet me in my neighborhood. They could! They set up a breakfast tasting at a restaurant I had never visited whose signature breakfast item is called ""millionaire's bacon"" ($9 for two slices).

I saw the check after breakfast: Treasury paid more than $250 for two winemakers, myself, and two PR people. For breakfast. Though to be fair, that did include corkage. I guess when you're tasting a $1000 magnum, it's appropriate.

The wine, full name Beaulieu Vineyard ""Rarity"" Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2013, is a special selection of 10 barrels that had been harvested and vinified to go into Beaulieu's Georges de Latour Private Reserve. That wine is the gem of Beaulieu's portfolio, and along with Penfolds Grange, could be a star of the whole 70-plus-brand Treasury portfolio.

But it's an important wine from a prior generation. After Prohibition, Georges de Latour Private Reserve was the first premium wine made in Napa Valley, selling for the unheard-of price of $1.50 in 1940. Before Robert Mondavi opened his winery in 1966, if you wanted to taste the best wine Napa Valley could make, it was either Inglenook or Beaulieu's Georges de Latour Private Reserve.

However, the wine lost its luster in the 1980s as a succession of corporate owners ramped up production and pinched pennies on equipment. Longtime winemaker Joel Aiken eventually managed to convince then-owners Diageo to take the flagship wine more seriously, but by then Napa Valley had moved on to a different model of expensive wine based not on legacy, but on, wait for it ... rarity.

Flash forward to 2013. Beaulieu winemaker Jeffrey Stambor, who has been at the company since 1989, calls 2013 one of the best vintages he remembers in Napa. California's five-year drought was in its early stages and, in 2013, it provided just the right amount of stress for the vines. A mild winter led to an early start to the growing season and an early harvest. Stambor was already fermenting many of the grapes for the Georges de Latour Private Reserve in barrels instead of tanks, meaning he had many small lots to blend together.

""As we got through tasting the lots in barrel, we put together a few A++ blends,"" Stambor told me over his breakfast of Millionaire's Benedict ($17). ""One of those sub-blends just showed unbelievable concentration and intensity. There had always been a hesitation to produce anything above the Georges de Latour. That's the flagship of the winery.""

The Rarity has comfotably assumed its place in the pantheon of Beaulieu Vineyard's wines.

But maybe Stambor knew which way the wind was blowing. In 2015, Diageo sold its wine properties, including Beaulieu Vineyard, to Treasury Wine Estates. Treasury is a big public corporation, but it's different from Diageo in a crucial way. Diageo is a spirits company that owned some wineries. Treasury is a wine company. Wine companies understand modern wine marketing and Treasury, which has owned Beringer since 2000, is no stranger to Napa Valley. Even if the name ""Rarity"" is a blunt instrument, it's the key if you want to sell a bottle of wine for $1000 instead of $100 – and why wouldn't you? That's $900 extra profit.

""I went ahead and bottled one of those sublots,"" Stambor said. The group of barrels included one of Petit Verdot that had been fermented separately; Georges de Latour Cabernet often includes small percentages of the other Bordeaux varieties.

The true meaning of Rarity might be not the size of production: 1500 bottles, all magnums, isn't that rare. In fact, you can buy it right now fairly easily; try that with Screaming Eagle Sauvignon Blanc. No, the true meaning of ""rarity"" is the frequency. Stambor said Beaulieu has made four special bottlings in its entire post-Prohibition history; the most recent was in 1990. All four were field blends of varieties like Petite Sirah, Charbono, Alicante Bouschet and Valdiguie. None were Cabernet-based. He also said that he currently has no more Rarity in the production pipeline.

""The danger is in calling out something as special when it really isn't,"" Stambor said. ""I think there's potential in 2016, but we'll have to wait and see.""

In fact, that won't be Stambor's decision. He is leaving the winery in June after 28 years and has not yet decided on his next winemaking post, only that ""you need a new challenge once in a while"". His replacement, Trevor Durling, also came to breakfast. Durling had been winemaker at Provenance Vineyards, another property recently sold by Diageo to Treasury, and thus has worked together with Stambor with some of the same vineyard sources for a decade. Durling also was delighted to sample some millionaire's bacon, which made me understand why the winemakers were willing to accommodate my request to meet across town. Expense account!

Now, I like Stambor, having interviewed him before, and I like breakfast, but I honestly did not expect to like this wine. It just sounded so cheesy: a wine called ""Rarity,"" which is not a single-vineyard wine, and in the original PR outreach email it wasn't even noted that it was Cabernet. It sounded like a marketing pitch I got the same week from a Swedish guy who claims to be making the world's best rosé, but opted not to let me taste it because Wine-Searcher isn't Hollywood enough. I thought I would go, sip and spit the Rarity but not drink any, have an $18 breakfast entree, and come home and make fun of the whole experience. (Each bottle comes in a thick case heavier than a microwave oven lined with what the PR person told me is a ""leather-like substance."")

The twist is that I ended up loving the wine and drinking a glass and a half of it before 11 am, so I can no longer claim to be a guy who never drinks Cabernet before noon. And I hated my $18 breakfast entree; I left it barely touched. So I had $1000 wine for breakfast, and yet came home to make fun of the whole experience because that's what I do.

Rarity is – no joke – terrific. It's fresh and lively, two words I don't lead with often enough when writing about Napa Cabernet, but it's also intense and full-flavored with dark fruit and long. The sappy tannins give it an interesting mouthfeel: they're not rough on the palate, instead giving a muscular yet brief impression like an octopus grabbing your arm and letting go. It's 15.5 percent alcohol but it's not heavy at all, and, especially because I was hungry and my $18 breakfast was lousy, I reached for the decanter to pour myself more of it, which I hardly ever do at tastings. And I didn't spit after the first tasting-notes tastes. It's yummy. Maybe ""Rarity"" actually is ""Love"".

The downside is – and it pains me to say this – the 2013 Georges de Latour Private Reserve wasn't as delicious as I'm accustomed to. It's fine, but the tannins need time to open and it doesn't have the lively freshness of Rarity. I had to ask if it would be better with the 12 barrels of Rarity added to it.

""I don't think so,"" Stambor said. ""It takes out 250 cases of premium wine. The impact of producing this wine is greater than the loss to the Georges de Latour.""

Mathematics note: Stambor made 6500 cases of Georges de Latour in 2013 (down from 17,000 at its worst, excessive, corporate peak.) I'm sure that even without the Rarity barrels, it's better than the worst years. The barrels that made up Rarity would have been less than four percent of Georges de Latour. This is the way Napa Cabernets are made and sold now. Treasury has taken Beaulieu Vineyard at long last into the 21st century. But I say this with a pang of regret.

Nonetheless, Wednesday was a good day. I had a $1000 wine for breakfast. Tomorrow it's probably cereal.",2017-04-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['wine', 'stambor', 'beaulieu', 'love', 'breakfast', 'sex', 'rarity', 'treasury', 'napa', 'latour', '1000', 'georges']",Ghana,news article,English
1577,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Solution for Kenya's flooding ahead of rainy season â?? New Business Ethiopia - New Business Ethiopia,https://newbusinessethiopia.com/nbe-blog/solution-for-kenyas-flooding-ahead-of-rainy-season/,"The annual rainy season in March â?? June, in conjunction with climate change, is a major concern for Kenyans across the country. Dirty flood waters rendering the roads unusable, and submerging residential areas, are expected again this year, and experts warn that better waste management, urban planning and warning systems are needed to help protect citizens.



So says Simon Thomas, an international consultant and board member of Megapipes Solutions Limited which provides sustainable stormwater, sanitation and flood alleviation solutions throughout Kenya and East Africa. â??The lack of adequate drainage and sanitation systems in Kenya has been well documented, however, not enough attention is being paid to how the sewerage systems have been designed and set up, or where excess water ends up,â? he says. â??Compounding the problem, there are multiple settlements that do not have adequate sewerage and sanitation services that edge onto Nairobiâ??s three main rivers, namely Mathare, Ngong and Nairobi.â?







According to him, citizens who live in flood-prone regions are in danger of losing their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives. â??And itâ??s always those living under the poverty line that are most vulnerable and need the most help and support in the event of such a disaster.â?

He says in the past few years, many regions in Kenya have had above-normal rainfall, resulting in flooding across the country. â??To lessen the potential impact of floods, the government has to map out and implement strategic plans to address flood disaster risk. These plans must pinpoint the projects and initiatives that are needed to manage and prevent floods.â?

Currently, many densely populated formal and informal settlements in Kenya employ open drainage channels, which are used to discharge rainwater, to address the problem. However, Thomas says while drains can help prevent flooding, when they are left open, they can easily become clogged with solid and domestic waste, making the problem far worse.

â??Moreover, multiple environmental hazards go hand in hand with open drainage channels, including groundwater contamination, a slew of easily preventable diseases, a lessening of soil productivity, and the contamination of vegetables and crops.â?

Unfortunately, building exposed drainage systems has been around for decades and has become the norm. â??Various regions in Kenya are prone to flooding, and at the same time, are notorious for blocked drainage systems. Also, town planners, do not seem to grasp the fact that open drains use land, which takes away space for pavements and walkways, forcing pedestrians, onto the streets and putting them in danger of being hit by motorists.â?

The bottom line? Thomas says that if Kenya is to achieve its Millennium Development Goal for increasing access to water and sanitation this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.







Thomas says a wider implementation of properly engineered and sustainable drainage initiatives is required, which mitigate the effects of large amounts of rainfall coming down in urban areas. While other solutions exist, including putting in additional drainage ditches, these are unable to cope with significant rainfall or extreme weather.

However, itâ??s not all doom and gloom. â??At Megapipes, we understand there is an urgent requirement for better systems that would be able to cope with larger volumes of waste and stormwater, particularly in fast-growing urban environments. With this in mind, we conducted studies into new large diameter pipe technology, already widely used with big success in other parts of the world. Megapipes Solutions made the visionary decision to opt for Weholite HDPE structured wall pipes, manholes, chambers and tanks, which address Kenyaâ??s need for sustainable water systems.â?",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['solutions', 'sanitation', 'drainage', 'ahead', 'kenyas', 'business', 'ethiopia', 'systems', 'thomas', 'open', 'season', 'solution', 'water', 'kenya', 'urban', 'flooding', 'waste', 'rainy']",Kenya,news article,English

RATNAPURA, Sri Lanka, Mar 28 2017 (IPS) - As the mercury rises higher, Kamakandalagi Leelavathi delves deeper into the lush green mass of the tea bushes. The past few afternoons there have been thunderstorms. So the 55-year-old tea picker in Uda Houpe tea garden of Sri Lanka’s Hatton region is rushing to complete her day’s task before the rain comes: harvesting 22 kgs of tea leaves.

“The rain is very unpredictible. Now there are downpours but it has been very dry the past few months,” says the daily wager who owns a one-acre marginal farm.

Yet at the Uda Houpe tea garden, the situation is much better, says Daurkarlagi Taranga, Leelavathi’s daughter and fellow tea farmer. “We have not been affected as badly as others. Here, the bushes are still full (of leaves) and the ground is moist thanks to the techniques we use,” she says.

These techniques are assorted green actions taken by small tea planters to manage their farmland in an eco-friendly way, explains Alluth Wattage Saman, manager of the Uda Houpe estate. The most important of these actions is minimising use of synthetic weed killer (herbicide), widely viewed as the main reason behind the degrading health of soil and tea plants in the region.

Climate threat to a lucrative sector

The tea sector of Sri Lanka is 153 years old and remain the largest industry today, providing employment to 2.5 million people. According to the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the industry counts for 62 percent of all agricultural exports and brings home 1.6 billion dollars in foreign currency each year. Contributing to this huge business is a 400,000-strong small tea farmer community.

However, the lucrative tea economy of the island nation has been witnessing growing environmental challenges – the biggest of them being severe land degradation.

According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), there is high rate of land degradation across the tea growing region in Sri Lanka. The biggest reason is that farmers here have used synthetic weed killer on the plantations for several decades.

They also paid little attention to protecting the water sources and biodiversity around the plantations. This has gradually affected the health of the soil, decreasing its fertility level, making it more acidic and also causing soil erosion.

While the degradation has affected the entire industry, the livelihoods and food security of the small tea growers are particularly threatened, says Lalith Kumar, project manager at the Tea Small Holding Development Authority (TSHDA) in Ratnapura, a region that produces over 70 percent of Sri Lanka’s tea.

Greening the Small Farms

The TSHDA is a government agency working with small tea growers in the country. According to Kumar, there are 150 small tea farms (less than 10 acres of land) in the Ratnapura region alone which provide livelihood to about 100,000 farmers. Climate change has worsened the situation with recurring droughts, erratic rainfall, and increasing soil erosion and acidification.

As a result, tea bushes are withering and moisture from the topsoil is evaporating, leaving the soil hardened and plant roots weak and damaged.

To help the tea farmers deal with this, TSHDA is currently working with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) on a project to minimise herbicide use in the small tea farms and reverse the processes of degradation by sustainably managing the land.

According to a document by Global Environment Facility (GEF), the funder of the 2.9 million project, the goal is to “improve farm management practices, so that existing production land becomes more productive and forests, rivers, streams and other biologically important land situated on or adjacent to tea production areas are protected from negative impacts.”

A major step taken by the TSHDA is to train the farmers to manage their land in a sustainable way with minimum or no herbicides.

“We have started to train small farm managers in sustainable land management techniques that are simple, yet effective,” Kumar said. A lot of weeds grow around the tea bush, but only some of them are harmful.

“We train them in identifying the weeds and removing the harmful ones either by uprooting or cutting them at the roots. The weeds are then used as a bed of mulch, applied in between the two rows of tea plants. This helps retain the moisture on the land,“ he explained.

Training the Community

Saman, the manager of the Uda Haupe, is one of the 300 small tea growers who have been trained by TSHDA so far. It was an informal, hands-on training, reveals Saman, which included a day-long visit to a progressive and sustainably managed farm – the Hapugastenne tea estate.

There Saman saw small farmers like him managing their land without any synthetic weed killer or pesticides. He also learned to use organic manure, protect the water sources like natural springs within the plantation, as well the shedy trees, so birds and other animals can also survive. Finally, he learnt that the yield of the farm had increased almost by 60 percent since they adopted those techniques.

The visit, says the tea planter, helped him realize “small steps can bring bring big changes in a farm”.

The result has been encouraging: “I earlier spent 35,000 on herbicide every year, now I am saving that amount. My overall profit has gone up to 75,000 rupees,” says Saman, who has shared the newfound knowledge with his workers.

Some Unplugged Gaps

Saman and other small tea farmers in the area like Leelavathi sell their harvest to Kahawatte Plantation, a tea estate owned by corporate tea giant Dilmah. Early this month, the plantation received a Rainforest Alliance certificcation which recognizes that the estate maintains sustainability standards all along its supply chain, including the farms from where it buys the tea. This has already boosted the price of the estate’s produce, but suppliers like Saman are not aware of either the certification or its economic benefits such as higher market value.

“Nobody has told us about this,” Saman says.

Others want the government to help them with monetary incentives to better deal with climatic challenges.

At present, TSHDA offers a 50 percent subsidy to farmers who want to do a replantation on their farm – a complex and costly process that involves complete uprooting of all the tea plants, re-preparing the soil and replanting the saplings.

This is done when the yield in the farm drops dramatically due to either age (normally 30 years) or severe degradation of the land that cripples productivity. However, there are no other subsidies or incentives provided to the farmers right now for adopting sustainable land management – a policy that small tea growers like Leelavathi would like to see change.

“Since the use of the mulch, I began to save 700 rupees every month on herbicide and my total income rose to 15,000. But because of the growing droughts, I have to use most of it on fertilizer. If the government gives a subsidy, it will be very helpful. Or else I may have to migrate to another estate to earn more,” she says.",2017-03-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'saman', 'land', 'farm', 'managers', 'small', 'sri', 'uda', 'lankas', 'sustainable', 'turn', 'tea', 'soil', 'tshda']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

By Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, Emelie Chace-Donahue and Colin P. Clarke*

(FPRI) — When Islamist insurgents laid siege to the coastal town of Palma in gas-rich northeastern Mozambique on March 24, leaving dozens dead, including several foreigners, the story received international attention. The insurgency in Mozambique is being waged by a group that calls itself al-Shabaab—not to be confused with the Somali group of the same name—and is affiliated with the Islamic State’s (ISIS) Central Africa Province. Despite the recent flood of attention al-Shabaab in Mozambique has received, the insurgency is not new.

A local religious group called Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jamaa (ASWJ) turned toward militancy around 2015, eventually renaming itself (in whole or in part) al-Shabaab. The militant group has engaged in insurgent fighting against Mozambique’s government since late 2017. Al-Shabaab has not been particularly outspoken about the goals of its insurgency, but it has articulated a desire to establish rule by a hardline version of Islamic law in Cabo Delgado. The group’s aims appear to center on undermining and degrading the Mozambican government’s military and political authority, gaining local support, and combating foreign interests in Cabo Delgado.

Religious and ethnic tensions, alongside poor regional economic conditions, are also reportedly prominent factors motivating the violence. The militants are believed by local leaders and community members to be primarily “disaffected youth motivated by complex political, economic, and social factors including feelings of marginalization and disagreements with religious authorities in Cabo Delgado,” according to the most recent U.S. Department of State Report on International Religious Freedom.

Mozambique is a Christian-majority country, but around 18% of citizens are Muslim, primarily residing in the north, including in Cabo Delgado province, where most of the violence has occurred. Fundamentalist forms of Islam have spread in the country over the past several decades and have largely been at odds with local political and religious authorities. Additionally, the Mwani ethnic group—a Muslim-majority ethnic group that has a large presence in Cabo Delgado—has long viewed itself as politically and economically marginalized by the Christian-majority Makonde ethnic group in the region. These religious and ethnic tensions have converged with low levels of economic opportunity in Cabo Delgado, which is considered one of the poorest regions in Mozambique.

Origins of Militant Activity in Mozambique

Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jamaa was founded by Mozambican and Tanzanian religious leaders with links to Salafist circles in Tanzania, Kenya, and Somalia. Various local sources say the group’s early leadership included locals who studied religious doctrine and received military training in Tanzania, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia.

Early Influences and Recruitment. Accounts from locals note that one of ASWJ’s early influences was the teaching of Aboud Rogo Mohammed, an extremist cleric from Kenya designated by the United Nations for providing support to Somalia’s al-Shabaab. Rogo was killed in Kenya in 2012, but his influence lives on. ASWJ’s leaders reportedly gave lectures inspired by Rogo and distributed videos of his speeches, along with other militant propaganda. Some members of Mozambique’s al-Shabaab were followers of Rogo in Kenya who resettled in Mozambique after his death.

ASWJ’s leaders appear to have originally recruited poor or unemployed youth by offering them small loans. Recruits could invest their loans in any sector, including the illicit economy, to help them build wealth through business opportunities. ASWJ leaders were likely able to lure recruits into these business ventures by capitalizing on both “long-standing feelings of marginalization” and “issues of youth unemployment and poverty.”

Transition to Militancy. ASWJ began its transition toward militancy by mobilizing in mosques against established religious leaders, a pattern that can be discerned elsewhere in militant Salafist social mobilizations. ASWJ members reportedly began causing disruptions at mosques, criticizing local Muslims for not adequately abiding by Islamic law. Some members reportedly threatened to kill local religious leaders.

After these confrontations with local religious leaders, the group began to shift from a religious organization to a militant group. Around 2015, ASWJ leaders began setting up training camps in northern districts of Cabo Delgado and created a decision-making council that was reportedly responsible for crafting military strategy. Locals interviewed by the Mozambique-based Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Económicos say that the group began recruiting youth from Tanzania and the Great Lakes region. These foreign recruits trained locals in military techniques.

October 2017 marked ASWJ’s transition to being an overtly militant group. It launched a series of attacks against police posts, killing two officers and briefly overrunning the strategic port of Mocimboa da Praia. In the following months, the militants carried out arson attacks on villages in Cabo Delgado that killed and wounded several civilians. Locals reported that some members of the group sold off their stock and businesses around this time (much of which had been built using loans from ASWJ leaders) and left their homes to travel to Mocimboa da Praia. The group likely began referring to itself as al-Shabaab at this point. There are no indications that Mozambique’s al-Shabaab is affiliated with Somali militant group of the same name, but there have been some suggestions of a connection between militants in Mozambique and Somalia. For example, some locals reported that children who were members of the Mozambican group disappeared for several months leading up to the October 2017 attacks, traveling to Somalia during this period to “participate in jihad” and study the Islamic faith.

Escalation of the al-Shabaab Insurgency in Mozambique

Since its turn to overt militancy in 2017, al-Shabaab has grown into an established insurgency, in some places openly controlling territory.

Nascent Insurgency. The group operated as a nascent insurgency in Cabo Delgado through 2018. It carried out intermittent small-scale operations, an estimated 120 incidents that killed 38 people between January and November 2018. This initial phase of insurgency represented a building period.

The following year, al-Shabaab intensified the scale and scope of its operations, carrying out more than 150 attacks that killed over 450 people during the same reporting period. The reasons for the escalation in 2019 are not clear, but there are indications that the group began organizing with ISIS-linked militants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) around this time.

At the beginning of 2019, news reports began to suggest that al-Shabaab was organizing training and operations with the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a militant group that has been waging a decades-long insurgency in eastern DRC and Uganda. Mozambican authorities arrested several Ugandan militants (likely associated with ADF) who were suspected of involvement in attacks in Cabo Delgado. A few months later, in March 2019, regional news outlets reported that an ADF offshoot, Madinat Tawhid-wa-l-Muwahidin (MTM), had opened a cell in northern Mozambique.

Affiliation with ISIS. Clear indications of al-Shabaab and ADF’s affiliation with ISIS emerged around this time, though murkier indications of a connection between the two groups and ISIS had already surfaced in 2017-18, primarily in online forums and jihadist propaganda. In April 2019, ISIS announced the formation of the Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP) after claiming responsibility for an attack launched by ADF militants in the DRC. Not long after, in June 2019, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack perpetrated by al-Shabaab in Mozambique, thus formally incorporating al-Shabaab into ISCAP.

There remains a fair amount of uncertainty about the role being played by foreign ISIS actors in Mozambique and the DRC. However, it is clear that since becoming integrated into ISCAP, al-Shabaab has significantly stepped up its operations and has begun to overtake and control territory. In August 2020, it captured Mocimboa da Praia, where it has continued to exert control. Al-Shabaab’s attacks have also become increasingly frequent and brutal, often displaying trademark ISIS tactics like beheadings. Between January and November 2020, the group was responsible for over 400 violent incidents that left more than 1,300 people dead. This is a substantial increase compared to the same reporting period in previous years. Al-Shabaab’s assault against the city of Palma in March/April 2021 shows that the militant threat is enduring, and it seems, growing more dire by the week.

Al-Shabaab also has likely grown in size since becoming affiliated with ISIS. Though many members are local Mozambicans and Tanzanians, the group also includes foreign elements, which likely include foreigners who traveled to fight with the group, as well as those who resettled in Mozambique looking for work. For the most part, the group’s foreign members come from Somalia and the Great Lakes region. Some reports have claimed that individuals from the Middle East and South Asia are present as well, but local sources have mainly reported that the fighters speak local languages.

Factors Hospitable to Insurgency

Whether al-Shabaab in Mozambique will sustain its operational tempo remains to be seen, but several factors suggest that the conditions in Mozambique are favorable to a prolonged insurgency, including geography and terrain and weak security forces.

Geography & Terrain. Mozambique is located on the southeastern coast of Africa, and Cabo Delgado is its northernmost province, bordering Tanzania. Forests and islands in Cabo Delgado offer valuable opportunities to an insurgency. The region is covered by dense forests and shrublands, which have provided the militants cover from counterterrorism operations and air raids. One media outlet reported that local residents who had been abducted by militants and later escaped described the base where they had been held as “located amid vegetation so dense that the place is always dark, necessitating the permanent use of lamps and lanterns, even during the day.” Cabo Delgado’s islands, many of which are thinly inhabited or even uninhabited, have reportedly served as training bases and points from which the militants can strategically position themselves against security forces.

Counterterrorism & Security Forces. The Mozambique Defense and Security Forces are largely incapable of countering the insurgency, lacking both adequate resources and the capabilities to contain militant activity or protect civilians. Given these deficiencies, the government of Mozambique has contracted private military companies—Wagner Group (Russia) and Dyck Advisory Group (South Africa)—to provide paramilitary assistance, including aerial support. Self-defense militias have also reportedly tried to protect civilians. After the Palma siege, the African Union called for “urgent action” to quell the fighting.

Conclusion

Though much foreign interest in Mozambique is centered around Cabo Delgado’s natural resources, outside interest also focuses on regional stability and spillover violence. The South Africa Development Community, an inter-governmental organization of countries in the Southern Africa region (including Mozambique), called for regional action on Mozambique last year since the insurgency poses “a serious threat to regional peace and stability.” In September 2020, Mozambique asked the European Union for military training and other assistance.

At various points, the insurgents have targeted contractors associated with liquefied natural gas projects, and have moved in recent months to close in on areas where these companies operate. There is the potential for foreign involvement, especially after recent attacks, and the United States has roughly a dozen Green Berets in country to train the Mozambican security forces. There is the possibility for a prolonged insurgency that could draw foreign fighters to the region, with the potential to spread into neighboring countries.

571,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,UEFA Super Cup can serve as next step in Liverpool's untraditional route to Premier League glory - Ghanasoccernet.com,https://ghanasoccernet.com/uefa-super-cup-can-serve-as-next-step-in-liverpools-untraditional-route-to-premier-league-glory,"The Exploding Heads simulate the UEFA Super Cup of Liverpool vs. Chelsea in FIFA 19 style.

ISTANBUL -- Liverpool can win their sixth European trophy this century when they face Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup in Turkey on Wednesday, but another continental cup will only draw attention to the ongoing wait to fill the glaring void in the Anfield trophy cabinet.

European glory used to be the pinnacle, but for Liverpool, it has become a stepping stone towards ending the long journey back to the summit of English football.

Some will point out that a third Super Cup, to add to the two Champions League titles and a UEFA Cup (now Europa League) won since the turn of the millennium, would be adding too much weight to the European club's achievements, considering that it is widely regarded as no more important than the Community Shield. But you have to be in it to win it and Liverpool's European pedigree is such that every piece of continental silverware matters.

To put their haul into context, Chelsea have won three European trophies since 2000 (Champions League 1x and Europa League 2x), while Manchester United have won two (Champions League 1x and Europa League 1x).

The rest of Liverpool's domestic rivals have yet to get off the mark in Europe this century, but Manchester City, Arsenal and even Leicester City will point to their names on the Premier League trophy in order to dampen any sense of superiority from the red half of Merseyside.

And as Jurgen Klopp's players prepare to face Chelsea in Istanbul -- the city which hosted Liverpool's momentous 2005 Champions League triumph against AC Milan -- they will face Chelsea knowing that, whatever happens at Besiktas' Vodafone Park, the only trophy that truly matters this season is the one which continues to elude them.

Liverpool's Champions League success in Madrid last season, the club's sixth overall, more than made up for the disappointment of missing out on the Premier League title to Man City at the end of the most compelling title race for 20 years.

-- What's Liverpool's succession plan for Salah, Mane and Firmino

-- Where did you club fail in the transfer window

But it was also unusual for the fact that Liverpool emerged as European champions having gone so long without being crowned kings of their own country. It is now 29 years since Liverpool were champions of England and no Champions League winners have lifted the European Cup having been second best in their own domain for so long.

Sir Alex Ferguson once compared winning the Champions League with Manchester United to scaling a mountain, with key staging posts along the way. Winning a trophy, then winning the title, were crucial milestones for Ferguson's United team on their journey to the Champions League crown in 1999.

Most clubs win the Premier League before the Champions League but Liverpool will be hoping to reverse history and their 29-year drought.

Chelsea took a similar path before lifting the Champions League in 2012, while City now see winning the European Cup as the culmination of their growth since Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan's takeover of the club in 2008.

In trophy-winning terms, Liverpool ran before they could walk by lifting the European Cup at the end of last season, bypassing the traditional route to success in the competition.

Since 2000, only two Champions League winners have won the European Cup having failed to win their own domestic league during the five years prior to their success -- Liverpool in 2005 and Liverpool in 2019.

But despite adding to their European haul last season, the desperation for domestic glory remains unquenched and, in many ways, becoming European champions has added to the pressure and expectation for the long wait for the English title to end

Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley always described the English title as Liverpool's ""bread and butter."" Anything else on top of winning the league was viewed as a bonus or embellishment on what really mattered. By that logic, bread and butter has been in short supply at Anfield since 1990, though.

Canvass anyone with a Liverpool affiliation -- player, supporter, owner, manager -- who was in Madrid in June and you would be hard pressed to find anyone who would swap that night, and the European Cup, for the Premier League trophy.

Privately, however, there is a growing determination and desperation to scratch the 30-year itch at Anfield and win the title.And winning the Champions League, with the Super Cup potentially also on the way, only sharpens the focus on winning the one that continues to elude the club.

Klopp has urged everyone at Anfield to forget about the events of last season and concentrate only on what lies ahead. He has told his players to ""stay greedy"" and spoken of the Super Cup as a ""big one"" because of the prestige that comes with getting there in the first place.

But Liverpool need to use their Champions League triumph and Super Cup appearance as steps towards winning the Premier League, rather than regard them as the cherry on top of the cake. For Liverpool, the cake is still to be cooked, but last season showed how close they are to ending the long wait.

Victory in Istanbul, against a Premier League rival, will only consolidate the winning mentality that Klopp aims to develop at Anfield. But until they win the Premier League, there will be a hollow feeling at Anfield, no matter how many European trophies they collect along the way.

1571,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Death and destruction as floods rain havoc across East Africa - Kenya - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/death-and-destruction-floods-rain-havoc-across-east-africa,"In Summary

Hundreds of thousands have been forced by torrential rains to flee their homes across Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda.

Many weather stations have recorded their highest levels of rainfall in 40 years, damaging homes and destroying water sources, making it impossible for families to practice handwashing or practice social distancing despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Vital infrastructure across the region, including hospitals, roads and bridges have been washed away, further compounding the difficulty of accessing healthcare.

By Luke Anami

East Africa continues to suffer the effects of flooding and landslides as more than 481,000 people are currently displaced and over 360 people have died.

The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has warned of more rainfall this month.

Already, Lake Victoria, which is shared by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, has hit the highest water levels in over 50 years, at 13.45 metres, causing widespread flooding in many areas.

â??With the ongoing rains expected to continue, the water levels may rise further, aggravating the challenges of flooding especially on the Kenyan side that has more rivers that drain into Lake Victoria,â? said Lake Victoria Basin Commission executive secretary Ali-Said Matano.

Across the region, it is a tale of death, displacement and destruction.

In Uganda, Lake Victoriaâ??s rising water levels have displaced communities living close to the shoreline, and created challenges for the countryâ??s hydropower infrastructure.

Ugandaâ??s Minister of Water and Environment Sam Cheptoris attributed the backflow and increased flooding to the emergence of several floating islands that has led to the blockage of River Nile, which is the only outflow of Lake Victoria.

In a statement last week, Mr Cheptoris said the islands will be removed or stopped from moving as soon as they are identified through surveillance.

Sweeping floods in western Uganda killed four people and displaced 5,000 as heavy rains continue to inundate the region, according to Ugandan police.

Isingiro County South member of parliament Alex Byarugaba Bakunda said they have recorded 5,000 people who have been displaced, and called for emergency government support.

In Kenya, hundreds have been killed by floods and about 161,000 displaced.

â??More than 237 Kenyans have lost their lives to floods. The rains are still pounding many parts of the country and our dams are filled up,â? said Eugene Wamalwa, Kenyaâ??s Devolution Cabinet Secretary, on May 13 after assessing the effects of floods in the country.

Homes and recreation centres built on and near wetlands in Kisumu (Kenya), Mwanza (Tanzania) and in Entebbe (Uganda) are flooded.

In western Kenya, the rivers Nzoia, Lusumu, Yala, Kipsangui, Malakisi, Sio and Malabar, and Lake Naivasha water levels have risen.

â??In areas around Lake Naivasha, many people have been displaced, while Budalangi in Kenya has been affected by backflows from Lake Victoria and River Nzoia, which has burst its banks,â? said Mr Wamalwa.

In Burundi, around 50,000 people have been affected, most of whom were displaced as Rusizi River burst its banks on April 30, for the second time in two weeks.

Ruined harvest

In Rwanda, an estimated 2,200 households (11,000 people) have been affected by heavy rain this year, and 1,000 hectares of cropsâ??potatoes, maize, bananas, tea and sugarâ??have been destroyed.

The floods have left at least 70 people dead. Since May 1, floods have severely impacted seven districtsâ??Gakenke, Musanze, Nyabihu, Muganga, Ruhango, Rubavu and Ngororero.

In Tanzania, more than 31,000 people have been affected, including 13,500 displaced.

The Tanzania Red Cross Society and local government authorities have reported floods in Kilimanjaro, Kagera, Katavi, Mara, Manyara, Kigoma and Rukwa regions, with about 4,409 households and 10,540 people affected. Over 752 acres of farms were destroyed.

Lindi and Coast regions were among the first parts of Tanzania hit by floods, with 21 deaths and 1,702 people displaced families early this year.

About 180 houses in Western Tanzania with 1,655 people were affected by flooding water from Lake Tanganyika, government authorities said.

The Zanzibar Commission for Disasters said early this week that six people have died, 200 displaced and some 690 houses damaged on the main island of Unguja and the twin island of Pemba.

In Somalia, torrential rains and riverine floods have inundated at least 27 districts, with Belet Weyne in Hiran region worst-hit.

The recent heavy rains come just after an above-average short-rains season in the region, driven by the Indian Ocean Dipole, which affected at least 3.4 million people across Eastern Africa and caused water bodies across the region to swell.

This month, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development Climate Prediction and Applications Centre predicts heavy rainfall above 200 mm expected in western and northwestern Kenya and along the Ethiopian rift.

Thermal discomfort is expected in south and southeastern Sudan extending into northwestern Ethiopia and northern south Sudan.

306,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Afghanistan: “Drought has finished all our livestock – now it is killing people” - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-drought-has-finished-all-our-livestock-now-it-killing-people,"By Gorata Fembo, IFRC

Shamsia Atayee, 35, is five months pregnant but hardly shows it.

When she’s congratulated on her pregnancy, she forces a polite smile and says ‘’Thank you’’ in a low tone.

“I would not wish a sixth child on anyone, certainly not in the state of poverty I am in. If it was by choice, I wouldn’t have fallen pregnant because we hardly survive. We have to borrow money for food.”

Drought and conflict robbed her family of a good life in Baghlan province.

‘’My family’s income was reliant on crops and farming, as my husband used to grow and sell vegetables. On a week’s sale, we could make enough to sustain the family’s food supply for a month, and we could buy clothes for our children and keep them warm during the cold winter.

“The drought has finished all our livestock, now it is killing people. As our livestock died and our stored food ran out, we had nothing to live for in Baghlan.

“Conflict contributed to our hunger. We were tormented by the frequent exchange of firearms and explosions. We couldn’t go out to take care of our livestock.’’

‘’It is a double tragedy we are faced with. Baghlan used to be such a beautiful sight. Now, since the drought and conflict, everything is destroyed. There was grass then, livestock would graze but now it is only hard patches of cracked lands, houses with bullet marks and broken bridges.

“Families are constantly on the move. When we migrated to Kabul, we travelled with other people from our community in search of a better life. The journey was filled with unimaginable suffering for us.

“In Kabul, we live in a rented two-room house costing 40 US dollars a month. Some months we can pay the rent, some we cannot. We used the last of our savings and my husband carried out small jobs in town. When we arrived in Kabul a couple of months back, my husband was employed as a security guard for government buildings, but he was later retrenched and making life even harder for us here.

“Since falling pregnant, I have not visited the doctor for antenatal care services. I was also diagnosed with a heart condition that requires close medical attention. In Baghlan, I used to visit the Afghan Red Crescent clinic, but since moving to Kabul I do not have the money to travel to the hospital. Once I had to pay a consultation fee which I did not have, and we ended up borrowing money from relatives. Life is far from easy here.”

Shamsia Atayee’s family has received emergency help from the Afghan Red Crescent Society.

816,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Mozambique: Humanitarian Dashboard (As of 18 December 2019) - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-humanitarian-dashboard-18-december-2019,"SITUATION OVERVIEW

Multiple and consecutive shocks, including drought, cyclones, floods and insecurity, have left an estimated 2.5 million people—almost 10 per cent of the country’s population—in need of life-saving and life-sustaining assistance in Mozambique. The revised Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) targets the priority needs of 2 million people, including food insecurity and malnutrition, inadequate shelter, and lack of access to health, protection and education services. It also contributes to early recovery, in complement to the Disaster Recovery Framework, which covers the medium- and longer-term response. However, less than half of the funding required for full implementation of the HRP has been mobilized—with under US$292 million received out of more than $620 million required—and four critical sectors are less than 20 per cent funded: Protection (18 per cent); Health (15 per cent); Nutrition (2 per cent); and Education (1 per cent).

Approximately 2 million people are now severely food insecure, and this number is expected to increase during the current lean season (October 2019-March 2020). Based on the findings of the food security and nutrition assessment conducted in June 2019 by the Technical Secretariat for Food and Nutrition Security (SETSAN), an estimated 67,500 children require urgent treatment for malnutrition. For the first time in many years, pellagra (a vitamin B-3 deficiency) has been reported in the country, with over 1,000 cases confirmed in Cyclone Idai-affected areas.

Eight months after Cyclone Idai hit the country, six months post Cyclone Kenneth, and with the rain/cyclone season approaching, more than half a million people (over 100,000 households) are reportedly still living in destroyed or damaged homes or makeshift shelters. Another nearly 92,500 people (over 18,000 households) remain displaced across 71 resettlement sites in the central and northern regions of the country, in dire need of food, water, education, shelter/NFIs, WASH, health and protection services. At the same time, the shocks endured by communities in 2018/2019 have significantly exacerbated pre-existing protection risks, including child protection concerns, sexual and gender-based violence, loss of personal documentation, and issues related to land and property rights. Displaced people, particularly women, often do not have clear tenure arrangements and limited access to land ownership which aggravates their insecurity and vulnerability to exploitation. An additional 65,000 people are estimated to have been affected and/or displaced by insecurity in Cabo Delgado to date, as a result of over 200 attacks on villages by unknown armed actors and clashes between security forces and armed groups since October 2017.

According to forecasts, the 2019/2020 rainy season is likely to be below average, with potential for late and erratic rains in the central and southern regions and normal to above average rains in the northern region. This could cause agricultural losses, further compounding needs. There is also the risk of another cyclone hitting Mozambique in the months ahead.",2019-12-19 08:00:00+00:00,"['security', 'mozambique', 'cyclone', 'humanitarian', 'insecurity', 'cent', 'protection', '2019', 'food', 'dashboard', 'months', 'million', 'nutrition', 'season', '18']",Mozambique,news article,English
534,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Bow to your King! Genius Messi single-handedly drags Barcelona back from the dead - Goal.com,https://www.goal.com/en/news/bow-to-your-king-genius-messi-single-handedly-drags/tazpeii4khwb1i1jh8rfq1ajz,"Bow to your King! Genius Messi single-handedly drags Barcelona back from the dead

The Argentine proved his genius - and resilience - by leading the Blaugrana to a sensational victory in Madrid that has blown the title race wide open

COMMENT

Marcello Lippi was asked earlier this week if Lionel Messi was in decline. ""Every time I see Barcelona's results,"" the legendary Italian coach responded, ""I see goals and assists from Messi.

""I don't think he has declined; it's the rest of Barcelona that has declined. The drop-off is more in terms of the defence and that affects the whole team.""

Sunday's Clasico showdown at the Santiago Bernabeu proved Lippi right on both counts: Messi was as brilliant as Barca's defence was brittle.

Messi wins Clasico for Barca at the death

Yet the Catalans, thanks to their talismanic No.10, managed to prevail over their great rivals Real Madrid, thus breathing new life into a Liga title race that had appeared dead by claiming a dramatic, last-gasp 3-2 victory in one of the greatest games this famous fixture has ever seen.

Indeed, many Madrid fans had come to the ground expecting to bury Barcelona. Avoiding defeat would all but seal the title and deal a fatal blow to a Blaugrana side seemingly on the way out after their comprehensive Champions League elimination at the hands of Juventus. Remarkably, even Messi was being written off beforehand.

The Argentine had come into the game without a goal in his previous six matches against Real Madrid. This unprecedented drought was viewed by some as evidence that Messi was no longer the phenomenon of old - in spite of the fact that no player has scored more goals in all competitions across Europe's top five leagues (now 47 in just 46 games).

When it comes to appraising the talents of Messi and Ronaldo in the modern era, it seems that they are only as good as their last game, and whereas the Portuguese had fired Real into the last four of the Champions League with a hat-trick against Bayern, Messi had drawn a blank in Barca's midweek draw with Juventus.

Luis Enrique was even asked in his pre-game press conference if it was time for his No.10 to shine again. ""I think it’s time for FC Barcelona to show their full potential,"" the Barca boss replied. ""We shouldn’t focus on just Messi or anyone else.""

Messi scores 500th goal for Barca

Real did focus on Messi, though, seemingly intent on nullifying his influence by any means necessary. Casemiro was booked just 13 minutes in for cynically scything the 29-year-old down after being embarrassed by Messi's quick feet in the middle of the park.

Marcelo, meanwhile, left the Clasico's all-time record goalscorer (23) prone on the Bernabeu turf with blood pouring out of his mouth with a careless elbow to the face.

Messi would have his revenge, though, retaliating not with aggression but artistry, bravely refusing to stop running at his rivals. He made five dribbles in the first half alone; the rest of the players on the pitch managed two between them.

He was felled twice more by Casemiro before the break, twice more he picked himself up off the ground and continued to carry the fight to Real.

Thirty-three minutes in, he finally lost his Brazilian tormentor for the first time and capitalised in scintillating fashion. He took a pass from Rakitic in his stride to glide past Luka Modric before then leaving Dani Carvajal swinging at thin air as he slotted the ball coolly past Keylor Navas to level the game.

Messi was involved again as Barca took the lead with 17 minutes to go. The Argentina captain found his path to goal blocked - legally, for once - but Rakitic picked up the pieces and unleashed a thunderous strike that left the brilliant Navas with no chance.

When Sergio Ramos was rightly shown a straight red card for throwing himself into a disgusting two-footed lunge at Messi just four minutes later, the game appeared to be up for Real. However, the 10 men incredibly drew level when substitute James Rodriguez turned in Marcelo's cross.

Messi wasn't done, though. With just 13 seconds of injury time to go, he timed his arrival into the area to perfection before driving home Jordi Alba's pull-back to silence the Santiago Bernabeu with his 500th goal for Barca. Bloodied, battered and still sporting a black eye from a bruising encounter with Juve, he celebrated by showing them his jersey as a reminder that he remains the King of the Clasico.

They thought his reign was over. They were wrong. Barca may be in decline but Messi most certainly is not. As Luis Enrique pointed out afterwards, ""Messi is decisive even when he is at home eating dinner! He is the best player in history.""",2017-04-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['title', 'barcelona', 'bernabeu', 'barca', 'madrid', 'king', 'real', 'messi', 'drags', 'bow', 'goal', 'singlehandedly', 'genius', 'minutes', 'dead', 'game']",Ghana,news article,English
231,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Parts of Australia declare natural disaster during 'once in 100 years' floods - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/21/australia/australia-flood-natural-disaster-intl-hnk/index.html,"(CNN) The Australian government has declared a natural disaster in large swaths of New South Wales (NSW) as heavy rains batter the state and force thousands to evacuate .

Rains have been inundating communities since Thursday, but parts of the east coast tipped into crisis on Saturday as a major dam overflowed, adding to swollen rivers and causing flash flooding.

The NSW and federal government have signed 16 natural disaster declarations in areas spanning the central and mid-north coast, from Hunter Valley near Sydney to Coff's Harbour, said NSW Emergency Services Minister David Elliott in a news conference on Sunday.

There have been no deaths reported yet -- but, Elliott warned, ""we are moving closer and closer to the inevitable fatality.""

""We cannot say it enough: do not put yourself in danger, do not put the agencies that are there to assist you in the event of a flood rescue in danger,"" he said.

Some families were forced to evacuate in the middle of the night as rivers rose to dangerous levels, and 4,000 more people -- primarily in the Hawkesbury region -- may have to evacuate on Sunday, said state Premier Gladys Berejiklian at the news conference.

#NSWRFS aviation crew continue to assist @NSWSES where required. This video was taken by one of our Air Observers on approach to Taree. For emergency assistance with flood and storm damage call the #NSWSES on 132 500. If it's a life-threatening emergency, call Triple Zero (000). pic.twitter.com/lKu4YlV6To — NSW RFS (@NSWRFS) March 21, 2021

""This is nothing like we've seen since the 1960s,"" Berejiklian said. In parts of the state that have been hit harder, this is a once-a-century event; in other regions like the Hawkesbury area, it's a ""one-in-50-years"" event, she said.

Joshua Edge and his fiancée Sarah Soars lost the house they were renting Saturday on what was supposed to be their wedding day. They lost everything they owned, including pets, as flood waters powered through Mondrook, an area near the town of Taree in NSW, Edge's brother Lyle wrote on a GoFundMe page set up to help the couple.

The page has raised nearly $100,000 AUD (roughly $77,000 USD) from 1,779 people in one day. A video circulating on social media shows a house being carried by floods in the same area, but CNN could not independently verify whether it was the one Edge and Soars had been living in.

""We have just been blown away with people's generosity,"" said Lyle Edge in a Facebook post. ""We are all so grateful and can not [sic] thank everyone enough.""

A rescue worker helps residents cross a flooded road in western Sydney on March 20

Since Thursday, the State Emergency Service (SES) has responded to 7,000 calls for assistance and conducted more than 750 flood rescues. Thousands of emergency workers and volunteers are still on the ground, helping trapped residents.

Photos show backyards and homes half underwater and roads flooded to knee-high levels. In the mid-north town of Taree , residents rescued a cow struggling to stay afloat in rough waters; nearby, an enthire house was swept away by the raging floodwaters, according to CNN affiliate Seven News.

Residents look at the swollen Nepean river during heavy rain in western Sydney on March 20.

Berejiklian urged residents to follow local guidance, stay off the roads, and heed evacuation orders if needed -- even for those who live in flood-prone areas and may have experienced flooding before. ""This is different,"" she warned. ""What we're going through is different to what you've been through for the last 50 years. So please take it seriously.""

Authorities don't know yet how many homes or infrastructure have been lost, but ""the damage is substantial,"" she said.

The natural disaster declaration could be further extended up the coast if the damage increases, said Elliott. The declaration allows those affected to receive financial assistance, including recovering damage to homes, subsidies for affected livestock or agriculture, and low- or zero-interest loans.

Australia's federal government activated disaster relief for flood-affected NSW residents, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced in a Facebook post on Sunday.

Those who are significantly injured, lost homes or had their homes damaged will be entitled to $1,000 AUD (roughly $770 USD) for adults or $400 AUD (roughly $310 USD) for children.

""The terrible storms and floods that have been ravaging NSW for the past few days are taking a heavy toll,"" Morrison said in a video address accompanying the post, mentioning that he has been in regular contact with Berejiklian.

The Prime Minister praised emergency workers and volunteers in his comments, urging people in flood-hit regions to listen to their advice and warnings, saying ""for now, our message is very clear to keep yourself safe, to keep your family safe and those around you to follow the instructions of the very competent, professional agencies and bodies and the volunteers who support them.""

Heavy rains are expected to continue in the upcoming week, with a rain band forecast to move across the state from the west, bringing significant rainfall to he northern inland and northwestern slopes, said Agata Imielska of the Bureau of Meteorology. The worst-affected areas could see rain totals more than four times the March monthly average falling in just two days.

Flooding on the Hawkesbury River, which runs north and west of Sydney, is expected to be as bad as a similar event that occurred in 1961, according to a statement from the Bureau of Meteorology.

More than 130 schools in New South Wales will close on Monday, with some requiring ""maintenance and repair,"" according to a press release from local officials.

Wednesday will be the first day of some reprieve, with rains expected to lighten into showers.",2021-03-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['nsw', 'natural', 'residents', 'lost', 'floods', 'rains', 'declare', '100', 'sydney', 'event', 'australia', 'emergency', 'parts', 'flood', 'state', 'homes', 'disaster']",Australia,news article,English
1663,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Container shortage delays shipments of Brazil's record coffee crop - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/coffee-transportation-brazil-idUSKBN26Z0JS,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coffee traders are struggling to ship cargos out of Brazilian ports because of a shortage of available containers or space in vessels to hold them, according to traders and analysts.

Brazil’s economy is suffering due to the coronavirus pandemic, causing a 40% slide in its currency, the real. That spurred a flood of exports of now-cheaper goods, but imports have dropped sharply, causing the imbalance in containers that has led to delays.

That’s a direct hit to Brazil, which with 30% of global coffee trade is the world’s largest exporter of the commodity.

According to shipping industry consultancy Datamar, there was an imbalance of nearly 80,000 boxes in Brazil in August, with around 251,000 containers leaving the country and only 172,000 arriving. By contrast, in January, 216,000 boxes arrived and 201,000 left.

Global shipping companies such as MSC and Maersk are fully booked for weeks to months in Brazil. Merchants say it is not feasible to currently export Brazilian coffee for prompt shipment, and what is possible can only be done at a higher cost.

“I sold coffee to a client in Spain and I’m still waiting for MSC to make containers available for the shipment,” said Nelson Salvaterra, a partner at Brazilian coffee exporter Coffee Selection.

MSC’s press office did not confirm that specific problem, and declined to comment further. Maersk said it was working to improve container availability.

“It is clear that the coffee sector is entering into the peak season. It is highly important that producers provide the proper visibility on when to move stocks in advance,” said Julian Thomas, general manager for Maersk East Coast South America.

He added that there is no more room for shipments in October.

Coffee, unlike other soft commodities like sugar, is shipped via containers rather than in dry bulk vessels.

Christian Wolthers, a partner at U.S.-based coffee importer Wolthers Douque, said he managed to find containers for a shipment out of Brazil, but there was no space in the ship and his merchandise was left at the port to be loaded onto another vessel.

Brazil’s trade surplus jumped to $6.16 billion in September, 38% more than a year earlier, due to the weak real. In recent months, Brazilian farmers rushed to sell their crops, boosting exports, as the weak currency means they receive more reais in dollar-denominated trade.

Foreign coffee sales that were planned ahead of time are being processed without much trouble, traders said. However, they said that some cargoes from Brazil may take longer to arrive, meaning global coffee merchants may need to substitute supply from other country.",2020-10-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['delays', 'shipment', 'coffee', 'brazil', 'maersk', 'crop', 'weak', 'trade', 'wolthers', 'record', 'shortage', 'brazils', 'container', 'containers', 'shipments', 'brazilian', 'traders']",Brazil,news article,English

by Mahmoud Fouly, Abdel-Meguid Kamal

CAIRO, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Nile River flooding poses no serious threat to Egypt despite the damage and casualties it caused to fellow downstream Nile basin country Sudan, said an Egyptian official.

""The flooding situation in Egypt is different and the society here will not be seriously affected as it happened in other Nile basin states,"" Mohamed al-Sebai, spokesman of the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, told Xinhua.

The ministry's monitoring and forecasting center said that the Nile flooding is rather useful to Egypt this year, since there is an opportunity to use quantities of the flood water to refresh and improve the quality of the Nile water as well as reduce its pollution and the amount of ammonia in Egypt's Nile delta Rosetta branch, the spokesman added.

The Nile River is the main source of fresh water in Egypt, providing the country with 55.5 billion cubic meters of water annually.

Sebai pointed out that the flooding will continue in Egypt until the end of October, in light of the continuous rainfalls in upstream Nile basin countries.

The ministry has recently announced that the Nile flooding this year is ""high and likely to continue increasing,"" while the government assigned the ministry to set up an ""emergency plan.""

Egypt has 13 riparian provinces along the Nile River that would be first affected by the flooding, located between Aswan in the south and Damietta in the north.

The biggest issue about these provinces is their encroachments in the course of the Nile, whether through construction or plantation on adjacent lands, making them the most vulnerable.

The encroachments lead to bottlenecks in the course of the river, and thus the incoming amount of water cannot be absorbed.

However, the water ministry's spokesman told Xinhua that ""any possible damage will be limited in the Nile islands and riparian lands of the river, which are considered an integral part of the river's course itself.""

Experts expect the Nile water level in Egypt to rise by about 120 centimeters, overwhelming the lowlands including islands and riparian buildings and crops.

Abbas Sharaqi, a professor of water resources at Cairo University, emphasized that the current flooding is not the most violent in the history of Egypt compared with those occurred in 1999 and 2000.

""But the difference is that Nasser Lake, the reservoir of Egypt's Aswan High Dam, has been filled early this year during the current flooding,"" said the Egyptian professor, attributing the current rise of the Nile water level in Egypt to the increasing water flow coming from the Ethiopian high central plateau.

Although Egypt and Sudan are the two downstream Nile basin states, this year's flooding caused deadly damage in Sudan while Egypt is likely to pass it safely, mainly due to its giant High Dam that helps contain a large quantity of the flooding water.

""Sudan was exposed to a greater flooding that submerged some states due to the heavy rains there amid increasing water flow coming from upstream Ethiopia,"" Sharaqi told Xinhua.

He explained that the capabilities of Sudanese dams are limited that they cannot reserve large quantities of water.

The Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation has other ways to deal with such a flooding, as it can resort to using the Edfina Barrage on the Rosetta branch of the Nile, which releases excess water to the Mediterranean Sea, or other northern barrages in case of continuing water flow.

""The situation is under the control of the ministry, because it can increase or decrease the Nile water level, which is still at a safe level, or increase the amount of water discharged into the sea when necessary,"" said the Egyptian professor.

271,DR-2021-000022-AFG,'The country could fall apart': drought and despair in Afghanistan - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/25/country-could-fall-apart-drought-despair-afghanistan,"Shafiqa watches closely over her six-month-old niece. Lying on a bundle of fabric, Maryam’s legs jut out, thin and pale. When they arrived at hospital two weeks ago, she could hardly breathe. Her body was swollen with malnutrition, her lips and fingers were blue.

There are 24 children being treated at Mofleh paediatric hospital’s malnutrition ward, on the outskirts of Herat city, western Afghanistan. Mothers and aunts lean next to hospital beds, some rocking tiny babies back and forth.

The worst drought in a decade, prolonged conflict and poverty have pushed families across Afghanistan to the brink. About 13.5 million people are severely food insecure – 6 million more than in 2017. This means they are surviving, for the time being, on less than one meal a day.

“That’s the highest number of any country in the world except Yemen,” says Toby Lanzer, the UN’s deputy special representative in Afghanistan. An estimated 3.6 million people are one step from famine. Flash flooding in many areas has compounded the misery families are facing.

As US and Afghan Taliban peace talks continue, and the prospect of US troops withdrawing looms, the UN’s appeal to donors – which set a target of $612m (£465m) for this year – is only 11% funded.

Without donor support, Afghanistan would face “a humanitarian tragedy beyond what one could describe”, warns Adele Khodr, Afghanistan’s Unicef representative; the country, she says, could fall apart: “It will become a chaotic situation that can generate insecurity not only for here but maybe elsewhere.”

Outside Mofleh hospital, tents stretch into the distance. It’s one of several areas where families who fled the drought have sought shelter. Some sleep in white tents handed out by the UN, others have propped up flimsy pieces of cloth on sticks.

Critics say the response to the drought was slow and failed to support people to stay in their home areas. Alarm bells were first rung by several agencies on the ground, including World Vision, in autumn 2017, but it wasn’t until April 2018 that the government declared a drought. About 260,000 people were forced to leave their homes across northern and western Afghanistan.

New arrivals, whose presence in Herat is politically sensitive, are scattered across several sites, making it harder for agencies to provide services. Access to drought-affected areas, where millions more remain, is hampered by insecurity and lack of funding.

Rahima Lakzai and her family left their village in the Muqur district of Badghis province four months ago. Almost all their animals had wasted away. There was no money for transport; for eight days, they travelled with two donkeys across the rugged terrain that leads to Herat.

Sitting in a small mobile health clinic, run by World Vision, Lakzai, 22, cradles her youngest daughter. Rakima, 11 months, is wrapped in a red cardigan, a matching scarf tied under her chin. A measurement of her arm circumference – just 11.2cm – indicates she has developed severe acute malnutrition. Rahima is given peanut paste to feed to her daughter, and asked to come back in a week’s time.

She says through an interpreter that the family still haven’t been given a proper tent to sleep in and can barely afford food for their two children. Her husband will do any daily labour he can, she says, but there’s little work going.

Torpikae, 35, from Badghis province, lost all 50 of her sheep and three cows in the drought before she fled with her family. “Only a few people remain,” she says. She has received cash handouts, but debt to neighbours means she is not able to keep everything she receives. “Half we give to those [neighbours] we borrowed from,” she says. Like Rahima’s family, Torpikae’s husband goes out to look for work in the city. “Mostly he is jobless,” she says.

Herat is one of Afghanistan’s most prosperous and safe cities, but competition for daily labour, which pays up to $5 a day, is tough. Food is abundant in markets, but numerous families – both locals and people who have fled the drought – can’t afford it.

Shafiqa is from Herat province’s Shindand district, an area that has been racked by violence. Maryam’s mother died two days after giving birth, leaving her in Shafiqa’s care. The family has no stable source of income because Shafiqa’s husband is not well enough to work. Before bringing Maryam to hospital, she depended on neighbours for handouts, she says: “I went from house to house to ask for milk.”

The effects of malnutrition for children aged two and under are irreversible, says Dr Shakib Popal, of World Vision Afghanistan, which supports the hospital’s malnutrition ward. “The brain of the child will be affected and all the consequences will remain for a lifetime,” he says.

Babies often need to stay in the ward for 45 days, adds Popal, but mothers struggle to say away from their families for so long.

“I am begging them to discharge me,” says the woman whose baby is next to Shafiqa. Her three-month-old still has swollen legs, but she has eight other children at home.

Families who have been displaced face the greatest barriers to healthcare: on top of discrimination against new arrivals, many are often too preoccupied with finding shelter and food to go for checkups.

It was six weeks before Torpikae was given a proper tent. In other areas of Herat, and across eight other provinces including Farah and Kandahar, flash flooding has swept away the shelters used by displaced families. “Some 15,000 families, many of them already affected by the drought, were hit by flash floods, and WFP and partners are responding to cover their immediate food and other needs,” says Zlatan Milisic, country director of the UN World Food Programme in Afghanistan.

Lanzer says that acknowledging and responding to slow onset natural disasters such as droughts typically takes time. Whether or not the response was slow is difficult to judge, and irrelevant, he says. “It’s a bit like counting the number of dead people after an earthquake. It doesn’t matter. We deal with the survivors.

“For the past nine months we’ve been doing everything we can with woefully limited resources to do as much as possible,” he says, adding that 5.4 million people were reached with food aid last year. While conditions for displaced families are dire, there are millions more who remain in drought-affected areas.

The effects of the drought are expected to wane. But land degradation – driven by decades of conflict, overuse of natural resources, and climate change – means the full benefits of recent rains aren’t felt. Instead, the risk of flash floods is heightened.

“When forests and rangelands are degraded, topsoil erodes. Any loss of plants and the soil they hold in place means that when rains come, the land doesn’t benefit as much as it should,” says Rajendra Aryal, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s representative in Afghanistan, which is working with the ministry of agriculture, irrigation and livestock to restore forests and rangelands.

Over the past decade and a half, droughts have become more frequent and more serious. It’s likely this trend will continue, creating food crises, prompting large numbers of people to flee their homes, and increasing the risk that water conflict will exacerbate existing ethnic tensions.

Many of those who have fled to Herat do not want to return home. “Even if this year is a good year [for rains] we do not have resources there,” says Rahima.

Shafiqa will stay in the hospital for another two weeks, before she goes back to her children in Shindand. “I have heard from others that the government is going to make peace with the Taliban,” she says. “I hope peace comes to my district.”

Shafiqa says her children are used to the fighting. “We have a shelter underground we go to … once, we were in it for a whole night. When they hear the firing sound, they just come and stick to me.”",2019-03-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['malnutrition', 'apart', 'food', 'hospital', 'family', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'despair', 'fall', 'country', 'families', 'world', 'children', 'herat']",Afghanistan,news article,English

The meteorological department has warned of heavy rain in the coming days

The flood alert comes as families that had been displaced by rising waters in Kihoto estate return to their homes after the levels went down.

The warning was issued by Kenya Red Cross and Lake Naivasha Water Resource Users Association.

They warned that indications show the projected rains could cause floods.

“This is to request you to move to higher grounds once the water levels start rising,” Red Cross said in a message put out in Kiswahili.

LANAWRUA chairman Enock Kiminta said the lake’s levels had dropped from 1891.56m above sea level last year to 1891.10m.

“When the water levels dropped some families whose houses had been flooded decided to return and we are worried by the move,” he said on Wednesday.

Kiminta said going by the weatherman’s projections, the rains could be heavier and could cause more displacement than last year.

“We have seen water levels in the lake drop sharply in the last three months but this should not be a reason for those displaced to return to their houses,” he said.

Kiminta said the fuel pipeline in Kihoto had been flooded raising fears among residents and environmentalists.

“Water from this lake is very corrosive and we fear that it might have effects on the metallic underground pipes that ferry millions of litres of fuel every day,” he said.

However, a senior officer from Kenya Pipeline Company downplayed any leaking fears, saying the pipeline had been built to withstand weather changes.

“It’s true the fuel pipeline is currently under water but studies indicate that it has a lifespan of over 20 years before the water can have any effects on the materials,” said the officer who declined to be named.

712,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Still scrumming down head-on with life - Times LIVE,https://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/rugby/2011-09-11-still-scrumming-down-head-on-with-life/,"When Chris Rossouw eventually disappears into obscurity, being a World Cup-winning hooker may yet be considered one of his lesser achievements.

Such is the gusto with which Rossouw has tackled rugby's afterlife - the minefield so many retired players so aimlessly traverse - that his playing career seems a mere by-product of the achievements of a man driven by the belief that horizons are there to be expanded.

Not that his achievements have come without a fight. Rossouw has had to confront life's vicissitudes head on and future challenges are likely to get similar treatment.

He overcame career-threatening injury, beating lymphoma into five-year remission after having had to come to terms with the trauma of his son's bone marrow transplant.

When Rossouw recalls the hardships, he does so matter of factly, as if everybody is afflicted by these tribulations.

""My wife and I have a pretty ordinary family life. We have Chris, 12, Joane, 10, Nicolaas, eight, and the fourth is due in January. Nicolaas had to undergo a bone marrow operation. I was still playing and I had to stop training. I'm thankful I had the means to take him to England for treatment.""

Although he has beaten cancer for now, he is not out of the woods. ""The lymphoma is in remission. It's been for five years. I'm clean and I'm really thankful. I've reached the stage where I can have life insurance again. You can have it when you've been clean for five years and it will be a big milestone for me.""

It's moot whether these events have helped shape him into the single-minded, success-driven man he is, but he is definitely stronger for it.

It has allowed him to reflect but not dwell on a rugby career that spanned two Rugby World Cups with not much before, in-between or after.

He played nine tests according to official records but insists an appearance as a substitute against the Wallabies in 1996 has been overlooked.

""I was injured after the 1995 Word Cup when I had a chance to establish myself as the No1 hooker. We toured Argentina and I picked up an injury. After that I suffered a bit of a drought.

""We had a three-year contract after the World Cup and in a way my body was spared. I was fortunate to get another chance when selected for the 1999 World Cup.

""That was in a way a disappointment because Nick Mallett didn't pick me because John Hart said I broke Bull Allen's jaw in New Zealand. If Nick said it then one could explain it, but I don't want to discredit anybody.""

His transition to rugby's afterlife was almost seamless. ""I started farming but that ran parallel with doing business and playing rugby. I studied at Tuks and I was always exposed to the markets.

""Now we are into combined farming - maize, soya and chickens. In 2007, the Rossgro Group won South Africa's farmer- of-the-year award.

Despite the accolades, Rossouw operates in a testing environment.

""We are a dying breed. The white, Afrikaans-speaking farmer in Africa. We're getting a bit rare but still sought-after.

""I don't know what the hullabaloo about land reform is for farming. Here we have farms and thousands of hectares of farm land of black farmers that is not utilised. I offer mentorship.

""Everybody is screaming for a solution but commercial farmers have so much on their plate just to survive that we don't have time to help our neighbours. I've bought tractors and I'm farming on black-owned land. As a consequence, my interests have trebled.""

He admits to being a Sharks fan because: ""they are more moderate,"" and loves travelling.

""Next, I would like to tackle China. It has opened up nicely. We are over being alarmed by the 'made in China' label. The world is one place. If we want to survive, we must be efficient.""

His views on the Springboks in the World Cup?

""We'll do well. If we lose it will only happen in the final. How we manage the John Smit, Bismarck du Plessis situation will be key.""",2011-09-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['farming', 'rugby', 'playing', 'im', 'way', 'scrumming', 'dont', 'thankful', 'world', 'rossouw', 'life', 'land', 'headon']",China,news article,English

1300,FL-2021-000038-KEN,An archaeology society hosted a talk against returning Indigenous remains. Some want a new society - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/archaeology-society-hosted-talk-against-returning-indigenous-remains-some-want-new,"An archaeology society hosted a talk against returning Indigenous remains. Some want a new society

The Society for American Archaeology’s (SAA’s) virtual annual meeting erupted in controversy last week after members realized the organization had allowed a talk arguing against a key U.S. law giving Native Americans rights to the human remains and cultural artifacts of their ancestors. Although the presentation was made by an SAA member and anthropologist, many archaeologists say they were shocked their professional organization gave a platform to what they consider anti-Indigenous views; they say SAA has not adequately addressed the harm caused by the talk. Some archaeologists are considering leaving and starting a new society.

“There’s a sense [that SAA] is protecting the organization over the people who are involved,” says Kisha Supernant, an archaeologist at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, and a member of Canada’s historic Indigenous Métis. A number of archaeologists note that this incident comes after a sexual harassment scandal at the organization’s 2019 conference, which left many SAA members feeling unsupported. (The 2020 conference was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.)

In 1990, the United States passed a law requiring universities, museums, and other institutions to inform Native American tribes of any Indigenous human remains and artifacts in their collections—and return them when requested. At first, many archaeologists worried the law, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), would compromise their research. But today NAGPRA is widely accepted by archaeologists, as most agree that Indigenous people should have the right to determine the treatment of their ancestors’ remains, which were often looted from tribal lands. Since NAGPRA became law, many tribes have collaborated with archaeologists to study their history and ancestors.

On 15 April, Elizabeth Weiss, a physical anthropologist at San Jose State University and an SAA member, gave a presentation at SAA’s virtual annual meeting titled “Has Creationism Crept Back into Archaeology?” co-written with retired attorney James Springer. During the talk, she said archaeologists “have let creationism into the heart of our discipline” because NAGPRA gives “control of research over to contemporary American Indian communities,” who may request repatriation or refuse to participate in certain research partly because of religious beliefs. Last year, Weiss and Springer published a book making similar arguments, which drew criticism from many archaeologists.

“Not only was [Weiss’s and Springer’s paper] not founded on good scholarship, but there’s also an inherent assumption that repatriation is antiscience. That’s a red herring,” says Supernant, who studies Métis sites. “[Repatriation] is about power. It’s about who gets to make decisions about what happens to the ancestors.”

Members of the program committee, comprised of several dozen volunteers, last year reviewed the title and abstract of Weiss’s and Springer’s talk, as they do for all SAA presentations, says Deborah Nichols, president of SAA and an archaeologist at Dartmouth College. “There is a review process, but it is not the equivalent of a peer review for a juried journal,” she says. Few abstracts are rejected. But submissions might be flagged if they analyze looted artifacts, report doing work without the appropriate permits, or promote pseudoarchaeology, such as a belief that aliens built ancient monuments, she says. No one flagged Weiss’s and Springer’s abstract, Nichols says, though she called their argument “dated.”

The program committee then grouped Weiss’s and Springer’s talk into a session titled “Curation, Repatriation, and Accessibility: Vital Ethical Considerations.” April Beisaw, an archaeologist at Vassar College, presented her talk on the importance of NAGPRA compliance in that session. “I was one of the very many people on the program committee. And I was not asked to review that abstract, even though NAGPRA is an expertise of mine,” she says. “I would have flagged it.” She called Weiss’s and Springer’s argument “nonsensical. … NAGPRA is a human rights law, it’s Indian law, and it’s a property rights law. It is not a religious law.”

After SAA members began to speak out against Weiss’s presentation on social media, the society issued a statement on 15 April. “SAA recognizes that some will find certain positions in presentations objectionable or even offensive, and we do not want to minimize those feelings. The conversation reflects the broader discussions happening in our field. Scholarship requires the opportunity for rigorous interrogation of diverse views.”

But Supernant was shocked to hear such arguments presented at an important archaeology conference. “There are Indigenous members of the SAA, myself included, and there’s so little care given to how a paper like that might have harmed us,” she says. “It was a very difficult experience to sit through that paper … when your very humanity and human rights are being questioned.” She adds: “People are entitled to hold these views. But whether or not they’re given a platform is up [to SAA].”

Supernant started the Twitter hashtag #IAmNotTheSAA, and many other members have expressed outrage on social media and called on the organization to apologize.

Weiss defends her presentation, saying: “Calls to cancel our talk, shout us down, or rewrite the guidelines for abstract acceptance so that similar talks are not accepted next year are a distressing movement to silence voices with minority or unpopular perspectives.” She adds: “Our position is not racist or anti-Indigenous. … [T]o us there are no Indigenous archaeologists and no non-Indigenous archaeologists—there are only archaeologists. … We think that the validity of any argument does not depend on a person’s race.”

Three days after SAA’s statement, Nichols took a somewhat stronger stance in an interview with Science Insider.

“The SAA Board refutes the viewpoint of the Weiss/Springer presentation [and] reiterates its support for NAGPRA,” Nichols says. “I understand, sincerely, why [Indigenous archaeologists] were upset and offended. … I personally regret the pain and harm that some have felt. At the same time, I also wrestle with [the fact that] silencing different points of view doesn’t make them go away. … To me, this controversy gets at what are some of the very, very hardest issues that universities, colleges, scholarly societies, and our society at large in the United States have had to wrestle with in recent years.”

Nichols says SAA will address the incident further. “I am quite certain we’re going to see changes take place” in the society as a result, she says.

For Supernant, it is too little, too late. She’s leaving SAA and hopes to build a new professional organization, tentatively called the Society for Engaged Archaeology. When she tweeted about her idea last week, she received a flood of interest and support. “This was the last straw that galvanized a number of us to seriously start doing that planning,” she says. “I understand that institutions are slow to change. But I don’t feel confident that the SAA actually wants to.”",2021-04-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['hosted', 'nagpra', 'law', 'returning', 'weisss', 'repatriation', 'talk', 'remains', 'springers', 'society', 'saa', 'archaeologists', 'indigenous', 'archaeology']",Kenya,news article,English

[Collins Oduor, Standard]

The Nubian community has called on authorities to improve conditions at a field in Kolwa, Kisumu County, where they are living in makeshift structures after they were evicted from a disputed land.

They have also urged the county government to expedite the process of resettling them.

Kenya Railways (KR) has laid claim to the land in Kibos, which the Nubians say was given to them by the colonial government in 1937.

The field, next to Kisumu East CDF office, is prone to floods that have made life difficult, especially for the elderly. The 850 people have been living in deplorable conditions for three months now since they were evicted from what KR says was a railway reserve.

KR accused them of encroaching on land meant for expansion of the railway line and forcefully evicted them.

The Nubians say their eviction was illegal.

They were moved to the land where they are currently living by the Kisumu City authorities.

â??We had lived on the land since 1937 before we were forcefully evicted. It has been tough for some of us, especially those of us who are elderly,â? said 82-year-old Khadija Rajab.

â??We did not expect this. But if we must move out so the railway can be expanded, then the government should compensate us,â? she said.

Rajab said other than floods, they have to contend will mosquitoes and rodents. She wondered why they were taken to the flood-prone field, a move she said has complicated their lives.

They have been depending on Kenya Red Cross Society, relatives and well wishers for food.

Abdi Asha, 39, called for justice saying KR had no right to take away their land.

â??We are Kenyans by birth and deserve fair treatment,â? Asha said.

Most of those living on the 18 acres belonging to the county government cannot fend for themselves.

Acting City Manager Abala Wanga said the county government has started the process of resettling the Nubians.

In the meantime, Wanga said they had built three tents to improve their living conditions and were in the process of controlling floods at the site.

Hassan Hussein, an elder, said they were happy the county government had started settling them, but urged the authorities to expedite the process.

Last month, the Environment and Land Court extended conservatory orders stopping KR from forcefully evicting the Nubians from the land.

This followed a petition by Fatuma Bilal, Rashid Sadii, Mohamed Abdulrahman, Mwanamisi Kinduli, Yaya Musa and Asaman Musa filed on behalf of the community.

The forward will spend the 2019-20 season with The Whites after a frustrating first season with the Frogs

Ghana striker Raphael Dwamena has left Spanish La Liga club Levante for second-tier side Real Zaragoza in search for regular playing time.

The 23-year-old transfers from Estadio Ciudad de Valencia on a season-long loan deal, having made only 15 appearances and started three games in all competitions for the club since joining from Swiss fold FC Zurich last summer.

Zurich, Spanish second division side Real Oviedo, and German outfit Hannover 96 were all reportedly expressed interest in signing him for the 2019-20 season.

""Levante UD and Real Zaragoza have agreed to the assignment of Raphael Dwamena until the end of the season,"" Levante have announced on their official website.

""The 23-year-old Ghanaian striker arrived at the Orriols club last summer from FC Zurich and during the last campaign he participated in 15 official commitments and scored a goal.""

Dwamena's limited playing time was a result of fitness issues and a loss of form.

His lack of game time caused him a place in Ghana's squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt after a good showing at the start of the qualifiers for the competition.

The striker has also played for Austrian clubs Austria Lustenau and Liefering.

1427,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Flood politics and Indian water terrorism - The Nation,https://nation.com.pk/09-Sep-2020/flood-politics-and-indian-water-terrorism,"Share:

Floods symbolise miseries and destruction and their effects can be felt for a very long time, like wrong decisions by politicians drive nations backward and derail them from the path of progress and growth. I am worried to see the way politics is being played on floods where the governments, at both the federal and provincial levels are fighting on percentage sharing. The federal government represents the state and the state is the mother which has to be looked after by each and every citizen of the land.

I wish and hope that Imran khan should have been more tactful and gracious in working with CM Sindh, and CM Sindh should also have cooperated for the sake of the people of Karachi.

The media teams on both sides fight like kids and it looks as if both sides media teams are indulging in competition where they are winning at the cost of the public of Karachi who are already crushed with ethnic and poverty storms.

I hope my observations will be taken positively as Karachi is my city too, where I studied and started my civil service; I know the problems of Karachi.

My appeal to fellow politicians is to stop playing politics on floods and other natural disasters at the cost of your own poor masses.

Floods destroy everything that comes in their way and as a poor nation, we keep looking for support and help from rich countries at the cost of our self-respect.

Is it not the duty of the federal or provincial governments to sit with the map of Pakistan, analyse past destruction of the floods and design ways to channel flood water by creating channels based on surveys and hold this water in dams in all provinces?

We should know who is in the charge of it and which authority can take up with provincial authorities. Let me point out that it is the duty of water board which needs to be converted into Water board authority which should be empowered with adequate funding to manage the flood water and river water in such a way that each and every drop of water falls in the sea and every drop is used for agriculture to enhance our agricultural proceeds.

Despite being rich in water resources, we Pakistanis continue to face water scarcity every year because of the inability of authorities to properly use and manage these water resources for socioeconomic and environmental sustainability.

Poor water management is costing our country around 4-5 percent of GDP each year. These costs are caused by the floods and droughts that we face due to poor water supply and sanitation. We are endowed with water yet we do not make the best use of this.

The most alarming thing here is that the water crisis was rated as the biggest risk to Pakistan by the World Economic Forum and the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources. They also warned that the country could run dry by 2025.

Half of the annual rainfall in our country occurs in July and August, averaging about 255 millimetres in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about fifty millimetres per month.

This year in August, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall recorded over the last 90 years.

Pakistan receives 145 million-acre feet of water every year. However, only 14m acre-feet of water are preserved and we can meet the shortage if we have proper storage of rainwater and floodwater.

We have rivers and small streams coming from mountains finally meeting at Sutledge. The flows and diversions need to be examined scientifically with proper measurements to ensure the use of water for the betterment of local people; it is also important to analyse its miserable effects on the public and crops.

Let every town build a local rain pond which can store all the rainwater which can be used by them later for agricultural and irrigation purposes. Once a storage capacity is built, then a sprinkler irrigation system can be designed and introduced to better store and manage this precious water.

The water can also be converted into clean drinking water by using small plants. This sweet water can be used in multiple ways if properly managed by the local bodies.

We may also let the DC be the Head of a Rainwater Authority to ensure the governments indulgence and control. It is an extensive but very simple exercise and this should be opted for on a priority.

On one hand, we are facing water scarcity due to floods and poor water management while on the other, we are also facing water terrorism from India as it wants to either just stop/block our share of water with ulterior motives when we need it, or release extra water into our rivers to increase the flow causing floods in Pakistan and we know that both of these are dangerous for Pakistan.

As we are dependent on India for water, Modi, by blocking water, wants to deprive Pakistan of water to convert her into a desert. In fact, Modi is following a full-fledged anti-Pakistan agenda.

India has worked out that the one of the national key quotients is water and hence, India will continue to block water flow from India to Pakistan. PM Modi had already thrown the first water bomb on Pakistan in 2018 by blocking our legitimate natural watercourse. India had completed its construction of Kishanganga hydropower project on the Neelam River by diverting the watercourse through a 16 km tunnel, which is a clear violation of the Indus Water Treaty between the two countries.

The Kishanganga River, upon entering Pakistani territory is recognised as Neelam River that originates from Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and flows through the Gurez Valley to join Jhelum River near Muzaffarabad, at Domail, in Azad Jammu Kashmir. The construction of Kishanganga Dam is also in violation of Article III (4) of the Indus Water Treaty, which places an obligation or restriction on India not to construct any similar projects on western rivers, that is, on Indus, Chenab and Jhelum. Also, the construction of the Kishanganga project will adversely affect the Neelum-Jhelum project, as its power generation capacity will be reduced radically. In accordance with Article III (2) of Indus Water Treaty, India is also prohibited from developing any human made obstructions that shall have or may cause a change in the volume of the natural flow of western rivers.

The project includes a 121 feet tall concrete-face rock-fill dam, which will divert a portion of the river to the south through a 24 km tunnel. The diversion reduced the flow of water into Pakistan by about 11 percent in the summer and about 27 percent in the winter, which would be contrary to the Indus Water Treaty as the western rivers belong to Pakistan. It also contends that the diversion would result in an ecological disaster for the area.

India had signed all the important Conventions that, with complete effect, would ruin our valley totally. It is sad to note that neither our previous government nor the present one ever took this matter seriously whereas the water issue is supposed to be an issue of life and death.

My above suggestions are better in both ways to use the extra water for irrigation. In this way, induction terrorism by India via water flow can be controlled and we can convert this misery into success by irrigating barren land.

We need to bring an enactment/bill or a rainfall act to get these activities regulated as a national priority. I am confident that this law will be of great benefit for the nation.

As per many predictions, the next wars will be over sweetwater.

I wish our defence sector takes initiatives to take help of our soldiers to develop these water channels during peacetime with the help of the local public on a volunteer basis.

Let all the provinces and the federation give serious thought to my above proposals.

I will, however, move a bill on The Flood Control Act in order to store rainwater throughout the country, fixing the responsibility on concerned authorities.

We have water, all types of minerals, a fertile landscape, the best brains, four seasons, the best beaches, natural gas, green mountains with blue waters and lakes, deserts and forests, but we do not have the command of unity and the skills of governance. We are still slaves of false egos and are masters of self-destruction.

It is time for the leadership to wake up and not flood their national cause and interest. Lead your nation to drive to the valley of love and not hate to protect your future generations.

National unity Zindabad.

996,FL-2019-000084-IND,Flood management: Looking beyond defence strategies - Telegraph India,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/flood-management-looking-beyond-defence-strategies/cid/1701895,"Floods in the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Barak flood plains have become an annual phenomenon. The scale of the disaster is enormous, dwarfing the menace of floods in many other states. At its peak, the floods affected around 4,600 villages and 57.5 lakh people in Assam and 1,240 villages and 81.6 lakh people in North Bihar. The administration responded with rescue operations and set up relief camps and relief distribution centres. But these do not match the enormity of the disaster. A concerted effort towards flood governance through resilience building is the need of the hour.

There is a discernible pattern in the government’s response to floods: making long-term promises and implementing short-term disbursements. This year, with the floods at their peak, the Assam government reiterated its zeal to work towards a permanent solution to the flooding, including the proposal to form a Northeast water management body. This would be a welcome step, but only if the government takes bold steps to bring in a paradigm shift in flood governance.

The discourse of experts on flood management coalesces around flood defence strategies that aim to minimize the probability of flooding through structural interventions such as dams, embankments, bank strengthening works, rivets and spurs, and the dredging of rivers. The demand for dredging of the Brahmaputra to contain floods in Assam, or the proposal to construct a high dam in Nepal to prevent floods in Bihar, is a case in point. But such flood defence strategies have their own challenges.

Other options

Building dams on rivers, which carry huge quantities of silt, might actually be a fruitless exercise. With suboptimal reservoir management, the dams could enhance the vulnerability of the flood-prone populace through reservoir-induced flooding. Embankments suffer from the ‘build-neglect-rebuild’ syndrome. Unfortunately, they are better known for breaches than for protection. This year, around 24 of 33 districts in Assam have reported damages in embankments. In Bihar, the data on embankment are missing in the daily reports issued by the disaster management department. While the average weekly rainfall in 12 affected districts in Bihar between July 18 and 24 was mostly deficient, the number of villages and people adversely affected by floods continued to rise. One wonders if the embankments constricted the spread of floods or were aiding the process.

The discourse needs to move away from structural interventions towards the life and the livelihoods of communities residing in recurrent flood-prone areas. An entire gamut of flood risk management strategies needs to be simultaneously implemented through a combination of structural and other kinds of intervention. This implies investments in health, education and livelihoods as well as developing roads, culverts, sluice gates on embankments, and embankment rehabilitation. This would push the flood management paradigm beyond flood defence strategies to include flood risk preparation, mitigation, protection, and post-flood recovery strategies.

Such initiatives would require the participation of diverse stakeholders to be successful. If the frequency of high-intensity rainfall rises, embankments might still have an important protective role to play. But this will only be possible if the ‘build-neglect-rebuild’ syndrome gives way to participatory embankment management.

The simultaneous implementation of diversified strategies can lead to resilience building in recurrent flood-prone areas. Only then would populations succeed in resisting the adversities of flooding, absorb and recover from the devastation, and continue to adapt and transform their lives and livelihoods by maximizing the use of available resources.",2019-09-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['defence', 'management', 'structural', 'flood', 'embankments', 'strategies', 'floods', 'assam', 'villages', 'bihar', 'looking', 'flooding']",India,news article,English
736,Drought Sri Lanka,"Govt. faces crisis after crisis, but rides on | The Sundaytimes Sri Lanka - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/121028/columns/govt-faces-crisis-after-crisis-but-rides-on-18318.html,"Govt. faces crisis after crisis, but rides on By Our Political Editor = Spotlight shifts to Geneva again, while cold war with judiciary aggravates

= Gotabaya goes to New Delhi as govt. partners move to repeal 13th Amendment View(s): View(s):

World attention will be on Sri Lanka again on Thursday November 1. The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva will review the country’s record during a three and half hour session beginning 2.30 p.m.

Like for all other 193 member countries of the UN, the event is routine. Every four or five years, the human rights record of members is reviewed under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a mechanism which the UN believes improves the situation on the ground. However, for Sri Lanka the event is significant for many other reasons.

Three months after this event, in March next year, the UNHRC is set to review matters related to the US-backed resolution on Sri Lanka. This was adopted in March this year at the 19th sessions. Issues there extended from alleged human rights violations to probing “extrajudicial killings”. How the government responded to them is due to come up for scrutiny in March next year. In the light of this, several western nations are watching the UPR sessions closely. Their interest has been heightened by what they believe are newer developments in Sri Lanka including ‘alleged state interference in the judiciary,’ ‘no forward movement’ in the government’s reconciliation efforts and media freedom issues among other matters.

It comes as the cold war between the Executive and the Judiciary showed clear signs of heating up. This was after Pradeepa Gamini Suraj Kariyawasam of 170 Lake Drive, Colombo 8, was indicted before the Colombo Magistrate’s Court for causing a loss of more than Rs. 391 million to the government and for alleged corruption. The former chairman of the National Savings Bank (NSB) is the husband of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake. He had earlier served as chairman of the Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka.

The UPR itself has also sent ripples in government circles. These are over questions on the possible role of India, which is heading a troika that will prepare the report of the Working Group once the discussion on Thursday is over. It may be recalled that India voted for the US-backed resolution in March this year.

As revealed in the political commentary last week, relations between Colombo and New Delhi have hit a new low, largely due to that vote. The measures government leaders contemplated in the past weeks including the repeal of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution caused serious concerns in India. Under such circumstances, New Delhi’s role at UNHRC’s 22nd sessions in March next year is cause for study by the government. Though belatedly, some measures to rectify the situation have got under way as tensions continue to remain.

The current sessions of the UNHRC began on October 22 and will continue till November 5. Until last Thursday, the human rights records of eight countries have been reviewed. They were the Czech Republic, Argentina, Gabon, Ghana, Ukraine, Guatemala, Benin and the Republic of Korea.

Tomorrow (Monday) the case of Switzerland will come up followed by Pakistan and Zambia. Japan will follow on Wednesday. Besides Sri Lanka, the case of Peru will also be taken up on Thursday. Of significant interest during the current sessions is the fact that the largest number of speakers, 99 of them, want to address the Council on Sri Lanka’s case.

As a result, each speaker has been allotted only a minute and 22 seconds. This is the lowest among the time limits allotted. In the case of Peru where 55 speakers have registered so far with the Palais des Nationes, two minutes are allowed per speaker. Among the four countries on which NGOs, including those based in Colombo, are conducting meetings in Geneva on the sidelines of the UPR process, is Sri Lanka. Others are Guatemala, Japan and Pakistan.

A total of 42 UN member countries are reviewed each year during three Working Group sessions dedicated to 14 countries each. Already presented to the UNHRC is Sri Lanka’s national report which recalls the assurances given by the government during sessions in 2008, the action taken so far and the newer developments. India which heads a troika together with Spain and Benin will prepare the report of the Working Group.

Before the review, they will receive the written questions and/or representations on an issue raised by UNHRC members and relay it to the Sri Lanka delegation. Their report will contain a full account of the proceedings, and will be formulated with the involvement of Sri Lanka delegation and Secretariat staff. India will introduce the report on November 5 between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. The troika usually consists of three countries’ delegates assisting the review. They are picked by the drawing of lots from among UNHRC members and different troikas function for different countries.

Overshadowing the government’s concerns over UPR, are domestic issues. On Thursday, detectives of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) filed plaint against Kariyawasam before the Colombo Chief Magistrate, Rashmi Singappulli. The complainant in this case is Lakshmi Jayawickrema, Director General of the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption. Upon a detailed statement she had made to the CID, detectives said Kariyawasam has been charged with “causing a loss of Rs 391,137,554.33 to the state due to the transaction of purchasing 7,863,362 shares of The Finance Company during the period March 14, 2012 to May 3, 2012.”

This was whilst Kariyawasam was serving as chairman of the National Savings Bank. He is also accused of corruption for allegedly recommending his own name and that of Shan Chandrasekeran Shanmuganathan to be appointed as members of the Board of Directors of The Finance Company. According to the plaint, the offence had allegedly been committed on April 27, 2012 or on a date close to it. The Court has directed Kariyawasam to appear before it on February 28 next year — four months away.

In May, President Mahinda Rajapaksa ordered the cancellation of a stock exchange deal where the NSB had purchased 7,863,362 shares of The Finance Company. It was at a price of Rs 49.74 per share when it was claimed that the price of shares was as low as Rs 30. The NSB had paid Rs 391 million, though the transfer of the funds was reportedly halted. Compounding the situation was a full page advertisement the NSB directors inserted in the national media thereafter. In that, they declared they had decided not to pay NSB money and that the decision has been conveyed to the Treasury. Despite a public outcry then for a full-fledged investigation to expose all those involved, a probe by CID detectives came amidst growing tensions between the Executive and the Judiciary. In a front page report in the Sunday Times of September 23 the Chairman of the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption, retired Supreme Court Justice Jagath Balapatabendi, declined to comment on why this particular inquiry was being fast tracked.

The plaint has listed 51 documents and 26 witnesses. Among these are:

Documents submitted by Taprobane Securities (Pvt) Ltd to the National Savings Bank (NSB) to purchase shares of The Finance Company.

A letter addressed to Shan Shanmuganathan by the NSB Chairman on 21.03.2012.

A proposed agreement between the NSB and The Finance Company on confidentiality of non-disclosure of information.

A letter addressed to General Manager (Monitoring) of the Colombo Stock Exchange Renuka Wijewardena by a Member of the Board of Directors of Taprobane Securities (Pvt) Ltd, N.S.Niles, dated 24.07.2012.

The news of Kariyawasam’s indictment was the talking point in Hulftsdorp, the nerve centre of the country’s legal profession and the judiciary. It came in the backdrop of persistent speculation that plans were under way by the government to impeach the Chief Justice, a claim which was denied by some government ministers.

However, the matter did come up for discussion when a team of ministers and legal advisors to the government met at ‘Temple Trees’ late last month to determine a course of action. This is in the aftermath of a three-page statement issued by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). In that, the JSC, referring to their Chairman and two members (Chief Justice and two Supreme Court Judges) said they were invited for a meeting with the President. It alleged that there was “interference in the judiciary” and said there was “proof” of such instances. However, the charge was strongly refuted by the Presidential Secretariat which said the invitation was to discuss “budgetary allocations” and matters relating to “scholarships for judges”.

Several leading lawyers in Hulftsdorp were speculating whether the indictment of Kariyawasam, either by design or otherwise, was intended to trigger any resignations in the higher echelons of the judiciary. However, legal sources close to the judiciary discounted such a possibility on the grounds that “those in the highest levels of the judiciary have no cause to resort to such a course of action.

They will continue in office.” One highly placed source said, “Any such move would only endorse” what he called “allegations even before they are proved in a court of law.” In the light of this, even moves by some influential sections to force the resignation of the JSC Secretary Manjula Tilakaratna have not been successful. An informal plea had been made by a member of the judiciary, an official source said.

External Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris, who was given a telling off last month by the President for his advice on the sharp differences between the Executive and the Judiciary, told Parliament that Tilakaratna’s appointment was “unconstitutional” but did not explain why the government had allowed him to remain in that office for more than a year. Tilakaratna was previously Assistant Secretary and later Deputy Secretary of the JSC, both for a cumulative period of three years. The Sunday Times learnt that much before Tilakaratna, who is said to be 29th on the list of succession, another candidate, the brother of a former Chief Justice who was also 29th, served as Secretary to the JSC.

The bone of contention that brought tensions between the Executive and the Judiciary to the fore, it is now confirmed, is the Divineguma Bill. The Supreme Court ruled last month that “we make a determination in terms of Article 120 read with Article 123 of the Constitution that the Bill in question is in respect of matters set out in the Provincial Council List and shall not become law unless it has been referred by His Excellency the President to every Provincial Council as required by Article 154 (G) (3) of the Constitution.” The Bill was introduced in Parliament on September 18. The Sunday Times has learnt that an initiative for the Attorney General to move for a revision on that (September 18) morning, before the SC determination was read out by the Speaker, Chamal Rajapaksa, later that afternoon, did not materialise. Hence, the government heeded the SC ruling and sought the approval of all Provincial Councils for the Bill. A controversy arose over Northern Province Governor G.A. Chandrasiri, approving it in the absence of an elected Northern Provincial Council.

That the timing of the indictment of Kariyawasam came in a week when the Supreme Court was hearing the cases of eleven petitioners and around ten intervenient petitioners over the Divineguma Bill has also given rise to many opinions in legal circles. One of the points discussed was a Sunday Times news item in its front page on October 7 quoting an unnamed member of the Bribery and Corruption Commission saying that after recording Kariyawasam’s statement the investigations had revealed that there was no case to file. The story remained un-contradicted.

The fundamental rights cases before the Supreme Court sitting as the country’s Constitutional Court were heard by a bench comprising Chief Justice Bandaranayake, Justice Nimal Gamini Ameratunga and Justice K. Sripavan. Six petitioners challenged the Divineguma Bill saying it was inconsistent with the Constitution. They wanted the court to determine whether it needed to be passed by a two thirds majority in Parliament and approved by the people at a referendum to become law.

There were petitioners who supported the Bill as well. They intervened to argue that the Bill is consistent with the Constitution; therefore, only it needed to be passed by a simple majority in Parliament.

The court directed the counsel to file comprehensive written submissions as early as possible on Wednesday (October 24) morning.

Thereafter, the Court declared it would send its determination to the President and the Speaker within the time period stipulated in the Constitution.

On Monday (October 22) the Supreme Court also put off for November 12 the reference made to it by the Court of Appeal regarding the questions of law that arose consequent to the hearing of a case in the Court of Appeal filed by Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian Mavai Senathirajah.

When sittings resume, the Court would consider appointing a five-judge Bench to determine and interpret these questions of law; whether the governor of a province could include in his expression of opinion, the views of the Provincial Council, when the Council stands dissolved and also whether such interpretation and determination of the constitutionality comes within Article 125 of the Constitution which empowers the Supreme Court to interpret and determine such references. M. A. Sumanthiran, a TNA MP and Counsel for Senathirajah, requested the Supreme Court to refer this to a five-Judge Bench.

The cold war between the Executive and the Judiciary also drew the attention of the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI). A statement issued by it on Friday night from London said:

“In a confidential letter to the President of Sri Lanka, His Excellency Mr Mahinda Rajapaksa, and to the Sri Lankan authorities, the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) expressed grave concern about recent threats to the independence of the judiciary and called for the rule of law to be adhered to, and promoted, in Sri Lanka.

“The letter follows disturbing reports of a physical attack on the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), Manjula Tilakaratne, on 7 October 2012 at a time of reported heightened tension between the JSC – an independent body made up of members of the judiciary that deal with all judicial promotions and appointments – and the Sri Lankan Government. The attack is widely perceived as an attempt to intimidate the judiciary and interfere with the independence of the profession.

“Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, Co-Chair of the IBAHRI said: ‘We consider the recently reported attack on the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission in Sri Lanka to be extremely serious, requiring prompt and proper investigation by the appropriate authorities.’ Elaborating, Baroness Kennedy QC added, ‘An independent judiciary functions as a critical institutional mechanism providing a check and balance on the executive and legislative branches of a democratic society. The independence of this organ is vital, not only to ensure that the judiciary is able to discharge its functions without fear or favour, but also to uphold public confidence in the legal system as a whole and the due administration of justice���..’

“Sternford Moyo Co-Chair of the IBAHRI said, ‘We appeal to the Sri Lankan authorities to prevent the harassment and intimidation of judges and magistrates in accordance with Article 111 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka which provides that judges will be protected in the exercise of their judicial powers and functions’. He added,’The need to develop and preserve an independent judiciary free from political influence and with adequate guarantees to maintain its impartiality is of prime importance to the protection of the rule of law. As a member state of the United Nations Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Basic principles on the Independence of the Judiciary which states that “the independence of the judiciary shall be guaranteed by the State”and that “it is the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary.”

Meanwhile, on Friday, the government hurriedly disassociated itself from calls by some ministers for the repeal of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. Most vociferous among them were Jathika Hela Urumaya frontliner and Minister Champika Ranawaka, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader and Minister Dinesh Gunawardene and National Freedom Front leader and Minister Wimal Weerawansa. Their parties launched campaigns after remarks supporting the repeal were first made by Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He left for New Delhi on Tuesday and returned to Colombo on Thursday. His visit was in connection with annual consultations in the field of defence, security and other bilateral matters for which arrangements have been going on for many weeks now. The event, however, coincided within the week he made the call for the repeal of the 13th Amendment, a by-product of the controversial Indo-Lanka Agreement of 1987.

The move to repeal the 13th Amendment caused serious concerns in New Delhi. According to diplomatic sources, both in Colombo and in New Delhi, the Indian government considered any action to repeal the amendment as “unilateral” and held the view that such steps could force similar responses from them. They could cover issues where India has already ceded to Sri Lanka’s requests. Such a development, one need hardly say, would have escalated the cold war and the shadow boxing that is now going on between Colombo and New Delhi. The Sunday Times learns that Indian authorities raised the matter with Defence Secretary Rajapaksa but no details of what transpired were available.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa who returned to Colombo after a visit to Dubai on Wednesday night asked official government spokesperson and Minister Keheliya Rambukwella to make clear that there was no government decision to go ahead with the repeal of the 13th Amendment. First, parts of the transcript of what he said:

“Q: There are conflicting reports on the Government’s position on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution with the Defence Secretary saying that it should be abolished. What is the Government’s position?

“A: The Thirteenth Amendment is a part of our Constitution and those of us in Parliament and the government are bound by the Constitution. But Constitutions can get amended. Sometimes we are mocked at saying we have amended the Constitution 18 times but the Indian Constitution has been amended more than 200 times and India is the world’s largest democracy. It is not a question that affects democracy. A Constitution can be amended from time to time to suit the requirements of that country. The Thirteenth Amendment is clearly a part of the Constitution but people’s representatives in Parliament are entitled to air their views on it. I think the Defence Secretary has spoken in his capacity as a public official and more as the Secretary to the Ministry of Urban Development. It has been said several times that there have been some issues in that area.

“Q: What is the final decision on the 13th Amendment?

“A: There is no move by anyone to bring it before the Cabinet or bring about a policy change. They have expressed an opinion. There is nothing official.

“Q: That means as at present the government supports the 13th Amendment?

“A: It is not a question of support. It is part of the Constitution and we are all bound by it.

“Q: The Government, in the past has spoken of 13 plus? Where does it stand on that?

“A: The government has said we are looking at 13 plus. The plus was related to the establishment of a Senate or the Upper House. Even I was present with his Excellency the President when he announced it to the Hon. Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh. I was present personally there. My President said that 13 plus �.what we are looking at is the Upper House. The idea is to bring the minorities from various provinces to the centre.

“Q: What happens if the TNA does not come to the PSC, the national issue will not be solved, how does the government hope to proceed from there?

“A: As a main opposition party the TNA will be given the opportunity and thereafter if they do not come the government will have to take its own decisions. The government will have to decide on the most suitable way of resolving the problem.”

Spokesperson Rambukwella admits that he was a witness when President Rajapaksa assured Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2010 that the 13th Amendment would be implemented and there would be a “Plus” or more in the form of a Senate. He is now categorical, at least for the moment, that the 13th Amendment would remain notwithstanding all the pressures to repeal it.

It was only in January this year Indian External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna, who submitted his resignation on Friday ahead of an impending cabinet reshuffle this weekend in New Delhi, told a news conference in Colombo that during talks with President Rajapaksa, he had agreed to enforce the 13th Amendment and go beyond it. Minister G.L. Peiris had been asked for confirmation of the President’s promise to go beyond the 13th Amendment before Krishna made that announcement in Colombo, and Peiris had confirmed the statement. However, Rajapaksa, during a meeting with national newspaper editors soon after the Krishna visit while confirming that he had said so, added the rider that the ‘plus’ to the 13th Amendment needs to be decided by Parliament.

If some partners of the UPFA are in favour of repealing the 13th Amendment, there are others who are opposed to it. One is the Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL). Its leader and Senior Minister D.E.W. Gunasekera told the Sunday Times, “The 13th Amendment came as a result of the interest shown by India to disarm the militant groups including the LTTE. One of aspects of the 13th Amendment was the expansion of democracy. The objective of this was to devolve powers to the north and east. Eventually this system was introduced to the entire country’.

“In fact I asked the former President J.R. Jayewardene as to why he introduced this to the entire country. His response was that he did not want to see the same thing that happened to S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike happening to him. I am the only member who was in the opposition who voted in favour of this amendment. But due to the conflict, the people in the North and East did not benefit from this amendment. It is only now the people in the East have started benefiting from the powers. The President has promised that elections will be held in the north and similar powers will be given to them.

“I cannot understand why some of the members in the Government are campaigning to abolish the 13th Amendment after the President gave an assurance that elections will be held in the Northern Province. It is very important that we suggest an alternative, if we want to abolish the 13thAmendment. I do not see any benefit in scrapping the 13th Amendment. I think it is a disadvantage to abolish this now. Abolishing this would only justify the struggle carried out by the armed groups during the conflict’.

However, Vijitha Herath, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parliamentarian for Gampaha District, held a different view. He told the Sunday Times, “The call for abolishing the 13th Amendment is similar to a tele-drama. It is directed by the same director with the old actors. Some people in the Government including Cabinet spokesperson Keheliya Rambukwella are saying they have no plans to abolish the 13th Amendment while the others in the government are campaigning to do so.

“One of the reasons is the issue in getting the Divineguma Bill passed in the Northern Provincial Council which has not been constituted. This is a direct message to the Judiciary. That is to say that the Provincial Councils are something which is not necessary, though the Supreme Court wanted the approval of all Provincial Councils for the Bill.

“Also the Budget is coming up on November 8. Our understanding is that it only has the details of the debts and the loans. There is nothing beneficial to the people. Therefore they have started a new debate on the need to abolish the 13th Amendment. The Northern Provincial Council elections are due. It is obvious that the elections will be unfavourable to the Government. Bringing up this campaign would lead to a delay in conducting the elections as the government will now claim there is a debate whether the Provincial Council system is needed. Our opinion is that the 13th Amendment is not a solution to the ethnic problem and therefore a solution which offers equality and grants the rights of all communities should be offered”.

With only two months to go for a new year, the government is burdened with several issues. Even if the budget offers relief in some form, the public have to cope with a number of price increases announced in the past weeks. It takes away from one hand what is given by the other. On the international front, human rights issues remain a scourge.

Momentarily at least, efforts are being made to revert to the status quo ante where Sri Lanka-India relations are concerned. Now, the cold war between the Executive and the Judiciary has heightened. With all this, the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration seems completely undeterred. Why not, when a lame duck opposition’s silence has become deafening on most issues thus negating the checks and balances needed in a healthy democracy.

1030,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Read “I discovered water damage in my home. Will insurance cover me?” - MoneySense,https://www.moneysense.ca/spend/insurance/home-insurance/home-insurance-coverage-leaks-flooding/,"A: While water damage is almost always the same—destroyed floors, mouldy drywall, and potentially destroyed electrical and heating systems—the cause can significantly change whether or not the damage is covered by your insurance.

Turns out, how water enters your home dictates whether or not the damage will be paid by you, out of pocket, or covered by your home insurance policy.

This should cause all homeowners concern. Why? Because flooding happens so frequently. Setting aside the incidental floods, such as pipes breaking or washing machines leaking, natural floods, such as those caused by snowmelt runoff or raised river banks, occur fives times as often as wildfires. In fact, natural overland floods are the second most frequent natural disaster in Canada, according to Dan Sandink, director of research at the Institute of Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR).

Sadly, residents in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick are now intimately aware of how devastating a flood can be to both property as well as to someone’s financial well-being. In April 2019, CTV News calculated that 6,425 homes had been flooded in Quebec alone. Another 3,508 were surrounded by water. Another 21 Ottawa homes were voluntarily evacuated, while 80 roads in New Brunswick had been closed.

According to Canadian Forces, 2,000 troops were deployed to Eastern Canada to help with flood efforts, and more than one million sandbags were used in the nation’s capital, Ottawa.

This doesn’t bode well for homeowners across Canada, who will eventually feel the burden of rising premiums to cover insured losses. This is on top of the $1.9 billion in insured losses that Canadians already sustained in 2018—the fourth-highest amount on record, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

What’s worse is knowing that a standard homeowners’ policy (or tenant insurance) doesn’t provide coverage in the event of flood damage. While government relief may be available for uninsurable damage, that relief is often slow to materialize and insufficient to cover the cost of repair, leaving families to pick up the pieces.

You may be able to purchase flood insurance—known as overland coverage—depending on whether or not you live in a flood-prone zone. And even if it is available in your area, however, you must also purchase sewer back-up coverage, which is typically far more available.",2019-10-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['relief', 'water', 'natural', 'available', 'homeowners', 'floods', 'canada', 'flood', 'discovered', 'cover', 'damage', 'insurance']",Canada,news article,English
1017,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"Flooding In Canada Is A Big Problem, But Few Canadians Know They're At Risk: Study - Huffington Post Canada",https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/05/16/flooding-in-canada_n_16645746.html,"It’s hard not to sympathize with flood victims, but a number of Canadians still think that such a devastating event could never happen to them.

Nearly all of the 2,300 people surveyed for a new University of Waterloo study did not know or weren't sure that they lived in a designated flood risk area. Almost 90 per cent were unaware that their home was in an area vulnerable to flooding.

Half of them said they weren't worried about it happening either.

That lack of awareness is a problem, according to the researchers.

Canada has seen about 80 flood events since 2000, and related costs are going up.

Development in flood-prone areas is a contributing factor, as are shifting weather patterns, more people living in basements, and outdated dams, dikes and stormwater infrastructure.

Canadians personally shoulder about $600 million each year in losses related to flooding.

“It is Canada’s most common and costly natural hazard,” the researchers wrote.

It’s not yet known how much flood damage in Quebec will cost after thousands of people were forced from their homes, but other past catastrophes weren’t cheap.

The 2013 floods in Alberta, considered the priciest disaster in Canadian history, cost more than $6 billion.

Floods also have social implications — physical and mental health issues, job loss and family disruption.

But while 83 per cent of respondents in the study said they thought they had a responsibility to protect their property, less than a third of them used flood protection measures like sump pumps, rain barrels or water-resistant materials in the basement.

And half said they weren’t interested in buying overland flood insurance.

“Canadians’ self-assessment of flood risk does not align with actual risk,” the authors wrote.

Feds set to help less with disaster relief

And what Canadians might not know is that the federal government is trying to offload more responsibility for dealing with the issue onto them.

The Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements program, which gives provinces and territories financial help, can't continue doling out the amount that it does, a Parliamentary Budget Office report found last year. While the budget for the program isn’t expected to grow, costs are continuing to do so.

As a result, the feds have invested money in flood mitigation, but are also upping the thresholds that provinces and territories must meet to receive money, according to the University of Waterloo study. Several private insurance companies also now offer flood insurance, so some provinces now tell their residents that flooding doesn’t qualify for disaster help.

“These changes could have serious implications for Canadians,"" the study authors wrote. ""By reducing the availability of disaster assistance and tightening the eligibility to receive it, the federal and provincial governments have shifted more financial liability and responsibility to homeowners.""

But as they note, governments, realtors and insurers also have an obligation to make sure people know they’re at risk in the first place and what to do. Only a quarter of the study respondents said they’d been approached about flood insurance.

More than 90 per cent agreed that flood risk maps should be public. Roughly the same number also agreed that home sellers should be required to tell buyers about potential risk if it's in a designated flood risk area and wanted to know whether their home was in one.

“Homeowners can’t afford to remain in the dark about their options and responsibilities,” said Jason Thistlethwaite, a study co-author and University of Waterloo assistant professor, in a press release.

And the need for people to be aware will only grow. While recent floods have been devastating, things may only get worse, if climate change has anything to say about it.

1563,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Flooding displaces hundreds of people around Kenya's Lake Naivasha - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-kenya-idUSL8N2HW0SR,"LAKE NAIVASHA, Kenya, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Months of sustained torrential rains have caused a lake in Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley to flood its banks, forcing hundreds of people to flee their homes and farms, in what officials say shows the devastating impact of climate change on East Africa.

Lake Naivasha has expanded to 173 square kilometres, from 112 square kilometres just 10 years ago, mainly due to increased rainfall and siltation, which pushes the waters outwards, said Cyrus Oguna, the Kenyan government spokesman.

In many other parts of the East Africa region too, heavy rains have ravaged crops and rising waters from lakes and rivers have destroyed shoreline communities.

â??This is a global phenomenon which has come to Kenya now. Climate change is now affecting the East African region,â? said Festus Ngâ??eno, the executive in charge of water in Nakuru county, where Lake Naivasha is situated.

Ruth Wanjiru, forced to leave her home in the shoreline village of Kihoto in May, said she had lived in the area for nearly three decades but had never seen flooding on this scale.

â??It all started in April. The water started rising, coming to the residential areas. It got worse and I had to move out,â? said the 47-year-old mother, one of around 500 people displaced by the flooding from Lake Naivasha.

She watched crestfallen as five young men waded through thigh-high waters to salvage windows and doors from the house she had to abandon.

â??I am now trying to save the little that I can,â? said Wanjiru, adding that she would sell retrievable parts of the house for food and other essentials.

Ten small rental houses she had built in the area have also been abandoned, depriving her of her primary source of income.

Some residents are afraid of wild animals that now roam about the area.

â??We are now having hippopotamuses right before our eyes,â? said Esther Gichuki. â??We cannot walk around after 7 p.m.â? (Writing by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Duncan Miriri and Gareth Jones)",2020-11-10 08:00:00+00:00,"['lake', 'started', 'square', 'kenyas', 'naivasha', 'shoreline', 'rising', 'east', 'water', 'flooding', 'waters', 'hundreds', 'displaces', 'wanjiru']",Kenya,news article,English
625,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Greater Accra Region Leads HIV Infection - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907180515.html,"The Greater Accra Region recorded the highest number of new HIV infections last year with about 4,593 people contracting the disease.

Currently, the region leads with the most number of persons living with HIV (77,132) across the country and though out of the figure, about 28,000 people were using anti-retroviral (ART), close to 3,000 people died in the region of the disease in 2018.

The 2018 HIV/AIDS National Estimates and Projections released by the Ghana AIDs Commission (GAC) in Accra yesterday, showed that 2.06 per cent of the adult population in the region were at risk of the virus.

The report, which pegged national estimated number of persons living with HIV (PLHIV) in the country at 334,714, with 19,931 new infections, cited the Ashanti Region as the second with the highest HIV prevalence (75,675).

Of the top 20 districts in the country with highest HIV prevalence, the Lower Manya Krobo in the Eastern Region topped with 5.56 per cent, followed by Tano South (5.35 per cent) in the Ahafo Region, with Atiwa West in the Eastern Region recording the lowest prevalence rate (3.05 per cent).

Acting Director General of GAC, Mr Kyeremeh Atuahene, throwing more light on the situation, said adult HIV prevalence in the country stood at 1.69 per cent with estimated AIDS deaths across all ages at 14,181.

Nonetheless, based on the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target by 2020, he said of the total number of PLHIVs in the country, about 185,000 people had been diagnosed, 113,000 put on ART and 75,000 had attained viral suppression.

""This is where we are and we need to do more to achieve the targets. We may not reach it by 2020 but we have put in place measures to achieve it shortly after the deadline,"" he stated.

Of particular concern to Mr Atuahene was the increasing number of orphaned children due to HIV/ AIDS, which had reached 226,463, indicating the commission's resolve to offer support to such orphans.

""The commission recognises the need to support such children, particularly those who have been abandoned by families after their parents died of HIV but we are constrained by funds.

""However, we have decided to establish the National AIDS Fund and it's in the process of operationalisation, once it is done, such children will be highly considered.""

Dr Stephen Ayisi Addo, Programme Manager for the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), said new data gathered showed increase of new infections in urban centres where key populations (sex workers, men who have sex with men etc) were responsible for the spread of the infection were mostly located.

""HIV in Ghana is now urbanised,"" he said, citing the tendency to indulge in high-risk sexual interaction, monetisation of sex, migration, especially by the youth to major centres and unwillingness to undergo HIV test as accounting for the rise in new infections.

Dr Ayisi Addo, however, mentioned interventions including intensifying public campaigns on the disease, particularly on the popular ABC - Abstinence, Be Faithful and Condom Use, school engagements, adherence to treatment to suppress the virus among others to achieve the global agenda.

""We want to make it clear that there is no cure yet for HIV and people infected will have to adhere to treatment which is free instead of resorting to other medications which is costly and pose higher risk to patients.

""We also need to stop the stigma and discrimination against infected people to enable them live to their full potential,"" he advised.

The Edo State government said it has appointed a contractor for the flood control project at Ughoha community in Esan South Local Government Area of the state, signalling the commencement of the project.

The project coordinator, Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP), Tom Obaseki, made this known on Wednesday at Ugboha, while introducing the project contractor to the community.

Mr Obaseki assured the people that the best contractor was selected to handle the project because of the importance of the community to the state.

Ugboha is very important to us and we thank the community for producing great men that have made so many positive contributions to the development of Edo State.

We made sure that in the process of recruiting a contractor for the job, we went for the best of the best, he stated.

Mr Obaseki solicited the support of the traditional head of Ugboha and members of the community for the smooth implementation of the project.

We want to solicit the support of your highness and the entire people of the kingdom so that there will not be hitches down the line.

Every time we waste or lose cannot be recovered. So, we want to seek your support in providing the enabling environment and security for the contractor, he said.

The traditional head of Ugboha, Ukato Steven II, assured that the community would provide a conducive environment for the successful and timely delivery of the project.

Leaders in Kikuube and Hoima districts are demanding the government to allocate part of Kabwoya Kaiso-Tonya Community Wildlife conservation area to resettle thousands of flood victims.



Kabwoya Kaiso-Tonya Community wildlife conservation area is situated in Kabwoya and Buseruka sub-counties in Hoima and Kikuube districts.



Over 20,000 people have been displaced by floods in the two districts of Hoima and Kikuube since March.



The most affected landing sites in Hoima are Tonya, Kijangi, Kaiso, Rwentali, Hoimo, Fofo, Mbegu, Waaki and Kiryamboga among others, while the affected areas in Kikuube include Nkondo, Sebigoro, Ususa, Senjojo, Wangjok, Busiki and Nsonga.



The flood victims have sought refuge in churches and schools while others are sleeping out in coldness under trees as the floods continue to ravage the area. Area leaders and the affected persons say the only option is to resettle them to the game reserve.



Peter Kyasimire a resident of Nkondo landing site in Kabwoya Sub County in Kikuube district says the government should consider the lives of the people and have them resettled.

Joyce Akumu who was displaced by floods at Kaiso landing site says currently she is settling at Kaiso Primary School with her five children since she has nowhere to construct another house because her house was completely submerged by floods.



Rashid Sunday, a resident of Sebigoro landing site says he was hit hard by the floods that submerged his house and currently he has nowhere to go.



He wants the government to come to their rescue and allocate part of the Kabwoya-Kaiso-Tonya community wildlife conservation area to resettle them.

In a much-hyped boxing bout, ‘The Problem Child’ improved to 3-0 as a professional and sent out an emphatic statement as he stopped his vastly experienced opponent inside two minutes of the first round.

Askren saw his defences opened up by a left jab and was then hit flush with a crunching overhand right that sent him sprawling to the canvas.

‘Funky’ took the eight count and wanted to continue, but the referee deemed him in no fit state to do so.

On the undercard, Regis Prograis beat Ivan Redkach on a technical decision after a bizarre end to their fight in which the Ukrainian was stretchered out of the ring.

Steve Cunningham also defeated former UFC heavyweight champion Frank Mir and there were wins for billionaire London businessman Joe Fournier as well as undefeated prospects Quinton Randall and Junior Younan.

The phenomenon is repeated across numerous communities in West Africa, where traffic and business come to a standstill for hours or days, waiting for the streets to drain. Sometimes the flooding becomes deadly.

Last year, hundreds of people were killed in a mudslide in Freetown, Sierra Leone, along a hillside where residents of the booming city had cleared forests to build homes. Victims were buried alive in their houses and vehicles. Environmental groups and local organizations had been warning for years that the development was risky.

In Nigeria, local television stations reported that more than 100 communities had flooded and broadcast images of muddy waters reaching the rooftops of clusters of homes. Some people died when flooding caused their homes to collapse, according to Agence France-Presse.

Local leaders in some areas were advising residents to evacuate. Officials in Anambra State set up 28 camps for fleeing residents. Thousands of people fled their homes in Cross River State, officials there said, noting that many of them lived in swampy areas or along waterways.

41,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Hazelnuts shortfall forces buyers to shell out 60% more for supplies - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/13/hazelnuts-shortfall-price-rise-harvest-turkey,"Chocolate makers already choking on the rising price of cocoa face another price crunch in commodity markets after warnings of a global shortage of hazelnuts.

The price of hazelnuts has increased by more than 60% this year to a 10-year high after bad weather devastated crops in Turkey, the world's biggest producer.

One Scottish manufacturer that sells bags of mixed nuts has already decided to take hazelnuts out of the pack, according to an industry source.

About 70% of the world's hazelnuts are grown on steep slopes near Turkey's Black Sea coast, but this year's harvest is likely to be sharply down after hail storms and frost in late March destroyed hazel flowers at a critical moment in the growing season.

The price of the nuts has reached $10,500 (£6,300) per tonne, compared with $6,500 (£3,900) per tonne in February, according to Michael Stevens, a trader at Edinburgh-based Freeworld Trading.

The full extent of the damage is not yet clear, but the Turkish industry is braced for a harvest that could be down to 540,000 tonnes, against pre-frost expectations of up to 800,000 tonnes.

It comes as food companies also face rocketing prices for almonds, cocoa and coffee – a potential nightmare for those who enjoy a Ferrero Rocher with their after-dinner coffee.

The hazelnut price rise will be particularly tough for buyers at some of the world's biggest confectionery companies, such as Cadbury, whose Whole Nut bar – made with hazelnuts – is one of its bestsellers.

A spokesman for the American conglomerate Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, declined to comment on whether it would increase the price of its chocolate bars. Mondelez is the name of the snack company spun off by America's Kraft, which completed a controversial takeover of the British chocolate maker in 2010.

Ferrero, the Piedmont-based company that makes Ferrero Rocher and Nutella, the cocoa and hazelnut spread, will also be watching the market closely. Ferrero is the world's biggest buyer of hazelnuts, using 25% of the world's supply and making 180m kg of the spread every year, according to the Italian Trade Agency.

But the company could be insulated from the latest price moves following its recent purchase of Turkey's largest hazelnut processor, Oltan.

The deal to purchase Oltan, which has eight factories shelling, chopping and roasting nuts, is reported to have unsettled other confectioners, which are uncomfortable that one of their suppliers has fallen into the hands of a rival.

Meanwhile, almond prices are at a nine-year high, because of drought in California, the world's biggest grower, while a prolonged dry spell in Brazil in January and February reduced the coffee harvest, pushing up prices.

Not all the current price moves in food commodities are due to unseasonal weather. The price of cocoa has been driven to a three-year high with consumers in China and India getting a taste for chocolate.

The hazelnut price surge has left market players reeling. ""Buyers are living hand to mouth,"" said Stevens. ""Some people had contracts already [pre-dating the frost] and they are not going to get them. A lot of people are still uncovered in the market and people that thought they were covered are now in the market again.""",2014-08-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['forces', 'hazelnuts', 'nuts', 'supplies', 'shortfall', 'buyers', 'biggest', 'market', 'shell', 'worlds', 'price', 'harvest', 'high', '60', 'cocoa', 'hazelnut']",China,news article,English

Nairobi residents woke up to heavy traffic snarl ups and flooded roads as heavy rains pounded the capital city on Monday morning.

The rains that pounded the city overnight left flood-prone areas submerged, with emergency services concerned on the fate of people living near river banks and riparian areas.

The Kenya Meteorological Department had over the weekend warned of heavy downpours in the city that will continue throughout the week.

A forecast of the rainfall situation by the weatherman indicated that there will be heavy rainfall in the Nairobi region, Central Kenya and parts of the Eastern Region from Saturday.

â??Showers and thunderstorms are expected over most places on Saturday night, while rains are expected during the week followed by a thunderstorm,â? Met said.

Director of Meteorological Services Stella Aura, in the statement, called for measures to be put in place to avoid loss of lives and property during the rains.

Aura has warned Kenyans, especially motorists and pedestrians, to be on the lookout and be cautious while passing through moving water.

â??Itâ??s going to rain heavy tonight. Everyone using the roads either as a driver or pedestrian is advised to observe extra caution. Avoid passing through moving waters. Keep safe,â? she said.

On Monday morning, along Mombasa Road, near Imara Daima estate, motorists were forced to use only one lane with access to several offices completely cut-off by the raging waters.

Some blamed the situation on the construction of the expressway saying contractors were spilling rainwater from their site onto the road.

Others blamed the perennial flooding challenge on poor drainage in the area.

@ntsa_kenya @KURAroads why should this happen?ð???ð?¤¦ð?¾â?â??ï¸ Unnecessary traffic on Mombasa Road at Imara Daima to town. @Ma3Route Complete flooding giving pedestrians absolutely nowhere to pass!! Shame on you for this nonsense. pic.twitter.com/tvsdAJUhzk â?? Kulanini by Aura ð??°ð??ª (@kulanini_) May 10, 2021

Mark Lukale said that the road from Garden estate to Windsor â??is now a big river! From Ruaka to Ndenderu is a nightmare. These roads need a 4Ã?4. Balaa tupu na hii mvua.â?

The weatherman only replied by telling him that there was more rain coming.

Following the night rains, most roads in Nairobi were flooded but the most affected areas were Wetlands, South C, Thika Road, Parklands and Kilimani.

1291,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Sailing the Seas on Reused Plastic - Earth Island Journal,https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/articles/entry/sailing-seas-reused-plastic/,"It is here that a boat called the FlipFlopi sails the crystal waters of the Indian Ocean. The FlipFlopi is a traditional Swahili dhow, a sailing vessel long associated with the Indian Ocean. But this particular boat is different than other dhows. The FlipFlopi is the first Swahili dhow made completely of plastic waste.

I first visited Lamu in 2016. The wild nature, warm sea, and alluring coastal culture caught my heart, but what called me to return many times was my now dear friend Ali Skanda — the master dhow builder who constructed the FlipFlopi, and a man I have come to admire for his effortless courage in creating a world of new possibilities.

Skanda is a ninth generation traditional Swahili dhow builder. He has inherited more than just skills. His ancestors have left him with the confidence to be able to imagine something that has never existed — and build it, bringing it to life. “When I see a piece of tree, I can imagine a chair, or bed …. and I think, I could do this and that. Some people see just firewood. Even with leaves and barks, I can imagine something.”

As waves brought mounds of plastic debris — sandals, water bottles, and other materials — to the beaches of Lamu, Skanda’s dhow building training kicked in. “Because of the problems of pollution taking place today, I feel it necessary to come up with solutions and solve this problem,” he says. Where others saw trash, he saw building materials. And then, he envisioned a dhow — and a way to build on a traditional skill to address Lamu’s present plastic problem. “I had a vision,” he says, that extends beyond what we inherit from our parents. “We need to move ahead, capture other parts from somewhere and add our skills. As the world is growing, we need to grow too.”

In September 2016, as part of this vision, Skanda organized a community beach clean-up and collected tons of discarded plastic. His team took the waste to a local facility to melt and repurpose it into synthesized plastic lumber, which he then used to construct the boat.

The dazzling rainbow dhow made its maiden voyage along the East African coast in 2019. “We started with the aim of awareness first,” says Skanda. The FlipFlopi team has welcomed many on board, with a particular interest in engaging youth. “One of our main goals is to drive this message to the younger generation, so they understand what the world is,” says Skanda. “We have caused problems for them, but they should stop [this problem] as leaders of tomorrow.”

Since 2019, Skanda’s efforts have been recognized by the UN Environment Programme, the World Economic Forum, and international media. While many entrepreneurs propose technological fixes to our ecological crises, Skanda’s dhow shows that the wisdom of yesterday can be part of our sustainable tomorrow, and that innovation can persist in tradition.

The recent successful expedition on Lake Victoria across three countries demonstrated that there is strong will to address the elimination of unnecessary single use plastics across the region as one unified voice. It is estimated that the FlipFlopi has directly engaged over 10,000 people, and 200 million through media campaigning. From fishermen to County Governors to the Queen of Buganda, the call to action was one: it is no longer business as usual! Time for change!

One day, the FlipFlopi aspires to sail the world, bringing beauty and hope to each of us. “The goodness of our life is measured by how we leave our legacy to be remembered after us,” says Skanda. “This is just the starting point, I have a lot vision… Nothing is impossible.”

Despite rain reducing in most parts of the country, many others continue to experience devastating effects of floods.

The raging floods have claimed about 20 lives and left thousands homeless. The worst hit are eastern, northern and western parts of the country.

In western region, Kasese District has experienced back-to-back floods after five major rivers burst their banks, sweeping away homes, schools, hospitals, and churches.

The recent episode was on May 21 when rivers Thaku and Lhubiriha burst their banks near the Uganda-DR Congo border, killing eight people.

The Kasese District environment officer, Mr Augustine Kooli, said the rainfall pattern in the area was the highest in April and May more than any other time of the year.

“The district experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern. The first rains are short but fall with high intensity and occur between March and May, and the longer rains from August to November have a low intensity,” he explained.

He added: “Annual rainfall ranges from 800mm to 1,600mm and is greatly influenced by altitude. At the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains, the rainfall amount is between 1,200mm and 1,400mm.” Mr Kooli explained that under the District Integrated Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan 2017-2020, they encouraged the communities to plant trees on mountain slopes to reduce the runoff.

Western region

In Isingiro District, five people died in Kabuyanda Town Council and Kabuyanda Sub-county on May 2 following heavy rain, according to Isingiro South MP Alex Byarugaba.

The rain also triggered landslides and floods in the hilly area characterised by deep valleys. “We have always experienced these catastrophes but this time the impact was far too great; I had never seen this extent of damage by rains,” Mr Byarugaba said on Monday.

The floods and landslides destroyed houses, banana plantations, vegetable gardens, fishponds, roads and bridges.

Mr Byarugaba added that more than 800 households of between 4,000 and 5,000 people were affected in Kikagati and Kabuyanda Town Council, while bridges in Kaburara, Rwabisheri, Kabumba, and Kamwotsya were destroyed. “These are crossing points within these sub-counties, connecting health centres, schools and markets. People now can’t easily access these places. Local leaders have mobilized people who just worked on temporary measures for crossing,” he remarks.

In Kanungu District, the area vice chairman, Mr Gad Byomuhangi, on Monday said most roads and bridges were destroyed by rain and yet they do not have money to work on them.

The Kisoro District chairperson, Mr Abel Bizimana, said Rubuguri-Katojo road was cut off after Rushaga Bridge was washed away by floods.

He added that Ruhezamyenda Bridge that connects Rubuguri-Kisoro Town road was also washed away and local people have resorted to using community paths to connect to either side.

In eastern Uganda, floods mostly hit Manafwa, Kween, Bududa, Sironko, Pallisa, Butaleja, and Bukedea districts.

In Pallisa, more than 30 families were displaced at the beginning of the month after floods swept away their homes and gardens.

In Kween District, landslides killed three people and displaced about 50 families in Chepsukunya Town Council and Ngenge Sub-county.

In Budaka District, hundreds are stranded with nowhere to sleep after a heavy storm hit several villages.

Northern region

In Lango Sub-region, more than 350 households in Apac District have been left homeless.

The affected are residents of Acholi Inn Landing Site, Kayei Landing Site, Wansolo Landing Site, and Kampala Kagoi, all in Akokoro Sub-county.

The flash floods also affected residents of Aganga, Tarogali and Alworoeng parishes in Ibuje Sub-county.

Overflowing water from Lake Kyoga and River Nile is currently invading dry land along the shorelines every day, submerging homes and gardens of crops.

The Apac Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Ms Beatrice Akello Akori, said a team from the district visited the affected areas last week to assess the damage and is compiling a report that will be sent to the Office of the Prime Minister. “We are looking at resettling them at Maruzi Ranch but these people are very tricky; once you give them land, they don’t want to leave it,” she said.

In Busoga Sub-region, increasing water levels on Lake Victoria have displaced about 4,000 residents at Masese Landing Site, Rippon and Gomba, all in Jinja Municipal Council.

The councillor representing Masese at Jinja Municipal Council, Mr Ronald Katongole, said there is a need to relocate all people at Masese Landing site. “We (local leaders) have tried to do what is necessary to ensure that people are safe but due to this pandemic, sometimes people turn violent that implementing some of the health directives is challenging,” he said.

Central region

In Masaka District, increasing water levels at landing sites on Lake Victoria shoreline have started extending to villages, sparking fear among residents.

By last week, the floods had swept through Makonzi Parish, Bukakata Sub-county, displacing 450 households across five villages of Kasaka, Bwami, Bukoko, Kisuku and Makonzi .

The floods first submerged the landing sites of Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo and Kachanga, forcing about 20,000 people to relocate to safer places on the mainland where they have since set up makeshift houses.

Although government has extended them some relief assistance such as food and tarpaulins, the victims are still in dire need of more humanitarian assistance.

Bukakkata Sub-county chairperson Aloysius Jjuko said no deaths have been recorded though residents are at high risk of contracting water -borne diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera and Hepatitis A due to the deteriorating sanitation situation in the area.

“Our focus has been on those displaced from landing sites but the problem has escalated, residents have lost houses and crops and government should assist them as well,” he said The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Herman Ssentongo, said area leaders have been tasked to identify free government land where victims can permanently be resettled. “This tragedy is unprecedented and as government we cannot leave our people to continue suffering; a lasting solution has to be found,” he said.

Kalangala cut off

In Kalangala, flash floods have also caused similar havoc, cutting off three landing sites and separating them from the main Bugala Island. The affected landing sites are Kaazi-Malanga, Mukalanga and Kasamba in Bujumba Sub-county.

Access to the three landing sites from Bugala Island has been by road but currently, residents have to use boats to connect to the area. Mr Federico Ssekatawa, the chairperson Kaazi- Malanga Village, said life on the ‘new island’ has become very difficult as residents lack food, clean water and medical supplies.

Currently, an estimated 7,500 residents in the area have no access to electricity supply after the devastating floods forced the service provider, Kalangala Infrastructure Services, to disconnect power lines to avoid electrocution.

For sale were distinctive pieces of jewellery, weapons, finely crafted ceramics, drinking vessels, and game boards—featuring unusual artistry and magnificent inlays of carnelian and lapis lazuli. These extraordinary pieces featured a complex symbology of animals, both wild and domesticated, depicted fighting among themselves or with human figures, the humans always triumphant. There were beautifully realised bucolic scenes of animals grazing in vast palm groves and architectural reproductions of temples or palaces.

Data provided by the internet sites and auction houses selling these mysterious pieces was sparse and, at best, vague. Their origins were often listed as “from Central Asia.” At first, it was assumed that the pieces were the work of expert forgers, but as more came on the market in the following months, scholars began to speculate that they could be genuine, deriving from an undocumented site whose location was unknown to them. In 2002 more appeared on the market.

Iranian police solved the mystery later that year. A coordinated investigation led to the arrest of several traffickers and the confiscation of a hoard of artefacts. These objects were being prepared to be shipped from Tehran, Bandar ‘Abbas, and Kerman to buyers around the world. Investigators revealed that most of these distinctive pieces could be traced back to a location in the Halil River Valley, about 25 miles south of Jiroft, a remote and peaceful city in southeastern Iran, not far from the Persian Gulf.

But where did these mystery artefacts come from? At the time, scholars knew of no dig sites in the area, but when they looked closer, they found a simple yet surprising explanation. In early 2001 flooding caused the Halil River to overflow its banks and erode the surrounding lands. Layers of sediment were washed away, and the remains of an ancient cemetery were exposed. Locals and looters quickly recognised the importance of the find and moved to collect and sell the artefacts they were finding.",2021-02-26 08:00:00+00:00,"['market', 'sites', 'culture', 'buried', 'location', 'artefacts', 'cradle', '4000', 'mystery', 'pieces', 'halil', 'objects', 'scholars', 'civilisation', 'ancient', 'river', 'expand']",Egypt,news article,English

On wheat farms in the U.S. and Russia, it’s a drought that’s ruining harvests. The soybean fields of Brazil are bone dry too, touched by little more than the occasional shower. In Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, the problem is the exact opposite. Torrential downpours are causing flooding in rice fields and stands of oil palm trees.

The sudden emergence of these supply strains is a big blow to a global economy that has been struggling to regain its footing after the shock of the Covid-19 lockdowns. As prices soar on everything from sugar to cooking oil, millions of working-class families that had already been forced to scale back food purchases in the pandemic are being thrust deeper into financial distress.

What’s more, these increases threaten to push up broader inflation indexes in some countries and could make it harder for central bankers to keep providing monetary stimulus to shore up growth.

The Bloomberg Agriculture Spot Index, a gauge of nine crop prices, has risen 28% since late April to its highest level in more than four years. Wheat earlier this week was the most expensive since 2014.

“The fundamentals have changed dramatically since May,” said Don Roose, president of brokerage U.S. Commodities in Iowa. “The weather is bubbling to the top, and we have demand chugging in a bull market.”

The fallout from the pandemic means that the United Nations was already warning of a worst-case scenario in which about a tenth of the world’s population would go hungry this year. Things could become more dire if grocery costs keep rising and even more people can’t afford to eat.

“It’s looking very bleak,” said David Beasley, executive director at the World Food Programme, the hunger-fighting group that won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. Declining currencies in food-importing nations, the threat of more economic shutdowns and struggles for farmers to expand production could all compound the problem, he said.

“You start adding all these things together and you begin to almost run around like, ‘The sky is falling, the sky is falling,’ but it ain’t chicken little,” Beasley said.

Mangled supply chains and a flood of buying already sent food prices higher in many countries earlier this year as Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted global trade. But even then, there was an ample cushion of grain stockpiles and Northern Hemisphere harvests were expected to be bountiful. Then came the dry weather.

Climate scientists have long warned that an increase in unpredictable and extreme weather patterns would be a growing threat to crop production and food security. Now, we are experiencing what it means to be living in a climate-disrupted world as wildfires blaze across the U.S. West, hurricane season grows more ferocious and forecasters say that 2020 could be the world’s hottest year on record.

Antonio Carlos Simoneti, a fourth-generation orange grower in Brazil, is seeing the change firsthand. With drought and heat plaguing his lands in Sao Paulo state, the world’s top region for orange juice production, the river that usually snakes across his property has vanished. That’s the first time that’s happened since his family acquired the farm 36 years ago. Oranges on his 500-hectare (1,236-acre) grove are drying up inside and becoming crystallized, as the trees suck all the water from the fruit to try to survive the parched conditions.

After making some sales earlier in the season, “I don’t have more fruits to sell,” said Simoneti, who expects his harvest to drop about 50% this year because of the weather. “What remains on the trees are dried, without water inside.”

Shopping Spree

It’s not just the weather sparking higher crop prices.

Agricultural commodity buyers from Cairo to Islamabad have been on a shopping spree as nations try to protect themselves from more disruptions to supply chains, like those seen earlier this year when lockdowns left food stranded at ports, sparked trucking delays and created logjams at warehouses.

A weaker real is boosting prices even further in agriculture superpower Brazil, where soybeans are up 81% and corn 56% this year, also raising costs for chicken and pork production. As an emergency measure, local government has temporarily removed import tariffs for soybeans, corn, rice and wheat to control food inflation.

Jordan has built up record wheat reserves while Egypt, the world’s top buyer of the grain, took the unusual step of tapping international markets during its local harvest and has boosted purchases by more than 50% since April. Taiwan said it will increase strategic food stockpiles and China has been buying to feed its growing hog herd.

The last protracted runup in food prices back in 2011 helped contribute to uprisings in the Arab Spring. That said, prices have a long way to climb before reaching those levels. Also, a bumper crop in Australia may help to fill the supply gap.

That growth in demand helps to explain why prices are moving higher despite a still-hefty inventory cushion. Global reserves of wheat, for example, are forecast to reach a record this year. Those supplies could eventually help to bring food inflation back in check if concerns over weather problems start to die down.

That would be welcome relief for people like Doan Cam Chi, a Ho Chi Minh City working mom. She estimated she’s spent about 30% more on food bills this year for her 5-member family. She’s seen pork prices decrease this month, but things like rice, cereals and fruits are still up from last year.

“I just can’t trim food expenses as my kids are in their growing years,” she said.

Meanwhile, at a market in the city, 50-year-old produce seller Le Thi Giang was just an hour away from closing on a recent morning, but her stall was still full of unsold spinach, pineapples, pumpkins, green beans and carrots. Ongoing torrential rains and flooding in key growing areas mean that prices for fruit and vegetables are fetching as much as double what they were pre-pandemic. At these higher costs, many people can’t afford to buy what they need for a healthy diet, she said.

“I have to call and invite people into my stall, something I had never done before,” said Giang, who has been selling at the market for two decades.

The recovery in prices after years in the doldrums has been welcome news for farmers in the U.S., who have relied more on government aid to balance the loss of income due to tariffs and trade wars.

“To see demand be so strong right now for a lot of commodities is a welcome sign,” Kevin Ross, an Iowa farmer and chairman of the National Corn Growers Association, who grows corn and soybeans in southwest Iowa, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “Right now exports are just on fire.”

The decisions of Caf’s disciplinary board over the 2019 Champions League final have been revealed

The Confederation of African Football (Caf) have retained Esperance as Champions League winners on Wednesday after its disciplinary board presided over the long-standing debacle.

The Tunisian outfit won the final in May after Wydad Casablanca abandoned the game in the 55th minute owing to Walid El Karti’s disallowed goal and subsequent VAR controversy.

Wydad called for video replays but the technology was unavailable, and they refused to restart play for nearly 120 minutes, forcing Gambian official Bakary Gassama to end the game.

Days later, Caf overturned the decision to award Esperance the title, demanded a return of the medals and announced a rematch of the second-leg at an unnamed date and venue.

Both clubs appealed the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), where Caf was called on to make the final decision on how to proceed.

The African body’s disciplinary board have subsequently meted out punishment to Wydad for their inappropriate behaviour in the game.

The Moroccan outfit “is considered to have lost the game in the final second leg, a fine of 50,000 USD is imposed on the club for the abandonment of the match and a fine of 15,000 USD is imposed for the use of flares by the supporters,” a statement from Caf read.

Esperance weren’t left out either, with club president Mohamed Meddeb receiving a 20,000 USD fine, while the club has been fined 50,000 USD for their supporters’ unsuitable behaviour.

The Tunisian outfit also risks playing two continental home games behind closed doors after the excessive use of smoke and firecrackers. Caf will only enforce the punishment if a repeat offense is committed in the next 12 months.",2019-08-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['outfit', 'punish', 'conduct', 'casablanca', 'fine', 'caf', 'champions', 'final', 'disciplinary', 'league', 'wydad', 'retain', 'esperance', 'usd']",Ghana,news article,English
23,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Fresh Produce favourites per country - FreshPlaza,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/2124552/fresh-produce-favourites-per-country/,"Fresh Produce favourites per country

Dutch cheese, German bratwurst and Russian vodka. Iconic cultural favourites not to be missed when visiting the country. But what about fresh produce? Although we think we do know most of the greens out there, there are still certain tasty products that are very popular elsewhere. This has much to do with the availability of the product, but also history can play an important role.



Strawberries in the United Kingdom

Whoever thinks of the summer in the UK, thinks of strawberries with whipped cream. The Wimbledon Tennis Championship in particular is strongly linked with strawberries. During the tournament, about 28,000 kilos of the fruit is consumed. The United Kingdom has for years been the largest buyers of Dutch and Belgian strawberries. Exports in recent years have significantly declined though, due to increased domestic production.



Sweetcorn in the United States

Sweet corn is one of the most important vegetables in the United States. The US cultivates the vegetables almost year-round. Annual consumption of sweet corn in the United States is about 10 kilo per person. That is much more than the 60/70 grams by European consumers. The bi-colour variant has now gained a major share in the United States.



Asparagus in Germany

Germany is fond of asparagus. Almost a third of Germans will eat asparagus at least once a week during the season. In the past year, they ate an average of about 1.1 kilos of asparagus per person. In other European countries, the vegetable is relatively unknown. German asparagus is largely domestic, grown on approximately 20,000 hectares.



Potatoes in India

India has a large potato market. The country consumes more than 40 million tons of potatoes per year, an amount that increases annually by 6 percent. More than 80 percent of the potatoes in the country is destined for the fresh market. The majority is sold in small markets and through roadside venues. The Indian potato production has grown in recent years. It is expected that the harvest in 2020 will surpass 49 million tons.



Tomatoes in Italy

Although the consumption of tomatoes has dropped slightly in recent years, the vegetable is still among the most important in Italy. Italian cuisine simply can’t do without tomatoes. In the mid-18th century, there was a real tomato culture in Italy, while the vegetables didn’t reach European tables until the 20th century. Production in the country amounts to almost one million tons, most of which is destined for domestic consumption. The Italian consumption of tomatoes per capita last year was 16 kg, while still at 21 kilos in 2011. In comparison: In Belgium, consumption is at 10.4 kilograms per capita.



Coconuts in Thailand

In Thailand, you'll come across fresh coconuts anywhere you go. On the beach there are lots of coconut trees, but there are also many plantations where coconuts are grown professionally. In Thailand, the coconuts are sold on the street. The coconut is very versatile. It’s used to make coconut oil and coconut milk, widely used in Thai cooking. Coconut oil is becoming increasingly popular, because it is a saturated fat and therefore the only vegetable oil suitable for heating because it remains stable at high temperatures.



Chicory in Belgium

Belgium is the birthplace of chicory. Consumption in the Netherlands is about three kilos per capita, though twice as high in Belgium. In Germany, for example, only 400 grams per capita is consumed. Belgium is one of the most important chicory producers in the world. In recent years, chicory acreage declined, and it is expected that cultivation will continue to drop.



Garlic in China

China is the land of garlic. The country is the largest exporter of garlic worldwide, and domestic consumption is high. On average, the Chinese eat ten cloves of garlic a day. When the Summer Olympics were held in China in 2008, an MP complained of the odour of taxis in Beijing. Taxi drivers were explicitly asked not to eat any more garlic. The unpleasant smell of garlic in the taxis is in fact a common complaint of tourists. Chinese garlic also contains less Allicine, a type of antibiotic that causes bad breath.

1662,FL-2017-000067-BRA,"01/21/2021 - Palm oil plantations, coal mines linked to deadly Indonesia flood - Mongabay.com",https://news.mongabay.com/2021/01/palm-oil-plantations-coal-mines-deforestation-indonesia-south-kalimantan-flood/,"Environmentalists have attributed recent heavy floods in southern Indonesian Borneo to widespread deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines.

An analysis by Indonesia’s space agency shows an area of forest twice the size of London was cleared in the past decade in the watershed area of the Barito River in South Kalimantan province.

During the same period, plantations spanning twice the size of Los Angeles have been established in the watershed area.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of licenses as well as rehabilitation of degraded areas in the region.

JAKARTA — Recent floods that inundated large areas of the southern part of Indonesian Borneo might have been exacerbated by massive deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines, activists say.

Heavy rains over the course of several days in early January battered the province of South Kalimantan, causing the Barito and other rivers to overflow. Floodwaters, in some areas as high as 3 meters (10 feet), forced the displacement of more than 112,000 people and claimed at least 21 lives. Nearly 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) have been affected.

President Joko Widodo, during a visit to the affected district of Banjar, attributed the disaster to the heavy and sustained rainfall. But environmentalists say the rapid loss of forest in the region in recent decades contributed to the scale of the flooding.

An area twice the size of London has been deforested in the Barito River’s watershed over the past 10 years, according to data from the Indonesian space agency, LAPAN. More than half of the 322,000 hectares (800,000 acres) cleared comprised primary and secondary forest and scrubland.

A separate analysis of satellite imagery by Greenpeace shows 304,000 hectares (750,000 acres) of forest lost in South Kalimantan’s watershed areas between 2001 and 2019. It shows the Barito watershed now has less than half of its original forest cover, while the watershed of another river in the province, the Maluka, has less than 1% of its forest cover remaining.

“It shows the carrying capacity of the forests in that region has drastically decreased,” Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Arie Rompas said.

Trees hold the soil in place, preventing erosion that results in heavy silting of rivers during rains. Silting makes rivers shallower, decreasing their water flow rate and making it more likely that they will overflow in the event of heavy rains.

The country’s disaster mitigation agency, the BNPB, has called for further studies to determine the cause of the South Kalimantan flooding.

“We also need to involve the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in [analyzing] the management of river areas and spatial planning,” BNPB disaster data, information and communications department head Raditya Jati said.

Palm oil

LAPAN analysis of satellite imagery shows 219,000 hectares (541,000 acres), an area nearly twice the size of Los Angeles, of new plantations established in the Barito River’s watershed in the past decade. In total, plantations cover 650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), occupying 14% of the Barito’s watershed of 4.5 million hectares (11.1 million acres), according to LAPAN’s remote-sensing division head, Rokhis Khomarudin.

He said the analysis could provide an explanation of the possible cause of the recent flooding.

“We understand that plantations are related to the economy, but the environmental aspect has to be paid attention to,” Rokhis said.

However, the analysis hasn’t identified the type of the crops being cultivated in the area.

“Because the data is from mid-resolution satellite data, [we] haven’t been able to determine [whether the plantations are] oil palm or other plantations,” Rokhis said.

There’s conflicting data on the true extent of oil palm plantations in South Kalimantan. The Agriculture Ministry identifies 564,632 hectares (1.4 million acres) of oil palm plantations in the province as of 2020. The Central Statistics Agency, BPS, lists 424,932 hectares (1.05 million acres) as of 2018.

Half of the plantation area, 227,791 hectares (562,884 acres), is owned or controlled by the 25 largest agribusiness conglomerates in Indonesia, according to a 2019 report by TuK Indonesia, an NGO that advocates for social justice in the agribusiness sector.

Among these conglomerates are Jardine Matheson Group, Triputra Group and Sinar Mas Group, which control 61,932 hectares (153,037 acres), 49,500 hectares (122,300 acres) and 48,741 hectares (120,442 acres) of oil palm concessions respectively, the report shows.

The Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), the country’s largest green group, says it’s clear that South Kalimantan is in an ecological crisis driven by unbridled deforestation.

Half of South Kalimantan’s total area of 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) has been parceled off to the palm oil industry and the mining industry.

“Indeed, these floods are strongly suspected to be caused by the ecosystems that have lost their carrying capacity,” Walhi executive director Nur Hidayati said. “So when there is extreme weather, the carrying capacity collapses and causes disasters.”

Walhi South Kalimantan chapter head Kisworo Dwi Cahyono said the destruction of natural ecosystems in the upstream areas of the province’s rivers leads to flooding downstream.

“So this is [caused by] a disarray in the management of the environment and natural resources, and then the degradation of environmental carrying capacity,” he said.

Data from Global Forest Watch show that oil palm is not the only crop that might have contributed to deforestation in the region. In Hulu Sungai Tengah district, where 64,400 people were affected by the flooding, mixed fruit plantations occupy the largest span of plantation area, at 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres), while oil palms occupy only 200 hectares (500 acres).

In Banjar district, where floods displaced more than 51,000 people, rubber trees are the dominant crop, covering 38,500 hectares (95,100 acres), followed by oil palms at 27,900 hectares (68,900 acres).

But in Balangan district, where nearly 12,000 people have been displaced, mixed oil palm plantations cover the largest area, 19,800 hectares (48,900 acres).

While the dominant crops differ, all three districts have one thing in common: all have experienced massive deforestation. In 2000, lush natural forests in all three districts were still largely intact, occupying from 50% to 78% of the total area. By 2016, almost all of them were gone.

Mining

Besides oil palm plantations, environmentalists have also attributed the flooding to the proliferation of mines in the region. Walhi data show 814 coal mining pits left by 157 companies after they finished digging.

The Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam) says there are 177 mining concessions dotted throughout the flooded districts.

According to data from the South Kalimantan provincial government, there were 13 coal companies with mining contracts and 160 firms with mining permits in the province as of 2013.

Combined, concessions for mining and oil palm plantations occupy half of South Kalimantan’s total area; 33% of the land falls under mining concessions and 17% under oil palm concessions, Walhi says.

“The biggest cause of deforestation in Kalimantan [Indonesian Borneo] right now is palm oil and coal,” Greenpeace Indonesia climate campaigner Hindun Mulaika said.

This is not the first time a major natural disaster in Indonesia has been linked to environmental destruction wrought by the plantation and the mining industries. In 2019, the hilly district of North Konawe on the island of Sulawesi was struck by floods that displaced thousands of people.

A report by the ombudsman of Southeast Sulawesi province said that “generally the cause [of the flooding] was land conversion for plantations, mining and illegal logging.” An analysis of the floods by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry cited “river silting” and “oil palm plantations” as among the causes of the disaster.

Extensive mining along North Konawe’s coast might also have been a factor. The mining exacerbated silting near the mouth of the Lasolo River, resulting in a “backwater effect” that intensified the flooding, the ministry’s report says.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of plantation and mining licenses in South Kalimantan as well as a moratorium on new mining permits in the wake of the recent floods.

“The current condition shows that the environmental carrying capacity [in South Kalimantan] is no longer capable [of mitigating disasters],” Hindun said.

Jatam campaign head Melky Nahar said it’s also important for the government to enforce the law by revoking mining and plantation permits in areas that play a crucial role in protecting the environment and the people who live there. He added the government should also start rehabilitating degraded areas in South Kalimantan.

“Without that, similar incidents will happen again [in the future] and we will listen to [rhetorical] statements from President Joko Widodo again,” Melky said.

Jefri Raharja, a campaigner at Walhi South Kalimantan, said the widespread deforestation in the region has also exacerbated global climate change.

“Kalimantan was once proud of its forests, but now the forests have been replaced by monoculture oil palm plantations and coal mines,” he said.

As many as 38 persons, including 15 females, have been killed in various natural disasters across the country since the onset of monsoon.

According to statistics updated by the Ministry of Home Affairs, at least 2009 households were directly affected by disasters which caused economic loss worth around Rs 133 million. The disasters, mainly the landslides, floods and inundation resulted in damage or destruction of 84 houses or huts.

Major disasters that claimed the lives include landslides, floods, lightning and fire, mainly in the Tarai and hilly districts.

The Meteorological Forecasting Division had officially announced the arrival of monsoon in Nepal on June 12, two days later than the normal onset date of the rainy season.

“Monsoon activity has gained momentum, leading to rain-induced disasters. Therefore, we appeal to everyone to take necessary precautions against disaster events,” Meteorological Forecasting Division advised. MFD has forecast light to heavy rain with thunder and lightning at many places of the country for the next three days.

“Monsoon trough line is now located close to Nepal, bringing more rain. Heavy rainfall may increase the water level in many rivers, leading to inundation and landslide. Therefore, we would like to appeal to all to maintain high alert against the possibility of natural disasters,” read a weather forecast bulletin released by MFD today. It has also forecast obstruction of air and road transport due to bad weather conditions.

More than 120 persons were killed and property worth tens of millions of rupees damaged in natural disasters last year.

The country receives an average of 80 per cent of annual rainfall during the monsoon. The average annual rainfall in Nepal is 1,600 mm, but it varies from place to place depending on climatic conditions.

In Brazil’s Pantanal, the vegetation compacted under the marshy flood water during the wet season dries out as ponds and lagoons evaporate, leaving flammable deposits underground that can continue to smolder long after visible flames die down.

Firefighters across Brazil are battling raging towers of flames from the Amazon rainforest to the Cerrado savannah, but the fires beneath their feet are a particular challenge in the Pantanal. The only way to combat an underground fires is to dig a trench around it, said state firefighter Lieutenant Isaac Wihby.

“But how do you do that if you have a line of fire that’s 20 kilometers long? It’s not viable,” he said.

The fires here are the worst in 15 years. The flames threaten the region’s biodiversity, rich with tapirs, pumas, capybaras and the world’s most dense population of jaguars.

The Pantanal, whose name derives from the Portuguese word for “swamp,” sprawls over more than 150,000 sq km in Brazil and also extends into Bolivia and Paraguay.

As fires approached emergency workers in the Pantanal this week, they used tractors to cut through desiccated trees and shrubs, leaving a gash of brown dirt meant to rob the flames of fuel and stop their spread.

But strong winds can send the flames over the top, or underground fires can pass below.

“Sometimes it passes under a firebreak and takes the firefighters by surprise,” said Lieutenant Jean Oliveira, who is leading the firefighting efforts.

“Sometimes you control a fire and it’s not really dead, it’s just sleeping,” he said.

Hundreds of firefighters, environmental workers, park rangers and soldiers have worked 24 hours a day for weeks attempting to extinguish flames that have destroyed thousands of square kilometers of the Pantanal.

With temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), one fire this week was unstoppable as strong winds pushed it across multiple firebreaks, burning through twisted branches and dry leaves through the day and into the night.

“We controlled it but then it jumped there, jumped there, jumped there,” said Edmilson Rodrigo da Silva, a firefighter for Brazil’s center-west state of Mato Grosso, pointing far into the distance to where the fire had gotten past firebreaks.

The region is a vast flood plain that normally fills with water during the rainy season, roughly from November to March. But the floods were lower than normal this year and a subsequent drought has left the area dangerously susceptible to fire.

The Pantanal so far this month recorded 4,677 “hot spots” in the worst rash of fires since August 2005, according to Brazil’s space research agency, Inpe.

Silva was one of about 20 men battling the fire through the night, bathed in choking smoke and swarmed by gnats flushed out of the undergrowth by flames that encircled the firefighters on three sides. They warned to look out for poisonous snakes and jaguars fleeing the fire in the night.

Rains brought temporary relief to the southern half of the Pantanal last week, but fires again began to pick up this week. Next month could be even worse.

“It’s our worst year here for fires. It’s never been dry like this,” Silva said.",2020-08-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['worlds', 'worst', 'firefighters', 'wetland', 'brazil', 'fires', 'jumped', 'largest', 'flames', 'state', 'week', 'burns', 'pantanal', 'brazils', 'underground']",Brazil,news article,English

“We came back in the afternoon after the water had receded and saw the great devastation of the floods. The water destroyed and swept away everything,” she says. “We have been left homeless and very desperate. Where do we start from? We need urgent assistance.”

A few kilometres down the road of this tourist region, Philly Donald Baluku, a travel guide, said the impact was a disaster. “I have been working as a tour guide on a contract basis. The tourism sector closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. The floods have rendered me homeless now,” says Baluku.

“What do I do? I have nine dependents. My brother has offered us a single room to stay. But we don’t have bedding and food. We are living in a very hopeless and desperate situation.

“All my property, banana plantations, vanilla and crops which I was supposed to harvest in September were swept away.”

The floodwater destroyed the Nyamwamba hydroelectric power station, and overran the wards, mortuary and drug stores of Kilembe Mines hospital.

The villages of Kyanjuki, Bulembia and Katiri are now buried under mud and huge stones that were propelled down the mountain. Homes on lower land are submerged in water.

“I haven’t seen anything like this. I’m seeing for the first time where everything has been run down,” says Stephen Oluka, the director of Uganda’s National Emergency Coordination and Operations Centre, on a visit to Kasese town.

“The infrastructure has been damaged. The hospital and power station has been overrun. People’s houses along the path have all been swept away. Gardens, crops and cows have been taken away,” he says.

Buildings damaged by the flooding at Kilembe

Schools and churches have been designated temporary displacement camps.

“The living conditions are bad and alarming. The basic facilities are lacking,” says Catherine Kugoza, 37, a mother of six, sheltering in Karusandara church, about 20km south of Kasese.

“We are starving. People are taking dirty water from the stream. The one latrine is full. People are defecating in the open. This is a recipe for disease outbreaks like cholera and dysentery.”

When the Guardian visited Karusandara on Saturday, the camp was hosting more than 1,000 people, mostly women and children, with just 18 tents supplied by Save the Children.

“It’s a crisis situation. We have children in the camps. They don’t have blankets, they need mosquito nets, people don’t have food,” says Robert Centenary, a lawmaker for Kasese municipality. “People don’t have supplies for purifying water; they don’t have utensils to use in the camps. The situation has caused an appalling sanitation crisis. We may end up degenerating into a cholera outbreak.

“We really need a lot of water and sanitation support. We want the government to immediately come to the rescue of the people.”

The Uganda Red Cross Society says the immediate needs include shelter, food, bedding, mosquito nets, utensils, mobile toilets, water storage facilities and tarpaulins. It is appealing for more resources.

Oluka says overcrowding in makeshift centres had complicated efforts to combat Covid-19. “The guidelines have been compromised. I didn’t see anyone [displaced] in the camps with a mask. The leaders are telling people to maintain social distancing but it’s not attainable. There is overcrowding in camps.”

He adds: “I don’t think they are now bothered about coronavirus, which they haven’t seen. They are bothered about what has affected them now [floodings], safety from waters and their livelihoods.”

In its outlook for March to May, Uganda’s National Meteorological Authority warned of heavy rainfall over several parts of the country, which could lead to flooding and landslides, causing loss of lives, destruction of property and infrastructure.

Floods and landslides have killed 194 people in neighbouring Kenya and 65 in north-west Rwanda in the past week. On Sunday morning, there was another wave of flash floods in Uganda.

“We have looked at the magnitude of the problem. It is too huge. It requires immediate, medium and long-term interventions,” says Oluka.

“The government will look at shifting people from the dangerous areas in Rwenzori to safer areas when funds can allow.”",2020-05-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['slides', 'water', 'children', 'dont', 'kasese', 'away', 'devastate', 'floods', 'uganda', 'western', 'run', 'masika', 'need', 'desperate', 'swept', 'rock']",Uganda,news article,English
1334,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Investors support Shell's strategy for net-zero emissions despite backlash - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/investors-support-shells-strategy-for-net-zero-emissions-despite-backlash,"Nearly 89% of shareholders at Shells annual investor meeting on Tuesday voted in favour of the oil and gas companys strategy to achieve a net-zero emissions business by 2050, the Financial Times reports. Despite this success, the firm is also confronted by growing support for activists demands to set more ambitious targets, the newspaper adds. It notes that a separate resolution by Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This calling for Shell to set more inspirational targets attracted the support of 30% of shareholders, although such resolutions require 75% to pass. According to the Times, Follow This insists that Shells goals are not consistent with achieving the Paris climate accord, in part because it lacks near-term targets for absolute emissions reductions. The Guardian notes that this significant shareholder rebellion came on the day that the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its net-zero pathway, in which all exploration for new oil and gas fields stops this year to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It quotes Charlie Kronick, a senior climate finance adviser for Greenpeace UK, who notes that Shells plans would increase gas production by 20% by 2030, contravening the advice of the IEA. Reuters states that, under its current plans, Shell intends to increase its investment in low-carbon energy sources in the coming years, but at least 75% of its spending will continue to go towards oil and gas. In Bloombergs coverage, it says that the oil giant also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its spill-prone operations in Nigeria.

Meanwhile, another Guardian story reports that, in Australia, politicians and companies are being urged by campaigners to abandon plans for new coal power, gas and oil investments in light of the new IEA report. In Europe, Politico reports that the landmark report is giving Brussels new ammunition in its war on fossil fuels, as its conclusions support the European Commissions efforts to discontinue EU funding for oil and gas projects. According to EurActiv, environmentalists have warned against some of the assumptions in the scenario developed by the IEA, notably the growing shares of biomass used for energy. The piece adds that IEA modellers have explained that their scenario assumes no overall increase in cropland use for bioenergy production, or new bioenergy crops on forested land. The Guardian reports on comments from the UK climate champion, Nigel Topping, who says he is stubbornly optimistic that the world will arrive at an agreement to forge a transition to a net-zero future at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year. (For more on the IEAs latest report, see Carbon Briefs coverage.)

Finally, the i newspaper reports on an email sent to staff at Londons Science Museum warning them to watch out for environmental protests as they open the doors to a controversial new climate exhibition sponsored by the oil company Shell.",2021-05-19 08:52:06+00:00,"['shell', 'climate', 'strategy', 'netzero', 'support', 'oil', 'reports', 'despite', 'targets', 'investors', 'backlash', 'iea', 'gas', 'emissions', 'shells']",Nigeria,news article,English
737,Drought Sri Lanka,Vincent's hits from voices of four generations | The Sundaytimes Sri Lanka - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka,http://www.sundaytimes.lk/121028/magazine/vincents-hits-from-voices-of-four-generations-18069.html,"Vincent’s hits from voices of four generations View(s):

Vincent de Paul Peiris, a gifted singer who rendered his voice to some of the evergreen hits like ‘Siripade Samanala Kanda Pene’ and ‘Bicycale Bicycale’ will return to perform a musical evening at 6.30 pm on Sunday, November 4 at the British School Auditorium, Colombo 8.

The most significant feature of this show is that Vincent will entertain his fans together with his children, grand children and great grand children on the same stage.

‘Siripade’, the musical evening will be performed by Vincent’s son and daughter Illonka, Anil, grand children Peshani, Amalika, Duwaine, Anarkalie, Lakindu, Shenal, Shion and Shioni and great grandchildren Ayani, Senuja, Deandra and Devorah.

The show will be compeered by Vijaya Corea while talented musician Dinesh Subasinghe is to handle the music.

Vincent a singing legend made his first appearance on stage singing in all three languages at a concert organized in aid of the war effort on December 15, 1940. There he had entertained Lord Louis Mountbatten and soldiers with his voice and a solo rendition on the Hawaiian guitar. He then joined then Radio Ceylon in 1949, Vincent was the only person to host two programmes, western and oriental. Vincent’s ability to yodel and sing western classics earned him the moniker ‘The Gay Yodeler’.

With the aim to render original Sri Lankan songs at a time when the identity of Sri Lankan music was being experimented, Vincent opted to become an oriental singer when Radio Ceylon granted him the option of hosting either western or oriental musical programmes.

232,FL-2021-000025-AUS,2 trapped drivers become first Australian flood fatalities - ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/trapped-sydney-driver-flood-disaster-fatality-76646937,"Two men trapped in vehicles have become the first fatalities of record flooding on Australia’s east coast

CANBERRA, Australia -- Two men trapped in vehicles hundreds of kilometers (miles) apart have become the first fatalities of record flooding on Australia's east coast.

A car got trapped in floodwater northwest of Sydney at dawn Wednesday and emergency services later recovered it with a body inside, officials said. The body, believed to be that of a 25-year-old Pakistani national, has yet to be formally identified.

An emergency crew later retrieved the body of David Hornman from an upturned pickup truck in a flooded creek 680 kilometers (420 miles) north near Gold Coast city in Queensland state, police said. The 38-year-old was last seen Monday.

While rain has eased across New South Wales and southern Queensland, flooding has persisted. Most rivers had peaked by Thursday, but 20,000 people were still evacuated from their homes, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.

Emergency services have made hundreds of rescues since the flooding began last week. Parts of New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, have received one-in-50-year and one-in-100-year rainfall records in the past week.

Insurance companies expect the damage in New South Wales to exceed 1 billion Australian dollars ($760 million).

Before the Queensland death was reported, Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed the Parliament’s condolences to the family of the man who died in the rural suburb of Sydney.

Morrison reflected on the state’s recent struggles — years of drought across most of the state culminated in catastrophic wildfires last summer. The fires were followed by the coronavirus pandemic and now record floods.

“We have seen so much over the course of the past year and more as this country has battled so many things — floods, fires, viruses, drought and now these floods again,” Morrison told Parliament.

In the Vatican, Pope Francis offered encouragement in the aftermath of the Australian flooding.

“In the past days, great floods have caused serious damage in New South Wales,” Francis said in his customary Wednesday remarks to the faithful.

“I stand close to the people and the families hit by this calamity, especially those who saw their houses destroyed. I encourage those who are helping to look for the dispersed and to bring their support,” he added.

A flotilla of boats was delivering crucial supplies to isolated communities on the flooded Hawkesbury River northwest of Sydney and ferrying stranded residents to safety.

Morrison took a flight over the river to survey the damage Wednesday.

“The expanse of water that went right across that region was quite devastating to see and to see the homes, only their roofs and those of out sheds,” Morrison said.

Cabinet Minister Peter Dutton said more than 700 defense personnel would soon be deployed as the floods recede to help people return to their homes and businesses as quickly as possible.",2021-03-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['past', 'queensland', 'morrison', 'fatalities', 'australian', 'trapped', 'floods', 'record', 'drivers', 'wales', 'flooding', 'flood', 'south', 'state']",Australia,news article,English
1444,FL-2011-000132-UGA,"Govt warns of strong floods, destructive rain - Daily Monitor",https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/govt-warns-of-strong-floods-destructive-rain-3333816,"By Franklin Draku More by this Author

The Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) has warned that some parts of the country are likely to experience strong winds and hailstorms as the rainy season sets in.

The authority has asked Ugandans to take precaution because there will be cases of thunderstorm, lightning and hailstorms.

The alert issued by the authority in a tweet on Monday said: “Alert! The rains expected in most parts of the country are likely to be associated with medium to strong winds. Be sure to reinforce your roofs for living houses, granary stores, and others; if there is need. Keep safe.”

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is a high likelihood of having rains above normal levels in several parts of the country.

“The onset of seasonal rains is anticipated to be characterised by severe isolated lightning, thunder and hailstorms,” he warned.

He said the predicted rains forecast should be used for planning in all rain-fed economic activities so as to improve economic welfare and livelihoods for all communities in their localities.

“UNMA will continue to monitor the evolution of relevant weather systems, particularly the state of the Seas Surface Temperature and Indian Ocean Dipole, and issue appropriate rainfall alerts, updates and advisories to the users regularly, especially to those areas that have been heavily affected by floods and landslides disasters,” he added.

Dr Luboyera said the major physical conditions that are likely to influence the increased rainfall for the next three months in Uganda include the current and evolving Sea Surface Temperature anomalies over global oceans.

He specifically pointed out the increased probability for Neutral El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole through the months of March, April and May period.

Dr Luboyera said the expected rains in most parts of the country may, however, present good prospects for improved agricultural production.

“Farmers and other agricultural practitioners are highly encouraged to take advantage of the expected good rains to optimise food and crop production,” he said.

He also advised farmers to plant trees, restock livestock farms, fish ponds and apiaries.

Dr Luboyera warned that there will be floods in central Uganda and landslides in mountainous areas of Kigezi, Rwenzori and the Elgon regions. He also warned that there could be an invasion of locusts.

“The disaster risk management institutions should review their contingency plans,” he said.

He said areas expected to receive average to above average rainfall should undertake integrated flood management, flood preparedness and mitigation strategies in flood-prone areas and plans for optimisation of power generation and distribution should be enhanced due to the expected increased discharge of seasonal rain water into the water bodies.

He said the urban areas should prepare for the flash floods by clearing water and drainage channels.

“Urban authorities need to clear and reduce blockages of the drainage systems to avoid water logging on streets. Strong winds may be experienced, which can cause structural damages to buildings,” he said.

Impact on health

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is high risk of malaria in wetter areas of Teso, Lake Victoria basin, Lake Kyoga basin, lowlands adjacent to Elgon region, and risk of cholera is expected in Buliisa, Busia, South western, Bulambuli, Karamoja sub-region and Namayingo District.

“There is, therefore, need to conduct community awareness about the potential outbreak of the diseases in context and surveillance,” he said.

Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc Thanh.

The European Union will provide 1.3 million ($1.52 million) for critical humanitarian assistance to families affected by severe flooding that wreaked havoc across central Vietnam.

The aid will focus on addressing the urgent needs of the most affected people in central Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces, European External Action Service said in a press release.

""This contribution underlines our solidarity with the people of Vietnam, many of whom have suffered the loss of homes, livelihoods and belongings in the wake of the devastating floods,"" said Olivier Brouant, who oversees the EUs humanitarian response in the Mekong region.

The funding includes the distribution of hygiene kits and other essential relief items while ensuring access to drinking water, sanitation facilities and the promotion of good hygiene practices. Cash transfers will also be provided, allowing people to buy food or items of their choice.

Female-headed households and people with disabilities will be given priority for humanitarian assistance.

The central region was bombarded by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that resulted in at least 130 deaths.

The historic flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated and livestock killed, damage the government claimed to be ""the worst in the past five years.""

Some countries and international organizations recently pledged immediate humanitarian relief to help central Vietnam overcome the consequences of deadly floods.

Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

South Korea pledged relief worth $300,000 while the U.S. has promised $100,000.

With central Vietnam yet to recover from the historic flooding, Storm Molave, the ninth storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Provinces on Wednesday, triggering heavy rains and strong winds for the central region.

At least seven people have been killed by landslides in Quang Nam, with 46 others still missing.",2020-10-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['provides', 'vietnam', 'assist', 'mln', 'quang', 'flood', 'eu', 'humanitarian', 'relief', 'flooding', 'central', '15', 'pledged', 'weeks', 'storm', 'historic', 'victims']",Vietnam,news article,English
1352,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Disaster management agencies acquire satellite technology for monitoring flood - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/news/disaster-management-agencies-acquire-satellite-technology-for-monitoring-flood/,"Nigerias disaster management organisations and hydrometeorological organisations gathered in Abuja on Tuesday, February 9, 2021 for a three-day online regional training workshop on flood monitoring and forecasting modeling.

The training, organised by the Centre for Space Science & Technology Education (CSSTE) was part of the Multi-Scale Flood Monitoring and Assessment Services for West Africa (MiFMASS) project under the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) Support Programme which seeks to help Nigeria and other West African nations to adopt a new system of utilising satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

x

Participants were mainly technical operational staff from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

The training, which holds simultaneously across four other West African countries, aimed at equiping participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-prone areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model, as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

According to the Lead of the CSSTE Consortium, Dr Ganiyu Agbaje, the training was in alignment with one of the major pillars of the GMES & Africa support programme, which was capacity building, and this had led the CSSTE consortium to identify strategic training needs of its collaborating stakeholders on the MIFMASS project with the aim to train and empower them to sustain the product and service outcomes after the lifetime of the programme.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, a major cause of flooding in Africa.

Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say you cannot dump refuse here, then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

x

Also, it has been said that the whole of the Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction and more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower, he said.

Dr. Agbaje, who also doubles as the Executive Director of the African Regional Centre for Space Science & Technology Education  English (ARCSSTE-E) in Ile-Ife, added that GMES & Africa is a joint initiative of the African Union and the European Union to harness the benefits of earth observation (satellite) data for inherent environmental challenges in Africa and their own MiFMASS project is one of the many ongoing research and development projects under the programme.

He pledged that two more training courses will be held as the consortium prepares for the conclusion of the project and the handover of its products and services to relevant agencies.

This is the third in the series of our training and we have two more to go, he said.",2021-02-11 08:00:00+00:00,"['world', 'flood', 'african', 'management', 'west', 'technology', 'mifmass', 'guardian', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'services', 'monitoring', 'agencies', 'training', 'project', 'africa', 'satellite']",Nigeria,news article,English
17,DR-2014-000109-CHN,China's President Says His Anti-Corruption Drive Is Deadlocked - KPBS,https://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/aug/08/chinas-president-says-his-anti-corruption-drive/,"There's been much to-do about China's anti-corruption drive and the leading example of that effort has been the downfall of a man who was once one of the country's most powerful officials, ex-security czar Zhou Yongkang.

But the Chinese government's unprecedented decision to investigate Zhou, which potentially paves the way for formal corruption charges, may not be quite the triumph many observers assumed. Perhaps the clearest signal comes from a recent assessment by the man at the helm of the corruption crackdown: Chinese President and Communist Party boss Xi Jinping.

""The two armies of corruption and anti-corruption are at a stalemate,"" Xi reportedly told a closed-door Politburo meeting in late June.

""In my struggle against corruption, I don't care about life or death, or ruining my reputation,"" a state-run newspaper in northeast China quotes him as saying, in remarks that have been described as ""shocking.""

Several state media outlets republished the report, which censors deleted later.

It's a glimpse into the party's inner chambers, and of the strength of internal opposition Xi is likely facing. It's also a sign of a potential backlash against the wider anti-corruption campaign, which is popular with ordinary Chinese fed up with endemic graft.

Until his retirement two years ago, Zhou commanded a vast security apparatus whose budget eclipsed even the military's. Now, he is accused of violating unspecified party rules. Criminal corruption charges could follow.

Observers see Xi as eager to make the anti-graft drive one of his signature policies, and to go at it with a blitzkrieg-like intensity. State media report that officials are being investigated at the rate of 50 a month, including, since February, two officials per month at or above the level of Cabinet minister.

State media have commented that China's leaders are determined to break tacit rules that politicians at the highest level are immune from prosecution, a tradition that has centuries-old roots in Chinese political culture.

But the many remaining corrupt officials – both high-ranking, powerful ""tigers"" and lower-level ""flies"" — are unlikely to sit around and wait to be picked off one by one, anti-corruption expert Guo Wenliang told the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper.

So ""the risk of a joint counterattack by the tigers is very, very great,"" said Guo, who teaches at Zhongshan University in the southern city of Guangzhou.

Among the tactics the ""tigers"" might use, he said, is turning the tables on leaders in charge of the anti-corruption drive — by gathering evidence of their corruption.

There's no evidence of a counterattack so far. But the fact that it took so long for the government to announce the investigation into Zhou Yongkang suggests to many observers that it ran into stiff resistance.

Every year, China sees thousands of cases of grass-roots unrest, often triggered by official corruption in the provinces. But the threat of a political counteroffensive by corrupt officials recalls the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping famously dire prediction: ""If China runs into trouble, it will come from inside the Communist Party.""

Truck movements around southern Queensland continue to be restricted as floods subside and roads are repaired but grain movements are getting back to normal. Some roads remain closed around Condamine, Bungunya, Goondiwindi and Tallwood but the logistics concerns have eased considerably from last week.

Rail lines form Moree to Narrabri have also reopened as the flood waters south of Moree retreated which allows trains to Newcastle to resume.

Local grain markets finished the week steady to mixed as traders contend with logistical and quality difficulties.

Sprouting has been a problem for sorghum, which has seen some loading being downgraded. Sprouting problems are expected to increase when harvest resumes after the recent torrential rains.

Sorghum is holding at $300 delivered into the Downs for an April delivery while barley was down $5 to $263. Stockfeed wheat was steady at $287 delivered.

Australia exported a record monthly high 2.68 million tonnes of wheat in February, exceeding the previous monthly high of 2.57mt set in May 2017. The record monthly wheat shipments were up from 2.4mt in January and about 2.5mt in December.

WA was the single largest export state in February with just under 1mt of wheat shipments, aided by large contributions from NSW, Victoria, and SA.

Queensland exported around 110,000 tonnes of wheat in February, lifting the total November to February shipments to 375,000t.

Indonesia was Australia's largest wheat export destination in February, taking 420,000t, followed by Vietnam and the Philippines.

February barley exports from Australia reached 930,000t. Saudi Arabia has emerged as Australia's largest destination after China introduced import taxes on Australian barley, with imports of almost 1.5mt of barley to Saudi Arabia since October.

It was a choppy week for global grain markets where international wheat markets slipped lower while feed grain prices moved higher.

Improving northern hemisphere winter wheat production prospects pressured global cash markets lower. Conversely, US corn markets rallied after the USDA released survey results that showed farmers intend to plant less corn than expected.

The smaller than expected corn plantings was seen as bullish feed grain markets after China's massive corn import program over the past 12 months.",2021-04-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['barley', 'markets', 'return', 'corn', 'monthly', 'week', 'normal', 'logistics', 'tonnes', 'wheat', 'grain', 'shipments', 'largest']",India,news article,English
154,Drought Sri Lanka,"Water, water, everywhere, but not a drop to drink: Adapting to life in climate change-hit Kiribati - World Bank Group",https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/03/21/adapting-to-life-in-climate-change-hit-kiribati,"March 21, 2017 - Tabonibara, Kiribati –Straddling the equator in the middle of the Central Pacific Ocean, Kiribati is made up of 33 coral atolls spread across 3.5 million km² (1.3 square miles) of ocean. Most of the islands are less than two kilometers wide and have an average height of 1.8 meters (6 feet) above sea level, making the country one of the most vulnerable in the world to climate change and sea level rise.

King tides can wash over entire islands, causing flooding for days and contaminating drinking water supplies for weeks and even months. Prolonged droughts, particularly during La Nina, can cause extreme water shortage, affecting agriculture and peoples’ general wellbeing.

With the entire population and the majority of the infrastructure located on the coast, damage and coastal erosion from high tides, storm surges and strong winds is increasingly an issue.

Ruteta, a mother of three living in Tabonibara village, North Tarawa, knows all too well the problems that contaminated well water can bring.

“A few years ago our well water got really smelly. We worried about our children, because they had diarrhea after drinking the water we boiled from the affected well,” said Ruteta.

North Tarawa, while still part of the main island of Kiribati, is only accessible by boat and remains largely subsistence-based, with residents gathering most of their food and water from their surroundings. Until recently, communities used ground water from wells for all their cooking, drinking and farming needs. While usually satisfactory after boiling, ground water can become contaminated by seawater during floods and king tides, making people – especially children – sick. Prolonged periods of drought, usually during La Nina years, often meant heavy rationing of water, impacting general wellbeing and agriculture.

Infant mortality in Kiribati is the highest in the Pacific Islands, at 43 deaths per thousand live births and infantile diarrhea contributes to this high number.

Through the Kiribati Adaptation Program, which is now in its third phase, rainwater harvesting systems have now been installed in Ruteta’s community, as well as in five other communities nearby.

“Now that we have rainwater tanks our children have fallen ill much less so that makes us very happy. There’s a big difference in the quality of rainwater compared to well-water,” said Ruteta",2017-03-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['islands', 'drop', 'kiribati', 'changehit', 'tides', 'tabonibara', 'drinking', 'water', 'children', 'climate', 'rainwater', 'adapting', 'life', 'usually', 'tarawa', 'drink']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Floodwaters around the giraffes’ home island in Lake Baringo were slowly rising for years, but in 2020, the rate of rising floodwaters increased, ""flooding lakeshore homes, businesses, and threatening the lives of the small group of Rothschild’s giraffe on Longicharo Island, in Ruko Community Conservancy,"" according to a Save the Giraffes Now news release.

Video released by the Northern Rangelands Trust of the final rescue showed Ngarikoni and her calf, Noelle, being tranquilized in order to be ferried to safety without causing the animals further stress.

In the footage, Ngarikoni is seen strolling through the brush as conservationists shoot her with a tranquilizer. She then gallops around as they corralled her to a safe location. Nagarikoni is then seen with a cover over her head as the crew guides her to a barge.

An aerial view shows the giraffe being ferried across the lake to another landmass nearby where she is released and gallops off into the brush once again.

Shortly after Ngarikoni was released, her calf, Noelle, was also released and is seen galloping off the barge to rejoin her mother.

""We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue,"" said David O’Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now. ""With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.""

The urgency to relocate the nine giraffes was essential to preserving their species.

""Rothschild’s (Nubian) giraffe are a dwindling subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and into Uganda. Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya,"" according to the Save the Giraffes Now organization.

The rescue effort was a collaboration among the nonprofit as well as Kenya Wildlife Service, Ruko Community Conservancy and the Northern Rangelands Trust.

""This incredible achievement involved sketching out the innovative rescue, from designing and building the barge (named ""The GiRaft"") to creating a 4,400-acre sanctuary on the mainland for the animals,"" according to a Save the Giraffes Now news release.

Save Giraffes Now is a nonprofit organization that collaborates with over 20 giraffe conservation projects in nine African countries to save giraffes ""from extinction by supporting action-oriented projects with immediate impact.""

1133,FL-2020-000164-IND,11 rain centres to come up in Delhi during monsoon - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/11-rain-centres-to-come-up-in-the-city-during-monsoon/articleshow/76719295.cms,"Image used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: The monsoon is here and along with it comes the opportunity of replenishing dwindling groundwater of the capital.

Delhi Jal Board has issued orders for setting up 12 rain centres to facilitate adoption of rainwater harvesting systems in the monsoon season. While eleven of these units will be located at the district level to provide guidance and technical expertise on installation of such systems, five teams will work on the central level.

A senior DJB official said that a central rain water harvesting cell has already been functional at Varunalaya, the Jal Board headquarters in Jhandewalan. “In order to educate and facilitate the public at large, district-level rain centres are being established in each revenue district. People from neighbouring areas can also seek guidance for installing RWH systems,” an official added.

In August last year, DJB had tweaked the rules to make it mandatory for all properties, with an area of 100sq metres and above, to have functional rainwater harvesting systems, with strong penal provisions for defaulters.

The compliance, however, has been way lower than expectations. While the initial deadline to create the RWH systems in houses was in March 2020, DJB officials said the Covid pandemic had forced them to consider a fresh deadline. “These eleven centres will be headed by an engineer with attending officials helping the residents with the technical know-how, information related to financial assistance and to provide details of executing agencies empaneled with the Jal Board,” an official explained.

The city receives 617mm of annual average rain and this precious resource can be used to recharge the depleting water-levels in the capital, as highlighted in a recent report submitted by the Central Ground Water Board in the apex court.

It is not that rain centres are a new concept in the city. Several years back, three centres were opened in RK Puram, Dwarka and Lajpat Nagar — which managed to do the job for a while but could not yield decent results.

Experts point out that while the policy of providing incentives and penalties encourages people to fall in line, poor enforcement has failed in delivering the original intent of these centres. Waivers, amnesties and delays in deadline for compliance are rampant.

DJB had already given relaxation of troublesome provisions like using activated charcoal as filtration medium and bore-well for making the water harvesting units. “Repeated postponement of deadlines and lax enforcement are to be blamed for the city performing poorly in ground water conservation,” an official point out.

A swimming pool crashed into a car park at a beachfront condominium in southeastern Brazil last week. The shocking incident which happened in Vila Velha, Espírito Santo, was captured on a security camera. The 75-foot long pool suddenly collapsed and turned it into a free car wash.

The CCTV footage shows the pool surrounded by plants and flood lights. No people are visible in the area. The bottom of the pool suddenly collapses in a clean break. The video then transitions to the parking garage below the pool, with is suddenly flooded with water. No people are seen in the garage.

Watch the video here:

The building's 270 residents were evacuated, Brazilian online news portal G1 reported. No injuries were reported in the incident. The accident did not damage vehicles in the indoor parking lot.

Some tenants of the building across the street from Itaparica Beach reported a strong gas odour coming from the heated swimming pool.

Argo, the company that built the 90-unit building, put up displaced tenants in nearby hotels for no cost.

Espírito Santo officials and Vila Velha cleared residents to return to their apartments on Tuesday after engineers inspected the complex and found no structural damage.

The pool was closed for at least three months in 2020 due to a leak, newspaper Folha Vitoria reported.

In October last year, an 18-year-old boy named Kunal Mohite saved the lives of 75 residents from a two-storey residential building collapse in Dombivli, Mumbai.

The East African Community (EAC) Council of Ministers suggests Uganda may have breached the agreements on how much water to release from Nalubaale dam — the main outlet of the world’s largest freshwater lake.

Lake Victoria flows into River Nile, with the dam being one of the two major outlets.

Documents filed at the EAC Council of Ministers say Uganda has refused to execute a new policy governing the release of water in Jinja, a decision that has led to flooding of the lake that could claim more lives and cause destruction.

The council ordered EAC member states to implement the policy in 2012, but over four years, despite protests by Uganda.

Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi voted for its implementation at a Council of Ministers meeting that year.

Uganda insists that the policy, which determines volumes of water to be released based on Lake Victoria levels, cannot be implemented as it does not take into consideration several factors, like extraction in the affected countries.

Life and death

The policy is yet to be implemented. “The 26th EAC Council of Ministers directive on the policy has taken more than four years to implement, not only by Uganda, but also by the partner state,” Uganda says in its appeal to the council.

“Studies that had been directed to be completed by November 2014 have never started. Uganda is, therefore, of the view that the policy cannot be implemented and needs review.”

Nalubaale dam was built as part of a hydropower station in Jinja after Uganda and Egypt signed agreements that the East African country would not do anything to interfere with the flow of the Nile, the world’s longest river.

However, power station operators have, over the years, increased or reduced the volumes of water flowing from the lake based on how much is needed to meet the East African country’s electricity demand.

The release of too much water means Lake Victoria’s depth will decrease, a situation blamed on drought for many years.

Releasing less water means the level of the lake increases and could lead to floods in towns and villages surrounding it.

Floods killed at least six people and displaced 32,000 in Kisumu County and its environs in April and May. Ugandan authorities want the original natural flow out of the lake maintained.

The regional bloc ordered implementation of the schedule after it emerged that Uganda had been violating agreements to maintain the natural Lake Victoria outflow volumes before Nalubaale dam was built.

Mitigation measures

Uganda says the studies that led to the policy failed to consider major water extractions in the three countries.

It adds that the EAC Council of Ministers ordered the implementation of the policy before more data and information on water extraction in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania had been collected, yet that was recommended by experts whose reports were used in formulating it.

“The developed and adopted blueprint is therefore only a release policy and not a release and abstraction one,” Uganda says in its appeal.

“Potential impacts of the policy in Lake Victoria Basin countries as well as downstream states was not carried out to provide mitigation measures for a win-win situation as directed by the Council of Ministers.”

“Uganda has more than 600 kilometres of River Nile across her territory that includes lakes Kyoga and Albert. It has made significant developments based on the agreed curve policy that came into existence in 1954, which will be affected by the new water release and abstraction policy.”

The construction of Nalubaale hydroelectric power station in 1954 provided a reliable source of electricity for Uganda, but the decision has come to haunt hundreds of thousands of families living around the lake.

Before the construction of Nalubaale, the Owen and Ripon waterfalls were the main links between Lake Victoria and the Nile.

The waterfalls also acted as a natural tap, controlling the Nile and Lake Victoria outflows. After signing the agreements with Egypt, Uganda built Owen Falls dam, later renamed Nalubaale.

Preparations for building the giant dam and power station meant that Ripon Falls was to be excavated.

Moderating factor

Eventually, Nalubaale was submerged but Ripon Falls remained.

But as Uganda celebrated its increased electricity supply capacity, it was the beginning of problems for millions of people around areas touched by the lake in the three countries.

Since the commissioning of Nalubaale in 1959, its operators have either increased or reduced Lake Victoria outflows, depending on volumes required for the production of electricity.

When more water is needed to meet growing power demands, operators allow more water to flow out of Victoria, which in turn leads to lower levels in the lake.

Whenever rain falls heavily, Nalubaale has sufficient water. It means less water is released, increasing levels in Lake Victoria in turn.

To increase power production and utilise excess water spills from Nalubaale, Uganda built another dam called Kiira just a kilometre away. President Yoweri Museveni commissioned it in 2003.

In 2005, World Bank senior disaster risk management specialist Daniel Kull led a study that showed that Uganda released more than 50 per cent of the allowed water volumes from Nalubaale and Kiira dams over the previous two years.

Fish population

Mr Kull’s team also found that the drastic fall in Lake Victoria water levels at the time was more as a result of the releases in Jinja than drought as had been widely believed.

“Based on the results of this analysis, it must be concluded that the severe Lake Victoria drops occurring in 2004 and 2005 were about 45 per cent due to drought and 55 per cent due to over-releases from Nalubaale and Kiira dams,” the World Bank disaster risk specialist’s report said.

It added that the rains that followed could not raise the levels of the lake, which was partial evidence that water release had more impact that drought.

Nalubaale dam is operated by Eskom Uganda Ltd — a subsidiary of South Africa’s state-owned Eskom Holdings Ltd.

Eskom has been spilling large volumes of water from Nalubaale and Kiira dams between February and May. The water reached its peak limits after the heavier-than-normal rainfall, leading to floods.

The effects of water releases go beyond flooding. When the water level in the lake drops, it affects the fish population.

As marine creatures move inwards to deeper waters, fishermen follow them. They at times get arrested after ending up in Uganda or Tanzania.

At least 70 Kenyan fishermen were arrested after crossing into Uganda between May and October last year.

They were released after paying heavy fines. Others had their boats confiscated. Some complained of being tortured and beaten by Ugandan security officials.",2020-05-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['lake', 'policy', 'releasing', 'dam', 'council', 'lvictoria', 'floods', 'uganda', 'water', 'release', 'volumes', 'ugandas', 'nalubaale', 'victoria', 'blamed']",Uganda,news article,English

As of 25 September, flooding has affected around 1.7 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected exceeding last years totals, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains are expected to subside in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, they will affect more areas in Central Africa. Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. Due to the frequency and scale of the incidents, additional support is often required.

1026,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"Rain-on-snow flood risk to increase in many mountain regions of the western U.S., Canada - Science Daily",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180806162726.htm,"Flooding caused by rain falling on snowpack could more than double by the end of this century in some areas of the western U.S. and Canada due to climate change, according to new research from the University of Colorado Boulder and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

The greatest flood risk increases are projected for the Sierra Nevada, the Colorado River headwaters and the Canadian Rocky Mountains -- places where residents are no strangers to flood concerns. Conversely, lower elevations in coastal regions of California, Oregon, Washington and maritime British Columbia could see decreases in rain-on-snow flood risk.

The findings were published today in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Rain-on-snow events vary widely in timing and scale but can cause costly and damaging flooding as rapid snowmelt triggered by heavy and prolonged rainfall converge in a cascade that can overwhelm downstream rivers and reservoirs. In 2017, California's Oroville Dam nearly failed catastrophically due to such an event, leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people and $1 billion in infrastructure damages.

""Rain-on-snow events can be intense and dangerous in mountainous areas, but they are still relatively poorly understood,"" said Keith Musselman, lead author of the study and a research associate at CU Boulder's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR). ""We can infer a little bit from streamflow, but we want to get better measurements and model more of the variables involved.""

To study the past, present and potential future of rain-on-snow events, the researchers turned to a state-of-the-art weather modeling dataset developed at NCAR. Known as CONUS 1, the dataset contains weather simulations across the continental U.S. in the current climate and a warmer future based on projected climate trends. The enormous data trove -- which took NCAR's Yellowstone supercomputer more than a year to compile -- offers unprecedented detail and resolution.

""This high-res dataset allows us to resolve mountains in granular fashion and examine the factors that combine to melt the snowpack when a warm storm comes in and hits cold mountains like the Sierra,"" Musselman said.

The authors found that in a warmer climate, less frequent snow-cover at lower elevations would decrease the risk for rain-on-snow flood events in areas like the U.S. Pacific Northwest. By contrast, at higher elevations where winter snow will still accumulate despite climate warming (such as in the High Sierra and much of the Rocky Mountains), rain-on-snow events could become more frequent due to increased rainfall that might once have fallen as snow. The events will also become more intense.

The rain and melt produced during rain-on-snow events is projected to increase for a majority of western North American river basins as rain rather than snow affects more mountain watersheds, increasing the corresponding flood risk by as much as 200 percent in localized areas and potentially straining existing flood control infrastructure.

""We were surprised at how big some of the projected changes were,"" Musselman said. ""We didn't expect to see huge percentage increases in places that already have rain-on-snow flooding.""

The findings represent an important first step toward better understanding rain-on-snow flood risk in the context of anthropogenic climate change, which could significantly shift the timing and extent of future flood regimes.

The researchers hope that continued investment in snowpack monitoring networks and efforts such as NASA's Airborne Snow Observatory will provide additional ground information, allowing hydrologists and climate scientists to verify their models against observations and better inform flood risk assessment now and in the future.

According to a report published in Dawn, the takeover of the local market share by a Chinese product is not uncanny and is similar to several Made in China products that have flooded local markets.

Earlier, the Chinese car tyres held 40 per cent of the market share in 2018. The share now has since increased to 85 per cent. ""In the light truck category tyres, China held a share of 30-40 per cent two years ago which has now gone up to 65-70 per cent,"" the report said.

Moreover, Beijing also dominates in truck/bus tyres with over 75 per cent market share which was merely 40 per cent two years back.



""Mushroom growth has been noted in the number of dealers who are regularly flooding the market with Chinese tyres,"" former chairman of the Pakistan Tyre Importers and Dealers Association (PTIDA) Azim K. Yousufzai told Dawn.

The association leader said the low prices were the main reason for the surging market share of Chinese tyres. They are cheaper than European, Korean, Thai and American tyres.

On the smuggling of tyres, Yousufzai said the illegal arrival of different types of tyres has slowed down drastically owing to strict vigil at the border areas.

""Strict monitoring at the borders has brought down informal arrival of tyres from 50-60 pc to 20pc,"" he claimed.

Over the decrease in sales of Pakistani tyres, the association leader said that the government has reduced the regulatory duty (RD) to 10-20 per cent for various categories of imported tyres which is among the factors encouraging legal imports. (ANI)

The fatality is the first confirmed death in New South Wales since the catastrophic weather event began. Authorities confirmed the Pakistani National was driving a hire car when he hit trouble and made several attempts to escape before his care experienced a possible electronic failure. He spent almost an hour on the phone to triple-0 before losing contact with emergency services who responded to reports at 6:30am on Wednesday. The Daily Telegraph is reporting the incident occurred on the corner of Cattai Ridge Road and Hidden Valley Lane in Glenorie, with the mans body and vehicle discovered at 1:10pm yesterday.

A Pakistani national killed in Sydney floodwaters was on the phone to emergency services and tried desperately to free himself from his car but he could not get out.

Ayaz Younus, 25, was on his first day as a contractor when his Toyota Camby became trapped in floodwaters in Glenorie on Sydneys northern outskirts.

Farhat Jaffri, from the Pakistan Association of Australia, said he had spoken to the mans father.

Mr Younus, from Malir Cantt Karachi, was studying software engineering and had two elder brothers and one younger sister, Mr Jaffri said.

Family has requested to send the body back to Karachi, Mr Jaffri said.

I have requested to Consul General to take care of this matter and offered any assistance from Pakistan Association of Australia.

You can only just imagine somebody fighting for their life to get out of the car  thats what the inside damage of the car looked like, Detective Inspector Chris Laird said as he described the horrific scene on Wednesday.

Police said the man called emergency services just before 6.30am after he became trapped in floodwaters on Cattai Ridge Road in Glenorie.

He managed to stay on the phone to Triple-0 for nearly 40 minutes until the connection was lost.

His vehicle was later found just after 1pm with his body inside.

Inspector Laird said the 25-year-old man was on the first day of a new contracting job.

We can only speculate that he may have not known the area as locals would  he may not have seen the water as he drove in given the fact that the gates across the road were completely submerged, he told reporters.

Sadly, in hindsight we can always say never drive into a swollen road and that will form part of our inquiries.

Inspector Laird described the mans death as an absolute tragedy and said it was a miracle no one else had been killed in Sydneys catastrophic floods.

We can only speculate again that, given what I have seen and the damage to the vehicle, that it could very well be that the electrics totally failed and he was simply unable to escape from the car, which is an absolute tragedy, he said.

Also, the fact that he was on the phone for so long is even more tragic and is going to form part of our inquiries as to what actually went on in the car and why this tragic accident occurred.

Inspector Laird said there were no broken windows and the man clearly couldnt get out.

A report will be prepared for the coroner.

Just hours after telling reporters it was simply a miracle there had been no deaths in the wildly destructive floods, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told parliament the state had recorded its first fatality.

Unfortunately, we have received news of a fatality in the northwest of Sydney flood waters, she said during question time on Wednesday afternoon.

Because its early stages, I will allow emergency services to comment at the appropriate time to ensure arrangements have been made with next of kin.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton also addressed the tragedy in federal parliament.

It underscores the messages everybody from the NSW Premier, the Prime Minister down have been issuing over recent days, and that is, please, do not enter these floodwaters.



Scott Morrison expressed his deepest condolences, on behalf of the parliament to the mans family.

As the floodwaters recede and the clean-up begins ... their house will be dark and their grief will be great because their loss will not recede, Mr Morrison said.

I just pray a blessing on their family.

He also paid tribute to the NSW police officers who responded to the incident.

Labor leader Anthony Albanese joined the Prime Minister in expressing his regret for this tragic loss of life.

He reiterated that water and cars dont mix, reminding Australians it was better to be delayed than to take risks during the significant weather event lashing the east coast.

Mr Albanese said no more lives being lost over the past few days was a credit to Australians.

During the 2013 Uttarakhand flash floods, the highest flood level at Joshimath was 1,385.54m.

The water level of the Dhauliganga river at Joshimath flowed at a perilously high level, breaching all records, Central Water Commission officials said after a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district leading to massive floods.

The glacial burst triggered an avalanche and a deluge in the Alaknanda river system that washed away hydroelectric stations and trapped more than 100 labourers who are feared dead. The intensity of the river’s flow in a short span of time was such that it engulfed whatever came in its way.

This was a grim reminder of the Kedarnath deluge of 2013 which led to widespread devastation in the ecologically fragile Himalayan region.

“At 11 am, the water level recorded at Joshimath was 1,388m,” Saumitra Haldar, chairman, Central Water Commission told PTI. During the 2013 Uttarakhand flash floods, the highest flood level (HFL) at Joshimath was 1,385.54m, he added.

However, by 6 p.m. on February 7, the water level of the river had reached the normal levels recorded a day before, said Rajesh Kumar, the superintendent engineer (Upper and Middle Ganga division) of the Central Water Commission. He said water levels have started receding.

At Joshimath, which bore the fury of floods, the water level recorded at 1 p.m. on February 6 was 1,372.58m. At 6 p.m. on February 7, hours after the disaster, the water level was 1,375m.

In Nandprayag, at the lower stretches of the river, the water level at 6 p.m. was 840.40m. A day before, it was 848.30m at 1 p.m. Mr. Kumar said the situation was similar in Rudraprayag, Srinagar, Devprayag, Rishikesh and Devprayag.

The water level at the Srinagar Hydroelectric Project was also at the Mean Draw Down Level which helped accommodate excess flow from the upper stretches. This will be released slowly, Mr. Halder added.

The sudden flood in the middle of the day in the Dhauliganga, Rishiganga and Alaknanda rivers — all intricately linked tributaries of the Ganga — triggered widespread panic and large-scale devastation in the high mountain areas.

957,FL-2019-000084-IND,"Explained: Why Assam is prone to floods, and what the solution is - The Indian Express",https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-behind-assams-flood-fury-5836815/,"Assam floods: A submerged village in Morigaon district, east of Guwahati, on Thursday. (PTI Photo) Assam floods: A submerged village in Morigaon district, east of Guwahati, on Thursday. (PTI Photo)

Assam is in the grip of yet another flood, with 57 lakh people affected across all 33 districts, and 36 people killed besides hundreds of animals. This is the first wave of floods this monsoon, and flood control experts expect at least two more. A look at why Assam has traditionally been flood-prone, what measures have been taken over the years, and what has been proposed as a long-term solution:

Why are floods so destructive in Assam?

Apart from incessant rainfall during the monsoon, there are many contributory factors, natural and man-made. At the crux is the very nature of the river Brahmaputra —dynamic and unstable. Its 580,000 sq km basin spreads over four countries: China, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, with diverse environments.

The Brahmaputra features among the world’s top five rivers in terms of discharge as well as the sediment it brings. At 19,830 cubic meters per second (cumec), it ranks fourth in discharge at the mouth, behind only the Amazon (99,150 cumec), the Congo (39,660 cumec) and the Yangtze (21,800 cumec), according to data from a 2008 research paper by retired Gauhati University professor Dulal Chandra Goswami, an environmentalist acknowledged as an authority on the Brahmaputra. In terms of sediment yield, two spots along the Brahmaputa’s course were at second and third places in 2008, behind the Yellow River whose annual sediment yield is 1,403 tonnes per sq km. The Brahmaputra’s annual sediment yield was 1,128 tonnes per sq km at Bahadurabad of Bangladesh, and 804 tonnes per sq km at Pandu of Guwahati.

Assam floods: The vast amount of sediment comes from Tibet, where the river originates. Assam floods: The vast amount of sediment comes from Tibet, where the river originates.

How do these characteristics of the river relate to flooding?

The vast amount of sediment comes from Tibet, where the river originates. “That region is cold, arid and lacks plantation. Glaciers melt, soil erodes and all of it results in a highly sedimented river,” said Dhrubajyoti Borgohain, a retired chief engineer of the Brahmaputra Board, a central government body functioning under the Jal Shakti Ministry’s Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, and whose responsibilities include flood control in the Brahmaputra basin.

By the time the river enters Assam — a state comprising primarily floodplains surrounded by hills on all sides — it deposits vast amounts of this silt, leading to erosion and floods. “As the river comes from a high slope to a flat plain, its velocity decreases suddenly and this results in the river unloading the sediment,” said Borgohain. The river’s channels prove inadequate amid this siltation, leading to floods.

Again, because of the earthquake-prone nature of the region, the river has not been able to acquire a stable character. Following the devastating earthquake of 1950, the level of the Brahmaputra rose by two metres in Dibrugarh area in eastern Assam.

Besides these natural factors are the man-made ones — habitation, deforestation, population growth in catchment areas (including in China) — which lead to higher sedimentation. For example, the sediment deposition itself creates temporary sandbars or river islands.

It is common for people to settle in such places, which restricts the space the river has to flow. When rainfall is heavy, it combines with all these factors and leads to destructive floods. This happens very frequently.

How bad is the current flood compared to previous ones?

While floods are a regular annual feature in Assam, some years witness more destruction than others. In terms of impact on human lives, the floods of 1988, 1998 and 2004 were the worst; the 2004 floods alone affected 12.4 million people and claimed 251 lives. The current wave of floods has affected 57 lakh people and claimed 36 lives so far. But experts say that the worst is yet to come.

“This is only the first major flood wave this season. We are expected to experience two to three more flood waves until the end of the rainy season, which will last till mid-October. In terms of total annual scale and effect of flooding, we had seen worse floods in 1988, 1998, 2004 and 2012. But if a few more large flood waves hit the state in the next two-and-a-half months, this year could well be recorded as one of the most severe flood years,” said Partha J Das, who heads the Water, Climate & Hazard Division of Guwahati-based Aaranyak.

Has the government tried to address the factors that cause floods?

In its master plan on the river in 1982, the Brahmaputra Board had suggested that dams and reservoirs be built to mitigate floods. The idea of dams, however, has traditionally been a double-edged sword. While one of their objectives is to regulate the release of flood waters, the release when it comes can sometimes be beyond the capacity of the channels downstream. In the Brahmaputra basin, locals and environmentalists protested against dam-building plans on grounds of displacement and destruction of evology, preventing the plans from moving forward.

“The Brahmaputra Board proposed a multipurpose dam in the present Gerukamukh site where NHPC (National Hydroelectric Power Corporation) is constructing the Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project. But the proposal was scrapped because of objections by the Arunachal government due to submergence [concerns], which included a few small towns as well,” said Guwahati-based environmentalist and engineer Pradip Kumar Bhuyan. In fact, the Subansiri project — on which the government spent crores — too has been suspended.

As such, the government has been using only one approach towards floods: building embankments on the river. “Embankments were proposed only as an interim and ad hoc measure for short-term mitigation,” said Aaranyak’s Das. Their lack of durability has often been on display.

“Most embankments built in the 1980s are not strong enough. Since they were temporary measures, the government did not spend on high-specification embankments. These are weak and are regularly breached,” a government official said.

The government also considered dredging, basically digging up the riverbed and making the river “deeper”. However, experts have strongly advised against this simply because the Brahmaputra sediment yield is among the highest in the world. “Experts believe that even if we take out all the silt this year, more silt will be deposited the following year, making the very expensive effort futile,” said Borgohain, the retired Brahmaputra Board engineer.

Dr Goswami, the retired Gauhati University professor, feels that the government’s measures have been “piecemeal” and “short-term”.

“They are not addressing the problem at the source — they are firefighting,” Dr Goswami said.

But, is there a long-term solution?

Dr Goswami said that for a sustainable solution, there needs to be “a basin-wide approach” to the problem. He calls this an “integrated basin management” system that should ideally bring in all the basin-sharing countries on board. “Addressing the issues only in Assam when the flood strikes isn’t the solution — one needs the countries to come to an understanding about taking measures in the catchment areas.” For that, interstate relationships, political cooperation and the role of the government are important.

Borgohain suggested “flood-plain” zoning, which is done the US. “Depending on the vulnerability of the area, you divide them into categories, and accordingly ban certain activities on it: like farming, building a house etc,” he said, “That is one option. We can’t help the rain but we can certainly control the damage caused by floods.”",2019-07-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['sediment', 'prone', 'brahmaputra', 'gauhati', 'flood', 'affected', 'comes', 'east', 'floods', 'assam', 'explained', 'solution', 'river']",India,news article,English
1422,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Karachi business grapples with the aftermath of flooding - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1576950,"KARACHI: As the water level receded, business and industry struggled to restore normalcy around the mega city. Fuel pumps ran dry, telecom towers fell out of service and many ATM machines were either not functioning or empty of cash.

Those few pumps where fuel was available were mobbed by motorbikes and cars as well as scores of people holding jerry cans to carry fuel for generators as the city-wide power outage extended beyond 24 hours.

People thronged to supermarkets and corner shops to replenish food stocks, only to find them shut or flooded, and in some cases, the large sections of the artificial ceilings had fallen in as rain water seeped through the roof.

Fuel supplies at the terminals in Keamari are ample an executive from a large oil marketing company told Dawn early on Friday. But before we can start sending out tankers to replenish supplies at retail outlets, we have to test the fuel that is already there to determine whether or not it has been contaminated with flood water. If it has then the underground storage tank needs to first be emptied out before more fuel is poured into it.

The process could take days but the executive told Dawn that fuel deliveries from the Keamari terminals to some outlets, where underground tanks were not contaminated, had begun by Friday evening and would continue overnight.

ATMs out of cash, fuel pumps dry, telecom service down

The situation should substantially normalise by Saturday morning.

The prolonged power outage also impacted many other services. Aisha Sarwari, spokesperson for Jazz told Dawn that largely due to infrastructural challenges and power outages in Karachi, network disruptions are hard to contain, especially when the damage is this large-scale.

She said knock on effects occur following prolonged power outages once the back up generators that power telecom towers start running out of fuel. Nobody from the telecom sector was willing to give an estimate for how long it will take to restore normal service, but most said it could take a few working days.

Many ATMs around the city were also not functional when people ventured out after the deluge. ATMs work primarily on communication networks, availability of electricity and whether staff can reach the locations to replenish the cash says Ali Habib, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at HBL.

He said his bank was able to ensure that at least 55 per cent of our network across the city was functional on Friday morning.

The inundation triggered the power outages and brought movement around the city to a halt, which in turn had knock on effects on communication, banking services and fuel supply across the city. It was late into the day on Friday when normalcy began to return to the life of the city as the weekend began.

Meanwhile, the citys utility took to social media middle of the day on Friday to say that close to 80 per cent feeders are powered up.

Many parts of Defence, Clifton, Bahadurabad continue to remain submerged and our substations are also badly affected in these areas due to waterlogging, the statement said.

By Friday night, reports of power being restored were being received from a growing number of localities around the city.

729,Drought Sri Lanka,England looking to end 38-year trophy drought - Stabroek News,https://www.stabroeknews.com/2013/06/23/sports/england-looking-to-end-38-year-trophy-drought/,"(BBC) Captain Alastair Cook hopes England can end a 38-year wait for a major 50-over trophy when they play India in today’s Champions Trophy final at Edgbaston.

England have never won a World Cup or Champions Trophy and will face an unbeaten India.

“It’s very important for us, one of our major goals this summer was to try and win the Champions Trophy,” Cook said.

“Not only will it break that duck of 38 years but prepare us well for the World Cup [in 2015], looking long-term.”

England have won only one ICC global event but that was in the Twenty20 format in 2010.

They have lost three World Cup finals, the last of which was in 1992, and also lost the 2004 Champions Trophy final to West Indies

.

England swing bowler James Anderson is second in the leading wicket-taker table with 10 scalps, only one behind New Zealand’s Mitchell McClenaghan.

Spinner James Tredwell has four wickets in three matches at a cost of 24.25 each and an economy rate of 4.61 per over deputising for Graeme Swann, who took 1-50 from 10 overs in his one match against the Sri Lankans. Cook gave no indication as to who would play in the final but said: “We’re very lucky to have two off-spinners who are outstanding, when one doesn’t play the other one does well and puts pressure on the other guy so Tredders has been given an opportunity and he has taken it just like we knew he would.” Tim Bresnan, who has taken four wickets in three matches, is available for selection having missed the semi-final following the birth of his son, Max Geoffrey.

Bad weather is expected at Edgbaston today and Cook is prepared for a shortened contest. “They’ve got a wealth of Twenty20 experience, they play a lot more than we do but I wouldn’t doubt anyone in our team – we’ve had these shortened games before and adjusted well so if it happens in the final there will be no reason why we can’t adjust,” added Cook.

“We’ve got an opportunity to win a major global trophy, which as a squad doesn’t come around often, so we’re desperate to take it.”

Thirty years ago this month India won their first World Cup and they won the competition again when it was last held in 2011. They are yet to win the Champions Trophy outright, having shared the trophy with Sri Lanka in 2002, and have lost in the first round in each of the last three events but beat England 3-2 when the teams last met in a one-day series in India in January.

Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said: “It’s a very important game, but in this tournament you only face the best of teams, so I think it will be a very good contest. England are a very good side, they know the conditions quite well so I think it will be very good for the spectators – that’s what we want to do, entertain the crowd.”

Asked about the measured style of batting favoured by England’s top three, he said: “They play proper cricket and often you need to see how athings are progressing.

With no reserve day scheduled for the final the tie must be decided on today, meaning an abandonment would result in the teams sharing the trophy.

435,DR-2021-000054-SOM,"Tapping regional integration to bolster resilience in the Horn of Africa In 2020, the economies of - World Bank Group",https://blogs.worldbank.org/nasikiliza/tapping-regional-integration-bolster-resilience-horn-africa,"In 2020, the economies of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia together grew by 0.88%, despite the significant downside risks precipitated by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic and the accompanying economic shakeout. Stark divergence in growth profiles, underlying fragilities and significant risks create a complex context going forward. It is against this backdrop of risk tempered with cautious optimism that the Finance Ministers of the Horn of Africa Initiative met virtually on March 31, 2021 to further the gains realized in strengthening regional integration in order to bolster resilience in the Horn of Africa.

Crowding in capital to support connectivity and unlock opportunity is a priority under the Horn of Africa Initiative. Of the agreed package of $15 billion, an initial tranche of $3.3 billion has been mobilized from the Africa Development Bank (AfDB), the European Union (EU) and the World Bank to support regional economic corridors, energy trade, digital economy, trade facilitation, disease surveillance and response to the locusts’ crisis. For example, the AfDB and the World Bank have teamed up to support the Isiolo/Mandera corridor, with the Bank funding $750 million through the Horn of Africa Gateway Development project. The Bank has approved a $500 million Emergency Locust Response Project with a Multiphase Programmatic Approach to help support countries in the Horn affected by locust invasions. The EU has also greenlighted $88 million for locust response and another $45 million to promote harmonized trading frameworks between Djibouti and Ethiopia. In 2021, AfDB is prioritizing three projects worth an estimated $500 million for implementation. The World Bank alongside the AfDB have mobilized about $600 million to support second Ethiopia-Djibouti Interconnector and the Ethiopia-Somalia Interconnectors. The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development supports the Initiative with its deep experience in the region and technical insights.

These interventions strengthen the relationships and connectivity across the Horn of Africa to help create jobs, mitigate emerging risks and strengthen resilience. Connected roads, access to energy, and digital systems are a catalyst for commerce; they help businesses trim their overheads and strengthen linkages to regional and global value chains. Investments in agriculture and pastoral value chains spur the creation of livelihoods and help to bring economic activity and services to neglected borderland areas. Last, but not least, such interventions create a multiplier for growth and development within broadly underserved markets and can help to address significant inequalities across the sub-region.

Horn of Africa Initiative member countries are working together to deepen regional integration with help from the newly-established 30 million Euro Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), contributed to by the EU and to be administered by the World Bank. Activities under this trust fund will accelerate the pace at which proposals can be translated into viable projects on the ground. The MDTF creates an avenue through which donors can also easily support projects under the Horn of Africa Initiative. The activation of the MDTF is critical given the plan to reach out to more development partners to finance the remaining part of the $15 billion priority financing package.

The Horn of Africa Initiative is also exploring innovative ways to help member states address the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, deal with drought and other climate related crises, and to support displaced populations. Countries have come together in multiple workshops to agree on and prioritize their collective efforts, providing a platform to keep the cooperation advancing even under the weight of the crisis. The initiative has also prioritized the ‘soft aspects’ of the partnership such as policy harmonization across member countries to ensure real spillover benefits, which are vital to enhance regional results and resilience.

Overall, the countries of the Horn of Africa Initiative are moving forward toward a more interconnected, a more integrated and a more resilient Horn. Sudan has participated as an observer and will likely join as formal member in autumn, further broadening the initiative’s potential and impact.",2021-04-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['help', 'million', 'africa', 'support', 'bank', 'bolster', 'development', 'initiative', 'resilience', 'tapping', 'integration', 'countries', 'regional', 'horn']",Somalia,news article,English

ALAPPUZHA: Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said that local bodies should join hands and set up a Kuttanad model for making flood hit Kuttanad clean and epidemics free.

""The state government has increased the financial assistance to the families, whose house was flooded at least two days, from Rs 3,800 to Rs 10,000. The government will provide Rs 10 lakh to those lost their land and homes in the flood. Those lost homes in the flood will get Rs 4 lakh. We have ensured adequate money for this purpose,"" said Isaac, who was speaking at the meeting for reviewing the flood situation in Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts, here on Tuesday.

However, the district collector S Suhas asked all the people living on the banks of rivers in Alappuzha to be vigilant following the shutters of various dams like Kakki as part of the Sabarigiri hydroelectric project in Pathanamthitta were opened. However, the water level has not increased drastically in Kuttanad areas and no relief camps were opened on Tuesday.

As many as 32689 members of 8339 families depending on these centres for food.

Finance minister Isaac said that the main challenge for the local bodies in Kuttanad is to remove the mud that accumulated in houses and land after the flood waters engulfed Kuttanad. Each local body should identify a space for depositing this mud. All the local bodies should roll out an action plan for removing the mud from the houses and public places within August 25. The local bodies should utilize MGNREGA programme for placing coir geotextiles protecting Kuttanad from flood. The local bodies should also come forward to remove the plastic waste arrived in Kuttanad with flood waters. Steps should also be taken for removing the plastic bottles in which mineral water are now being handed over to Kuttanad people for drinking purpose. One day cleaning drive should be conducted for this purpose,"" he said.

""Kudumbashree should lead the cleaning works in the flood hit homes. We have to also ensure clean potable water to the flood hit people. The officials concerned should ensure that the people drink only boiled water. The civic bodies should also take steps for storing the rain water in maximum places for drinking purpose in future. The health department has taken effective steps to prevent the out breaking of epidemics in Kuttanad. This attention and action should continue,"" Isaac said.

The finance minister said that Alappuzha district collector S Suhas will coordinate the relief activities in the flood hit Kuttanad that spreading in Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts.

On Tuesday, Keraleeya Kendra Sanghatana Bombay of Keralites settled in Mumbai handed over 1000 kits consisting clothes and medicines to Alappuzha district administration for distributing to flood hit people of Kuttanad.

The State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) has issued a red alert for eight districts in Kerala following an extremely heavy rainfall warning by the weather office.

The red alert will be in place till August 14 for Wayanad district and August 13 for Idukki, while for Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Palakkad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode it will be till Saturday. An advisory issued by the SDMA directed the public to avoid travel through hilly areas from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. in view of the possibility of landslips.

Citizens have been advised not to venture into the sea as well as rivers, streams and other waterbodies prone to flash floods. They have also been directed not to park vehicles under trees or near waterfalls on ghat roads.

The advisory also calls on citizens to be ready for evacuation on the direction of officials and avoid visiting places where floods and landslips have occurred.

Meanwhile, the midday weather inference issued by the India Met Department (IMD) on Friday indicated that conditions in the Bay of Bengal were becoming favourable to drive the southwest monsoon into an aggressive phase. The cyclonic circulation over North Odisha and neighbourhood and another similar system over West Central Bay of Bengal and adjoining south coastal Andhra Pradesh were likely to be joined by a fresh low pressure area brewing over the northwest Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood around August 13. The cyclonic circulation over the Southeast Arabian sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area, however, has become less marked.

The Met Centre here has warned of strong winds from the westerly direction, speed occasionally reaching 25-35 kmph gusting up to 55 kmph, were likely along and off the Kerala and Karnataka coasts and Lakshadweep areas. Fishermen have be advised to venture out to sea till Saturday evening.

The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad, has also issued a tidal flooding alert for Kerala from August 11 to 15, ""The perigean spring tides during the period could lead to flooding all along the Kerala coast, worsening the situation in low-lying areas such as Kuttanad and preventing the discharge of floodwaters released from reservoirs and swollen rivers into the sea.

793,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Climate Change Profile: Mozambique - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/climate-change-profile-mozambique,"Introduction

This climate change profile is designed to help integrate climate actions into development activities. It complements the publication ‘Climate-smart = Future-Proof! – Guidelines for Integrating climate-smart actions into development policies and activities’ and provides answers to some of the questions that are raised in the step-by-step approach in these guidelines.

The current and expected effects of climate change differ locally, nationally and regionally. The impacts of climate change effects on livelihoods, food and water security, ecosystems, infrastructure etc. differ per country and region as well as community and individual, with gender a particularly important vulnerability factor. This profile aims to give insight in the climate change effects and impacts in Mozambique, with particular attention for food security and water. It also sheds light on the policies, priorities and commitments of the government in responding to climate change and important climate-relevant activities that are being implemented, including activities being internationally financed.

Summary

Mozambique is one of Africa’s most vulnerable countries to climate change. Poverty, weak institutional development and frequent extreme weather events make Mozambique especially vulnerable. Climate-related hazards such as droughts, floods and cyclones are occurring with increasing frequency, which is having a cumulative and devastating impact on a population that is insufficiently prepared.

Central Mozambique is projected to experience recurrent agricultural losses as a result of droughts, floods, and uncontrolled bush fires. The densely populated coastal lowlands will be increasingly affected by severe erosion, saltwater intrusion, loss of vital infrastructure and the spread of diseases such as malaria, cholera, and influenza.

Changing rainfall patterns will lead to a decrease of soil water recharge, impacting ground water resources and the water table in wells. Reduction of Mozambique’s trans-boundary river flows will decrease the availability of surface water.",2019-02-05 08:00:00+00:00,"['security', 'mozambique', 'change', 'climate', 'development', 'effects', 'profile', 'vulnerable', 'activities', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English

From the emergence of new cities and countries, to new industries and technologies, Africa is a continent that is alive with rapid change – but not all change is welcome.

Scientists estimate that over the past 100 years, temperatures across Africa have increased by an average of 0.5 – 2 degrees. It may not sound significant, but the impacts are life-changing. From changing weather patterns that reduce crop yields in Malawi, to natural disasters which threaten lives in Southern Africa, or the 2018 crisis that saw Cape Town facing ‘Day Zero’ without water, the fall-out of changing climate is evident across this continent.

We know that climate change hits the most vulnerable first and hardest. Worldwide 100 million people are already at risk of being pushed into poverty by climate change by 2030 – particularly across Sub Saharan Africa – and 720 million by 2050. 65% of the African population is likely to be impacted by the consequences of climate change – despite the fact that African nations are responsible for just 2-3% of global emissions.

Communities around the world are waking up to the scale of this climate disaster – in recent months the UK has passed a landmark piece of legislation, becoming the first major economy to write into law a commitment to end its contribution to global warming by 2050.

It is right that the UK makes big changes domestically, but given the global scale of the challenge it is also right that we work together with our global partners.

The UK’s former International Development Secretary Rory Stewart was recently in Kenya, where he has seen first-hand how the UK is working with the Kenyan government, institutions and civil society to tackle both the causes and consequences of changing climates across East Africa – and announced the UK’s single largest direct aid investment in climate and environment across Africa, with £250 million of transformative funding.

And in Kenya he saw some brilliant success stories, including the largest on-shore wind farm in sub-Saharan Africa, which – with support from UK businesses and UK aid – is providing approximately 17% of the country’s installed power capacity.

Almost three-quarters of Kenya’s electricity comes from renewable sources – it is home to hydro, wind and solar energy production, making the most of the country’s fantastic natural resources.

This is exciting for two reasons. Firstly, because it showcases how the continent can embrace innovative, low-carbon and efficient technologies, leapfrogging over dirty energy sources. What’s more, it demonstrates the potential for clean economic growth and job creation in this cutting-edge sector – at the same time, helping protect the environment for the majority of Kenyans who rely on agriculture and predictable rainfall for their livelihoods.

There’s more that can be done. At the G20 earlier this month the former British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that all UK aid investments will consider the risks and opportunities posed by climate change. This makes the UK the first major economy to combine a legally-binding aid spending target with a commitment to align support for developing countries with the Paris Agreement.

The world is currently on course to warm by more than 3 degrees by the end of the century. This need to advocate for urgent international climate action is why the UK has bid to host COP26 in partnership with Italy in 2020.

We cannot allow increasing temperatures and extreme weather to continue having a profound and devastating impact on the lives and livelihoods of communities across Africa.

After Sri Lanka had Australia wobbling a 28-3 inside Friday's first hour, Burns and Head hit centuries in a record-breaking 308-run fourth-wicket stand in the second test - the first to be played at Manuka Oval.

Burns went to stumps unbeaten on 172, becoming the first Australian opener to bat through the first day of a test in more than two years.

Kurtis Patterson is with him on 25, but only after Head had compiled a stylish 161 including a run-scoring spree after tea of 63 runs from 50 balls.

Batting together for the first time in a test, the pair took few risks early but punished anything loose from a Sri Lankan attack, missing their three quicks from the Gabba through injury.

MARK KOLBE/GETTY IMAGES Travis Head celebrates his maiden test century for Australia during day one of the second test against Sri Lanka in Canberra.

Burns was particularly strong off the back foot, pulling all three of their replacement quicks for boundaries through mid-wicket after getting off the mark with two cover drives for four.

He brought up his fourth test century with a drop-and-run off Kasun Rajitha, taking a load of pressure off Australia's otherwise barren top order in the process.

The Queenslander has put forward the strongest case possible for a ticket to the Ashes in August, when he might push to open with David Warner or bat in the middle order like he had done on debut.

Head looks a certainty to be there, with his maiden hundred coming after three half-centuries earlier this summer.

He again cut extremely well - with eight of his 21 boundaries coming through the point region - while he brought up his century when he danced down the wicket to Dilruwan Perera and whacked him to the boundary.

His downfall eventually came when he was trapped lbw to Vishwa Fernando (3-99), but not before he and Burns had combined for the team's highest partnership against Sri Lanka in Australia.

Sri Lanka were also their own worst enemies, dropping Burns and Patterson once each and Head twice - all from relatively simple chances at test level.

But still, the pair's runs came after Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne and the out-of-form Usman Khawaja failed to impress in their last tests before the Ashes.

1332,FL-2020-000207-NGA,A Flood of Polluting Air Conditioners Hampers Africa's Climate Efforts - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-flood-of-polluting-air-conditioners-hampers-africas-climate-efforts,"As air conditioning sales in Africa soar, many of the units imported there are old and inefficient, driving up electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. But some countries are taking action, banning the import of used air conditioners and adopting tough energy standards.

Its early August and a dozen air conditioners are keeping Joy Obehis clients cool on another hot steamy day in Lagos, Nigeria. But invariably the electricity flickers off and her expensive diesel generator rumbles to life. The power goes out pretty much every day, usually for one hour or two hours, said Obehi, who rents out short-term meeting space and spends as much as $300 a month on diesel fuel. [Air conditioners] use a lot of power, but our clients expect our locations to be cooler. As African incomes rise and the number of hotter days from climate change increases, demand is exploding for air conditioners around the continent. In Nigeria, Africas most populous nation, more than 500,000 air conditioning units are bought each year and the number is increasing by 4 to 5 percent annually, according to a recent report. But that demand comes at a price: the plethora of energy-sapping  but inexpensive  air conditioners that are stressing already overburdened electricity grids, saddling consumers with high energy bills, contributing to more frequent outages that damage local economies, and making a significant contribution to the continents growing greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of used and new inefficient AC appliances are being sold in Africa every year, many of them illegally. Many are obsolete secondhand appliances imported mostly from Europe, despite international laws forbidding such activity. The appliances also contain banned ozone-depleting refrigerants that are potent contributors to climate change.

Electricity demand for air conditioners is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040.

And with cooling demand proliferating due to urbanization and hotter temperatures, Africas air conditioning market is poised to get bigger. Electricity demand for air conditioners and other cooling appliances is on track to jump 10-fold across Africa by 2040, from 11 terawatt-hours (TWh) to 112 terawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency. If African countries adopt stricter air conditioning efficiency standards, energy demand could be cut in half, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 million tons by 2040, according to the United Nations. Africas cooling challenge is part of a much larger trend. Worldwide demand for air conditioners is expected to more than triple in the next 30 years, from 1.6 billion units in 2018 to 5.6 billion units by 2050. That amounts to 10 new air conditioners being sold every second for the next three decades. Without government policies to make air conditioners cleaner and more efficient, greenhouse gas emissions from ACs and other cooling equipment will jump by a projected 90 percent by 2050  a huge step backward in international efforts to limit global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, says a new UN report. Now, some African countries are trying to tamp down on energy-guzzling cooling. Ghana is successfully enforcing a ban on imports of used cooling appliances, including air conditioners. Rwanda approved a similar ban, along with Africas toughest-ever energy performance standards for new cooling appliances, both of which are set to come into effect next year. A half-dozen other countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, have minimum performance standards for new air conditioners and refrigerators. But success is still largely elusive due to weak policies and minimal enforcement. There are not many harmonized efficiency policies at the moment in Africa, and many of them are out of date, not enforced, and not stringent, said Patrick Blake, a policy expert at the UNs United for Efficiency Program (U4E).

Among the countries struggling with the issue is Nigeria, Africas second-largest AC market behind Egypt. Compliance with our energy standards is very, very slow, said Etiosa Uyigue, executive director of a Nigerian environmental group, the Community Research and Development Center (CREDC), which has been pushing for more stringent mandatory energy standards and environmentally friendly refrigerants for all cooling appliances sold in the country. The stakes are enormous. Air conditioner sales are rising steadily across the continent, especially in hotter, more prosperous countries in West Africa. Morocco, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast have all seen a doubling in air conditioner imports since 2010, whether used or new units, according to government data. The United Nations projects that air conditioner stocks will hit 1.5 billion units in Africa by 2030, up from 660 million in 2015. The strains are already being felt. Nigerias limited power supplies, which are half the size of North Carolinas despite having nearly 20 times more people, turn on and off every day and occasionally cause national blackouts, as happened 11 times in 2019. Hot sticky days when air conditioners are humming full throttle are the worst. We just had two outages today, said Uyigue, speaking in July from his home in the capital Abuja, where he uses three generators and a small solar energy system to keep the lights on. A Nigeria Energy Commission study in 2014 estimated that air conditioners account for 25 percent of total energy consumption in Abuja and 17 percent nationally. Nigerias annual CO2 emissions have tripled since 1990. The countrys widespread reliance on noisy, polluting diesel generators costs the economy nearly $14 billion a year, primarily in added fuel expenses. Meanwhile, Africa is tethered to an AC market dominated by high-polluting inefficient appliances.

Many air conditioners sold in Africa are low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made.

For years, many African countries have been flooded with millions of antiquated secondhand air conditioners and refrigerators imported primarily from Europe. Nigeria and other West African countries with high summer temperatures and close proximity to European shipping ports are especially popular destinations for used cooling appliances, which arrive stuffed into containers, cargo vehicles, and even used cars. The appliances are often broken and those that still work often consume two to three times more electricity than new models. They come in branded as new, but when theyre off-loaded its mostly near-end-of-life e-waste, said Leslie Adogame, executive director of SRADev, a Nigerian nonprofit environmental health research group. Theyre certainly cheaper to buy, but they use a lot more energy and dont meet environmental standards. A half-dozen African countries have joined a United Nations working group, launched in April, that is trying to stop these flows, many of which are unlawful. Shipping non-working electronic equipment is illegal under both the Basel Convention, an international treaty governing hazardous waste, and the European Unions Waste Shipment Directive. New cooling appliances being sold in Africa are not much better. Recent research by the energy efficiency nonprofit CLASP and the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development (IGSD) showed that 35 percent of new room air conditioners sold in Africas 10 largest countries in 2018 were low-efficiency units that could not be sold legally in the countries where they were made, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China. A quarter of the 650,000 low-efficiency units  none of which meet common efficiency standards used in developed countries  were imported from non-African countries, primarily China. The remaining three-quarters were largely imported and then assembled in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Egypt.

Environmentally harmful dumping is occurring in Africa, said Gabrielle Dreyfus, senior scientist at IGSD. These kinds of markets deprive consumers of a smarter choice by flooding markets with lower-price products that cost consumers more over time. The report also showed that 790,000 air conditioning units sold in Africa contained obsolete ozone-depleting, greenhouse gas refrigerants known as R-22, which are being phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol. Another 820,000 units contained R-410A refrigerants, a highly potent greenhouse gas with 2,000 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide. They are being phased out under the Montreal Protocols Kigali Amendment, beginning in 2019 in developed countries and later this decade in developing countries. Efforts to halt these damaging trade flows have been going on for years, but most have been unsuccessful, in large part simply because more and more African consumers want affordable devices to stay cool. Ghana is a noteworthy exception. Alarmed by the millions of obsolete cooling appliances that were entering the country and the widening gap between energy demand and power production, the country banned all used air conditioner and refrigerator imports in 2008. In 2013, when the government began enforcing the ban, illegal imports plummeted. Last year, new appliances, mostly from China, made up 95 percent of the market. We succeeded in reversing the market in favor of new appliances, said Kofi Agyarko, director of energy efficiency and climate change at the Ghana Energy Commission, who credits tough enforcement for catalyzing the shift. While new, more efficient appliances cost two to three times as much as used ones, they consume a third as much electricity, with Ghanaians saving on average $140 a year on energy bills, Agyarko said. But even if countries can effectively ban used imports, how can they limit the flood of inefficient new appliances into Africa? Rwanda thinks it has the answer. Last year, as part of a comprehensive national cooling strategy, Rwanda enacted Africas toughest energy standards and energy labeling for new air conditioners and other cooling appliances. The mandatory standards, which take effect next year, are modeled after guidelines developed by the UNs United for Efficiency program. Brian Holuj, who leads the programs work on cooling appliances, says Rwandas efforts are an important breakthrough. For the first time in Africa, Rwanda will demonstrate the impact of mandatory policies, coupled with strong energy efficiency requirements and limits on global warming-damaging coolants in new products, he said.

If other African countries follow Rwandas lead, AC energy demand would be cut in half from current projections.

If other African countries follow Rwandas lead, air conditioning energy demand would be cut in half from current projections, according to the UN. More than two-dozen full-sized power plants could be avoided through more efficient air conditioners and refrigerators in Africa, Holuj said. A critical step, Holuj said, is for countries to come together regionally on consistent policies, backed by enforcement, that send a strong market signal to the industry. The key is regional alignment, he said, citing the EUs success in developing common requirements and energy labeling. Dreyfus, the scientist at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, echoed this point: As long as markets for cheap products are able to flourish, high-efficiency appliances will have a hard time competing. If a manufacturer feels they have to compete for market share by selling low-efficiency obsolete equipment, we have to close the loopholes to bring the market up so that they have the right marketplace in which to sell better products, she said. Nigeria has tried some of the approaches Ghana and Rwanda are using, but they are not working, according to CREDCs Uyigue. Nigeria imposed an import ban on obsolete used cooling appliances in 2010, but it is not being enforced. It adopted voluntary energy performance standards and energy labels for air conditioners in 2017, but compliance is broadly lacking. Numerous obstacles are impeding progress. The first is price  a low-performing air conditioner costs only $100 to $200. The second is trade barriers such as a 20 percent duty on imported assembled air conditioners, an important source of government revenue. The third  perhaps the biggest  is the governments unwillingness to take the tough steps necessary to force a market shift.",2020-09-09 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'air', 'demand', 'climate', 'hampers', 'flood', 'conditioners', 'africas', 'efforts', 'cooling', 'used', 'units', 'appliances', 'countries', 'energy', 'polluting']",Nigeria,news article,English
1276,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Kenyan traders seek tougher ban on Uganda’s poultry imports - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/markets/kenyan-traders-seek-tougher-ban-on-uganda-s-poultry-imports-3371136,"By Dorothy Nakaweesi More by this Author

Kenyan traders have asked their government to tighten the ban on Uganda’s poultry imports.

The demand comes just days amid talks in which Kenyan officials were in Uganda last week to discuss trade barriers on a number of products including sugar, maize and milk.

In January, Kenya’s Directorate of Veterinary Services banned importation of poultry and beef products as it sought to protect its farmers from competition as well as support the resumption of the sector that had been dampened by Covid-19 related disruptions.

However, reports by Business Daily yesterday indicated dealers in Kenya, specifically Yo Kuku, were still trading in poultry products processed from Uganda, which has prompted traders in to petition government to tighten the January ban in order to protect dealers amid a second wave of Covid-19.

Mr Zack Munyambu, the Kiambu Poultry Farmers’ Cooperative Association director, told Business Daily that the Kenyan government needed to protect its farmers from imports amid restrictions occasioned by the second curfew.

“Our farmers have been affected heavily by this second curfew and we need to protect them at all costs,” Mr Munyambu said, noting there was need to tighten the ban to ensure that farmers are not exposed by imports that are smuggled into the country.

In the same measure, Business Daily reported the Federation of Poultry Farmers, had demanded that: “… the importation of poultry meat and poultry products ceases as soon as possible so that the industry ... can hold on until times are less volatile.”

This is the second time Kenya farmers have sought for protection with the first plea in December resulting into a ban on poultry exports from Uganda that had been recovering from a 2018 ban occasioned by suspected bird flu.

Business Daily yesterday reported that Ugandan poultry products, despite an ongoing ban, had been located in Yo Kuku outlets in the Nairobi suburbs of Roysambu, Kawangware, Umoja and Kitengela.

However, Mr Rahim Manji, the Yo Kuku executive director, yesterday told Daily Monitor, the company had ceased exporting its products to Kenya months ago, noting there was a possibility that what is being sold now is stock before the ban was instituted.

“That is not true. We are not exporting our products to Kenya. The borders were closed. What is on shelves is stock before the ban,” he said.

Mr Aga Ssekalala Jr, the Poultry Association of Uganda chairman, said the ban has impacted business in Uganda, forcing some companies to heavily downsize operations while others have temporally closed.

Mr Ssekalala also noted that it was disappointing that a delegation from Kenya, which was in the country last week, had only dealt with sugar and maize with poultry issues referred to a later date.

Production capacity

Data from Uganda Bureau of Statistics indicate that between 2014 and 2018, Uganda’s poultry production capacity increased to 42.9 million birds with 87.7 per cent of these being indigenous.

A total of 930 million eggs were produced in the period up from 856 million eggs in 2014. The increase indicates a 2.6 per cent rise in eggs in 2018 from 907.1 million in 2017.",2021-04-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['kenyan', 'seek', 'uganda', 'ban', 'farmers', 'kenya', 'million', 'traders', 'poultry', 'daily', 'tougher', 'ugandas', 'protect', 'products', 'imports', 'second']",Kenya,news article,English

2.5 million people have been affected by floods which devasted Sindh Province in late August.

71,500 people received in-kind food assistance during WFPs first phase of the response between September and early October.

117,000 people will receive cash assistance under WFPs second phase of the response. Among them, 26,658 people have already been reached.

Highlights

 WFP initiated a second phase of relief assistance in November 2020 to meet persistent humanitarian needs in Sindhs flood affected districts. Cash transfers under this second phase are expected to be completed by early January.

 Following the relief phase, WFP plans to focus on recovery efforts in 2021 together with its government and development partners, to rebuild livelihoods and rehabilitate assets that can support sustainable food security.

WFP Funding Requirements

 WFPs ongoing relief assistance is fully funded.

 WFP is currently seeking contributions to support recovery activities planned in 2021.

Situation Update

 The floods have destroyed this years main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton.

 Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season.

 The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the provinces already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

WFP Response

 On 10 November, WFP started distributing unconditional cash assistance to vulnerable floodaffected households who had not yet received in-kind food assistance from WFP in September. Distributions are being carried out in the three most affected districts: Umerkot, Sanghar and Mirpurkhas.

 Each targeted household is receiving a multipurpose cash transfer of PKR 15,000 (approximately USD 90), distributed in two tranches.

 Sensitization sessions on nutrition and hygiene practices are also being carried out at distribution points and through village development committees, with a focus on pregnant and lactating women, infants and young children. Sensitization sessions also cover precautionary measures against the spread of COVID19 and dengue virus.

 As of 15 December, WFP and its partners, Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) and Secours Islamique France (SIF) have distributed cash assistance to 26,658 people.

1083,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Suez Canal unblocked: Hilarious memes flood social media as Ever Given floats again - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/suez-canal-unblocked-social-media-flooded-with-memes-as-ever-given-is-freed-7251131/,"Even though the crisis at a key maritime route came to an end, memes and jokes continues on social media.

Almost after a week after the Ever Given container ship blocked the essential Suez Canal, it was dislodged and floating again on Monday. Thanks to the congregation of tugboats and dredgers that freed the cargo ship from Egypt’s coast, traffic resumed in crucial shipping route that had severely affected global supply chains and economy. As videos of the ship moving went viral, so did memes and jokes, and strangely many people on the internet revolted saying: “put it back”.

At dawn on Monday, rescue workers from the SCA working with a team from Dutch firm Smit Salvage partially refloated the ship and straightened it in the canal. After several hours, it shifted briefly back across the canal before being manoeuvred free by tugs as the tide changed, Reuters reported.

Video of the cargo ship leaving canal, with all the crew involved in the operation blowing horns after the route was unblocked, flooded social media. The Ever Given sailed to the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal, for inspection, said Evergreen Marine Corp., a Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship.

The canal is a source of national pride and crucial revenue for Egypt, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Monday’s events after days of silence about the blockage. “Egyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis,” he wrote on Facebook, “despite the massive technical complexity.”

However, as most celebrated the occasion, mostly trade and maritime officials, rescue crews, and politicians, netizens were upset that the entertaining subject which spewed torrents of memes and jokes, came to an end, urging salvage teams to “put it back”. Twitter was flooded with memes and GIFs and ‘Put it back’ dominated social media trends.

Meeting in Paris, they signed a



The U7+ summit on 9 and 10 July was attended by university presidents from the G7 advanced economy countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. They were joined by leaders from higher education institutions in Argentina, Australia, Ghana, India, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea.*



They adopted

University World News is solely responsible for the editorial content. This article is part of a series onpublished byin partnership withis solely responsible for the editorial content.

The six principles, which have actions embedded, include:

• Pursue joint action through the U7+, including meeting each year in the context of the G7 process, “so that our actions can weigh in the discussions and contribute to making positive change a reality”.





• Recognise universities’ distinctive responsibility to train and nurture responsible and active citizens who will contribute to society, from the local to the global level.





• Recognise that “our universities have a major role to play in addressing the environmental issues and challenges to sustainability such as climate change, biodiversity and energy transition. This should include leading by example on our own campuses.”





• Recognise that universities have a distinctive and leading role to play regarding equality and inclusiveness in the world, and in combating polarisation in society.





• To engage with stakeholders and solve complex issues of global relevance universities must promote interdisciplinary research and learning, in particular bridging in research and teaching between social sciences, humanities, the life sciences and STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).





• Recognise that the U7+ “has the power to serve as a lab to consolidate best practices that can be shared both within our network and more broadly with universities and similar institutions worldwide for inspiration”.

The five global challenges the U7+ will focus on are: universities’ key role in a global world; climate change and cleaner energy; inequality and polarised societies; technological transformations; and community engagement and impact.



Patronage of President Macron



Under the patronage of French President Emmanuel Macron, the newly formed U7+ is an initiative of



They recognised that the themes of the forthcoming G7 summit were relevant to their university role and raison d’être.



“Universities have always been and remain global actors, and we act upon issues that relate to the G7 agenda,” said Vanessa Scherrer, vice-president for international affairs at Sciences Po, one of the founding institutions and current chair of U7+.



“G7 started opening to civil society a few years ago – there are now engagement groups for women, for youth, academies of science, business, work and so on.



“In that context, the U7+ is an alliance of world universities taking action in the area of the G7, and in a special way: rather than making recommendations to the heads of state of the G7, we will present our commitments to action, as a way of trying to make a change and lead by example. This is the DNA of U7+.”



With the G7 opening to civil society, new ideas and countries beyond the G7, and the fact that there were no engagement groups or ministerial meetings related to higher education and research, “the idea [for an alliance of universities] was discussed between the French founding universities and we realised it would be important for the world,” said Scherrer.



Rapid formation



The university alliance was created “in a very short time”, she said. “The first meeting of the French steering committee was in April, and we decided collectively on which international colleagues to invite – five universities from each of the G7 countries.”



The G7 universities then proposed institutions in other countries* to join their alliance. “The response was high from the outset, so we quickly realised our intuition was right,” said Scherrer.



The organisers had only a few weeks to negotiate and set up the complex international arrangements to establish the alliance in time for G7 preparatory meetings in June, before the first U7+ summit in July.



With the G7’s open approach to other countries under the French presidency, what was originally simply the ‘U7’ Alliance of world universities added ‘Plus’ to its title to become U7+, in recognition that universities from outside the group have joined.



U7+ leaders must now present their commitments to their faculty, students and staff, who have “a decisive role to play in these actions”, said Scherrer.



Interdisciplinarity stressed



She stressed the importance of interdisciplinarity in U7+ institutions, “especially topics related to new technology and its impact. It is important that STEM students are trained in the social sciences.”



For the future, after France hands on the G7 presidency to the United States at the end of 2019, Scherrer says: “At that point, we can say that the 47 presidents have committed U7+ to meet next year in the context of the G7 summit, whatever happens. We will remain a very flexible organisation, but universities from France, the US and UK, successive chairs of the G7, will work together.



“We are committed to meeting once a year, probably in a G7 country. We shall hold a mid-term meeting, and keep contact among us to monitor actions, and stay in touch with sherpas [the representatives of heads of state or government who prepare for the summits] to prepare for the next G7 summit.”



Monitoring is a high priority, and the ‘champion’ institutions will work together to harmonise the action.



“For example, on climate change,” said Scherrer, “all the champions have agreed to make systems comparable, with harmonised indicators, measurements, deadlines, deals and platforms.”



U7+ could take on different commitments in future, she said. The present ones “arose as key fields in which we are already global actors, and connected to the agenda of the G7 in France this year, but we agreed it could change next year, like the G7 which has a new focus each year”.



* Institutions that attended the U7+ summit are listed at the end of the Declaration.



At the first summit of the U7+ Alliance, an international alliance of leading universities from the Group of Seven (G7) countries and beyond, presidents of 47 institutions from 18 countries, representing more than two million students worldwide, adopted six principles to tackle five major global challenges.Meeting in Paris, they signed a Declaration committing to take concrete action related to themes of the G7 summit that will take place in Biarritz at the end of August under the 2019 French presidency.The U7+ summit on 9 and 10 July was attended by university presidents from the G7 advanced economy countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Engineers are harnessing the Japanese art of paper-folding to build in smarter, more efficient ways.

A team of researchers designed a self-folding robot that can assemble itself and crawl away in four minutes, described in the journal Science. But in the same issue, a second team shows how origami can be used to actually create materials with novel properties – and they show how you can create a ‘metamaterial’ of your own, right at home.

The study led by Jesse Silverberg of Cornell University applied origami-like principles of folding not to machines, but to the very materials they’re built from. After all, once you’ve produced a material – a rod of iron, a sheet of paper – it’s typically difficult to adjust its mechanical properties. But if your material is organized in a particular folding pattern, it could potentially be reconfigured at a moment’s notice.

So the scientists studied the Miura-ori – a pattern that basically looks like a 3D tessellation of parallelograms and is used to efficiently stack solar panels for space – to see how it responded to changes.

When the researchers folded paper into a Miura-ori pattern, it gave the paper an unusual springiness: When squeezed in the middle, it contracts evenly, instead of bulging out of the sides the way a sponge would. That’s a very useful property in a building material, from an engineering perspective.

They also found that they could adjust the stiffness – how much it resisted being squeezed – by introducing a defect in the pattern. All they had to do was take a finger and push out certain folds, creating what they called “pop-through defects,” and it would make the sheet stiffer. If they introduced more than one defect, they interacted in interesting ways, even canceling each other out.

On top of that, the defects were reversible – the folds could be popped back into place.

The scientists think this means that just about any thin sheet – whether paper, or different types of metal – can be converted into a metamaterial. And these kinds of origami-inspired materials, featuring ‘tunable’ properties, could be very useful for future soft robotics and other devices.

“Such structures would be self-folding and single or multifunctional, with applications for such capabilities as yet scarcely imagined,” Zhong You of Oxford University, who was not involved in the research, wrote in a commentary.

Gatkuoth also thanked Egypt for launching an air bridge during the crisis to transport to South Sudan important humanitarian aid, the Egyptian cabinet’s spokesman said in a statement on Monday.

He affirmed Egypt's efforts to support South Sudan came in light of the brotherly relations between the two peoples.

The meeting was attended by Egypt's Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdel-Aty.

Torrential rain and floods earlier this year hit South Sudan and submerged many villages and livestock and displaced over 600,000 people since July. The floods were described by the UN as the worst in 60 years.

The South Sudanese minister also praised Egypt’s establishment of technical schools in South Sudan that have qualified students for the job market, as well as the decision to increase the number of scholarships for students of ٍSouth Sudan to study in Egypt.

He expressed his aspiration for further Egyptian support of other South Sudanese students in the country and in Egypt, who receive education at their own expense, especially as the coronavirus implications have affected their income.

Gatkuoth said he wants to enhance cooperation with Egypt and to benefit from the Egyptian experience and distinguished cadres in capacity-building and the establishment of Egyptian investment projects in agriculture, irrigation, electricity and other infrastructure fields.

The minister also requested that Egypt opens a branch of one of its banks in South Sudan, particularly the National Bank of Egypt (NBE).

Gatkuoth called for forming a joint high committee with Egypt.

Prime Minister Madbouly affirmed during the meeting that Egypt will spare no effort to support South Sudanese people in the fields mentioned by the minister, mainly supporting South Sudanese students in Egypt, based on President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi’s directives to support foreign students residing in the country.

Madbouly also expressed Egypt’s willingness to establish investment projects needed in South Sudan.

The prime minister urged coordination with the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to accelerate efforts to form the joint high committee and to hold its first meeting in Cairo before the end of this year.

Concerning the request to open a bank branch in South Sudan, Madbouly said the Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt would be contacted to submit the request to open a branch of the NBE there.

536,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"TRAINSPOTTER: Abuse, Inc – Zuma uses Hani memorial to stage counterattack - Daily Maverick",https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-04-10-trainspotter-abuse-inc-zuma-uses-hani-memorial-to-stage-counterattack/,"There have been some déclassé moments in Zuma’s biography. The 24th anniversary of Thembisile Chris Hani’s murder was definitely among them. By RICHARD POPLAK.

In the East Rand’s industrial ass-end, where decades from now robots will wander through the remnants of South Africa’s degraded industrial economy, and where energy from Russian nuclear reactors will fizzle uselessly in the drought-swirled dust—a memorial service for a fallen comrade.

Twenty-four years ago, Chris Hani was murdered by Janusz Walu? and Clive Derby-Lewis, during another of those terminal events that was intended to push SA over the brink, but instead left us staring into an abyss that appears bottomless. Hani, the quintessential victim of swart gevaar/communist/racist paranoia, was an actual communist and an actual armed-resistance veteran, and if his speeches and writings are anything to go by, it’s unlikely that he’d have much good to say about the chaos capitalism that has arisen since he was assassinated.

Indeed, relations have become grim between the South African Communist Party and the industrial grade looting machine to which it has been allied for so many years. During the recent cabinet “reshuffle”, although members of the SACP for the most part emerged with their portfolios and salaries intact, they were unimpressed by how it all unfolded. Their deputy general secretary, the excessively genial Solly Mapaila, has been rather vocal in his demands for the president to step down. Meanwhile, the ANC has sort of rallied around Zuma, because what else are they going to do? Stand on principle? When you’re living inside the beast’s intestinal tract, it’s impossible to know whether the host you’re leaching from is dead or alive—until, of course, it’s too late.

Well, it is too late.

And so here we were, in another of the ANC’s nostalgia loops, another one of its reactionary celebrations of a stalwart who would likely find no place in, and indeed would not recognize, the organization celebrating his memory. To cover the ANC in 2017 is to become complicit in drafting their Trümmerliteratur—the genre of historical revisionism that scrutinizes the rubble of a movement or civilization that has caved in on itself. In this particular case, the ANC laments the purity of a liberation movement that has been destroyed by the politics of the belly—whose belly happens to depend on the faction one belongs to. “The once proud ANC,” and all that crap. Just a couple of tweaks, just get rid of the right/wrong people, and the khongolose is back in the game.

Well, no. “Every major social transformation leaves behind a fresh Eden that can serve as the object of somebody’s nostalgia,” writes the American political scientist Mark Lilla. “And the reactionaries of our time have discovered that nostalgia can be a powerful political motivator, perhaps even more powerful than hope. Hopes can be disappointed. Nostalgia is irrefutable.”

Which is exactly what has made the recent memorial orgy, despite the undeniable goodness of the men being memorialized, so utterly reprehensible. The Hani tent was full of fake communists, fake women’s leaders, fake religious types, along with the occasional real struggle vet—none of whom participate in the same narrative any longer. We’ve become so inured to this idiotic incoherence that it no longer registers as parody. But imagine you’d been dead for 24 years, and you lurched up from the Highveld loam into this madness, with Jacob Zuma—of all people—standing on the presidential podium, addressing a country in which the pittance earned from being bussed into political events likely registers as a decent portion of the GDP, and where the crowds sing “My president! My president!” in the praise of man unpicking the country from the inside out.

Anyway.

According to the presiding Reverend Maphatsoe, Zuma had asked that no one—no one, hear!—was to use this platform to extend the factional fighting. “Who are we to judge,” asked the pastor. “Because God judges.” Then, Zuma laid wreath. (He is still astonishingly spry when he bends down to attend to such matters.) Fikile “Razzmatazz” Mbalula laid a wreath. Solly Mapaila laid a wreath. Limpho Hani laid a wreath. Whether or not they felt awkward, I cannot say. But I certainly did. It felt like a shabbas dinner following a catastrophic and bitter divorce, during which the cook burns the tsimis. Zuma stared into the middle distance, at—what? What does a budding dictator in the middle of a coup think about during photo-ops, other than the fact that photo-ops will soon be a thing of the past?

He then took his seat, and listened to the early going, which was devoted to Ekurhuleni pimping itself as a “smart, connected, development city—the aerotropolis”, which is the sort of technocratic gobbledygook the ANC has always intoxicated itself with.

Limpho Hani then stood at the podium:

“At the moment we are loving at a time of extreme paranoia and factionalism,” she said. She told of going to a church service following the cabinet reshuffle, prayed for the country, and was promptly accused of being against Zuma. “I come from a church family, and God has never failed me,” she said. “Comrades, I do not belong to a faction. I belong to the ANC, and there is only one ANC. I will not respond to those who ask, What would Chris do? I do not know.”

Why did no one march after over a hundred poor black people were left to die during the Life Esidimeni tragedy, she wanted to know? What about the taxi gang rapes recently reported in Soweto? The answer, of course, is that almost no one cares about poor people or the victims of sexual violence—the latter having been normalized, I might add, by the man preparing to address the crowd. Such is the way of things in vicious, zero-sum societies. Then Hani thanked Zuma for helping her through troubled times with her daughter’s “cocaine addiction”.

“President, I have no words.”

Oh, and I think I failed to mention her big reveal: Zuma was the last ANC leader to see Hani alive, said his widow. Surprise, surprise, history books!

Do you see how pliantly the past crawls toward the powerful?

Then the King strode to the stage. His body language gave no indication that this was to be one of the signature speeches of his long political career. The rent-a-crowd sang. “Amandla,” he roared. And he began to tell a story that became a parable.

[Comrade Hani’s] killers wanted to plunge the country into civil war so as to prevent us from achieving a democracy in which government would be built by the majority will of the people. [He] demonstrated throughout his life and at the hour of his death that he lived for his people. He taught many young men and women within the ANC and the Alliance that personal suffering was the price to be paid in defence of the interests of the oppressed black people. In their actions, the killers of Chris Hani, sought to sow division amongst the people of South Africa so that they could protect minority interests. However, the leadership of President Nelson Mandela rose to the occasion and called on all of us not to allow minority interests and the actions of disruptors to shift our focus. President Mandela called on all of us to honour the sacrifice of Comrade Chris Hani by uniting and accelerating our advance towards democratic elections. Indeed, we used that sombre occasion as a platform to push harder for freedom and democracy and eventually held our first democratic election on 27 April 1994; on the principle of one person, one vote.

This—or a version of it—was now happening again. And why? Because, as Zuma noted earlier this year to his State of the Nation Address, the long arc of South African was bending toward radical socio-economic transformation, and “minority interests” were trying to halt its progress.

Zuma referred to the sanctity of the Constitution. (And it was only Monday). He quoted OR Tambo. He spoke about the black middle class he’d just screwed with a downgrade entirely engineered by him. He spoke about the black business his recently evacuated Treasury DG admitted the government used as “cashflow management”, another way of saying they don’t get paid. He spoke of the poor, “the majority of whom are black and female”—traditionally a huge concern of Zuma’s. He spoke about structural racism in the private sector, and other serious transformation issues that could not be ignored.

He’s right, of course. South Africa needs to change now, and not in some halcyon future. And he is the one that will change it. But, versions of Hani’s killers are once again on the loose, looking to derail the national democratic project. And it was in the final movements of the speech where the parable found its meaning:

We have sadly not yet succeeded in building the non-racial society that we envisaged. There is a resurgence of racism in our country. It is also clear that racists have become more emboldened. The marches that took place last week demonstrated that racism is real and exists in our country. Many placards and posters displayed beliefs that we thought had been buried in 1994, with some posters depicting black people as baboons. It is clear that some of our white compatriots regard black people as being lesser human beings or sub-human. The racist onslaught has become more direct and is no longer hidden as was the case in the early years of our constitutional democratic order. Racists no longer fear being caught or exposed. In the fight to combat racism, we should look beyond only overt racist utterances and public displays that we saw during the marches last week. We should also look at the ideological and institutional machinations that continue to give racism more traction. Racism is a gross violation of human rights and plunged this country into decades of conflict in the past. We cannot allow and assist racists to take our country backwards.

It was a beautiful, elegant, and supremely dangerous counter-attack, delivered with zero passion, as if he was reading the instructions to a Furby. Yes, racists marched. As did Sufis, Baha’i, ghosts, insufferable white liberals, insufferable black liberals, insufferable coloured liberals, and bespoke puppies. Freedumb of expression was on proud display. But baboon placards?

Come. On.

Solly Mapaila—no one’s idea of a upper-class Camp’s Bay anti-poor mass murderer, and who spoke with such fire at the Pretoria event—sat stone-faced, looking out at the crowd that would later boo him as he attempted to speak. Zuma was then whisked off into power’s bosom. Immediately thereafter, the heavens burped, and then emptied with deluge that can only be described as Biblical. This country is clearly some celestial screenwriter’s idea of a good time.

Is this what constitutes an honour in South Africa? To have your final resting place used as the opening salvo in a race war that will function as cover for robbing the country into eternal penury? As a means of answering that question, perhaps we should take a moment to bring up a little historical moment that both Zuma and his latest hagiographer, Limpho Hani, neglected to mention. In 2004 and 2005, Zuma took time out of his busy schedule to meet the architect of Hani’s assassination, Clive Derby-Lewis. No one is precisely sure as to why they engaged in some friendly facetime. Was Zuma going to collect smallanyana skeletons on his many enemies? Was Derby-Lewis trying to influence a spoiler in order to rustle up a presidential pardon? Was the future president trying to solicit a killer’s (very good) lawyers to represent him in his innumerable legal battles?

All good theories—but in final reckoning, it really doesn’t matter. What does matter is that the two men met, and that according to the extant pictures, their encounters were pleasant and recrimination-free. We mustn’t get too sentimental about politics. But we also can’t pretend away the past. In other words, the memorial was not the first time Zuma had used Hani’s assassination to further his own purpose.

So: this is the ANC, and this is the man who has captured it wholesale.

In the past 48 hours, Zuma and his minion henchmen have used the memorials of two legendary ANC stalwarts in order to further an agenda that neither man – that no one sane, really – would support. It doesn’t matter how many widows, comrades, friends or followers get churned up in the process – onward into the past!

South Africa’s past is monstrous; there is no fresh Eden to return to. If there is to be any hope, the country has to begin making the future instead of submitting to Zuma’s increasingly aggressive revisionism. “Nostalgia is irrefutable”, said the professor. And yet refute it we must, and loudly. DM

The worst floods in a generation have left 25 dead and many more missing in the east and southwest of Uganda.

Seventeen people are confirmed dead in the south western region of the country, and a child is still missing.

Speaking to RFI Emmanuel Okecho, a Disaster Protect Officer with Uganda's Office of the Prime Minister explained “the south-west in flood prone because of naturally low-lying areas and marshes.”

Bridges and roads have been submerged by the heaviest rainfall to hit Uganda in over 25 years, complicating relief and rescue efforts.

“The floods have caused millions of shillings worth of damage,” Monica Azuba, Uganda’s Transport Minister, told RFI by telephone from Kampala adding, “the government is prioritising the humanitarian situation before assessing the full extent of infrastructural damage.”

The government dispatched an assessment team on Monday, and the Red Cross are leading search and rescue efforts in the east and south west of the country.

Scores of people are unaccounted for after mudslides engulfed homes killing at least eight people in the foothills of Mount Elgon over the weekend. This, despite concerted efforts by the government and environmental organisations to combat deforestation.

East Africa has been hit by torrential rains in recent weeks unleashing deadly flooding in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and now Uganda. Two million people have been affected.

“These floods are worse than in 2010 because it has been raining almost constantly for two months,” says Okecho.

The rains are expected to continue at least until the end of December.

1168,FL-2021-000021-IND,Uttarakhand glacier burst: Heavy damage to two hydel projects at the epicentre - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-damage-to-two-hydel-projects-at-the-epicentre-101612727025442.html,"Massive floods caused by a glacier breach in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli on Sunday washed away the under-construction Rishiganga hydro project and caused heavy damage to the 530MW Dhauliganga hydel project, officials aware of the developments said.

The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), under the chairmanship of cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, met on Sunday to review the Chamoli flooding disaster likely caused by a glacial lake outburst. The incident led to the rising of water levels in river Rishiganga, washing away the Rishiganga small hydro project of 13.2MW, according to a note shared by NCMC.

The floods also affected the downstream hydro project of NTPC at Tapovan on the river Dhauliganga, which is a tributary of River Alaknanda, according to people aware of the developments. The force of the water and boulders rolling down from the upper reaches near Raini village completely washed away the under-construction Rishiganga and the debris from there gushed into the Dhauli Ganga river, causing heavy damage to the 530 MW Dhauliganga hydel project, just 10km away.

“The river was flowing 10-15 metres above its normal level and took everything along. Only a few concrete structures on the banks remain of the Rishi Ganga hydel project,” said Dhan Singh Rawat, who rushed out of his house in Raini village after hearing a huge explosion.

Uttarkhand disaster relief force spokesperson Alok Raven said that the rescue teams initially recovered two bodies from the Dhauliganga hydel power project.

Vivek Pandey, a spokesperson for the paramilitary Indo Tibetan Border Police, confirmed that while the Rishiganga hydropower plant was destroyed, the Dhauliganga hydropower plant was damaged.

He said at least 42 workers got trapped inside two tunnels at the Dhauliganga plant. While 12 workers trapped inside one tunnel were rescued, at least 30 others were still stuck inside the other tunnel, he added. Another 170 workers at the two plants were missing, Pandey said.

About two years ago, residents of Raini village told the Uttarakhand high court that the construction of Rishiganga hydel project could cause damage to those living in the area. In the summer of 2019, villagers filed a public interest litigation in the court, which directed the district magistrate Chamoli and member secretary state pollution control board to constitute a joint team to inspect the Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project site with regard to allegations about the impact on the environment and local people.",2021-02-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['glacier', 'workers', 'river', 'village', 'dhauliganga', 'rishiganga', 'heavy', 'hydel', 'projects', 'project', 'burst', 'plant', 'raini', 'uttarakhand', 'damage', 'epicentre', 'inside']",India,news article,English
219,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Germany's first female Euro commentator faces sexist outrage online - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-first-female-euro-commentator-faces-sexist-outrage-online/a-19340658,"Social media users flooded German public broadcaster ZDF's sites after Friday's Italy-Sweden match, not to voice complaints about the game, but to bemoan the broadcaster's female commentator.

Claudia Neumann, a reporter for German public broadcaster ZDF, became the first female play-by-play announcer for this year's men's European Championships in France.

But her role as the match's main commentator enraged numerous soccer fans. Many of whom posted complaints about her ""annoying voice"" while others said women have no place doing sports commentary for men's soccer. One Twitter user wrote: ""Women shouldn't commentate men's soccer. It doesn't fit. Annoying. Period.""

Her Euro 2016 debut was the June 11 match between Wales and Slovakia. Following that first game, users insulted and attacked her with misogynistic slogans about ""the place of women"" and even rape threats.

ZDF 'shocked' by sexist comments

Despite expecting some criticism following the games, the head of ZDF's sports department said he couldn't believe the ""harsh formulation"" of comments that appeared on ZDF social media sites.

""I'm shocked,"" said Dieter Gruschwitz on Saturday to sports news agency SID, calling some of the social media comments ""asocial critique.""

In a post on the broadcaster's Facebook site, ZDF editors said numerous ""offensive"" comments had been deleted.

""If you cannot objectively take part in the discussion, we will block you,"" warned ZDF on Facebook, adding that ""insults are not opinions and will not be tolerated according to our netiquette.""

Stefan Leifert, a ZDF correspondent in Brussels tweeted a screenshot of some of the Facebook comments which included homophobic and sexually explicit remarks.

Neumann: 'I've got thick skin'

The strength of some of the comments prompted an angry reaction from ZDF on Saturday, but a cool reaction from Neumann, herself.

""Hey, people, it's only about football!"" Neumann told SID in an interview, adding that the social media backlash against her ""is all absolutely ridiculous.""

""Most of those people weren't even born when I was already sinking bicycle kicks.""

In 2011, she became the first female sports announcer on German TV for the women's World Cup - women's soccer, as well as men's, had until that point been dominated by male commentators.

When asked how she is coping with the deluge of online criticism following her first two Euro 2016 games, she said she hopes her work will make it easier for more women to break into the ranks of sports commentary.

""If it helps to eventually make it easier for a few younger female colleagues - okay. I can take it,"" Neumann said. ""I've got thick skin.

""I won't let them break my passion and my profession,"" she added.

Fans stand up for Neumann

Many on Twitter and Facebook also praised Neumann's performance during the two Euro matches, including several members of the German media.

One user tweeted that the Italy-Sweden game had ""two good things. 1. The refreshing commentary from Claudia Neumann. 2. The goal from Italy's team.""

Kathrin Steinbichler, an editor for the German newspaper ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"" tweeted: ""By the way, Claudia Neumann is one of the best and most knowledgeable colleagues. (She's) doing a super job at the Euro 2016.""

Another twitter user praised Neumann's voice and called her a ""hero.""

Although Neumann was only slated to make the commentary for the tournament's group rounds, some on social media are campaigning for her to take over the Euro 2016 match final.

The ability to provide commentary during an important soccer game ""is not a question of sex, but a question of competence,"" read an online petition calling for her to commentate on more matches.",2016-06-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['faces', 'neumann', 'comments', 'social', 'online', 'female', 'german', 'commentator', 'mens', 'germanys', 'outrage', 'sexist', 'zdf', 'women', 'soccer', 'euro', 'media']",India,news article,English
553,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Abdul Safiu Fatawu: Trelleborg sign Asante Kotoko and Ghana Special Competition top scorer - Goal.com,https://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/safiu-fatawu-trelleborg-sign-kotoko-and-ghana-special/in5eqmdy108718g69h4kq9kf0,"Safiu Fatawu: Trelleborg sign Kotoko and Ghana Special Competition top scorer

The 25-year-old has sealed a transfer to the Swedish club after fine performances last season

Swedish club Trelleborgs have announced the acquisition of Asante Kotoko attacker Abdul Safiu Fatawu.

The 25-year-old Ghanaian joins the second-tier side for the remainder of the 2019 season with an option to extend the deal for a further two years.

The switch comes after a move to Swedish elite division fold Helsingborgs fell through due to the inability of the Porcupines and the Reds to reach an agreement over his transfer fee following a training stint with the club.

""We continue to strengthen on the attack side, now by the addition of 25-year-old forward Fatawu Safiu from Ghana,"" Trelleborg announced on their official website on Tuesday.

""The contract is valid for the 2019 season with an option for an additional two years.""

""Fatawu Safiu comes from the club Asante Kotoko in Ghana where he played the 2018-19 season.

""He has also previously represented Ghana's U20 national team.

""We warmly welcome Fatawu to Trelleborgs FF!""

Last season, Fatawu netted 10 times to help Kotoko win the Ghana Special Competition, finishing joint-top scorer in the championship.

The attacker also played an instrumental role as the Porcupines reached the group stage of the Caf Confederation Cup.

His good showing earned him a spot in Ghana's provisional squad for the recent Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt but he fell short of making the final 23-man roster.

""With Fatawu Safiu, we get an experienced and strong striker who can also play in all attack positions,"" Trelleborg boss Peter Swardh said.

""He is creative and should strengthen our offensive qualities.""

Fatawu's transfer situation saw him miss Kotoko's Caf Champions League opener against Nigeria's Kano Pillars on Saturday.
