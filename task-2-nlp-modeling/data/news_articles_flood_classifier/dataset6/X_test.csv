Kenya is mostly affected by mudslides and floods during two rainfall seasons, namely March-April-May (MAM) and October-November-December (OND).

These landslides, floods and mudslides more often than not lead to loss of human lives, destruction of houses, displacement of people, livestock deaths, loss of livelihoods among other impacts.

This paper highlights the use of earth observation satellite imageries from the Airbus foundation for post-disaster impact assessment during the 2019 OND rainfall season to support effective response.

On the 23rd of November 2019 during the OND rainfall season, mudslides and floods occurred in West Pokot resulting in disruption of road accessibility, loss of human lives, loss of livelihoods, houses destruction and displacement of people.

Due to continuation of rainfall, roads were cut-off and hence it was difficult to access the area to determine the damage and the number of households affected. Through the partnership with Airbus foundation, International Center for Humanitarian Affairs (ICHA) at Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) tasked the Pleiades satellite to acquire imageries of the affected areas five days after the mudslide event.

A spot 6 imagery archive captured on the 15th of May 2019 (months before the mudslide event) was downloaded from the Airbus foundation archives. A comparison of these two imageries through change detection was done in order to extract mudslide and flooding hazard extents. A hazard exposure analysis was done in order to determine houses and roads affected by the mudslide and flood hazard. Results from exposure analysis revealed over 145 houses as being destroyed and over 2.1 kilometers of roads being cut-off. Further analysis was done to determine partially and completely destroyed houses. KRCS was able to use this information for post-disaster recovery interventions such as search and rescue as well as shelter initiation of re-construction houses that were completely damaged by floods and mudslides.

This study has demonstrated the valuable use of satellite imageries from the Airbus Foundation to KRCS through provision of timely and accurate information on impacts of mudslides and floods in remote and inaccessible areas in a cost-effective manner and further support effective and efficient response and recovery. It is highly recommended for KRCS and other Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies to use earth observation satellites for post-disaster assessment especially in remote areas that are inaccessible. This by far would improve their humanitarian capacity in conducting post-disaster assessments in a cost-effective and timely manner.",2020-12-15 08:00:00+00:00,"['west', 'postdisaster', 'rainfall', 'observation', 'loss', 'houses', 'humanitarian', 'floods', 'foundation', 'pokot', 'krcs', 'study', 'mudslide', 'products', 'kenya', 'imageries', 'mudslides', 'response']",Kenya,news article,English

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) in Vietnam and local peoples generosity.Luu Thi Phuong, 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children, she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDPs 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam, she said.However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last years floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life, he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households, said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing. At least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or collapsed./.",2021-05-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'receive', 'storms', 'nam', 'quang', 'residents', 'undp', 'nams', 'central', 'support', 'house', 'houses', 'safe']",Vietnam,news article,English
1547,FL-2017-000120-VNM,Megaprojects threaten water justice for local communities - EurekAlert,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uoa-mtw051821.php,"Urban megaprojects tend to be the antithesis of good urban planning. They have a negative impact on local water systems, deprive local communities of water-related human rights, and their funders and sponsors have little accountability for their impact.

These are the findings of the University of Adelaide's Dr Scott Hawken from the School of Architecture and Built Environment who led a review of the impact of urban megaprojects on water justice in South East Asia.

""Urban megaprojects have severe implications for environmental processes,"" said Dr Hawken.

""They have a major impact on hydrological systems and during all phases of development affect water security and human rights.

""As well as interrupting urban water flows and waste removal, they cause biodiversity degradation and loss of arable landscapes, and increase pollution and change the flood regimes of rivers.""

The study, published in the journal Cities, focussed on the Phu My Hung project in Vietnam, the Amarapura project in Myanmar and Boeung Kak Lake in Cambodia, and is the result of Dr Hawken's engagement with recent calls from the United Nations for greater accountability in megaprojects globally.

Urban megaprojects have been a key mode of development in Southeast Asia since the 1980s. Between three and 14 per cent of GDP is invested in these kind of developments in SE Asia and eight per cent globally. They can include urban regeneration schemes, transport and energy infrastructure, industrial corridors, city clusters, new towns, innovation districts, science and technology parks and sports infrastructure.

""The projects we looked at are typical of most major cities in Southeast Asia in that they are located near coasts or major rivers which exposes people who live there to extreme weather events such as floods and erosion,"" said Dr Hawken.

""At every stage of these projects there needs to be a more systematic approach to sustainability especially when assessing their impact on water security. The community needs to be more involved and funders and sponsors need to be more accountable for the impact.

""Wealthier residents tend to benefit from these urban enclaves while they dramatically displace and disrupt existing economics and social relations. Poor socio-economic urban residents are disproportionately adversely affected.""

Megaprojects are often publicly positioned as economic benefactors for cities with governments and developers framing them as delivering wealth and new technologies to urban regions.

""Considering the prominence of this development model, it is unacceptable that there is so little information or recourse when these projects do not deliver on their promises,"" said Dr Hawken.

""Existing urban issues are rarely solved by these projects so a new approach is needed to better engage with communities and their socio-ecological relationships with natural water systems. Considering where they are built such projects also expose cities to future climate related disasters such as sea-level rise and flooding.

""Our findings and recommendations are relevant to cities around the world which are in semi-aquatic, delta environments and sensitive water catchment areas.

""Developers need to be accountable for such projects now and into the future.""

204,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Commercial Diver Lives to Tell the Tale - The Maritime Executive,https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/commercial-diver-lives-to-tell-the-tale,"Commercial Diver Lives to Tell the Tale

A commercial diver living in Australia has revealed the horrific crushing accident he suffered 330 feet (100 meters) below the surface whilst working in the Gulf of Thailand.



The diver, who wishes to remain anonymous, has recounted events to MarEx:

He was relocating buoyancy tanks on a pipeline when an error in communication resulted in a 7.5 ton metal depressor frame being lowered on to him.

The diver was on his knees facing the seabed when the load was lowered by crane, and it made contact across his back where his emergency air supply was located.

He was forced down into the mud of the seafloor. His head was forced back, and his helmet was danger of being pulled off his head. He tried to “headbutt” the helmet on while constantly being forced deeper in the mud.

The action caused trauma to the muscles and discs in his spine. His right leg was forced sideways, causing a torn knee ligament, and his arms were forced apart. Although he attempted to close his arms back to his chest, the mud was too firm, and both shoulders were dislocated.

With his arms dislocated and behind him, his chest bore the full surface area of the seabed. He held his breath and flexed as hard as possible, but his lower cartilage ribs were fractured and the cartilage between his ribs and sternum broken.

He felt the need to speak to the supervisor to “politely” ask him to remove the load. However, whenever he attempted to speak, gas was forced from his lungs, causing further compression to his chest cavity.

He was compressed beneath the load for approximately 10 seconds before the crane was able to lift it.

The diver working with him pulled him from the mud via the umbilical line that connected him to the dive bell, his only means of returning to the surface.

At this point the diver was still conscious (“only just holding on”) with visual problems, mobility problems and breathing difficulties.

The diving bell clump weight was lowered to the seabed, and his companion carried him 30 meters from the accident site so that he could be positioned on to it. The clump was then raised to the diving bell.

However, the diver could not fit back into the bell’s small opening as his dislocated arms stuck out sideways. He managed to clamp his left arm between his legs and pull it back into its socket. This maneuver, his own idea, was performed in his current adrenaline-fuelled and panicked state. He didn’t think he could perform the same action on the other arm and remain conscious. Breathing was now extremely labored.

The supporting diver assisted him on to his side so he could be floated up into the bell, right arm first with his elbow retracted. The diver used his left (uninjured) leg to hold himself in the bell by standing on the valve guard on the outer bottom door.

His head was still underwater in the partially-flooded bell. As the bellman pressurized the bell, forcing the water out, the diver had to bear the weight of his helmet in air. He was unable to do so without extreme pain, so the bell was re-flooded.

As he was still wearing his helmet, a cervical collar could not be fitted. Instead, the bellman’s towel was rolled up and used to support his head. The bell was then pressurized until the water level was at just above shoulder height. His helmet was then carefully removed.

Again, the bellman attempted to fill the bell with air. Again, it had to be reflooded because the diver experienced severe pain until his right, still dislocated, arm was supported using a rope.

The bell was finally raised to the ship, and towels were used to make a stretcher. Due to the extent of the diver’s spinal injuries, and right arm still sticking out unable to be splinted, he could not be maneuvered through the cramped conditions of the dive bell’s doors without causing extreme pain.

Morphine was administered, and his memory is clouded as the vessel’s medics attempted to relocate his right shoulder. After about an hour of unsuccessful attempts, he was transferred to another chamber so he could be decompressed, a process that takes several days, ready to be taken to the ship’s hospital.

“Six doors and two tight corners - ‘very’ difficult and painful”

He was made as comfortable as possible in a bunk with pillows, blankets and more morphine. Pain relief was constantly administered throughout decompression, firstly through intramuscular injection in the arm, until it was too bruised, then through the buttocks.



Upon completion of decompression, the casualty was assisted from his bunk and out of the diving system, where he was able to stand on his uninjured leg if holding onto something for support. He was assisted to the vessel’s hospital, where his arm was finally relocated.

After a 24-hour bend watch, in case he should suffer decompression sickness, he was evacuated by helicopter and transported via ambulance to hospital.

Both shoulders have since been reconstructed, and he has undertaken a full year of physio and occupational therapy before returning to full duties as a diver. He still experiences psychological trauma involving nightmares and flashbacks.

1653,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil's Amazon dam plans: Ominous warnings of future destruction (commentary) - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/brazils-amazon-dam-plans-ominous-warnings-of-future-destruction-commentary/,"Brazil’s current 10-year Energy Expansion Plan calls for three more large dams in Amazonia by 2029, and Brazil’s 2050 National Energy Plan lists many more.

Both plans contain ominous passages explaining that the list of dams could expand if “uncertainty” is resolved regarding current regulations protecting Indigenous peoples and protected areas for biodiversity.

Brazil’s National Congress is considering bills to eliminate environmental licensing; a bill submitted by President Jair Bolsonaro would allow dams on Indigenous lands. Brazil’s dam-building plans to satisfy 2050 energy demand extend to neighboring Amazonian nations, including Peru and Bolivia.

The 2050 plan essentially admits that dams on Indigenous lands and within other protected areas are not necessary because the electricity could be generated by offshore wind power. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.

Every year Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy publishes a “Decennial Plan for Energy Expansion,” which includes the “large” dams (since 2004 defined in Brazil as having at least 30 MW installed capacity) to be completed within the ten-year time horizon.

The number of Amazonian dams listed has steadily declined in the last few plans, a fact that the plans make clear is due to “uncertainty” about current licensing policies restricting impacts on the environment and on Indigenous peoples. The most recent plan, which is for 2020-2029, lists only three dams: Tabajara (in Rondônia), Bem Querer (in Roraima), and Castanheiras (in Mato Grosso). A longer list of dams to be completed “after 2029” is also included, but the most controversial dams are also not included in it.

The 2020-2029 plan contains an ominous paragraph (p. 264) making clear that unnamed dams could be built depending on the “treatment” of conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity) and Indigenous Lands. In other words, more and more-damaging dams could be built if regulations are changed, as is proposed in bills currently moving through committees in Brazil’s National Congress.

This is not a remote possibility, as Brazil’s environmental regulations have been being dismantled since the mid-2000s, and this process has accelerated enormously since Jair Bolsonaro became president in January 2019. Several proposed laws would effectively eliminate environmental licensing. There is also a proposed law introduced by President Bolsonaro that would open Indigenous lands for exploitation by non-indigenous people — hydroelectric development is one of the uses specifically mentioned, development which could be carried out without requiring consent of the Indigenous groups impacted.

In addition to the ten-year plans, Brazil also has periodic “National Energy Plans.” The most recent one, which completed its public comment period on October 13, extends to 2050. This plan also omits the most controversial dams such as the Babaquara (renamed “Altamira”) Dam on the Xingu River upstream of Belo Monte. However, the report’s list of potential dams (Figure 1) includes the Chacorão Dam on the Tapajós River, which would flood part of the Munduruku Indigenous Land, as well as other dams on the Tapajós and its tributary the Jamanxim River that would flood part of Sawré Mubyu, a Munduruku area that has had its official status as an “Indigenous land” blocked precisely to make way for these dams.

The omissions in the 2050 National Energy Plan are intriguing. For example, the map of planned transmission lines omits the line from Manaus to Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima state (p. 191). It is included in the 2029 10-year plan (p. 105). This line would pass through the Waimiri-Atroari Indigenous Land and requires consultation. Yet the planned Bem Querer Dam in Roraima, which would use the line to transmit most of its output to Manaus, is moving ahead quickly and is scheduled for completion in 2028 according to the 2020-2029 10-year plan (p. 57).

Dam plans can appear out of nowhere, as with the Barão do Rio Branco project announced soon after Bolsonaro took office. This project would build a 2,000-MW dam on the Trombetas River (Figure 2) together with a road connecting the Amazon River to the border with Suriname on a route that is almost entirely composed of conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity), Indigenous Lands and Quilombola Lands. “Quilombolas” are descendants of enslaved Africans who escaped in past centuries and set up their own villages in the forest; they have the same rights as Indigenous peoples under Brazil’s 1988 constitution. Bolsonaro’s planned dam would flood Quilombola Lands.

Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador also have big plans for Amazonian dams. The 2010 Brazil/Peru agreement specified six large dams in the Amazonian part of Peru to be built by Brazilian construction firms with financing from Brazil’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), largely to export electricity to Brazil (Figure 3). Since 2010 the “Lava Jato” (“Car Wash”) corruption scandal in Brazil has tainted the main construction firm expected to build the dams (Odebrecht), as well as various political figures in Brazil and in the other Amazonian countries. In addition, Brazil’s economy has not been doing well, and BNDES has less money to invest than it once did. Nevertheless, many of these dams are listed in Brazil’s 2050 National Energy Expansion Plan as possible sources of electricity in the coming decades (Figure 4).

The dams Brazil plans to build in Peru and Bolivia would have many impacts on the environment and on the people who live along the rivers in these countries. Ironically, they also would have impacts in Brazil itself. A study by Bruce Forsberg and coworkers showed that these planned dams would retain enough sediments to significantly reduce the transport of this valuable material into the Brazilian part of the basin. Nutrients in, and associated with, these sediments represent the base of the food chain for fish. As a result, the fisheries along the entire length of the Amazon River would see reduced production.

The fact that Brazil would be “shooting itself in the foot” by building these dams does not mean that they won’t be built. After all, Brazil dammed the Madeira River with the Santo Antônio Dam in 2011 and the Jirau Dam in 2013, thus sacrificing much of what had been the world’s second-greatest riverine fishery, second only to the Mekong (which is also threatened by dams). Fish catches plummeted due to the two Madeira dams, not only in Brazil but also in Bolivia and Peru because of the blockage of fish migrations.

In Bolivia, the same type of arrangement as in Peru applies to at least two planned dams. Brazil has also considered building a dam in Guyana, which could be connected to the planned Boa Vista-Manaus transmission line. All of these dams would have major environmental and human impacts, and the other Amazonian countries generally have even weaker legal protections than Brazil. This fact appears to be part of the reason for building these dams abroad, as the secretary of planning of Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy as much as confessed in 2012 in admitting that the foreign dams had priority because they would be faster to approve and build.

As compared to previous energy plans, one improvement in the current plans is that they foresee a substantial increase in wind energy. While the plans for wind power still focuses on onshore generation, the 2050 plan has calculations of the enormous potential for wind power on the continental shelf along the Brazilian coast. The plan admits that “The total expected installed capacity of wind power in 2050 may be even greater than 200 GW… as long as the expansion of hydroelectric dams with interference in protected areas is not allowed” (p. 101). In other words, Brazil could get all of the electricity it demands by tapping this wind resource without needing to allow hydroelectric dams to be built in the country’s Indigenous Lands and conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity).

The 2050 National Energy Plan shows that by 2050 Brazil could install 89 GW of “centralized” photovoltaic solar power (i.e., not counting “distributed” panels on rooftops), and that this would make up the difference in foregone hydroelectric generation if restrictions are not removed on Indigenous land and protected areas (pp. 111-112). If restrictions on hydropower are relaxed, less centralized photovoltaic solar (42 GW) would be installed. These numbers for solar power assume that wind power will be installed on a large scale. If some restriction prevents this, then centralized photovoltaic solar power could be expanded to over 100 GW (p. 112).

For comparison, Brazil’s total potential installed capacity of untapped hydropower is only 52 GW, and of this only 12 GW (23%) does not interfere with indigenous lands and other protected areas (p. 79). The 2050 plan’s repeated inclusion of scenarios with flooding within Indigenous lands and conservation units undoubtedly reflects the expectation of Brazil’s electrical authorities that protection of these areas against flooding by dams will indeed be eliminated.

The 2050 plan assumes that hydropower is the cheapest, and therefore the most desirable option, followed by wind and then solar. However, dams are by no means cheap energy, as shown by a worldwide survey of hundreds of dams that found that most are uneconomical because they almost always cost much more than originally estimated and they routinely take longer than expected to begin generating electricity. Brazil’s Belo Monte Dam is a good example: it cost more than double the original expectation and completion took longer than planned. The importance of the high financial cost of dams pales in comparison to that of their human and environmental impacts, which are far greater than those of wind and solar power.

The plans could be more ambitious in the area of energy conservation. The 2020-2029 Ten-Year Plan calculates that 4.8% of Brazil’s projected electricity use in 2029 could be avoided through conservation measures (p. 220). The 2050 National Energy Plan has many calls for energy efficiency, but no calculations of how much electricity use could be avoided. Ever since the 2008 National Plan for Climate Change (PNMC), the government’s goal has been to end use of the electric showerheads that, according to the PNMC, consume 5% of all electricity in Brazil (p. 58), but basically nothing has been done. There is no mention in any of these plans of stopping the export of electricity in the form of aluminum and other electro-intensive products (7% of Brazil’s electricity use).

185,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Human rights violation: Soldier’s hanging jeopardises EU trade concessions - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/story/467905/human-rights-violation-soldier%E2%80%99s-hanging-jeopardises-eu-trade-concessions,"



The execution of soldier Muhammad Hussain has risked Pakistan’s hard-earned trading leverages with the European Union (EU) by breaking the four-year moratorium on death penalty which served as a condition for duty-free access to EU markets.





As a fatal coincidence, the penalty overlapped the coming into force of EU’s trade concessions which, after years of tedious dialogue, became operational on November 16. Facilitated trade required Pakistan to meet some human rights benchmarks, including the curtailment of the death penalty.It is hence feared that Hus­sain’s hanging in a Mianwali jail on November 15 may provide grounds to jeopardise Pakistan’s trade prospects with the bloc of 27 nations.Hussain, 45, stabbed a superior in Okara over a personal dispute in 2008. He was tried in the military court in Okara cantonment, which sentenced him to death on February 12, 2009. Hussain’s mercy petitions to the General Headquarters (GHQ) and the Chief of Army Staff were rejected. Senator Farhatullah Babar, the presidential spokesman, revealed that Hussain’s mercy petition to the president was also turned down.The break in the de facto moratorium undercuts recent announcement by the government of introducing legislation to abolish death penalty, said EU High Representative Catherine Ashton in a statement.Following the execution, EU headquarters in Brussels posed questions to the country’s mission, sought all relevant information, and said that EU trade agreements were tied to human rights bars whose violation increases chances of cancellation, said diplomatic sources.The EU is not willing to take the execution of the army soldier as an exception – an execution is an execution, whether ordered by a military court or a civilian court, said embassy officials. Chief of Army Staff General Kayani could have intervened to pardon the soldier, they said, adding that all available options were not utilised to exonerate Husain.The Nov 16 concessions were on 75 trade items for a period of roughly 14 months. The proposal for concessions was put forth after the 2010 floods to abet Pakistan’s economic recovery. It came into force after 26 months.It was agreed that quarterly reviews would decide the continuity of concessions.According to EU embassy officials, the recently proposed Generalised Scheme of Preferences, which will come into force from 2014, and promises duty free access of unlimited goods, is not attached to abolition of the death penalty.Officials added the worst scenario for Pak-EU trade relations would be a series of executions, with the recent one serving as a precedent.Published in The Express Tribune, November 19, 2012.",2012-11-18 08:00:00+00:00,"['penalty', 'rights', 'eu', 'court', 'violation', 'human', 'hanging', 'soldier', 'pakistans', 'jeopardises', 'force', 'trade', 'hussains', 'death', 'soldiers', 'concessions', 'execution']",India,news article,English

Mehdi Pedramkhoo/Tasnim News Agency/via REUTERS/File Photo

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran evacuated residents from inundated areas of the southwestern city of Ahvaz on Wednesday as the nationwide death toll from the worst flooding in 70 years reached 77, state media reported.

The state news agency IRNA said more than 200 villages were also evacuated in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan, and 46,000 people were housed in emergency shelters provided by the government.

Further districts of Ahvaz were put on flood alert, the provincial governor said, as more torrential rain was forecast in coming days. A hospital in the city was evacuated on Monday.

Floods described by officials as the worst since the 1940s have hit some 1,900 cities and villages across Iran after exceptionally heavy rain since March 19. Western and southwestern areas of the country are suffering the worst.

The disaster has left aid agencies struggling to cope, and the armed forces were deployed to help flood-hit people.

Early estimates put flood losses in agriculture sector at 47 trillion rials ($350 million).

The government has told citizens, and especially flood-affected farmers, that all losses will be compensated. The Islamic Republic’s state budget is already stretched under U.S. sanctions on energy and banking sectors that have halved Iranian oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad.

Iranian officials have repeatedly said the massive floods have not affected production and development of oilfields, or the flow of crude through pipelines to recipient markets.",2019-04-10 12:01:13+00:00,"['hit', 'underway', 'southwest', 'flooding', 'evacuation', 'southwestern', 'hard', 'evacuated', 'rain', 'ahvaz', 'losses', 'iran', 'worst', 'villages', 'province', 'officials', 'state']",Iran,news article,English

718,Drought Sri Lanka,White Ferns poised to break World Cup drought - Stuff.co.nz,http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/8243286/White-Ferns-poised-to-break-World-Cup-drought,"CAPTAIN'S KNOCK: Suzie Bates scores an unbeaten hundred to lead her team to victory over Australia.

Captain Suzie Bates says her White Ferns are in ""a good place"" ahead of their women's 50-over cricket World Cup opener against South Africa in Cuttack, India, tomorrow.

New Zealand brushed aside Monday's surprise hammering by India to topple world champions England by 13 runs in yesterday's final warmup match and confirm themselves as contenders for a first cup triumph since 2000.

They headed for India buoyed by a 2-1 Twenty20 series win over Australia in Melbourne, their first series victory on Australian soil for 26 years, and are confident of breaking up the England-Australia dominance during the past eight years.

Though India showed on Monday that they will be a handful on their home turf, and the West Indies are also now a major threat in the women's game, that confidence will remain intact following a rare win over England.

New Zealand posted 223 all out in 50 overs, with Sara McGlashan scoring 88 from 90 balls and Lucy Doolan 57 from 77, and held their nerve to dismiss the tournament favourites for 210 in the 49th over.

""To beat England, who are a very strong side, was really impressive and it puts us in a good place heading into the World Cup,"" Bates said, describing the tune-up win as ""massive"".

""If we'd had two losses, we would've been a bit more nervous, but with our batters scoring runs and bowlers executing, we are really confident going into our first pool game.""

With the 9am starts, Bates said the first 10 overs were tricky for the team batting first, while the wickets had taken plenty of turn later in the day, so playing late and negotiating spin would be crucial for the batsmen.

New Zealand have been something of a third wheel in women's cricket when it comes to major tournaments during the past eight years, with England winning the last 50-over World Cup, in 2009, as well as the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in the same year, while Australia won the previous 50-over World Cup, in 2005, and have won the last two T20 World Cups, in 2010 and 2012.

New Zealand have become accustomed to the bridesmaid's tag, having lost three finals (one 50-over and two T20s) in the space of two years in 2009 and 2010.

But there is genuine belief among the New Zealand team that they can win for the first time since 2000.

""There's very little separating the top teams at this level, so it's very much going to be about sticking to our game plan and our strengths and how people cope with the pressure. We believe we can win at the World Cup,"" said coach Katrina Keenan.

Runs from the experienced Bates and left-hander Amy Satterthwaite at the top of the order will be vital for New Zealand, as will Sophie Devine's hitting power in the middle order. There are few better strikers in the world.

As well, all-rounder Nicola Browne, who also has few problems finding the boundary, looms as influential.

The slower bowlers are expected to be prominent in India and New Zealand have a few handy ones, most notably Morna Nielsen who bowled well in Australia.

New Zealand will also face Pakistan and Australia in group B before the Super Sixes playoff stage.

Group A is headed by England and includes India, the West Indies and Sri Lanka.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - A flood, triggered by incessant heavy rain, has claimed two lives and affected 27,808 people or 9,245 families in 29 villages of Bima District, West Nusa Tenggara Province, hsince Saturday .

""The Bima Disaster Mitigation Office (BPBD) reported that two local residents died in the disaster, and 9,245 families comprising 27,808 people were affected,"" Raditya Jati, the office's spokesman, said on Sunday.

A number of people were displaced by the flooding, he added.

The flooding submerged 294 hectares of farming areas, 25 hectares of ponds, and 9,245 houses. It also damaged 12 of the flood-hit houses, and four bridges.

Downpour fell for around nine hours incessantly on Saturday throughout Bima, causing several dams in four sub-districts to overflow.

The affected sub-districts were Madapangga, Bolo, Woha, and Monta.

The Bima BPBD has coordinated with the authorities in the affected areas to distribute relief aid and deploy personnel to help flood victims.

It has also deployed rubber boats and provided emergency tents for displaced people.

Earlier, the Meteorological, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has warned that extreme weather such as heavy rains, strong wind and huge waves were forecast to occur in parts of Indonesia, including West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara Provinces.

On April 7, 2019, nine of them were arrested as they arrived from the city of Mahshahr, said Dahimi, who spoke with the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on April 10.

“Today, I was informed that a group of young Arabs in the city of Hamidiyeh wanted to take food items and blankets to the flood victims but they were stopped by the security forces,” Dahimi said.

Dahimi said he did not have information about their identities or places of detention but added that two other rescue workers, Ahmad Ka’bi and Yaghoub Ka’bi (relation unknown), were detained the following day in the same village.

“Ahmad and Yaghoub Ka’bi were helping with rescue operations when they were arrested for unknown reasons,” Dahimi told CHRI. “According to information from our friends in the village, the Arab youths wanted to distribute food and other goods they had collected for the victims but there was an argument with the authorities and they got arrested.”

According to Dahimi, both had previously advocated minority rights in Shushtar.

Since late March 2019, flash floods have claimed at least 77 lives and injured more than 1,000 people, the head of Iran’s Emergency Medical Services, Pir-Hossein Kolivand, told Parliament on April 9.

On April 8, a video was widely shared on Persian social media appearing to show an elderly Arab man being disparaged by Khuzestan’s Governor Gholamreza Shariati.

“You won’t help us because we are Arab,” an old man tells the governor. “We have nothing left. Why do you help Syria but not us?”

The governor replied, “Don’t talk nonsense. You’re a rude opponent of the state. Get out of here!”

Commenting on the governor’s reaction, journalist Mehdi Ghadimi tweeted:

“Watching the governor being so disrespectful to a protesting flood victim was one of the worst moments of these past few weeks. When there are rumors that flood waters are being redirected toward Arab villages and threatening lives, the authorities have to build trust instead of making enemies out of tired, angry people.”

Former political prisoner Abdollah Momeni wrote: “… Governor Shariati’s response to the poor old man is a sign of the deteriorating moral fiber among some of the government officials that is grinding the soul of the Iranian people. They are so consumed with power that morality has died inside them.”

“What kind of crisis manager are you, Mr. Governor?” tweeted journalist Nelli Mahjoob. “How can you allow yourself to silence a flood victim by making accusations against him… They are all people. People. Do you get it?”

Journalist Saba Azarpeik tweeted, “The security and intelligence establishment should teach Khuzestan Governor Shariati about how to treat devastated people who have lost their homes! His behavior is making people angry!”",2019-04-12 15:28:00+00:00,"['guards', 'arrest', 'arabiranian', 'making', 'rights', 'man', 'help', 'arab', 'governor', 'volunteers', 'flood', 'dahimi', 'province', 'revolutionary', '11', 'kabi', 'arrested', 'khuzestan']",Iran,news article,English
545,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,The Ducati Scrambler was a bike for hippies — but now it's a motorcycle for hipsters - Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ducati-scrambler-bike-hippies-now-160712814.html,"Ducati Scrambler

I recently took a short vacation to Bologna, Italy and while I was there I spent some time at the Ducati factory and museum.

Ducati is a very old motorcycle brand, founded in 1926 and headquartered in Bologna for its entire history.

In recent years, the company has gained renown for its so-called ""naked"" bikes, mainly the Ducati Monster, which was rolled out in 1993 and has achieved widespread popularity (it has an open trellis frame that exposes its unique desmodromic v-twin engine).

Ducati is also well-known for its aggressive superbikes, such as the Panigale — often called the ""Ferrari"" of motorcycles.

But it's biggest hit of late is a reboot of a motorcycle that it first built back in the early 1960s and discontinued in the early 1970s. It was called the ""Scrambler,"" and Ducati resumed making it, with a completely different level of technology and much more horsepower, in 2015.

Ducati Scrambler

I was a big fan of the Monster, but the Scrambler is really just about my favorite bike on the road right now. For Ducati, it gives the brand a bike to put against some of the revived ""cafe racers"" that have been produced by the likes of Triumph and even Harley-Davidson, which is famous for its hulking cruisers.

Triumph's bikes are pure hipster, but the Scrambler nods at a subset of hipsterdom: riders who want to tackle the road and the trail. In this sense, they probably would have appealed to somebody like Steve McQueen, a motorsport nut who actually sampled a whole bunch of dirt bikes for Popular Mechanics in 1966.

The original Ducati Scrambler wasn't on his docket, but it should have been.

Ducati made the original Scrambler for the US market, and if a photo I snapped while I was at the museum is any indication, it was a bike beloved by counterculturalists:

Ducati Scrambler

I'm not sure if the new Ducati is similarly pitched; the target market seems to be especially chic hipsters. In fact, the Scrambler has been so successful that rather than allow it to exist as a single model in the overall Ducati lineup, the company has turned it into a standalone brand selling a variety of different bikes.

Story continues

From a business standpoint, this shows a pretty bold pivot for Ducati. The bike maker is now appealing to several different markets, uniting them with its high-end, design-and-engineering-driven DNA.

As I learned when I stopped by the New York Motorcycle Show last year, American bikers are now absolutely spoiled for choice. There are far more great, modern motorcycles now than there were when I was growing up. Back then, it was essentially cruisers and sport bikes; if you wanted something different, you had to scour the vintage realms.

Nowadays, kickstarting is a thing of past and all these retro-bikes are outfitted with state of the art tech. But as in the case of the Scrambler, they haven't lost their spirit. The bikes of the 1960s and '70s may have appealed to hippies, but there aren't that many of those folks around these days. So a hipster dirt bike with an Italian pedigree is perfect.

208,FF-2016-000062-IDN,We can have fish and dams: here's how - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/we-can-have-fish-and-dams-heres-how-61424,"Fish are the most threatened group among Earth’s freshwater vertebrates. On average, freshwater fish populations have declined by 76% over the past 40 years. Damaged fish communities and declining fisheries characterise global freshwater environments, including those in Australia.

Fish migrate to complete their life cycles, but water-resource developments disrupt river connectivity and migrations, threatening biological diversity and fisheries.

Millions of dams, weirs and smaller barriers – for storage and irrigation, road and rail transport and hydropower schemes – block the migration of fish in rivers worldwide.

These barriers serve our needs for water supply, transport and energy. But, by obstructing fish migrations, they also degrade ecological integrity and reduce food security.

This is bad news for those who depend on fish for food. For example, in the Mekong River fish supply over 70% of the people’s animal protein, but catches are falling drastically following dam building.

In our paper published today in CSIRO’s Marine and Freshwater Research, we take stock of the impact these barriers have on our freshwater fish, most (perhaps all) of which migrate, and how we can help them.

Dam it all

There are countless barriers across Australia’s rivers. Roughly 10,000 barriers of all kinds obstruct flows in the Murray-Darling Basin. Flow is unobstructed in less than half of the basin’s watercourse length.

Native fish numbers in the basin’s rivers have declined by an estimated 90% through habitat fragmentation by barriers together with altered flows, overfishing, coldwater pollution and invasive species.

Similar problems also affect coastal river systems. One or more barriers obstruct 49% of rivers in southeast Australia.

Local species extinctions and loss of biodiversity have occurred nationwide in developed regions, especially upstream of large dams.

Overcoming barriers

One way to help fish overcome barriers is to build fishways (or “fish ladders”).

Fishways are designed to aid fish travelling upstream or downstream at high (dams, weirs) or low (road crossings, barrages) barriers. These are classed as “technical”, with hard-engineering designs, or “nature-like”, mimicking natural stream channels.

Author provided

Recognition that dams threaten freshwater fish communities lagged well behind their construction. Nonetheless, European and American observations of declining fisheries for species moving from the sea to breed in rivers prompted early attempts in Australia to provide for fish passage.

The first Australian fishway was built near Sydney in 1913. By 1985, 52 had been built, but they adopted Northern Hemisphere designs for salmon and trout. These were unsuitable for Australian species, which rarely leap at barriers, and their flow velocities, turbulence and other aspects were excessive.

Seeing the failure of these fishways, New South Wales Fisheries sought advice in 1982 from George Eicher, an American expert, who advised on research to create designs for local species.

This led to expanding fishways research and construction in eastern states. The result was markedly improved performance, for example in the Murray-Darling’s Sea to Hume program.

Fishway performance

Our research shows that regrettably few Australian fishways have yet been shown to meet ideal ecological criteria for mitigating the impact of barriers. Furthermore, fishways are in place at relatively few sites.

In NSW, for example, only about 172 in total serve several thousand weirs and 123 dams. They can be expensive to build and operate, so costs retard mitigation at numerous important sites.

Fishways have seldom been built on dams (fewer than 3% of Australia’s 500 high dams have one); they have generally cost tens of millions of dollars; and most operate, with limited effectiveness, for less than 50% of the time. The need for much greater investment in innovation, research and development is pressing.

How to store water and also rehabilitate fish

To reduce the impact of dams on fish we need to look at resolving problems at river-basin scale; improving our management of barriers, environmental flows and water quality; removing barriers; and developing improved fishway designs.

Author provided

One way to accelerate improvements nationally would be to pass legislation for routinely re-licensing waterway barriers at regular intervals. This would mean that older barriers are re-evaluated and upgraded or removed where necessary. Under the NSW Weir Removal Program, 14 redundant weirs have already been removed, with others under assessment.

We are developing an innovative pump fishway concept at UNSW Australia. It combines aquaculture fish-pumping methods for safe fish transfer with existing fishway technology.

We hope the project may help transform past practices through less-costly modular construction, adaptability to a wide range of barriers and improved effectiveness.

Better fishway developments will mean that we can store and supply much-needed water while also restoring fish migrations. This will be increasingly important as climate change reduces streamflows in many regions, and will help rehabilitate fish populations.",2016-06-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['research', 'weirs', 'fishway', 'dams', 'rivers', 'fishways', 'fish', 'freshwater', 'heres', 'barriers', 'water']",India,news article,English

Russian customers choose clothes at a market in Manzhouli, Inner Mongolia autonomous region. China and Russia have pledged to increase bilateral trade to a value of $200 billion a year by 2020, up from $55.4 billion in 2010. Liu Zhaoming / for China Daily

The Sino-Russian trade relationship is about to become more profitable

MOSCOW/ST PETERSBURG - Ding Yanna has been involved in Sino-Russia trade for more than 19 years. Since arriving in Russia as a student in 1992, she has sold fur coats, been a construction contractor and is now opening a restaurant in St Petersburg.

Unlike many of her Chinese peers, Ding spends most of her time with Russian friends and only conducts business in accordance with local laws and regulations.

Although it has brought a lot of extra costs, such as the payment of taxes and the cost of hiring lawyers and accountants, this approach has allowed her business to survive and thrive.

""If you want to do business here over a long period, doing it legally is of the utmost importance,"" said Ding, who also has a business in Moscow. She said she is planning to establish a school to provide basic business knowledge to Chinese entrepreneurs working in Russia.

Illegal Chinese business activity in Russia is one of the most sensitive issues facing the future of Sino-Russian trade. In 2009, around 150 Chinese businessmen and a large amount of their goods were detained by Russia's Federal Migration Service in raids at the Cherkizovsky Market, in the east of Moscow. The raids and subsequent detentions quickly escalated into a diplomatic spat, with Chinese officials demanding that the Russian government should protect the interests of Chinese businesspeople in the country. China also sent a delegation to Moscow to conduct negotiations on the issue.

Three years later, many of the merchants who stayed in Russia have relocated to a different market in a southeastern corner of the city. Officially it's called the Moscow Trade Center, but is better known to locals as Lyublino.

Although many of the Chinese dealers are still complaining about the Cherkizovsky raids, during which contraband goods worth about $2 billion were seized, most of them are getting used to the new place.

""I like the new market, it is much cleaner and better regulated compared with Cherkizovsky,"" said Li Xue, who came to Russia in 2000 and owns a shoe store at Lyublino. She said business has improved since she moved from Cherkizovsky three years ago.

According to official figures, about half of Russia's trade is now conducted with other European countries..

Its trade with China, meanwhile, accounts for about 10 percent of its total trade. Earlier this year, China and Russia pledged to increase bilateral trade to a value of $200 billion a year by 2020, up from $55.4 billion in 2010. However, a lot of the trade volume is conducted through energy sales.

Cai Guiru, chairperson of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Russia, said in an article earlier this year that the biggest obstacle for Sino-Russia trade is ""Gray Customs Clearance"", in which some government-connected ""clearance"" companies have been pushing imported goods into the Russian market at a tax rate much lower than the official level.

The Russian authorities have long criticized the low level of business education of Chinese traders and workers in their country, noting that Chinese commodities traded to Russia often go through the

gray market rather than the proper channels.

""China and Russia need real international trade instead of covert transactions such as street vendors, illegal private banks, and urban marketplaces,"" said Cai. He added that Russia needs licit Chinese commodities and welcomes entrepreneurs who will run their businesses legally.

Cai said that if long-standing illegal business practices are allowed to continue, Sino-Russian trade will remain at a low level.

According to official figures, there are between 200,000 and 400,000 Chinese living in Russia. A 2008 study by Aleksander Larin, a researcher at the Institute of the Far East in Moscow, shows that the average Chinese migrant in Russia hails from northern China.

Deng Weining, secretary general of the association of South China dealers at Lyublino, said many Chinese dealers have started to conduct legal business since they moved to the new market. ""Russia needs Chinese goods, but it also wants quality Chinese goods,"" said Deng. He noted that Chinese dealers need to be united to raise the average price of Chinese goods to counter rising costs.

According to Deng, a Chinese T-shirt will often sell for 200 roubles ($7) in an urban marketplace. The same item will fetch more than 400 roubles in a mall or even 4,000 roubles if it's passed off as an exclusive brand in a specialized shop. That affords Chinese dealers a chance to make a much bigger profit if they manage to ascend the value chain, he added.

Ling Ji, minister counselor for economic and commercial affairs at the Chinese embassy to Russia, said the Sino-Russian trade volume totaled around $30 billion in the first five months of this year. ""It shows that the Sino-Russian trade relationship has very great ability to restore itself,"" said Ling.

Meanwhile the Chinese and Russian governments have set a target of raising the volume of trade between the two countries to $100 billion by 2015.

""The US and Canada are not very populous compared with China, but their trade volume exceeds $600 billion. China and Russia share a 4,300-kilometer-long border, so it's really a pity that their trade volume is only $55.45 billion,"" said Cai.

1659,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Lawsuit Against BHP over Brazil Dam Collapse Fails on Appeal in English Court - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2021/03/25/606967.htm,"LONDON – A 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group said on Wednesday it had failed to resurrect a 5.0 billion pound ($6.9 billion) English lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP over a devastating 2015 dam failure.

The Court of Appeal agreed with a lower court that the vast group action was an abuse of process, that claimants were already able to seek redress in Brazil and that the case would be “irredeemably unmanageable” if allowed to proceed.

Related: Brazilian Dam Claimants to Take BHP Class Action to English Court of Appeal

Tom Goodhead, the PGMBM lawyer representing the claimants, said it was “a sad day for the English justice system” after senior judges agreed that the claim, relating to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, should be struck out.

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

The landmark case was the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

But the English claim against BHP was first struck out in November after a High Court judge ruled that allowing it to proceed here would be like “trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel.”

Goodhead said he was surprised and disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision, which sent “a poor message about corporate responsibility and legal consequences for wrongdoing.”

“We are committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy. We will now take stock and assess our options as to how justice can best be achieved,” he said.

BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that the proceedings duplicated existing and ongoing remediation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil. It said it remained fully committed to doing “the right thing” for victims.

BHP says it and Vale each poured about $1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems.

BHP said Renova has spent nearly 12 billion reais ($2.17 billion) across the projects to date.

A United Nations expert report, published in September, said the disaster decimated the livelihoods of more than three million people, leaving locals exposed to dust and heavy metals in mud, that information about toxicity was inadequate and that all reparation projects were behind schedule.

In October, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against BHP and Vale, alleging compensation packages were too low and forced victims to waive rights in other legal proceedings.

Renova has insisted that projects such as water quality monitoring and environmental repairs are on track, while the miners reject allegations they are not complying with obligations and of wrongdoing.

850,FL-2016-000114-EGY,"In Egypt, 8 Dead After Chaotic Day of Heavy Rains, Flooding - VOA News",https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/egypt-8-dead-after-chaotic-day-heavy-rains-flooding,"CAIRO - Heavy rains that pummeled the capital of Cairo and other parts of the country, causing massive traffic jams and flooding many key roads, left at least eight people dead, including four children, authorities said Wednesday.

People captured images of Tuesday's downpours and flooding on their mobile phones, posting images on social media, including scenes of cars submerged by flood waters.

In one dramatic video, a man on a bulldozer pulls the lifeless body of a little girl out of the water in a flooded area in northern Sharqia Province as shouts and screams are heard in the background. Another video shows a policeman, steps away from the presidential palace in Cairo's district of Heliopolis, wading into a flooded street to unclog a sewage drain.

Authorities closed schools and universities in the greater Cairo area Wednesday and companies saw only skeletal staff show up at work. Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly said school closures were limited to the greater Cairo area, including Giza and Qalioubia, as more rainfall was expected in the next couple of days, according to the country's weather service.

The mayhem raised questions about Cairo's ability to deal with such heavy rains as the city's infrastructure and sewage and drainage systems have suffered from years of poor maintenance.

People took to social media to criticize the government's lack of preparedness. Cairo, a city of some 20 million people, has been left for decades in neglect and decay, particularly its overcrowded neighborhoods.

Hashtags like “(hash)Egypt is sinking” were trending on social media, attracting many videos and pictures of the most affected areas in Cairo and elsewhere.

Five deaths occurred in the Nile Delta provinces of Sharqia, Gharbia and Kafr el-Sheikh, according to the Interior Ministry. Three of the victims, including two children, were electrocuted. The other two victims died falling from the rooftops of their flooded homes.

Local authorities in northern Sinai also reported two deaths. Moataz Taher, head of the el-Hassana municipality, said in a statement that a 47-year-old farmer and his 13-year-old daughter died early Wednesday in the flooding.

In the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, the heavy rain caused a three-story building to collapse Wednesday, killing a 7-year-old child and injuring her 19-year-old brother, according to the city's civil protection authority.

In Cairo, the eastern suburb of Nasr City was hit the hardest, but so was Heliopolis, located near Cairo's international airport. The government said the two suburbs had received at least 650,000 cubic meters cubic feet of precipitation in just 90 minutes on Tuesday, overwhelming the city's sewage and drain systems.

Trucks fanned out across Cairo to drain water from flooded areas. A key highway connecting Cairo to other provinces was closed, the state-run al-Ahram daily reported.

EgyptAir said it had delayed some fights on Tuesday because passengers were stuck on the roads and unable to get to the airport. A part of the old Cairo airport terminal which has been under renovation was also flooded, with footage on social media showing rainwater pouring into the hallway.

The Civil Aviation Ministry said that terminal was only being used by a private carrier for one or two flights a day and shared photos of it after it was cleaned up.",2019-10-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['day', 'heavy', 'flooded', 'cairos', 'egypt', 'including', 'chaotic', 'media', 'city', 'social', 'rains', 'flooding', 'sewage', 'dead', 'cairo', 'citys']",Egypt,news article,English

(Photo: Andrés Viña)

After major flooding in 1998, China introduced the Natural Forest Conservation Program, a logging ban to help protect against erosion and rapid runoff. A recent study in Science Advances of 10 years of satellite data found significant recovery in some Chinese forests.

But it's not all good news. Andrés Viña, an author of the paper, says this reforestation is probably shifting deforestation elsewhere.

""They implemented two national programs. One was the Grain to Green program, which is basically to reconvert agricultural fields in steep slopes into forests. And the other is the natural forest conservation program which is, in a sense, a logging ban to prevent deforestation and also to increase the aerial forests,” Viña says. “At regional scales, in the Sichuan province, the program seems to be working in the sense that there is forest regeneration, forest recovery. And so we wanted to see if that was the case on a national scale. And we also wanted to see if the program was, in fact, related with this regeneration.”

China’s conservation policies banned logging and employed locals as park rangers, protecting forests so that they could regrow. The recovery of a forest in the Min Mountains, Sichuan Province, is pictured here. (Photo: Andrés Viña)

China's reforestation initiatives, in other words, have been a huge success. But Viña says this isn't necessarily a good thing. China, as it turns out, is just looking elsewhere to get the lumber products it needs.

“China has become one of the leading timber importers in the world,” Viña says. “It's Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Indonesia, as well as Africa, northern Eurasia, Russia are the ones that are now supplying all the gap that has been left by this program enacted. In a sense, the program exported the deforestation, and we basically also speculate that it's not just a climate issue, but also a biodiversity issue, because many of the places that are being deforested right now are also places of high biodiversity. We are replacing high biodiversity places in other places for relatively poor biodiversity forests in China.”

Satellites tracked forest cover and regrowth from 2000-2010 in the study, “Effects of conservation policy on China’s forest recovery,” published in Science Advances. (Photo: Viña et al. Sci. Adv. 2016)

“We as consumers with user consumption habits and user consumption rates basically encourage China to participate in things like sustainable timber production certification. A lot of that timber that is imported is used to produce furniture, for example. But then is exported again to countries like the US and countries in Europe, etc. So, indirectly, we are contributing to this export of deforestation. ... What we do in one place will have repercussions beyond that particular place,” Viña says. “Thinking of China as a vacuum, it's a win for China, but how much a reality in terms of climate change mitigation this program is accruing is still a question mark.”

In a Special Evaluation Study titled ADB’s Response to Natural Disasters and Disaster Risks, the ADB said 50.3% of the country's land area is economically at risk from multiple hazards such as floods, typhoon, and earthquakes.



This means some 81.3% of the country's population or around 76.6 million Filipinos are prone to economic impacts brought by natural disasters.



In terms of mortality risk, the report stated that 88.6% or some 83.5 million Filipinos face life-threatening risks from natural disasters. This means that 76.6% of the total land area of the Philippines are at risk of human losses caused by various disasters.



Some 13.8% of Filipinos are exposed to earthquake-related risks every year, while 0.9% of the population are exposed to flood risks every year.



""(Some) 20 of the 44 DMCs (Developing Member Countries) have been rated as 'mortality hotspots,' and 14 of them as 'high economic risk,"" the ADB said. ""Relatively speaking, the countries at highest risk of human losses and economic damage are Viet Nam, Bangladesh and Philippines.""



Disaster funds lacking



Despite this risk, the ADB said assistance that go to the Philippines for disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) have not been enough.



The ADB admitted that while many DMCs receive funding, Kyrgyz Republic and the Philippines are the two contries that either did not receive technical assistance (TA) or got very little.



The Philippines only received one technical assistance worth $225,000 in disaster risk financing. Kyrgyz Republic did not receive any. The ADB extended a TA to the country for the project Developing a Public-Private Earthquake Pool in the Philippines.



""Many of the countries that were ranked high in the Global Risk Hotspots Analysis are supported by ADB, but some did not receive TA, or got very little, notably, Kyrgyz Republic and Philippines. Many countries have not yet been supported by TA for either natural disasters or climate change. This may need to be looked at,"" ADB said.



However, when it comes to projects funded by loans and grants, the Philippines was among those that had high numbers of natural disaster projects. There were 7 projects in the country that were funded by loans and grants, the same level as Sri Lanka.



Apart from the Philippines and Sri Lanka, ADB said DMCs that had at least 3 loan or grant based projects included China (18), Pakistan (16), Bangladesh (12), India (12), Indonesia (12), Viet Nam (6), Tajikistan (4), Cambodia (3), and Kyrgyz Republic (3).

FLOODS

Heavy rains have been recorded in West and Central Africa in the past weeks, including in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Senegal, leading to devastating floods that have killed dozens and displaced thousands of people. In Niger, 329,958 people had been affected by flooding with 65 deaths. About 31,960 houses have collapsed and 5,768 hectares of farmland destroyed. Maradi, Dosso, Tahoua and Niamey are the most affected regions. In 2019, at the same time, 35,384 people were affected across the country.

In northern Nigeria, thousands of homes and wide areas of crops have been destroyed in recent flooding in the states of Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi and Sokoto. More than 30 people reportedly have died. In Borno State, about 26,000 people, including IDPs, have been affected by heavy flooding across camps and communities. Borno and Adamawa states remain at risk of heavy flooding according to the Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) released by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) in June.

In Chad, some 188,915 people (37,783 households) were affected by flooding in the central and southern provinces, in the Lac and NDjamena respectively. Large pieces of farmland are inundated with a potential impact on food security and livelihoods.

In Senegal, an emergency aid plan has been activated following exceptional rains in the capital Dakar and large part of the country that caused devastating floods on 5 September. At least four people were killed, the exact number of the people affected is yet to be determined.

Mali has also seen severe flooding that began in July. By early August, more than 13,200 people, including 5,400 internally displaced persons, were affected by floods in the country. The worst affected regions are Gao, Mopti, Sgou and Sikasso. A total of 1,160 homes have been destroyed.

In Cameroon, more than 30,000 people have been affected by floods caused by heavy rains in Far North, West, Coastal, South and South-West regions, destroying homes, washing away livestock and devastating plantations.

Heavy rainfall at the end of July caused rivers to overflow in the Far North, affecting over 5,000 people. More flooding was recently reported in the area, with over 1,500 families displaced around Maroua.

Flooding also affected the city of Douala and surrounding areas of Littoral region in the South-West after a torrential downpour on 21 August 2020.

In Ghana, roads, bridges, homes and farmland were inundated in the Northern and North East Regions due to heavy rainfall and releases from the Bagre Dam in neighbouring Burkina Faso, which began in mid-August 2020. At least eight people have lost their lives. The spillage was necessary due to a sharp increase in the water level. Several areas remain inaccessible, making assessments impossible.

In Burkina Faso, three people died in Kaya, Centre-Nord after heavy rainfall on 4 September. Earlier flooding affected the capital Ouagadougou, reportedly killing one person and damaging houses and property.

When flooding ravaged parts of southern Alberta in 2013, banks and other lenders took notice.

“We would be asked on every deal, ‘Is it in the flood zone?'” Mike Boyle, president of Calgary-based The Mortgage Group, told Global News.

Lenders didn’t want to get involved with addresses that turned out to be in the disaster areas, he recalled.

Six years later, with the flood a “distant memory,” that’s no longer an issue, according to Boyle. But he worries about homeowners in regions like southeastern Ontario and Quebec, where rivers seem to be overflowing with alarming regularity.

“You can’t get a mortgage if you can’t get insurance,” he said.

Speaking from the Ottawa-Gatineau area, which is experiencing its second major flood in the span of 24 months, licensed insolvency trustee John Haralovich shares the same concern.

“We have seen lenders not agree to renew the mortgage,” said Haralovich, a senior vice-president at debt consultancy firm MNP.

Those have been rare cases so far, he said, but that could change.

“In 2017, they said (the flood) was a once-in-100-year occurrence, and two years later, it’s happened again,” he said.

Homeowners who discover they can’t continue their insurance coverage may also hear from banks that they won’t keep servicing their mortgage once it comes up for renewal, he added. With no insurance to protect the collateral, mortgages on homes in flood-prone areas may become too risky for mainstream lenders, he said.

Several experts who spoke to Global News are concerned that a growing number of Canadians may find themselves facing this issue after the latest round of spring flooding.

The trouble with overland flood insurance

Some 1.7 million Canadian households, or roughly 20 per cent of the population, are exposed to the risk of so-called overland flooding, in which the water flows in from windows, doors and cracks in the walls, usually from an overflowing river or lake.

The good news for them is that overland flood insurance, which didn’t exist for residential dwellings during the 2013 Alberta floods, is now increasingly available in Canada.

The bad news is that no kind of private insurance is meant to cover homeowners from natural disasters that keep happening.

READ MORE: ‘You have a fear of more rain’ — Flooding haunts homeowners for years, study finds

Between eight and 10 per cent of Canadian homeowners live in areas where the likelihood of recurrent flooding is so high that insurance coverage is not available or would come at an “outrageous” cost, Robert Harrison, chairman of the Insurance Brokers Association of Canada, told Canadian Underwriter.

But even homeowners who have been able to buy overland flood coverage can’t necessarily rest easy. If they ever make a claim on that coverage, it is “entirely possible” that they will see their coverage reduced or their insurance costs increased at renewal, said Anne Marie Thomas of InsuranceHotline.com. And if there is a high enough risk that they will be flooded again, they may not be able to continue their coverage at all, she added.

Insurance is meant for events that are “sudden and accidental,” said Pete Karageorgos of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

“You don’t necessarily meet that threshold … if you’re living in a floodplain and odds are it may flood again,” he said.

Canadians who have another type of flood coverage called sewer backup insurance also face a similar conundrum. Filing a claim because backed-up city pipes caused water to flow back into your basement may cause your insurance provider to rethink the terms of your policy when its term is up.

But homeowners dealing with a flooded basement can take several steps to help limit the risk and extent of future water damage and keep their insurance company happy, Thomas said. That includes measures such as installing a sump pump, which helps pump out water accumulating under your home, or a backwater valve, which prevents water in sewage pipes from backing into your house.

Those measures, though, only go so far when you have water breaking in through your windows and doors from nearby rivers and lakes, Thomas said.

“You can’t stop Mother Nature,” she said.

Floods, mortgages and bankruptcies

Eventually, floods can lead to debt defaults, Haralovich said.

Story continues below advertisement

Lenders’ refusal to renew mortgages, of course, is one potential trigger. If homeowners are asked to pay off their outstanding mortgage balance and can’t cover those costs by selling their property, they may have no choice but to default.

Another plausible scenario is that they would be able to turn to alternative lenders, which take on riskier loans but also charge higher interest. That may be a temporary solution, but over time, higher mortgage costs could still push homeowners into debt restructuring, Haralovich said.

A third possible driver is repair bills.

Haralovich recalled seeing one family after the 2017 flood who was forced to file a consumer proposal, despite having some flood insurance.

The policy didn’t cover all the costs so the family used credit cards to finance the rest of the repairs. Within a few months, according to Haralovich, the bills and credit charges had spiralled out of control.

“There is an emerging risk facing Canada’s mortgage market, where flood-related mortgage arrears may become more frequent following flood events as saving rates remain low and more households are subject to repeated flooding,” reads a report by Natalia Moudrak and Blair Feltmate of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

That risk exists for sewer backup flooding, too. The average cost of a flooded basement is $43,000, while available insurance coverage is sometimes capped at less than half that in certain areas, Feltmate previously told Global News.

Meanwhile, surveys show almost half of working Canadians live paycheque to paycheque, the Intact study noted.

Where is the government?

For years, the expansion of the private flood insurance market after the Alberta floods coincided with an attempt by various levels of government to curtail their own responsibility toward property owners, according to Jason Thistlethwaite, a professor at the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development at the University of Waterloo.

Story continues below advertisement

In 2016, for example, British Columbia announced that applicants for disaster financial assistance who could “reasonably and readily” have purchased overland flood insurance would not be eligible to receive the government aid.

The idea was that promoting insurance coverage would help contain the flood-related costs borne by taxpayers. But private insurance alone is ill-suited to protect property owners in areas with a high risk of repeated flooding, Thistlethwaite noted.

READ MORE: ‘This is a huge shock to us’ — What climate change means for home insurance

“This lack of insurance availability in high-risk areas is likely to undermine the federal government’s goal of reducing the costs of publicly funded disaster assistance,” he predicted in a paper co-authored with Daniel Henstra for the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

That realization seems to have dawned on the government now.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month that residents in some areas will have to “move or rebuild differently,” while Quebec Premier François Legault has spoken about paying $200,000 for homeowners in the Ottawa River floodplain to move away from the area.

READ MORE: How Canadians can assist flooding victims in Ontario, Quebec and N.B.

Buyouts have also been a topic of discussion in formal talks between Ottawa and provincial governments. Efforts are also underway to draw or update flood-risk maps. And policy-makers are speaking with insurers about creating a flood-risk insurance pool to fund coverage in flood-prone areas. Insurance companies would set aside part of the revenues to offer subsidized coverage in these areas in a model similar to what is used in Canada to offer auto-insurance coverage to high-risk drivers, Thistlethwaite said.

It makes for a stark contrast to the narrative politicians were using in the aftermath of the Alberta floods, in which the emphasis was on restoring things to the way they were before, Thistlethwaite said.

Now, he added, the language has changed.

According to WFP, the floods have destroyed this years main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton. Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season. The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the provinces already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

Any reasonable observer of the United States ruling class discourse during April 2017 realizes that the imperialist war drive is still a dominant theme.

Many people were quite skeptical if not disbelieving of the campaign rhetoric of current President Donald J. Trump when he hinted at lessening tensions with the Russian Federation over the wars in Syria and eastern Ukraine. These decisions to embark upon a militarist approach to foreign policy is well entrenched in history.

After all the indigenous Native peoples were driven off their lands and systematic genocide remain the order of the day in light of the situation at Standing Rock as a stark example. Of course African people having been kidnapped into slavery and super-exploited for two-and-a-half centuries through involuntary servitude by the purportedly “enlightened and civilized” British, French, Spanish, Danish and Dutch ruling classes were essential in the transformation of the economic system of the West from feudalism and mercantilism into industrial capitalism and imperialism.

The Atlantic Slave Trade not only created the economic conditions for the rise of mass production utilizing steam technology, large-scale agricultural commodity exports and raw material extraction, it developed more effective means of generating surplus value through the advent of the mining outposts and plants where scientific manufacturing systems such as Taylorism and Fordism took capitalism to unprecedented levels of wealth generation. Although capitalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries expanded the capacity to generate wealth, it only intensified the contradictions between labor and the owners of production.

It was the global triangular trading system of slave labor, agricultural commodification and export for profit which fueled the economic imperative of colonial imperialism. Slavery was abolished beginning in the early decades of the 19th century only to pave the way for a more effective process of exploitation. Even though workers in the colonies both foreign and domestic were considered emancipated in fact they were enslaved through their dependence on meager wages needed to maintain an existence after the destruction of more traditional forms of farming and small scale commodity production.

The colonial project in the British colonies of the northeast and southeast as mentioned above was based on genocide and enslavement. The contradictions between the ruling classes of Britain and what became known as the U.S. was resolved through the so-called Revolutionary War, which some historian now realize was in actuality a counter-revolution to preserve chattel slavery, and the War of 1812, which solidified the quest for American dominance over areas south of the Canadian border.

Contemporary Instances of Imperialist Destabilization Efforts in Africa: The Case of Cameroon

For the purpose of this discussion let us first look at the current situation in the West African state of Cameroon. This is a country that garners almost no news reporting in the U.S. due to what is perceived as a lack of strategic interests.

Nonetheless, over the last several months a mounting struggle across the country has paralyzed the ability of the public sector to function in an efficient manner. The Cameroon crisis is almost completely framed by corporate media reports as a conflict between the French and English speaking regions of the nation. Two provinces are dominated by those who speak English while the other eight are largely under the influence of French language and culture.

Teachers and civil servants went out on strike late last year in the English speaking provinces due to policies initiated by the government of President Paul Biya, who has been in office now for 35 years. Lawyers and legal workers objected to the imposition of French speaking judges in their court systems which created an untenable situation.

Later teachers in the English speaking provinces complained of the inadequacy of educational materials mandated by the French-oriented regime. Moreover, teachers were not being paid for their work and these factors precipitated a general strike among both educators and legal workers.

The Biya government responded by imposing draconian measures such as the termination of internet services in an attempt to make it more difficult to organize resistance. Just recently the government announced that it is reinstating connectivity to these provinces in the western region of the country.

This labor unrest eventually spread to the French speaking areas as well. Teachers in the other provinces went out on strike saying that in many cases they have not received a paycheck in as much as five years. Many teachers who graduated college and were hired as educators had not been able to collect one dime for their services.

Despite the efforts of the government and business press to frame the conflict as purely a sectional one, stripping it of its class and anti-imperialist dimensions, this has not been wholly successful. One of the leading football stars of Cameroon, the champions of the Africa Cup, openly expressed solidarity with the people of the English speaking regions of the country.

Nevertheless, how did this situation develop? Africa was subjected to imperialist divisions during the late 19th century.

There is almost no appreciation or acknowledgement of the role of Germany under Otto von Bismarck in the imperialist partitioning of the continent. The fact of the matter is the Berlin Conference was held there due to the important role of Germany in the colonial project.

In a series of three articles published recently by this writer, I have outlined the role of Germany in its genocidal and exploitative role during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Africa. These articles dealt with the demand by the Herero people of Namibia, formerly known as South West Africa, for the payment of reparations stemming from the genocide against the Namibian people during 1904-1907. Tens of thousands of Africans were slaughtered, forcibly removed from their traditional lands, starved and worked death simply because they revolted against the imposition of German colonialism in the final years of the 1800s and the first decade of the 1900s.

Also the Germans were involved in East Africa through the colonization of the area now known as Tanzania, then Tanganyika, along with Rwanda and Burundi. In Tanzania, the Maji Maji Revolt of 1905-07 against German imperialism prompted another genocidal wave of violence resulting in untold numbers of deaths through brute force, dislocation and systematic starvation. The people of Tanzania are now demanding reparations from the government in Berlin which is seeking to enhance its trade and political relationships with independent African states.

Cameroon was as well a German colony during this same period. Atrocities were committed through forced labor initiatives utilized to build railroads and agricultural commodity production. Those Africans who refused to cooperate were tortured and killed in the thousands.

All of these historical developments occurred decades prior to the holocaust in Germany, Poland and Hungary of the 1930s and 1940s under the Third Reich of Adolph Hitler. Yet the consciousness of people in the West, and even within Africa itself, is almost nil in this regard.

During the course of World War I, Germany lost all of their colonies in Africa. The imposition of the Treaty of Versailles negotiated by President Woodrow Wilson and the victorious European imperialist powers in the aftermath of the First World War did not bring peace to the globe but set the stage for the rise of fascism and the advent of World War II.

However, there has been no recognition of the colonial history of Cameroon in evaluating the contemporary political impasse. It is important to evoke the anti-imperialist and revolutionary national liberation history of Cameroon.

In the aftermath of WWII, there was a wave of anti-imperialist fervor internationally. Africa did not escape this phenomenon. The Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) sought immediate national independence during the 1950s. Having met vicious repression on the part of the French colonialists, they embarked upon an armed struggle. Consequently, the UPC was targeted for liquidation by Paris.

Two of the leading figures in the UPC, Ruben Um Nyobe and Felix Roland Moumie were assassinated. Nyobe was killed on the battlefield in 1958. Moumie was later poisoned in Switzerland by the French secret police in 1960. The political forces which became the official government after independence in the early 1960s were willing to compromise with imperialism. Although Cameroon was further divided through the independence process, officially it is not supposed to be a francophone state.

Consequently, it is important to look beyond the headlines in order to understand the post-colonial conflicts in Africa. As historical and dialectical materialists we must uncover the truth through an examination of the social forces motivating existing contradictions both within the society as well as external influences.

Trump Escalates Imperialist War in Somalia

Late last month, President Trump issued another executive order on Somalia. The essence of the initiative was to purportedly relax restrictions on carrying out aerial strikes against Al-Shabaab fighters who have been in a war with the U.S. and European Union (EU) supported government in Mogadishu.

Washington has a long history of military and intelligence interference in the internal affairs of Somalia. In the last decade, the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has engaged in targeted assassinations, training programs for the reconstructed of the Somalian National Army and the embedding of U.S. personnel within local state structures.

These policy efforts are bolstered by the presence of flotillas of warships off the coast of Somalia in the Gulf of Aden, one of the most lucrative shipping lanes in the world. The situation in Somalia manifested by the naval presence of the Pentagon and the EU in the Gulf of Aden is closely related to the imperialist war in Yemen, Syria and the entire region of West Asia.

The previous administrations of Presidents George W. Bush, Jr. and Barack Hussein Obama engaged in aggressive military and covert operations in Somalia. Since 2007, U.S. and British warplanes have staged bombing operations in various regions of the Horn of Africa state.

Therefore, the proclamation by Trump is merely a disingenuous approach to continuing the already existing war policy in the Horn of Africa. Additional Pentagon troops are being deployed to Somalia in a supposed bolstering of training operations in support of the recently-elected administration in Mogadishu.

In fact the role of the U.S. in Somalia over the last twenty five years has done more ensure that no real political settlement is achieved in the country. When any semblance of national unity and social stability is achieved it is immediately attacked by Washington. This holds true for successive Republican and Democratic administrations.

Somalia is an oil-rich nation where leading multi-national petroleum firms are engaging in drilling. Its natural resource wealth combined with the strategic waterways off the coast makes the nation an important focal point of imperialist intrigue on the African continent extending through the so-called Middle East.

Nevertheless, despite all of the natural wealth and imperialist funding of military operations, including the stationing of 22,000 African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) troops which are funded and trained by the imperialist states, the humanitarian situation in the country is worsening on a daily basis. Somalia has for nearly four decades suffered from periodic drought and famine. These problems have forced millions of its residents into neighboring states throughout Africa, the Middle East and even into Western Europe and North America.

The advent of colonialism scattered the Somalian people across five different geographic nation-states: British Somaliland, Italian Somaliland, French Somaliland, Kenya and imperial Ethiopia under the monarchy. The maintenance of the status-quo under neo-colonialism is the driving forces by the U.S. support of military intervention by neighboring states such as Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti.

Formerly French Somaliland, Djibouti, is now the largest base of the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) on the continent. This geographically and populated small Horn of Africa state houses thousands of American and French troops at Camp Lemonier serving as an imperialist base for Pentagon and CIA operations across the region including Yemen.

With all of these resources flowing in from the West and its allies, why are the people in Somalia still under extreme duress? It is largely due to the real objectives of the imperialist states which are to ensure geo-strategic dominance and the exploitation of resources and labor.

In a report issued by the Inter-regional Information Network (IRIN) of the United Nations on March 28, it says: “Six years after a famine killed a quarter of a million people in Somalia, the country is threatened with another. Famines only occur if political decision-makers allow them to; it is imperative that the right decisions are made now. But have we learnt enough from the mistakes of 2011? The context has changed since 2011. Somalia now has a functioning – if limited and fragile – state apparatus. Some of the areas worst affected by the last crisis have since received considerable resilience investment (although how far such programming has helped people prepare for or cope with the current crisis is not yet known).”

IRIN continues in this same article emphasizing: “Food security, nutrition and health are rapidly deteriorating in affected areas of the Sool Plateau in the north of Somalia and in the ‘sorghum belt’ in the south. In late 2016, the deyr rains failed in the south and the earlier gu rains were well below average, bringing national grain yields to their lowest in a decade. Predictions for the coming gu season in the affected areas are not optimistic. Food prices are rising. The purchasing power of typical households has declined by 20 percent in some areas of the north and by as much as 60 percent in the hardest-hit areas in the south – repeating the dangerous pattern seen in early 2011. Large-scale livestock deaths are already occurring. The Shabelle River, which provides irrigation water and a livestock refuge in the south, ran dry at some locations in January and remains dangerously low.”

Such as profound contradiction of increasing U.S. military involvement and deteriorating social conditions are by no means an anomaly. This is the actual history of imperialism in Africa over the last six centuries.

Prior to the rise of the Atlantic Slave Trade and colonialism, the area now known as Somalia was very much a part of the world system extending from the Far East in Asia to the Indian Ocean basin. This trading network existed for at least a thousand years and was not disrupted until the rise of Portugal and Spain as the initiators of the triangular construct leading to involuntary servitude as an economic system.

In understanding this history it is quite conceivable that the system of imperialism can be overthrown and transcended. This basis for the establishment of an alternative economic method of organizing society, the relationships between states, and the priorities of production, has been set forth through socialist ideology.

This is the reason why imperialism declared war on socialism in its infancy following the Russian Revolution (1917) and the subsequent founding of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (1922) in 1922. Both the bourgeois liberal imperialists and their fascist counterparts longed for the destruction of the Soviet Union and the national liberation movements through the rise of the Third Reich, Mussolini’s Italy, Franco’s Spain and Japanese expansionism in Asia. The breaking of the might of the Nazi military apparatus at Stalingrad and other key battles in 1942-43 has never been fully recognized by the educational modules that have achieved dominance in the U.S.

Then of course the efforts by both Italy and Germany to reclaim their imperialist ambitions during World War II led to some of the fiercest battles of the period being waged in the North Africa regions of Egypt and Libya in 1942-43. Ethiopia’s invasion by Italian imperialist fascism in 1935, are far as Africa is concerned, represented the beginning of the Second World War.

Even with the defeat of Italy and Germany in 1944-45 solidifying the resultant dominance of England, France and the U.S. did not lead to the abolition of colonialism. A Cold War beginning in 1947 was not merely designed to reverse the advances of socialism and national liberation in Vietnam, Korea and China. The Cold War represented the imperatives of the West to maintain its colonial hegemony among the immense majority of humanity in the oppressed nations of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.

In addition, the contradictions within the imperialist states themselves had reached unprecedented proportions prior to World War II. The Great Depression of the 1930s brought the capitalist system to the brink of collapse. Both the ruling classes of the U.S. and Britain were forced through their desire for mere survival to adopt the Welfare State, incorporating elements of socialist “safeguards” to protect the interests of the private ownership of capital and to ameliorate the antagonism of the nationally oppressed and the proletariat as a whole.

These dynamics on the part of imperialism are manifested in Africa through the crises in Somalia and throughout the continent in the present era. Drought and famine are spreading across the region at a rapid pace.

IRIN in this same above-mentioned report stressed: “On the other hand, the current drought is more widespread than that of 2011. Global competition for humanitarian resources is fiercer. Parts of South Sudan have already been declared to be experiencing famine, and the situation there is likely to worsen substantially over the next four to five months, while Nigeria and Yemen also face the imminent threat of famine. Across the world, a record 70 million people are estimated to need emergency food aid in 2017. Yet there are fears some donors, notably the U.S., will significantly cut their aid budget this year, including for humanitarian assistance.”

The U.S.-based corporate and government-sponsored media never asks the simple question: How is the renewed military build-up by the Pentagon in Somalia going to address the humanitarian crisis? Or what is the correlation between imperialist militarism and underdevelopment as represented by increasing poverty, dislocation, food deficits and political instability? Also what real impact does aid from the West actually have on the imperatives of self-reliance, self-determination, genuine independence and sovereignty and sustainable development?

We can only conclude based upon the actual history of Africa that what is described as “aid” is part and parcel of a reinforcement of the cycle of dependency stemming from centuries of slavery, colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism. The only real solutions must derive from the struggle of the masses against Western domination which can only be effectively realized through Pan-Africanism and Socialism in practice.

The Destabilization of South Africa, Zimbabwe and the SADC Region

Finally we must look at recent events in the sub-continent to get an even clearer insight into the African situation. The Republic of South Africa is the most industrialized state on the continent due in large part to the international division of economic power and labor.

During the 19th century, the struggle for the imperialist control of South Africa and the Southern Africa region intensified through the quest for control of its treasure trove of natural resources and arable land. The mining of gold and diamonds in South Africa and Zimbabwe thrusts these countries into the forefront of imperialist exploitation worldwide.

The complete rationalization of capitalist exploitation through the apartheid system after 1948 was by no means an aberration. This social pattern had been based on developments in the U.S. where the indigenous people were forced off of the most arable and mineral rich lands to make way for the settler-colonialists. Super-exploitation of the labor of Africans generated profits so enormous that the return on investments was unprecedented in comparison to any other period in world economic history.

A protracted struggle for national independence accelerated in the aftermath of World War II with the Rand Miners’ Strike, the development of the African National Congress Youth League Program of Action, the Defiance Campaign Against Unjust Laws, the creation of a Federation of South African Women, the advent of the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU), the Congress of Democrats, etc.

By the period between 1976 and 1994, less than two decades, the African masses and their allies were able to force the racist apartheid National Party from power. The African National Congress, which had been labelled as communist and terrorist were able to construct a government that remains in power after 23 years.

In response to the national liberation movement in South Africa, occurring in conjunction with the overall African revolutionary struggle across the continent and the broader international community, the owners of capital sought to undermine the capacity of the ANC to effectively govern the post-apartheid state. Large scale disinvestment after the advent of the national democratic government was far more significant in real terms than the divestment movement which sprung up from the 1960s through the early 1990s, targeting the settler-colonial system itself and its enablers in the imperialist countries, mainly the transnational corporations and financial institutions based in the West.

Even today a major controversy has developed over the economic trajectory of ANC government policy. Since the world recession of 2008 and beyond, the South African people have loss millions of jobs inside the country. This is due to the shrinking of manufacturing and monetary markets increasing the cost of conducting commerce and prompting the closure of plants, mines and its concomitant impact.

These developments were compounded with the reaction of capital to the demands of the working class for a greater share of the profits accrued from the exploitation of strategic minerals, commodities and manufacturing production. The legacy of radical trade unionism is South Africa has roots which extend back for the greater portion of the 20th century to the present. Without the essential role of the South African working class, the overthrow of the apartheid system could have never been achieved within the existing historical framework.

The formation of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) in 1985 placed tremendous pressure on the already beleaguered settler-colonial state and internal capitalist system which was dependent upon the investments from Wall Street, Washington and London. An organized working class union with a strong alliance with the national liberation movement and the South African Communist Party (SACP) signaled the potential for a genuine socialist construction after the demise of white minority-rule.

Since 1994, the Tripartite Alliance has been flexible and even conciliatory in its approach to the immediate need of preserving foreign capital inside South Africa. Yet this approach has not been met with reciprocity by the ruling class. Not only have the mine owners and other capitalists retrenched production facilities and markets as well as laying off many workers over the last several years, they have systematically resisted any mentioned within the public discourse of the necessity of wealth redistribution as a prerequisite for the realization of a people’s democracy.

The opposition parties which have sprung up to challenge the ANC on an electoral level are largely bankrolled by the capitalist class. The Democratic Alliance (DA) advocates policies of greater neo-liberalism which have not worked effectively anywhere in Africa or throughout the world. Another party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is led by Julius Malema who was expelled from the ANC several years ago. Although the EFF takes an ultra-left position in its rhetoric, objectively it has blocked with the DA which is in actuality a party of the white settler-class despite the Black figureheads who are ostensibly in charge of the organization.

A recent illustration of the role of international finance capital and its efforts to strangle the South African National Democratic Revolution was the revelations regarding the currency fixing carried out by some of the leading banks inside the country. This scandal is strikingly similar to the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) matter which gained considerable media coverage in years past. LIBOR was utilized to exploit working people utilizing insider information and informal negotiations to maximize the profits of these firms at the expense of the most vulnerable within capitalist society.

A report published by this writer in March says: “In South Africa, it was revealed by an anti-trust agency that during the period where residents were negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the economy fueled in part by the fluctuating value of the rand, banks were profiting from these problems. These multi-national firms represent some of the largest of such entities in South Africa and the world. The South African Competition Commission cited the following companies in relationship to the currency fixing matter: Citigroup, Nomura, Standard Bank, Investec, JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, Commerzbank AG, Standard New York Securities Inc., Macquarie Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), ANZ Banking Group Ltd, Standard Chartered Plc and Barclays Africa (Absa), part of the Barclays Plc. Investec and Barclays agreed to participate in the probe. Nonetheless, Standard Bank, BAML, Nomura, Credit Suisse, ANZ and Standard Chartered have not gone on record as to whether they will cooperate in the inquiry.” (Global Research, March 16)

This same report goes on to stress that: “These developments in South Africa and internationally illustrates that the economic system of capitalism is controlled by an ever shrinking group of financial interests who operate as a matter of policy in contravention to the majority of people not only within the western industrialized states notwithstanding throughout the world. As the African Union member-states face escalating economic difficulties a re-emergent debt crisis in looming. This burgeoning phenomenon of declining currency values and lack of credit availability portends much for the ability to strengthen both state and non-state structures in Africa. Escalating rates of poverty and lack of national and regional economic capacity will inevitably foster even greater dependency on the West and its transnational institutions.”

This is why the lessons of Zimbabwe and its land reclamation process are important. After two decades of independence from settler-colonialism, in 2000, the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) government initiated a constitutionally engineered policy of seizing and redistributing millions of acres of land which rightfully belonged to the African people. The land was illegally confiscated by Cecil Rhodes and his class of settler-colonialists. In order to carry out this process it was necessary to politically enslave the masses through a colonial system of military and economic domination. Sanctions were enacted against Zimbabwe not only by the former colonial power of Britain but also their erstwhile imperialist allies in Washington and Brussels. Zimbabwe is yet to recover from this economic war against social transformation yet the farmers are able to exercise a greater degree of self-determination and economic independence through land ownership. Studies conducted by the Institute for Development Studies in Britain confirm the positive impact of land reform which is sorely needed in South Africa and Namibia as well.

A recent summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) endorsed a regional industrialization program aimed at fostering such self-reliance and internal-centered development policy. Nonetheless, it will be a challenge in pushing forward with this process because it goes right up against the desire on the part of the former colonial and current neo-colonial powers which actively work against genuine independence and sovereignty.

Conclusion: The Need for an Anti-Imperialist Viewpoint

These examples of events on the continent bring attention to the cause of anti-imperialism in the U.S. We must be in complete solidarity with all anti-capitalist, socially progressive and socialist-oriented policy initiatives taking place in Africa.

The African states have an inherent right to shape their own governmental and societal structures free of imperialist influence. It is quite obvious that six centuries of slavery, colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism has failed to bring real development to the people. Therefore, the importance of social transformation should be a priority of all modern-day anti-imperialist and solidarity forces in North America.

1012,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Toronto keeps flooding when it rains hard. Here's why - Toronto Star,https://projects.thestar.com/climate-change-canada/toronto-flooding,"There are dozens of official water gauges, most operated by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, across the Toronto area.

When storms slip past the gauges, like the ninja storm of Aug. 7, precipitation is unknown.

On that evening, conservation authority staff were trying to assess the threat of the Black Creek, a repeat offender for flooding. The first “low level” alarm (from a water-level gauge) for Black Creek at Highway 401 arrived by text message at 8:45 p.m. But, as a debriefing report noted, the rainfall gauges showed little precipitation.

Still, Black Creek continued to rise. It peaked between 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. In 90 minutes, it would rise 3.5 metres.

Inside the elevator, where Freire and Otrin are trapped, the river water keeps rising. It is brown. Otrin watches big bugs paddling on the surface.

Unable to find a door release, Freire joins Otrin on the handrails, to keep their one cellphone dry. With no way out, no cell signal, Otrin begins smashing the escape hatch in the ceiling. His knuckles bleed. He uses the top of his head, trying to let a cell signal inside. The hatch opens a crack and Otrin shoves in Freire’s red leather journal to keep it open. Standing on the railing with water at chest level, Freire calls 911. Police and firefighters are swamped with flooding calls. Eventually, he gets through.

A few minutes after 11 p.m., when the water reaches their chins, Freire and Otrin hear voices in the basement hallway, which was filled with six feet of water, nearly reaching the top of the elevator. Two Toronto police officers heard the 911 dispatcher’s call for help. Still in uniform, they swim down the stairs into the garage hallway and use a crowbar to pry open the elevator door. Water rushes into the elevator and then sweeps them out. One officer drags Freire up the stairs until he can walk on his own.

It took months, but Otrin and Freire are ready to talk. “There almost hasn’t been a day when I don’t think of the incident to some degree … some days I think about it more deeply than others. Certainly, it changes your perception of life,” Otrin says.

“We went through a lot of recovery, adjusting, dealing with the events and self-reflection,” says Freire.

Freire and Otrin had a hard time working, focusing and sleeping. They sought help for trauma. They received calls from lawyers, but declined offers of representation to sue the building owner, who has since added a floodgate to the garage entrance and water sensors on the elevators. “He’s a good guy,” says Freire. “We decided to just move forward.”

Freire designed an elevator sensor that would detect water below and stop on a higher floor. It could be used on elevators in flood-prone areas to “save lives for less than $50 dollars worth of hardware,” Freire says. The Ontario Building Code does not require flood detection sensors on elevators, a city of Toronto spokesperson says.

Freire and Otrin looked at the drone business and questioned its impact.

Do they continue trying to build consumer drones or use their experience to find a different purpose?

The answer, Freire says, lies with clean energy to combat climate change.

They designed a drone that can fly up a wind turbine and video the unmoving blades to check for damage or necessary maintenance, collecting data which Freire says, will improve the mechanics and potentially save on electricity costs.

“I think we realized that if we were still here, we might as well do something that was meaningful.”",2019-05-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['creek', 'water', 'rains', 'heres', 'hard', 'elevators', 'gauges', 'elevator', 'keeps', 'toronto', 'freire', 'otrin', 'trying', 'flooding', 'think']",Canada,news article,English
1389,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Afghanistan and Pakistan floods: At least 160 dead and hundreds of homes destroyed amid heavy rainfall - Sky News,https://news.sky.com/story/afghanistan-and-pakistan-floods-at-least-160-dead-and-hundreds-of-homes-destroyed-amid-heavy-rainfall-12057142,"At least 70 people are dead and dozens are injured from flooding after heavy seasonal rains drenched northern and eastern Afghanistan, while 90 have died amid similarly devastating weather in neighbouring Pakistan.

In Afghanistan, the number of victims is expected to rise as rescue teams try and locate people buried under destroyed homes, according to a spokeswoman for northern Parwan province.

Wahida Shahkar said at least 66 people had been killed and 90 were injured in her province alone.

Meanwhile, in neighbouring Pakistan, the military said it would deploy rescue helicopters to the city of Karachi to transport some 200 families to safety after canal waters flooded the city during monsoon rains.

A total of 90 people have died in rain-related incidents across Pakistan since Sunday, the country's national disaster management agency said.

Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered aid to be delivered to Parwan and other provinces, while expressing his condolences to the victims' families.

Disaster management ministry spokesman Ahmad Tameem Azimi said flooding blocked highways to eastern and northern provinces, and that teams were working to reopen the roads to traffic.

He added that at least 300 houses were destroyed in Parwan and over a thousand people displaced, and that ground and air support sent to help those trapped by the flooding had reached the provinces.

Hundreds of acres of agricultural land have been destroyed, with rain wiping out crops in eastern Nuristan province.

Mr Azimi said that houses and roads were also destroyed in northern Kapisa, Panjshir and eastern Paktia provinces.

Two people died and five others were also injured in eastern Maidan Wardak province after flooding destroyed several homes there.

And in Nangarhar, located in the eastern part of Afghanistan, two members of a family died and four others were injured on Wednesday when the wall of their house collapsed in flooding.

Earlier this month, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan sent troops to help local authorities pump out rainwater from residential areas, as rains are expected to continue for the rest of the week in Karachi.

The Pakistani military said it would send out rescue helicopters when the weather cleared up.

Rescuers were unable to use boats to rescue the marooned families because of fast-moving floodwaters in the city's low-lying neighbourhoods.

Video footage showed parts of Karachi under water as troops tried to repair an embankment of a canal. Water started pouring out of the canal on Tuesday during heavy rainfall.

Help kids get back to school by repairing 50 damaged buildings and replacing lost furniture, books and toys.

Reunite separated children with their parents.

“It rained the whole day and I was returning from a class in the evening when the river was filling up the road,” she says. “My mother was at home with my baby sister and I asked her what to do. She said we would have to leave the house if the waters come.”By the evening, roads around Ishara’s house were completely submerged. They had to flee.“We went to a house on a higher ground, but water reached there, then we still climbed higher and water reached there too.” When they finally returned home days later, everything in the house was caked with mud.“The clothes, our beds, pots and pans, everything was gone with the water.

Updated on August 12: Kerala floods to remain grim, relief not in sight

Kerala floods have been continuously wreaking havoc over the state. Eight districts remain flooded and as per weathermen, rains will continue to lash the state which will only aggravate the situation in the state of Kerala.

As per reports, over 60,000 people are in relief camps across 14 districts of Kerala presently. Rajnath Singh has assesses the situation and said that the conditions are grave and all help will be provided from the centre.

The Indian Army has reconstructed a road damaged at Kochukodakallu-Machiplavu. They have also distributed food and medicines at a camp at Adimali district. So far, at least 33 people have been killed and 6 remain missing.

The flood situation does not seem to be improving anytime soon despite slight reduction in rains.

Updated on August 11 - Kerala floods: Moderate rain to continue, to intensify by Monday

The flood situation remained grim over the state of Kerala as moderate rains occurred in the last 24 hours. In fact, Punalur recorded 27 mm of rain, followed by Kozhikode 22 mm, Karipur 20 mm, Kannur and Alappuzha 18.

Further also we expect moderate rains to continue and on August 14, rainfall may increase more and may worsen the flood situation in parts of Kerala.

Updated on August 10 - Kerala Floods: Situation worsens as reservoirs continue to swell

Kerala floods refuse to take a backseat as heavy showers continue to lash the state. Heavy rainfall activity was observed during the last 24 hours as well.

The death toll which was at 20 yesterday has risen to a 26. The flood situation has gone grimmer in the past 24 hours and it does not seem like there is any relief likely.

Heavy rains did continue through the night due to which the rescue operation teams inclusive of the Indian Armed Forces, the Indian Air Force, the Indian Naval Forces as well as the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). In fact, 10 NDRF teams have been carrying out the rescue work and along with the Defence forces, the Coast Guard has also been roped in.

As per sources over 240 relief camps have been set up and more than 15 thousand people have been shifted from low-lying areas. 5,500 people from Wayanad district and 3500 from Ernakulum have been moved to relief camps.

Moreover, two more shutters of the Cheruthoni Dam have been opened once again for easing out the pressure of water on the Idukki reservoir.

The shutters opened after water levels reached to a whopping 2401 feet mark, at around 7:00 am in the morning. Due to rising water levels, 22 dams have been opened during the last few days as water levels have been on the rise. This has caused the Periyar River, the longest river in Kerala to swell.

In the last 24 hours from 8:30 am on Thursday, Punalur recorded 48 mm of rain, and Thiruvananthapuram saw 44 mm of rainfall.

Schools as well as colleges will remain shut in parts of Idukki, Wayanad, Palakkad, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Pathanamthitta, Malappuram and Kollam. In fact, due to the possibility of some showers tomorrow as well, annual Nehru boat race in Alappuzha has been postponed.

The Chief Minister of Kerala has imposed a ban on the movement of heavy goods vehicles and tourist vehicles in the high ranges of Idukki taking into account, the heavy rains over the state. PM Modi has also offered assistance to the state.

As per weathermen at Skymet Weather, rainfall activity will continue to occur over the state of Kerala for another 24 hours. However, rains will not be as intense as they were before. Thus, the situation will not see any massive improvement for at least another 24 hours.

1561,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,'The water will come back': why Kenya's struggle against flooding is far from over - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jun/02/the-water-will-come-back-why-kenyas-struggle-against-flooding-is-far-from-over,"Using a short piece of nylon line with a hook at one end and a long thin stick on the other, a mechanic and a nightclub doorman have only caught one small fish all day.

â??Iâ??ve never been a fisherman before,â? says Erick Ochieng on the edge of a flooded creek in the port city of Kisumu on the banks of Lake Victoria. â??I used to work as a bouncer but nightclubs have closed. Sometimes my family sleeps without eating.â?

As the frequency of extreme weather events increase, climate experts are warning of above normal levels of rainfall in the already saturated region in the coming months.

â??Now we donâ??t have jobs, our houses are flooded and we are living in a school,â? says Patrick Obondo, an out-of-work mechanic.

Africaâ??s largest inland body of water, Lake Victoria, which is shared by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, hit the highest level ever recorded in mid May, submerging parts of towns and whole villages on its banks â?? and water levels are still high.

â??My family go to bed hungry,â? Ochieng says. His rent is 8,000 Kenyan shillings (Â£60) a month. â??Iâ??m already two months behind.â? He is not the only one struggling; nearly 84% of Kenyaâ??s workforce is made up of informal labourers, whose families rely on money made each day to eat.

Around 233,000 people have been affected by the floods in Kenya, and more than 116,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross, after two consecutive seasons of record rains caused rivers across the country to burst their banks, devastating towns and villages.

â??The water started rising at about 6pm in the mud house and by 9pm I had to leave everything. My home and the animals on my small farm were washed away by the Nzoia River at the start of May,â? says Celine Apondi, 50, sitting in the shade of a tree in a schoolyard in Siaya county near the lake.

Apondi and her seven children survived but the Kenyan government says 237 people have died from the flooding. She is one of more than 3,000 displaced people living in Nyambare secondary school.

As well as food items, pots and pans, and thick plastic sheeting to make tents, the Kenya Red Cross is also being given face masks â?? but Apondi says social distancing is impossible.

The government closed schools in March to prevent the spread of Covid-19 but now more than 100 are home to the displaced.

Kenya has recorded 62 deaths from Covid-19 and has had 1,745 confirmed cases. Movement has been restricted in and out of Mombasa and Nairobi and a 7pm to 5am national curfew has been enforced by police using violence and teargas.

Last week President Uhuru Kenyatta said the government was distributing 250m Kenyan shillings (Â£19m) a week to vulnerable families hit by the economic crisis and 1bn shillings (Â£75m) has been set aside for flood control measures.

However, apart from Kenya Red Cross emergency handouts, people who were made homeless by the floods told the Guardian they have yet to be given any substantial government support and cannot afford to move away from living on increasingly volatile flood plains.

â??I would expect the government to resettle these people elsewhere â?? that is the only solution to this place.â? says Joseph Oyamo, a 62-year-old retired primary teacher, as he looks at an eroded river bank close to some houses near Ahero town in Kisumu county.

James Okumbe, deputy governor of Siaya county, said plans to build a dam and dykes to control river levels have been delayed. â??It could have been finished but the national government has not completed the compensation of the land owners [who need to be relocated and] live along the river banks,â? says Okumbe.

There are predictions of above normal rainfall in the region between June and September, says Mark Majodina, World Meteorological Organization representative for eastern and southern Africa.

Climate experts are reluctant to pin one weather event to global heating but there is increasing alarm at the frequency of extreme and unpredictable weather systems.

For the past decade high temperatures in the western Indian Ocean have heated the sea and moisture is absorbed into the atmosphere. That moisture is then precipitated over east Africa, says Guleid Artan, director at the Climate Prediction and Application Centre.

Artan says rainfall records were broken in the October, November and December 2019 rainy season, and a wetter than normal January and precipitation over the March, April and May rainy season have also broken records in the region.

So much rain saturates the soil that chunks of farmland have broken off Ugandaâ??s shores and created several floating islands that have clogged dams and the lakeâ??s only outlet into the Nile River.

Three villages next to the lake are now partially under water, says Owiena Hezekiah, assistant chief of Kogembo sub-location, in Homa Bay county, which also borders the lake. â??There are more mosquitoes, which cause malaria, and aggressive hippos have come inland.

â??We are worried about sanitation and cholera. People relied on pit latrines which are now overflowing with water.â?

Majodina says weather prediction data is becoming increasingly accurate and is communicated through the media to fishing communities, and to government departments. â??They donâ??t sit on the relevant information, they act, but people are still resisting,â? says Majodina.

People are reluctant to leave their homes, and think someone is going to take their belongings, he adds. â??One needs to look at how you compensate people. Is there some sort of insurance you can give people once they leave [their homes]?â?

â??I had to walk for three kilometres to safety with the water around my neck,â? says farmer James Yogo, 27, at an emergency distribution at a school in Kisumu county.

â??There was a child from the area who died from the water,â? adds Yogo. â??Some people climbed trees and sat on roofs. My house has collapsed. No one came to help.â?

â??Itâ??s just climate change,â? Yogo says. â??Iâ??m reluctant to replant my crops as I know the water will come back â?? but there are no jobs and I have no choice, Iâ??ll have to start again.â?",2020-06-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['lake', 'banks', 'weather', 'kenyas', 'river', 'photograph', 'ed', 'struggle', 'county', 'water', 'kenya', 'flooding', 'far', 'living', 'come']",Kenya,news article,English

* Strict quarantine measures extended by at least a week

* Philippines logs its second-highest daily Covid-19 cases

* Hospitals in the capital reach critical capacity

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has extended a strict lockdown in the capital region and adjacent provinces by at least one week to try to contain a renewed surge in coronavirus infections, his spokesman said on Saturday.

The Philippines, which has the second-highest Covid-19 cases and deaths in Southeast Asia, reported 12,576 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, putting further strain on the healthcare system.

Restrictions, which include a ban on non-essential movement, mass gatherings and dining in restaurants, will remain for at least another week, Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said in a televised announcement. The measures had been set to end on April 4.

""This will go with intensified prevention, detection, isolation, tracing and rehabilitation that we will monitor on a daily basis,"" Roque said.

Active cases in the country have hit a record 165,715, 96% of which were mild, health ministry data showed.

But intensive care capacity in the capital region's hospitals have reached a critical level, with 80% of beds utilised and many hospitals being forced to turn away patients.

The congested capital region, an urban sprawl of 16 cities home to at least 13 million people, accounts for two-fifths of the country's 784,043 confirmed cases and a third of the total 13,423 deaths. A University of the Philippines research team on Saturday called for a speedy construction of isolation facilities to prevent infections spreading through households.

Extended coronavirus curbs will continue to hurt the Philippines' economy, which posted a record 9.5% slump last year.

The Philippines has so far inoculated nearly 739,000 people. This is just 1% of its target of vaccinating 70 million of its 108 million population to achieve herd immunity and safely reopen the economy.",2021-04-03 12:01:00+00:00,"['duterte', 'strict', 'provinces', 'nearby', 'spokesman', 'week', 'hospitals', 'philippines', 'coronavirus', 'capital', 'million', 'infections', 'curbs', 'cases', 'extends']",India,news article,English

Raini village is settled on two mountains separated by the river Rishiganga, which meets river Dhauliganga.

Sunday’s landslide washed away a concrete bridge connecting the two villages, snapping road connectivity and forcing the government to press helicopters into service to deliver food supplies.

“This is Raini Chak Subhai and across the river is Raini Chak Lata,” Chander Singh, a local resident, told DH.

Besides the concrete bridge, four cable-stayed bridges – a common feature in these mountain ranges – were also damaged.

""Raini Chak Lata, Pang, Suki, Bhallagaon, Suraithota, Tolma, Long Segdi (Tamak) and Jumma –located across the river Rishiganga have lost road connectivity, Sher Singh Butola, Assistant Commandant, First Battalion,"" ITBP said.

Villages Jugju, Juwagwad, Bhanyal, Gahar and Aira across the river Dhuliganga too have no road connectivity.

Several installations of the Army, ITBP and Border Roads Organisations too are located across the two rivers and currently have no road connectivity.

“We have pressed helicopters into service and they have been evacuating those requiring medical help and airdropping food supplies,” Butola said.

Chetan Rana and his brother Ravi cannot attend school as it is located across the river in Raini Chak Lata.

“It has been a few days that we had resumed school after the closure due to coronavirus,” Ravi said pointing to the remnants of the bridge that was the sole connectivity across the river.

A house located on the edge of the road too was washed away, locals said.

Anama, home to 14,000 people on a tributary of the Solimoes River that flows toward capital Manaus, is just one municipality of dozens in Amazonas state that has seen life upended by unusual rainfall.

Amazonas’s civil defense secretariat on Thursday warned the flood could soon be biggest recorded in the last century, and said 350,000 people have already been affected.

As the river continues rising, the sound of power saws in Anama is constant as residents cut boards and beams to build rudimentary scaffolding within their homes. It’s a race to stay above the water’s surface. Motorcycles are stored atop the wood, too.

“What we’re living isn’t good. The flood is here, in this home,” said Luzia Santiago da Costa, a 62-year-old homemaker. Her knee problems mean she keeps her eyes focused on her steps while balancing atop the wood and moving slowly through her home.

Raimundo Sampaio Sobreira, 63, said his floor is now so high that he’s begun hitting his head on the ceiling.

“We are accustomed here, but this is going beyond the limits,” Sobreira said.

Twenty of Amazonas’ municipalities are in a situation of emergency, and 22 have rivers spilling over their banks, according to the secretariat's statement on Thursday. The latter group includes capital Manaus, where people have built makeshift bridges.

The Negro River, which flows past Manaus to meet the Solimoes River, could reach its highest-ever level within days, the state’s government said this week.

Increased precipitation is associated with the La Nina phenomenon, by which cooler-than-normal sea-surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean impact global weather patterns.

Several areas of Vietnam hit by the worst floods in decades. In the last month, torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing, and created hardship for 240 thousand families. Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs mobilized. The strengthening of relations between the two countries can be linked to the US's anti-Beijing strategies.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) - Taiwan has donated 400,000 US dollars in aid to Vietnam to support the local population, hit by the worst floods and landslides in decades. In the past two weeks, storms no. 6 and 7 have caused serious damage in the central-northern provinces of H Tinh, Qu?ng Bnh, Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thin-Hu? and in the central-southern ones  N?ng, Qu?ng Nam, Qu?ng Ngi, Bnh ?nh and Ph Yn.

The Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention reports that torrential rains have caused 113 deaths and 20 missing since late September. River levels have risen rapidly in central areas of Vietnam, flooding 212 municipalities inhabited by 240 thousand families.

Many communities are isolated; at the moment in the devastated areas it is possible to move mostly with small boats. Victims are in immediate need of food, bottled water, medicine, clothing, blankets and books.

At the end of the emergency, money will be needed for reconstruction, especially seeds and agricultural machinery. Many Vietnamese have mobilized to support the flood victims. Groups of young people, including Catholics, brought rice, spaghetti (noodles) and drinking water to the most remote flooded areas.

Richard Shih, Taiwanese representative in Hanoi, said that Taiwanese entrepreneurs and NGOs operating in Vietnam have mobilized and sent aid to disaster areas. He hopes the victims can rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon.

The aid delivery ceremony took place on 23 October in the presence of Tr?n Quang Hoi, director of the Vietnamese agency for the management of natural disasters. The Hanoi representative thanked the generosity of the government and the people of Taiwan, stressing that the distribution of aid will start as soon as possible.

The Taiwanese authorities highlighted the strong ties that unite their country to Vietnam. More than 320,000 Vietnamese migrants live and work in Taiwan; Taipei is Hanoi's seventh trading partner, with a turnover of 13.5 billion euros in 2019.

Torrential rains have triggered devastating floods and landslides across East Africa in recent weeks, aggravating an already challenging situation as countries in the region battle the coronavirus pandemic.

The destruction caused by the heavy rainfall has killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and has also forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.

This week, officials in Kenya and Rwanda said nearly 200 and 65 people had died in both countries, respectively, with floodwaters and mudslides destroying houses, washing away bridges and straining critical infrastructure.

On Saturday, Kenyan and Uganda suffered nationwide electricity outages, leaving tens of millions of people without power.

Health experts are worried about the implications of the flooding on the countries’ response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

Floodwaters also recently swept away most parts of an entire small town in Somalia and swept away roads, bridges and a hospital in Uganda.

Heavy rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in western Uganda after Nyamwamba River burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, according to officials.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance, but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, was quoted as saying by the Reuters News Agency.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also washed away despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

The Somali region in eastern Ethiopia has also been hard hit by the floods, with more than 100,000 people displaced, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Meanwhile, an unspecified number of people were killed in the semi-autonomous Puntland region in Somalia when flash floods swept away most buildings in Qardho town, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, said Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Kenyatta University in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

The floods are coming as swarms of locusts are wreaking havoc across East Africa where millions of people struggle for food.

Billions of desert locusts have already chomped their way through Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan and Uganda.

1472,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Uganda: Living Dangerously - the Plight of Ntoroko Flood-Affected Families - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202104140086.html,"More than 150 families, part of the 10,000 people who were displaced by the floods two years ago after water levels in Lake Albert rose, are living in a dire condition.

The lives of many locals who have gathered in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District near Lake Albert, are being threatened since the temporal houses erected in water are on the verge of collapsing. The families are also in dire need of food and other essential basic needs.

The unstable houses, made of iron sheets, and reeds are being held by timber poles erected in water, some of which are rotting away and can no longer hold their weight.

Mr Justice Kabagambe,46, a resident of Kamuga Village in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District, one of the affected people, in April last year erected a temporary house above the water after his house that is a few metres away from the shores of Lake Albert, was submerged by floods.

Following the incident, he joined another family whose house was submerged days later. ""I decided to build a temporary four-room house where I am staying with my family,"" he said.

""The family is not sure of a single meal in a day but we get support from friends and well-wishers. My house is not stable and it shakes whenever it gets windy, especially at night, we fear it may collapse,"" Mr Kabagambe added.

Mr Kabagambe's house is surrounded by 40 others in the same condition. The houses are hard to access and one has to use a boat as a means of transport to visit friends and family members settled away from the flooded area. Similarly, food and other requirements are transported by boat from the dry areas. The operators of the few available boats demand a fee for their services.

There are a few makeshift shops built above the flooded areas. Mr Kabagambe's family is forced to keep indoors since they have no compound.

The communities also lack clean water for domestic use and are forced to draw contaminated water from the lake.

The families lack toilets too and are forced to defecate in the water. ""We use the same water to ease ourselves since our toilets and tap stands were submerged,"" Mr Kabagambe said.

His plight is shared by more than 150 families who have found shelter above the water.

The sub-counties that are mostly affected include Kamuga, Kachwakumu and Rwangara. The affected families are, however, holding on to hope that the government will come to their rescue.

Those who were displaced in 2019 and later in 2020, were first sheltered in nearby schools of Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu, which were later submerged. The floods left homes, shops, schools, gardens and health facilities submerged.

Last year when the State minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Mr Musa Ecweru, and other officials visited the area, local leaders requested government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

Current situation

The chairperson of Kachwakumu Village, Mr Rwaheru Byaruhanga, said while some people sought refuge with friends and family, others have nowhere to go.

He said more than 200,000 houses are still submerged and only rooftops are seen floating on top of water. ""People spend days indoors and school-going children have not reported to school because their schools were submerged. Our people have also risked their lives because any time, these makeshift houses may collapse. They will also contract disease because they use contaminated water,"" Mr Byaruhanga said.

Lack of food

Ntoroko District's main economic activity is fishing and cattle keeping. The livelihood of locals was greatly hit since the floods affected livestock farming.

Accessing health centres is also a big challenge and they have to hire boats to reach Butungama or Rwebisengo sub-county for medical service. The nearby Rwangara Health Centre III was submerged.

Dr James Kato, the officer-in-charge of Rwebisengo Health Centre III, said they have to travel long distances to pick drugs.

Mr Byaruhanga said since 2019, they have been requesting the government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

The chairperson of Kanara Sub-county, Mr Friday Mugiisa, said they have never received any relief food.

""People who are stuck in floods have no food to eat and they have been depending on fish. Last month, the UPDF fishing unit on Lake Albert destroyed all boats after accusing our people of illegal fishing,"" Ms Mugiisa said.

The Ntoroko County Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, last year told Daily Monitor that the government had promised to relocate the displaced people and settle them at Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. This has not been fulfilled.

""The acres they are talking about are not enough, but sadly, they haven't been availed to the people,"" he said.

The acting chairperson of Ntoroko District, Mr Ben Muthahinga, said they recently received some relief items such as beans, posho and blankets from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), which they want to distribute to displaced people.

He said last week, the Minister for Tourism, Mr Tom Butiime, was in the area to discuss the relocation plan.

Mr Butiime confirmed that he visited Rwebisengo Town Council and held a meeting with local leaders and they agreed that Uganda Wildlife Authority reduces the restrictions on cattle keepers so that they can graze their animals in certain parts of the park.

He said the restrictions will only be applicable for farmers who have cattle but not for people who want to construct shelters in the park.

The Tourism boss also said the affected locals are being registered by the sub-county chief and they will soon be allowed to graze in the park.

567,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Ghana: Work On U.S.$475 Million Takoradi Port Multi-Purpose Terminal Begins - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201908070180.html,"Ghana's quest to become a trans-shipment hub in West Africa has received a major boost as construction works on the development of the multi-purpose Atlantic Terminal Services on-dock facility at the Takoradi Port has commenced.

This followed the laying of the first block to signify the commencement of the first phase of the project held at the Tarkoradi Port on Friday.

The first phase will involve the construction of a 600-metre quay wall with pavement alongside it, coupled with dredging besides it from 14 metres to 16 metres deep.

The 475 million dollars project is a joint venture between Ibistek, an indigenous company and the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GHPA) under a concession agreement signed between the two in 2017.

Royal Haskoning DHV is providing the technical advice and support in relation to all aspects of the project which includes the management of all procurement processes for the EPC contract, supporting all the necessary environmental assessment and plans for the project.

Speaking in an interview with the media after the first block laying ceremony Mr Kwame Gyan, Chairman, Ibistek described the commencement of the project as historic as it was the first time in the nation's history that a local company was undertaking a project of this magnitude.

He said it was an indication that local companies were building their capacity to play a major role in the country's development.

""This is the first time the locals are building and operating a deep sea port and we think that the capacity we have developed from project inception through execution shows our capability. Down the road we will end up in the West African sub region,"" he said.

Mr Gyan said: ""We are happy we have all joined hands to witness the casting of the first block for this milestone project. This means a lot for this port of Takoradi, the Western Region and the Republic of Ghana, container numbers will be boosted, employment will be boosted, and revenue will be boosted. The will be cash in the pocket of those who live in this corridor, transit trade will be boosted and Ghana's economy will b e boosted so we are extremely privileged to be part of this,"" he said.

He said phase one of the project which would cost 200 million dollars was expected to be completed in two years.

He said AFC of Nigeria was providing the debt component of the finance and Ibistek was providing the equity.

""This port will be ready with all the facilities of a first class and then we continue from phase two to extend the key length from 600 miters to 1,495 metres so we are in it for the long haul. We know that by the grace of God we will get there,"" he said.

Capt Ebenezer Kojo Afadzi, Director, Takoradi Port said: ""With the coming in of this container multipurpose terminal, with the depth of 16 metres we hope that we will be able to get to about 200,000 the first year and hope I will be able to compete with other ports in West Africa.""

He said he was happy that a local company was undertaking the project which would transform the Takoradi Port.

""We have given the Ghanaian the chance, let's all support them to deliver, this is what port of Takoradi will do, we will support them to deliver,"" he said.

Satellite image ©2020 Maxar Technologies via REUTERS

CAIRO – 18 March 2021: Ethiopia has shown, through its latest statements on the rules of filling and operating the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), its intention to impose a fait accompli on the Nile downstream countries (Egypt and Sudan), said Egyptian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Ahmed Hafez in a statement on Thursday.

On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the inauguration of the GERD in a symposium in Addis Ababa on Wednesday, the Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs that his country is proceeding with the second phase of filing the controversial dam’s reservoir due in July 2021 although the three countries did not reach a legal and binding agreement on the dam operation and filling the dam.

“Completing the flagship project is a matter of assuring the sovereignty of the country,” said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, H.E. Demeke Mekonnen during the symposium.

""Egypt voiced its rejection of the Ethiopian statements because of the threat it poses to the interests of the Egyptian and Sudanese peoples and the impact of such unilateral measures on security and stability in the region,"" Hafez said.

“Ethiopian officials use the language of sovereignty in their talks about exploiting the resources of a cross-border river,” Hafez said, adding “it is impermissible to extend sovereignty over them [cross border rivers] or seek to monopolize them.”

The natural resources should be fairly shared on the basis of the rules of international law, without causing harm to any party, he added.

The Ethiopian statements reflect the absence of political desire in negotiation in time during which the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the current leader of the African Union, is making appreciable efforts to relaunch the path of negotiations and reach an agreement before the next season of the flood.

“Egypt and Sudan emphasized the importance of an active involvement of the international community in negotiations led and conducted by the Democratic Republic of the Congo through an international quartet that includes the United States, the European Union and the United Nations, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the negotiation process and to push the three countries and help them reach an agreement on the Renaissance Dam in the coming months,” he said.

However, Ethiopia’s Foreign Ministry said two days ago that they haven’t received an official proposal to form a quartet committee that includes the European Union, the United Nations, the United States and the African Union to mediate the talks.

Ethiopia’s Foreign Ministry also informed Congo delegation earlier this week that they ‘reject the quartet mediation proposal’ and that other parties cannot be involved in the Renaissance Dam negotiations.

Egypt and Sudan have voiced their concern about the possible harms and threats of the GERD and how the dam will negatively after their water share of the Nile in case Ethiopia abstained from signing a binding and legal agreement on the dam operation and filling its reservoir.

Early March, 2021, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi made a one-day visit to Sudan, during which he and the Sudanese leaders have affirmed rejection to Ethiopia’s unilateral plans to implement the second phase of the GERD filling whether or not an agreement among the three countries is reached.

Ethiopia has frequently affirmed it would implement the second filling of the dam next July under any circumstances.

Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel-Atti has said previously hat Sudan worried because of what happened last year when Ethiopia began filling the dam reservoir without notifying Sudan, adding that Sudan was negatively affected.

In mid-July 2020, Ethiopian authorities unilaterally carried out the first phase of the filling process with 4.9 billion cubic meters; and it is expected that the second phase of the filling would reach 13 billion cubic meters in July.

The dispute among Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia dates back to May 2011 when Ethiopia started building the dam; Egypt voiced concern over its water share [55.5 billion cubic meters].

As Democratic Congo is chairing the AU for the year 2021, it is attempting to revive stalling negotiations between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. However, few hours before Sisi’s official visit to Sudan, Ethiopian Minister of Water, Irrigation and Energy Seleshi Bekele said on Thursday that his country is looking forward to a “win-win solution” for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam through trilateral negotiation.

Bekele’s remarks came after he hosted a delegation from the Democratic Republic of Congo to discuss the ongoing negotiations with Egypt and Sudan to reach a deal on GERD.

In 2015, the three countries signed the Declaration of Principles, per which the downstream countries should not be negatively affected by the construction of the dam.

In October 2019, Egypt blamed Addis Ababa for hindering a final agreement concerning a technical problem, calling for activating Article No. 10 of the Declaration of Principles, which stipulates that if the three countries could not find a solution to these disputes, they have to ask for mediation.

Washington had brokered tripartite negotiations among the three countries, in the presence of the President of the World Bank (WB) starting from November 6, 2019 until February 27 and 28, 2020.

During these rounds of talks, tangible outcomes were agreed on among the three parties concerning the rules and mechanism of operating the dam and the filling process of the reservoir during drought and prolonged drought; however, an agreement was not sealed.

Constructions in the Grand Renaissance Dam started on April 2, 2011 at a cost of $4.8 billion. The dam is located on the Blue Nile with a capacity of 74 billion cubic meters and is expected to generate up to 6,000 megawatts of power.",2021-03-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['egypt', 'ethiopia', 'agreement', 'downstream', 'sudan', 'nile', 'fait', 'countries', 'ethiopian', 'reach', 'renaissance', 'dam', 'accompli', 'imposes', 'filling']",Egypt,news article,English
704,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Man City CEO Gary Cook resigns over offensive email claims - Firstpost,http://www.firstpost.com/fwire/man-city-ceo-gary-cook-resigns-over-offensive-email-claims-80505.html,"Cook on Friday acknowledged an 'error of judgment' and said his resignation was 'in the best interests of the football club.'

London: Manchester City chief executive Garry Cook resigned on Friday after he was investigated by the Abu Dhabi-owned club for emailing a player's mother ridiculing her cancer.

Defender Nedum Onuoha's mother received a message sent accidentally by Cook which mocked her use of the phrase ""ravaged with it"" in the original email about her cancer treatment.

While Anthonia Onuoha received the reply, it was addressed to ""Brian."" City's football administrator Brian Marwood was also among the recipients of the woman's original email, which dealt with her son's contract.

Cook on Friday acknowledged an ""error of judgment"" and said his resignation was ""in the best interests of the football club.""

Although the email was sent in October 2010, Anthonia Onuoha only complained to City and English footballing authorities early this week.

The Sun newspaper, which received the email exchange from Onuoha, initially reported that Cook denied sending the email and said his email account had been hacked.

But City's board investigated her complaint and found the allegations were with ""foundation,"" a club statement said.

""Garry Cook has offered his resignation, which has been accepted with regret by the board,"" City said on its website.

Cook was president of Nike's Jordan Brand until leaving the sportswear company after 19 years in 2008 to take the top job at Manchester City. Within months, he oversaw the sale of the club by former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra to Abu Dhabi's Sheik Mansour, who has invested more than $1 billion to transform the team.

A 35-year trophy drought ended in May when City won the FA Cup while Roberto Mancini's side qualified for the Champions League for the first time.

""I am privileged to have held my position at Manchester City Football Club and to have experienced the opportunities that it has presented,"" Cook said on City's website. ""The privilege is in part offset however by the significant personal focus which has at times, detracted from the magnificent achievements of those working at the football club.""

""It is that factor, together with my error of judgment in this matter that has prompted me to reach this decision, which I believe is in the best interests of the football club.""

With support from other partners, the Ghana chapter of Plan International (Plan International Ghana), a child and gender-based charity, has been running a five-year program to promote school enrollment in poor and deprived communities, its Country Director Solomon Tesfamariam said.

The Reaching and Teaching Out of School Children is a five-year program spanning from 2015 to 2020, aiming to enroll 90,000 out-of-school children from five regions.

The project advocates that partners at the national and district levels urgently address a lack of schools in communities where there were none.

Available data indicate that Ghana’s school enrollment rate stood at 84 percent by 2013.

“The project will enroll boys and girls in the beneficiary regions through the Complementary Basic Education, and transition 70 percent of the graduates to formal primary schools,” Tesfamariam said at the One Day West African Corporate Social Responsibility Conference.

He said the program ultimately aims at ensuring universal school enrollment in the West African country where education accounts for about 23 percent of annual state expenditure.",2019-07-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['west', '90000', 'enrollment', 'children', 'school', 'support', 'project', 'schools', 'country', 'gets', 'send', 'ghana', 'program', 'tesfamariam']",Ghana,news article,English

The lobby firm, Patton Boggs LLP, has submitted its registration with the US Senate for lobbying on behalf of ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), shows the Congressional records of lobbying disclosure reports.

The current and anticipated 'specific lobbying issues' on which Patton Boggs would work for OVL are ""issues related to ONGC Videsh oil and gas operations in India and future focus on US oil and gas market"", says its registration filing submitted to the Senate's lobbying database on April 4.

The firm has named two persons, Anurag Varma and Daniel Waltz, who would work as lobbyists for its client, OVL.

Late last year, another energy major from India, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) terminated its registration for lobbying activities in the US. Prior to that, Mukesh Ambani-led RIL had lobbied for years in the US through its then lobby firm, BGR.

BGR also lobbies on behalf of the Indian government in the US, but it has not yet made its disclosure for the first quarter of 2013.

OVL's lobby firm Patton Boggs has worked for clients like Lloyd's of London, Halliburton, AO Smith Corp, Air France - KLM, Amazon.Com, Bristol Myers Squibb, EADS North America and Facebook.

For ONGC Videsh, the primary business is to prospect for oil and gas acreages abroad, which includes acquisition of oil and gas fields in foreign countries as well as exploration, production, transportation and sale of oil and gas.

OVL earlier used to operate on a small scale to carry out limited exploration activities in few countries like Iraq, Yemen, Sri Lanka and Tanzania, but it started expanding in a major way from late 1990s with overseas acquisitions and exploration activities.

Currently, it has presence in 27 projects in 14 countries of which 9 projects are operated by OVL, 7 projects are jointly operated and 12 projects are non-operated.

Earlier this year, another Indian firm, Devas Multimedia, also filed its lobbying registration with the Senate and it intends to lobby on ""trade and investment issues related to India"".

Among others, Sterling Biotech has disclosed having spent $20,000 on its lobbying in the US during the first quarter of 2013, while software industry body Nasscom has incurred lobbying expenses of $30,000 for the same period.

Wildlife suffered a huge loss as 90 per cent of the Kaziranga National Park was submerged in water

After the flood, even as the water level receded, citizens struggled with the after-effects of what it had done

Assam witnessed its worst flood scenario in decades recently. Unlike previous years, this time the flood affected all 33 districts of the state which also includes two hill districts of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong. More than 80 people lost their lives whereas loss of property amounted to crores.

The Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, witnessed the worst in its recorded history. The wildlife suffered a huge loss as 90 percent of the park was submerged in water, with the only silver lining being that the floods have historically led to renewal of the plant ecology in the park. Now, as with the worst of the flood situation having come to an end, waters have receded, but the plight continues especially for the poor farmers and those living close to the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. Due to heavy silt deposit during the floods, much of the agricultural land is now almost useless, not fit for any cultivation. In some places the situation is so bad that one to two feet of silt have covered the plots.

In a remote char (small river island) of Dhekiajuli, Siraj Ali, a farmer Republic spoke to lost all his lifetime savings. He invested around Rs 5 lakh to cultivate corn this year. The cultivation was good. But the sudden flood washed away his corn field. Helpless, he now has no door to knock on as it was not insured.

""I'm devastated. I'm looking towards the government now,"" said Siraj.

Many farmers in Assam never insure their crops, mostly because of lack of awareness. Another major threat for the people living near the Brahmaputra and its tributaries is posed by erosion. Every year lakhs of hectares of land are being gulped by the rivers. Erosion has been a major threat to the state since a long time. But so far no concrete solutions have been formulated to solve this issue once and for all. Be it Rohmoria in Dibrugarh, Ghunahuti in Lakhimpur, Lahorighat in Morigaon, Binapara in Dhubri by the Brahmaputra or Kachubari in Karimganj by Longai, Nandigram in Silchar by Barak, across Assam the scenario is very grim.

People living in flooded areas or water lodged conditions are at risk of suffering from waterborne diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, etc.

KALAKI - Rising water levels on Lake Kyoga have ravaged three sub-counties in Kalaki district, leaving over 1,400 people helpless.

Scores of residents have fled their homes for safety. Some stay with relatives, while others have rented small units in trading centres.

The LC1 chairperson of Akura village in Kakure sub-county, Kalaki district, Charles Ochung, said the water levels started rising five months ago, but residents did not take it seriously.

Ochung said the most affected sub-counties are Kalaki, Bululu and Kakure.

Florence Engoru, a resident of Akura village, said the rising waters have paralysed transport since roads have been cut off.

Engoru said children in candidate classes from the affected sub-counties were finding it hard to access schools and are worried about how they will sit their examinations.

Engoru said she realised earlier that water levels were going up and left the village before the situation could get worse.

Those who remained behind are now crying out for assistance to be evacuated as more homes get submerged.

52,DR-2014-000109-CHN,SWOT analysis Dutch onion sector - FreshPlaza,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/2125195/swot-analysis-dutch-onion-sector/,"The Dutch onion chain is in good shape. Thanks to the combination of the highest yield per hectare in the world and the lowest cultivation, processing and transport costs, the Netherlands is a leader when it comes to export. Furthermore, the sector, which is often cyclical in terms of production and price development, seems a bit more stable than before. The onion acreage is bigger than ever this year, with over 30,000 hectares. The acreage went up last year as well, while prices for growers remained at a higher level this past season than in the previous season. The cultivated area for seed and planted onions has gone up in the 2014/2015 season, which just started, by 20%, the area for sown onions grew by 2%. While the number of agriculture companies is going down fast, and arable farming is also seeing a downward trend, the number of companies cultivating onions is increasing. The new season, thanks to favourable growing conditions, seems to start with high volumes of good quality. For this reason, price volatility is looming. Prices will normally be lower than in the past two years, because of supplies. This could put returns under pressure, but does offer a further stimulus for export growth to more and more markets. 90% of the Dutch onion production is already being exported. There are other opportunities for the onion chain in the area of technological innovation and quality guarantees.





Currently, there are 3,590 onion companies: 2,870 are dealing with sown onions, 950 with seed and planted onions. A part of the agricultural companies is active in both sown and planted onions. The number of sown onion growers increased by 1% compared to 2013, that of planted onion growers by no less than 15%. That brings the number of planted onion growers back to 2003 levels. These companies hope to take advantage of the early end of the 2013/24 trade season (running from July until June), and the favourable growing weather in spring. Because of this, the first planted onions could be harvested extra early. The number of agriculture companies has gone down by 47% since 2000, the number of seed onion companies by only 3%. The number of seed and planted onion growers has gone down by 15% in this period. The scale of agricultural companies saw a huge increase, of more than 50%. The average onion acreage per company even increased by 66%: from 5.3 hectares per company in 2000 to 7.8 ha now. Of the total onion acreage of 30,240 hectares, 22,390 hectares consists of sown onions, and 7,440 hectares of seed and planted onions (and 420 hectares of pearl onions). Both acreages are seeing a growing trend (figure 1 and 2).



Below charts in Dutch:







There are limits to the growth of the onion acreage, however: a responsible agricultural enterprise is allowed to grow onions on 1/8th of its acreage maximum. The necessity of crop rotation in the cultivation plan (optimum land use is essential) is an important natural reason for this. On the other hand, the farmer will spread out (financial) risks through variation in the cultivated area for onions. By switching between contract cultivation with fixed prices or a free, more speculative cultivation, an onion grower can also adjust their own measure of risk appetite.



Netherlands global player on onion market

The most important onion production countries are China (share of over 30%) and India. The Netherlands, with a production of around 1.3 billion kilogram (average of the past five years) and a share of around 2%, falls just outside the top ten. Production has seen a growing trend: in 1980, production was 300 million kilos. The production growth completely benefited the export.





Now, around 90% of production is exported in the Netherlands, worldwide that's 10% at most. With an export share of around 20%, the Netherlands is, after India, the biggest onion exporter in the world, and for yellow onions the country has even been the number 1 for over forty years. India has overtaken it thanks to the strong position in red onions and shallots. China, the United States, Mexico and Spain follow on the export ranking, on places three to six.



Below, the most important strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the onion grower are named.



Strength of the sector: Highest yield plus lowest cultivation, processing and transport costs in the world



That the Netherlands is still, despite a small production share, a dominant player in the global market is - apart from the thoroughbred entrepreneurship and being a notoriously reliable trade partner - a consequence of the advantages the country has when it comes to the chain, logistics and strategic position.



High product yields An onion is the vegetable that uses the most water. There is more than enough of that in the Netherlands. Partly for that reason, the annual yield per hectare is the highest in the world, and, moreover, structurally increasing: in good years, 60 to 80, and in some acreages, even over 100 tonnes gross per hectare. This is partly because of the ideal day length in the growing season. In addition, the onions can be grown and conserved year-round. When it comes to the breeding of onions, the Netherlands is also a leader.

Efficient chain The onion sector is known as an efficient chain. There are over 3,500 growers, 50 packagers/sorters at most, and around 200 exporters. In some cases, there's a commission agent between grower and packager. Only in the Netherlands, growers and sorting companies are separated. Abroad, there are no free onion growers. Dutch growers are too small to invest in sorting and packing machines on their own. That's done by the packing plants. For that reason, nowhere in the world are sorters so specialized and cheap.

Port logistics For both onion growth and onion trade, the Netherlands has the right strategical location by nature. Nowhere are costs for transport logistics of onions - packing costs excluded - so low as in the Netherlands: from grower to packing plant and from packager to port, both are € 0.01 per kg. Global market leader Wiskerke Onions drives the onions from the packing plant in Kruiningen in Zeeland, to the Maersk depot in Vlissingen. From there, each day three feeders with containers sail for the port of Rotterdam. The ports of Antwerp and Bergen op Zoom are also nearby for the packing plants in Zeeland and Flevoland. To compare: Pasco Onions from Texas in the US has to go to Seattle first for transport by sea (800 km round trip). From Rotterdam, the onions are transported by container ship to, for instance, export destination Senegal, where they can be preserved and eaten for up to two months. Transport by ship from Rotterdam to Dakar, Brazil or Asia is cheaper than road transport to Paris, for instance. With sea transport to Asia, onion exporters fill up the containers that sailed with onions from China and the like to Rotterdam. This way, they won't have to return empty, and transport costs are kept relatively low: about a third of the cost from East to West.

Weakness of the sector: imbalance in chain and weather and seasonal dependence

Imbalances in the chain The chain power lies mostly with the (agency) exporters and retail. In addition, around 20 of the, at most, 50 wholesalers and sorters, control the market. The heavily competing onion growers are largely dependent on them. Apart from that, they're largely dependent on price developments determined by weather and seasonal influences. Due to the already wafer thin margins, that makes onion growers extra vulnerable. They can choose to store onions longer, and so speculate on higher prices with later delivery in the season, or otherwise for the certainty of fixed prices in contract cultivation.

Large price differences per season A quantitatively and qualitatively good or bad harvest is a big factor in yields for the onion grower. Figure 3 shows that bigger harvests lead to lower prices. The record harvest in 2011 led to very bad prices in the 2011/2012 trade season. However, the severe winter of 2013 caused a smaller harvest that year, leading to lower yields in the past season (figure 3). Positive, however, is that the production and yields show a growing trend (figure 4). 2011/2012 was a negative outlier for trade prices, and more bad years will undoubtedly follow, but four of the five last years were above average when it comes to yields. In addition, export prospects remain positive.





Also for onion traders, revenue can strongly vary due to price fluctuations during the season and between the various years. For them, risk spreading is a must, for instance through planned purchasing. All sorts of combinations are possible: purchases can be made at a fixed price, partly at minimum price or even under the cost price or at bale prices (including tare), for instance with an amount of small (very early), medium and large onions. The WUR is currently researching opportunities for a futures market for onions, given the importance of risk spreading.

The WUR is currently researching opportunities for a futures market for onions, given the importance of risk spreading.



Opportunities mainly by reaching new markets and technological innovation



The Dutch market is saturated, so the opportunities are mainly found abroad. The world population is growing by nearly 200 million people per year, various sales markets in Asia and Africa are becoming wealthier, and the average human being eats 7.5 to 8 kilos of onions per year. These are favourable factors for the Dutch onion sector, a sector which is already heavily focused on export, and which saw the export volume increase by around 75% during the past 15 years.



The trend toward more extreme weather conditions, appears to lead to more failed harvests or even a definitive end to onion cultivation elsewhere in the world. The Netherlands is well able to 'fill such gaps' and benefit from sales prices, which are going up as a result. An example from the past is the food riots regarding onions, which occurred in Latin America, or the fact that onion cultivation has stopped in Israel, due to the water problem (shortage and salinity) there. The Dutch onion chain benefits from this, because Israel is now importing its onions from the Netherlands.







Continuing to develop new markets worldwide

In the 2012/13 onion season, for the first time over 1 million tonnes of onions were exported. In the 2013/14 season, the export was 959,00 tonnes because of a lower harvest. Onion growers are successful in expanding the number of markets worldwide. Russia and the rest of Eastern Europe, the Far East (Malaysia, Indonesia), Latin America (Brazil and recently Panama and Costa Rica) and the Caribbean are proving to be growth markets. Since 2008, however, mainly Africa is a booming market (figure 5). The average yearly volume growth to Africa has been 18% since then, while sales within the European Union stagnated. Because of this, the European market share went down from 48% to 32%, and the African share increased from 29% to 44%. The past years, Senegal has been the most important export country, with Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone taking 3rd and 4th spot in 2013. The UK is the 2nd export market.



Technological innovation

More important than the introduced innovation regarding a digital trade platform (uienhandel.com) are the technological innovations that growers and sorters can still undertake. These entrepreneurs would do well to focus even more on quality and food safety (100% control). Growers are still focusing too much on maximizing the number of kilos, rather than quality. Packing plants are focusing on investments in new sorting machines, including cameras (assessment of onions is often still done by hand). Wiskerke has the first computerized sorting machine with infrared laser and optical cameras. Such investments are only profitable, however, at a low cost price per product, and hence high export volumes. There's still a technological challenge ahead when it comes to measuring and then lowering the nitrogen level of onions, which is often still too high.



Threats due to increasing competition, currency risks and danger of quality loss



Increasing competition leads to price pressure Due to high onion prices in the past two years, not only the Netherlands, but also surrounding countries will see more cultivation. When harvests are good, this will result in lower prices. Subsistence, for instance in African markets, will also increase then. In Senegal, import often stops in January, in order to sell their own onions first. When they're out of these, the borders are opened up again. If the current local production - at a sufficient quality - can be increased, Dutch onion sales will go down, and new markets will have to be found.

In China, for instance, although there's a growth in export of onions and a higher production quality, their export focus will remain on industrial goods, because of higher added value. In addition, China needs their own onions because of the continuing population growth and migration from the countryside to the cities.



Dependence on exchange fluctuations

Onion export mainly takes place to countries outside the Euro zone. Because of this, trade is highly dependent on currency fluctuations. When Dutch prices are high, Asian countries will move to import from India or China. Export flourishes with a cheaper Euro, to Africa, Asia, Latin America, but also to the United Kingdom. So it's good news that the ING Economic Bureau is expecting a weakening of the Euro against both the British pound and the American dollar.

Neck rot risk asks for focus on quality and innovation

More extreme weather also means more rain, and too much humidity is bad for production quality. Neck rot is often already a big problem in the sector, especially during a wet and warm growth season. For the image of the Netherlands as an onion country, but also for company costs and revenue, this can have negative consequences. There are also always risks of soil fertility decreasing. Such quality problems in cultivation and storage of onions not only lead to lower production volumes, but also to dissatisfaction with buyers. Minimizing neck rot risk is a big challenge for the entire onion chain, from breeding to export country. So an even bigger focus on innovations, in order to increase quality, is a must.

In 2014, onions took up nearly 6% of the agriculture acreage. Grains (circa 37%), potatoes (30%), and sugar beets (15%) cover a much larger part of the acreage. Onion, as the fourth most important agricultural product, is the only one that saw the number of hectares go up since 2000, with about 50% in total (seedbed sown onions 60%, seed and planted onions 40%). The total acreage decreased by 18%. Also, for the first time in history, the onion acreage (30,240 hectares) is larger than that of barley (27,640 for spring and winter barley in total).",2014-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['dutch', 'season', 'quality', 'onion', 'prices', 'onions', 'production', 'growers', 'analysis', 'sector', 'price', 'swot', 'export', 'netherlands']",China,news article,English

Another powerful storm is testing Southeast Asian disaster responders after Typhoon Goni crashed into the Philippines on 1 November, before veering towards flood-hit central Vietnam.

Goni, known as Rolly in the Philippines, made landfall on Sunday on Catanduanes Island in the countrys east, bringing violent winds and extensive flooding. The Red Cross says theres massive devastation in some areas, including 90 percent of the homes in villages in one part of Catanduanes.

Philippine authorities are still assessing the total damage, but the government said 11 people had died as of 2 November, with numbers still rising.

The evacuation of at least 450,000 people and early response planning helped avoid a worse outcome, but aid groups warn that the combined hit from a barrage of recent storms and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will test communities for months to come.

The Philippines has been locked in disaster response mode for weeks after previous storms caused extensive flooding in parts of Luzon, the countrys main island. Typhoon Molave, known as Quinta in the Philippines, killed at least 23 people in October; Typhoon Saudel, known as Pepito, struck days earlier.

Attention now turns to Vietnam, which is preparing for a weakened Goni to strike its flood-hit central region around 5 November  the countrys fifth major storm since mid-October.

Typhoon Gonis wind speeds slowed to around 90 kilometres per hour by 2 November, but successive storms over the past month have driven severe floods and landslides across central Vietnam.

Vietnams government says roughly 160 people have died, with dozens more missing in the worst flooding to hit the country in 20 years. The disasters have inundated more than a quarter of a million homes, and prompted a $40 million humanitarian appeal targeting 177,000 people.

The Philippines isnt in the clear, either. Another storm, Atsani or Siony, could careen toward northern Luzon in the coming days, though forecasters say its current path is extremely erratic.

Floods are common during Asias various monsoon and cyclone seasons, but aid groups say the damage has been particularly severe this year.

Typhoon Goni was the strongest storm to hit the country since 2013s Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,300 people and led to a massive humanitarian response.

Climate change is fuelling more volatile extreme weather across the globe. The Philippines first typhoon of the season, Vongfong or Ambo, arrived relatively early in May; the storm season typically hits its peak in July.

Posting on Twitter, Yeb Sao, who was the Philippines climate negotiator when Haiyan struck in 2013, said Typhoon Goni and the burst of recent extreme weather is further proof of a crisis.

The climate emergency persists and is wreaking havoc, he said.

341,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Nine Afghan children killed or maimed daily in world's most lethal warzone - UNICEF,https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/nine-afghan-children-killed-or-maimed-daily-worlds-most-lethal-warzone,"NEW YORK/GENEVA/KABUL, 17 December 2019 – The 40-year-old conflict in Afghanistan is having a devastating impact on children and parties are failing in their duty to shield them from its consequences, UNICEF said in a new report released today.

Preserving Hope in Afghanistan: Protecting children in the world’s most lethal conflict notes that in the first nine months of 2019, an average of nine children were killed or maimed every day. This marks an 11 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2018 and is largely due to a surge in suicide bomb attacks and ground engagements between pro- and anti-government forces.

“Even by Afghanistan’s grim standards, 2019 has been particularly deadly for children,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Children, their families and communities suffer the horrific consequences of conflict each and every day. Those same children are desperate to grow up, go to school, learn skills, and build a future for themselves. We can, and must, do so much more to reinforce their extraordinary courage and resilience.”

Between 2009 and 2018, nearly 6,500 children were killed and almost 15,000 others injured, helping make Afghanistan the world’s most lethal warzone in 2018, the report says.

Besides the direct impact of violence, children’s lives are also being blighted by the combined effects of natural disasters, poverty, and under-development, according to UNICEF.

Additional facts from the report include:

3.8 million children need humanitarian assistance;

1 in 3 girls marries before her 18th birthday;

3.7 million school-aged children who are out of school;

600,000 children under the age of five are severely malnourished;

30 per cent of children are engaged in child labour;

400,000 young Afghans enter the labour market each year but many lack the vocational skills necessary to find jobs and livelihoods.

“Young Afghans need to know that their career prospects extend beyond joining an armed group, or escaping the country to try their luck abroad,” said UNICEF Afghanistan Representative Aboubacar Kampo. “With the right support, they can begin to break free of the cycle of violence and underdevelopment and create a better future for themselves and Afghanistan.”

UNICEF is working with the authorities and local communities to address a range of negative social norms. Girls are at risk from honour killings, domestic abuse and sexual violence.

Working through partners, UNICEF is also providing treatment to 277,000 severely malnourished children. But the programme needs to be substantially scaled up if another 300,000 children in need are to be reached.

UNICEF is increasingly using sustainable gravity-fed and solar-powered water systems to help some of the 2.8 million Afghans affected by a severe drought last year. Even so, only 64 per cent of the population have access to improved drinking water that is protected from outside contamination.

All parties to the conflict must fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, which require them to protect children, end the targeting of schools and health centres and allow access to humanitarian assistance.

Donor support is also critical. UNICEF needs $323 million to support its Afghanistan operations in 2020, of which 75 per cent is unfunded.",2019-12-16 08:00:00+00:00,"['killed', 'maimed', 'support', 'daily', 'afghanistan', 'million', 'lethal', 'conflict', 'report', 'cent', 'afghan', 'need', 'humanitarian', 'unicef', 'warzone', 'children', 'worlds']",Afghanistan,news article,English
1493,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Asia's Hottest Stock Market Has Vietnam Primed for Inflows - Bloomberg,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/frenzied-retail-investors-lead-charge-back-into-vietnam-stocks,"Individual investors are piling into Vietnam stocks at an unprecedented pace, fueling Asias biggest rally and stoking speculation that foreign funds will return after fleeing the market over the past year.

The countrys benchmark VN Index soared 17% in the three months ended April 30, beating every major market in the region and almost doubling gains from the S&P 500 Index.

While foreign investors pulled about $842 million from the Southeast Asian countrys shares so far this year, the tide could be turning. Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam ETF thats raised more than $350 million.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that -- like in many others around the world -- has attracted retail punters in droves. Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

The stock market was very active and many of my friends were making money from it, so I decided to withdraw money from the bank to invest in stocks for a better return, said Nguyen Lan Huong, a 30-year-old grocery store worker from the riverside district of Long Bien in Hanoi.

The final catalyst for Vietnam could be if international investors reverse their net sales of the nations stocks. Vietnams retail investors normally model much of their investment behavior around foreign investors when they look for which sectors to favor, according to SSI Securities JSC, the countrys second-largest brokerage.

Bulking Up

Vietnam is an investable market, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. The flood of local cash has seen trading volumes more than quadruple since the end of 2019, based on 50-day moving averages. The benchmark index now includes 11 stocks exceeding $5 billion in market value, up from just two in 2015. Vingroup JSC has been leading the charge, and the conglomerate is now launching an ambitious plan to sell electric vehicles to the U.S. Vingroup was founded by the countrys richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine. The company started out focusing on property development but it now also makes cars and smartphones.

The stock exchanges other heavy hitters include a smattering of state-backed behemoths -- Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, PetroVietnam Gas JSC -- as well as steelmaker Hoa Phat Group JSC and Vietnam Dairy Products JSC.

Vietnams stocks have been climbing amid optimism its export-oriented economy can maintain momentum after being one of the few in Asia to expand last year. Manufacturing activity jumped in April to the strongest since November 2018, according to a PMI report Tuesday. Equities retreated today, sending the VN Index down 1.1% as of 9:38 a.m. local time, after Vietnams capital city instructed school pupils to stay home in order to help contain an increase in local Covid-19 cases.

The country is well positioned as the U.S. and Chinese economies lead a global rebound from the pandemic. Thats because Vietnam benefited when U.S.-China trade tensions spurred companies to diversify supply chains out of its larger Asian neighbor.

Apples Shifting Supply Chain Creates Boomtowns in Rural Vietnam

Weve been positive on Vietnam for a number of years. They are a clear beneficiary of China-U.S. trade tensions and their handling of the pandemic has been among the best examples globally, said Jeff Gill, who helped manage about $10.9 billion of assets at City of London Investment Management as of Dec. 31.

Waiting Room

Part of the problem may be that international investors overstretched when they splurged. Foreigners sold a net $876 million of Vietnamese stocks last year, similar to whats been already sold so far this year. Thats in line with a wave of selling across Asian emerging markets. Those moves look to have simply swelled foreigners cash positions inside Vietnam, which are already substantially higher now than they were at the end of 2020, according to Vu Bang, former chairman of the State Securities Commission.

Vietnams stocks also faced a setback in March when FTSE Russell decided to maintain the country as a frontier market, instead of upgrading it to a secondary emerging market, citing settlement methodology issues. The State Securities Commission expects to resolve the issue later this year. Investors have also cited foreign ownership limits as a concern that could hamstring the markets capacity to grow further.

Money managers from Sempione Sim SpA, to Asia Frontier Capital and City of London Investment Management Co. say they are busy looking for entry points. They cite solid economic prospects, relatively attractive valuations, rising foreign-direct investment flows and healthy earnings growth as reasons to be optimistic, while also showing faith in the governments ability to contain the pandemic.

I see Vietnam as a very nice compelling growth and stable story for the short, mid and long term, said Federico Parenti, a fund manager at Sempione Sim in Milan.

Vietnamese like Quy, a 33-year-old swimming teacher, are all too willing to keep investing in the nations stocks. He never thought of buying shares until the pandemic kept on shutting down the pool where the Hanoi resident usually teaches his students, slashing his income. He used his entire savings at that time -- around 300 million dong ($13,000) -- to buy stocks. He made about a 12% return last year.

I am not a professional investor and I dont have experience, he said. Quy is considering some more short-term purchases.

Commenting on the Australia floods, IAG chief executive officer and managing director Nick Hawkins said: “We’re working hard providing support to customers and communities affected by flooding. Our teams are on the ground supporting customers in the worst impacted areas of the NSW

Mid North Coast, Western Sydney, and South East QLD, assessing the damage to our customers’ homes, ensuring their properties are safe, and arranging temporary accommodation for those who need it.

“Our dedicated major events team is managing claims from this event, and we have increased our call centre capacity to help affected customers lodge claims as soon as possible. All our NRMA

Insurance branches in the impacted areas are open to support customers, and we have deployed a claims team to the NRMA Port Macquarie branch to provide face-to-face support for those lodging claims.”

IAG’s net natural perils claim costs for the eight months to February 28, 2021, were around $375 million following relatively benign perils activity this financial year before the March event.

Following the March event, and taking into account seasonally lower perils costs that typically occur in the June quarter, IAG expects FY21 net natural perils claim costs to reach around $660 million to $700 million, which is marginally higher than the perils allowance of $658 million for this period.

Quebec's government has offered to buy out residents in flood zones, while New Brunswick is considering it.

But for homeowners who are trying to figure out if they're at risk in the future, research from the University of Waterloo suggests that information may prove very difficult to find.

Jason Thistlethwaite, professor of environment and economics at the University of Waterloo, conducted a study to find and understand Canada's flood maps. He and his colleagues reviewed maps from 280 municipalities and found that most were insufficient — either out of date, inaccessible to the public or unintelligible to the average property owner.

Officials with New Brunswick's River Watch program said the flood forecast for the next few days show water levels dropping. (Stephen MacGillivray/Canadian Press)

""In Canada right now, we're ignorant of this risk, so we're not even able to defend our property,"" Thistlethwaite told Day 6's Brent Bambury.

He says many of the flood maps were meant for engineers and planners, so would mean little to most property owners. Others were only accessible on a dated web browser. And other municipalities didn't have any maps that the public could access at all.

""It's absurd as an industrialized country; we actually don't have high quality flood maps to let people know about their exposure to flood risk,"" said Thistlethwaite.

Researcher Jason Thistlethwaite points to this Nanaimo B.C. map as an example of poor flood map quality in Canada. A study from the University of Waterloo indicates that most flood maps in Canada are lacking. (Government of British Columbia Floodplain Maps by Region)

High-risk areas not always obvious

Even residents who don't live near a body of water could be at risk of flooding. Thistlethwaite says urban flooding is very common, with thanks to high population densities and aging infrastructure. This is a type of flooding that Toronto residents got to know too well this past summer when torrents of rainwater flooded much of the city.

Thistlethwaite says that the flood maps available in Canada will deal with river flooding, but not urban flooding.

""We actually don't have a very good idea of where that risk is at all in Canada,"" he said.

U.K. residents can search their postal code to see flood risk

Canada's system of flood maps isn't universal. The United Kingdom has a website that allows residents to type in a postal code and see what the flood risk is relative to that property.

The Australian government simply collected the existing maps into one database and made them publicly accessible. Thistlethwaite says he and his team have recommended the federal government take on Australia's system.

""At this point, anything is better than nothing,"" he said.

Thistlethwaite blamed the hold-up on a combination of governments ""downloading"" the responsibility of flood risk onto the property owner, and a lack of investment.

""What really has been missing is leadership by the federal government to help coordinate this information and get it out to the provinces, [and] support from the provinces to then make the information available there,"" said Thistlethwaite.

'This is not people's fault'

Thistlethwaite says there is a lot of ""victim-blame"" in flooding — the assumption that property owners should know if they're in high-risk flood areas or not, or that they should just move.

""The information is not available,"" he said. ""This is not people's fault, and we need to be doing a better job getting the government to do the things that help us protect ourselves from this flood risk.""

In New Brunswick, Gagetown restaurant owner Thane Mallory had to shut down his shop due to flooding from Gagetown Creek.

""You're seeing the the local marina which used to be nicely stacked and now it's just kind of Jenga,"" he said.

Mallory describes his relationship with the creek as a ""tough love affair.""

""When the river is where it's supposed to be, you wake up in the morning and you go, 'Hey, this is the best place to be in the world.' And after travelling all over the world, [...] this is home, and the river keeps calling me back,"" said Mallory.

So, what can you do to find out?

Thistlethwaite says a property owner's ability to find their flood risk really depends on where the property is.

""If you're lucky,"" he said, some municipalities have the information accessible on their website.

Some provincial governments, like Ontario, have a conservation authority, which he says have relatively up-to-date riverine flood maps.

But he says the best option is to check with an insurance provider, and ask about flood insurance.

""But good luck is really all I have to say to you if you're trying to figure out that type of information. It is exceedingly difficult.""",2019-04-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['good', 'area', 'expert', 'river', 'risk', 'residents', 'maps', 'canada', 'highrisk', 'live', 'flood', 'information', 'property', 'flooding', 'luck', 'thistlethwaite', 'know']",Canada,news article,English

• The early onset of rains and above-average rainfall since February promoted land preparation and planting activities for the MAM season across Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, along with the Belg season in Ethiopia.

• However, the abundant rains have also caused localized flooding, mudslides, flashfloods, and river overflows over the past months causing casualties, population displacement, infrastructure damage, and crop damage in parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and Yemen.

• Cropping conditions remain generally favourable as rains are expected to be beneficial to planting and crop development across much of the region; however, localized losses and crop damage are expected in areas worst affected by flooding (Figure 2).

• Abundant rains have also promoted the breeding and development of desert locusts and protracted the outbreak across the region, which continues to pose a significant threat to main season crops.

• Above-average rainfall is expected to continue across much of the region through May which will increase the flood risk across many areas and further protract the desert locust outbreak (See May Outlook Pg. 8).",2020-05-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'crop', 'rainfall', 'east', 'uganda', 'updated', 'flood', '2020', 'rains', 'tanzania', 'special', 'expected', 'season', 'report', 'damage', 'region', 'agriculture', 'impacts', 'somalia']",Uganda,news article,English

The broadcast dubbed The Exchange: Conversation for a better future which featured IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva and Christiana Figueres ended after 24 minutes with most comments from netizens against the body for loaning the government.

The comment section of the 24-minute long broadcast featured remarks by Kenyans who told the IMF to stop giving Kenya loans.

Kenyans also accused IMF of indirectly funding corruption in the country by giving the government more loans yet the previous ones were allegedly embezzled.

The two were discussing the effects of Covid-19 and climate change on the economy of the various countries.

Kenyans online in early April failed to convince IMF through social media activism to cancel a Sh255.9 billion credit facility advanced to Kenya after over 185,000 citizens signed an online petition seeking to convince the body to stop giving the government loans.

Through a stopgivingKenyaloans hashtag, the citizens said the loans have seen the countryâ??s public debt balloons with little to show in terms of development, a position the government has dismissed.

President Uhuru Kenyatta is on record saying the government has utilised money borrowed in developing the country

But experts have said the IMF negotiate with governments and not individual citizens, but added that the petition could see the lender look at the conditions in future when dealing with Kenya

Kenya has already received Sh33.7b already disbursed with Sh79 billion will be disbursed in June while the remaining Sh176.9 billion will be disbursed after a review by IMF done after every six months.

Kenyans have questioned the use of the money borrowed already with the public debt now standing at Sh7.25 trillion bulk of resources from outside lenders while Sh3.4 trillion procured locally

PEMBA, Zambia, Jul 26 2019 (IPS) - Jennifer Handondo, a small scale farmer of Choma district in southern Zambia, plants food crops such as maize mostly for her family’s needs. Because of uncharacteristically high temperatures and low rainfall during the rainy season in March, the divorced mother who single-handedly supports her three children, has not been able to harvest as much as she usually does. So she has diversified into selling seedlings of neem, Moringa and other medicinal trees.

“For me, trees represent money and a livelihood, but not in the wrong way through charcoal production but through these seedlings,” she told IPS. As a value add, she recently diversified into selling leaf powders such as Moringa Oleifera—a scientifically proven food and medicinal tree.

While she earns on average about 78 dollars from selling seedlings and powders each month, she said she earns as much as 5,400 dollars a month when she has large orders of the Moringa powder. She receives orders for the powder from large local institutions and explained that she usually has to collaborate with other farmers to fulfil these orders.

“My livelihood is based on trees,” she said.

Zambia’s rising deforestation threat

Zambia has a forest coverage of 49.9 million hectares, representing 66 percent of the total land area in this southern African nation and boasting at least 220 different tree species. However, with a deforestation rate of between 250,000 and 300,000 hectares per annum, this rich biodiversity is at risk of being wiped away.

A recent environment outlook report by the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) showed that the country’s high levels of deforestation are not slowing down. The report points to various causes for this, among them illegal indiscriminate cutting of trees and the reckless collection of wood for fuel, charcoal burning, the harvesting of timber, clearing of large tracks of land for agriculture through slash and burn methods, urbanisation and new human settlements.

In addition, the country’s renewable energy connectivity figures are not impressive. It is estimated that only about 25 percent of the population of 17 million is connected to renewable energy sources.

Handondo’s story is different though. A grade nine dropout, she has returned to school and graduated in General Agriculture from the Zambia College of Agriculture. She is passionate and active in forest conservation, participating in tree-planting campaigns and awareness programmes since 2016.

So for her the link to selling seedlings and products from trees as a source of income was an easy one.

She is also a change agent and champion for the World Vision Zambia supported farmer-managed forest regeneration (FMNR) project, which is being implemented in southern Zambia. FMNR is the active regeneration and management of trees and shrubs from felled stumps, sprouting root systems or seeds with the goal of restoring degraded farmland and soil fertility, and increasing the value and/or quantity of woody vegetation on farmland.

“The main objective of FMNR is to empower the community with knowledge to reduce deforestation which has been very rampant in this country,” Shadrick Phiri, World Vision Zambia Agriculture and Natural Resource Specialist, told IPS.

According to Phiri, the technique is highly appropriate for rural communities and land that has been degraded to a point where the loss of perennial vegetation cover, biodiversity and soil fertility on farmland is diminishing livelihoods and quality of life.

“FMNR can take place either as an on-farm activity practiced by individual farmers, or in forest areas protected and managed by the community,” Phiri said, adding that the practice is also relevant to the regeneration of grazing lands.

“We have chosen to use a cheap but robust system of regenerating our forests naturally. We currently have 600 farmers under the four area development programmes in Southern Province currently practising FMNR. The figure currently stands at 2,600 households nationally across the 25 area programmes where World Vision is currently working.”

The FMNR project is one of several initiatives in Zambia targeting the restoration of degraded land. Other projects include:

the Community Based Natural Resources Management in Zambia with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature serving as secretariat;

the Zambia Community Forests Programme implemented by Bio Carbon Partners;

the Promoting Climate-Resilient, Community-Based Regeneration of Indigenous Forests in Zambia’s Central Province project by ZEMA;

and the Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project supported by the World Bank.

Another intervention working to improve local livelihoods of farmers by revitalising degraded lands, is Plant A Million (PAM). Launched last year, PAM is a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification-supported project under the Africa-led 3S initiative. It aims to plant at least two billion trees by 2021.

Emanuel Chibesakunda of Munich Advisors Group, a business and investment consultancy firm that developed the concept and is implementing the initiative, told IPS that since the launch an important milestone for rural farmers has been the partnerships with like-minded stakeholders.

Musika Development Enterprise, a non-profit company with a mandate to stimulate and support private investment in the Zambian agricultural market with a specific focus on the lower end of these markets, has been one of these partners.

“Musika provided both technical and financial support to PAM to set up a commercial nursery in order to strengthen rural livelihoods through domestication of indigenous fruit and non-fruit trees in Zambia. This proposed intervention will enhance Musika’s efforts in testing the ‘trees on farms’ concept as a business for the smallholder economy that has the potential to generate socio-economic return on investment and enhance environmental sustainability,” Reuben Banda, Musika’s managing director, told IPS.

The nursery sells readily-available seedlings at an affordable price.

Community centred approaches

At the Global Landscapes Forum held last month in Germany, leaders, experts and indigenous communities deliberated and adopted a rights approach to sustainable landscapes management and conservation.

The forum showcased evidence from around the globe that when the authority of local communities over their forests and lands, as well as their rights, are legally recognised, deforestation rates are often reduced.

In recognition that it is this generation who can and must recover the damaged land, governments, civil society and traditional leadership, are using community-centred approaches to achieve land degradation neutrality.

A unique feature of FMNR in Zambia is the targeting of traditional leadership as an entry point.

“As custodians of vast traditional land where most of deforestation activities take place, we believe their involvement is very important in reversing the damage,” said Phiri.

He explained that the community approach has been successfully implemented in Niger and Ethiopia, with millions of hectares of forests under regeneration, while Malawi is equally making steady progress.

At a recently-held community meeting in Zambia, traditional leaders resolved to form Community Forest Committees to enforce FMNR and all related forest management activities in their chiefdoms.

But to achieve this, they requested that the government consider strengthening their authority by giving them powers of enforcement with regards to laws that govern local offences and penalties.

“As traditional leaders, we are of the view that section 19 of the Village Act on offences and penalties be strengthened to give more power to traditional leaders to sternly deal with offenders in our local jurisdiction,” said Tyson Hamamba, a representative of Chief Choongo from Southern Province.

Hamamba said this was the only way to deter rampant charcoal making and deliberate bush fires among other destructive practices leading to alarming forest and land degradation.

According to current laws, chiefs cannot issue a penal sanction against offenders. Their only role is to facilitate arrest of offenders by state police and/or other legally authorised law enforcement agencies.

For Handondo, FMNR is important for the future of the country’s forests. She credits it as being key to the lush growth of her seedling business.

“As a small scale farmer, and a seedling grower for that matter, I have found this practice cheap and easy to undertake. I have noted that we have a lot of stagnant bushes that are not growing because they are overcrowded but when we prune through the practice of FMNR, we have seen that these shrubs quickly grow into trees forming the much needed forest cover because nutrient competition is reduced.”

508,Drought Sri Lanka,Linking disaster risk management into economic policy planning in Sri Lanka - ft.lk,https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Linking-disaster-risk-management-into-economic-policy-planning-in-Sri-Lanka/14-674610,"By Kanchana Wickramasinghe



As several districts in Sri Lanka continue to recover from the prolonged drought last year, recurring floods and landslides hamper economic activities in the country. Sri Lanka was ranked as the second most affected country by the impacts of weather-related losses in 2017, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2019.



Worryingly, the country’s situation has worsened since 2016. This highlights Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to climate impacts and the need for effective policies. The good news is that the 2019 Budget proposes several measures to improve Sri Lanka’s disaster resilience, as shown in the diagram.



When it comes to natural disasters, it is the agriculture sector that is hit the hardest. The total damages and losses in the sector, due to floods and landslides in 2016, were estimated to be nearly Rs. 3.6 billion, according to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA). The estimated cost for the loss of paddy alone was Rs. 553 million.

The Districts of Jaffna, Anuradhapura, and Mullaitivu – where communities heavily rely on farming – were the most affected. Meanwhile, a survey carried out in the Anuradhapura District revealed that climate-related disasters and rainfall uncertainties are prominent among a number of risks/uncertainties faced by farmers. As a result, 2019 Budget proposals provide a more secure supply of water for agriculture through multi-purpose development projects, canal construction projects and rehabilitation of tanks.





Management of disasters: Challenges and caps



Frequent natural disasters call for an efficient mechanism for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in Sri Lanka. There have been notable improvements in disaster risk management over the years; considerable progress has been made to shift focus from post-disaster measures to improve preparedness to face disasters.



However, Sri Lanka’s recent experiences with natural disasters indicate that several areas of DRR are lagging behind, specifically, the ‘preparedness’ component which has not received due attention; disaster relief mechanisms, including disaster compensation, showed notable inefficiencies, as noted during the floods in 2017.



There were significant targeting issues in providing relief to people affected by natural disasters in 2016 and 2017, as revealed by the Sri Lanka Rapid Post Disaster Needs Assessment Floods and Landslides – May 2017. The distribution of relief goods, such as food, water, and medicine, was not inclusive, as key socio-economic information about affected groups were missing.

The issue was more severely felt when providing relief items to highly vulnerable groups such as infants, women, and the elderly. Also, the remote areas, with limited access due to poor road conditions and lack of transport facilities, were largely neglected following disasters.



There were delays and even cancellations of relief distribution, as the exact locations of the displaced people could not be identified, according to the Sri Lanka Rapid Post Disaster Needs Assessment Floods and Landslides – May 2017. Such issues point to the importance of establishing relief centres, to ensure that relief goods reach those who need it the most.



In addition, gaps were observed in Sri Lanka’s early warning system. Disaster forecasts are particularly important to the agriculture sector, as livelihoods are directly affected by weather patterns. Despite existing communication systems for early warning dissemination, there are issues in providing localised warnings to vulnerable communities. The absence of a proper mechanism at ground level is an issue. Disaster experiences in the last few years show that vulnerable communities were not adequately prepared to take heed of these early warnings.



The lack of disaster information is a key barrier in conducting assessments for effective policy formulation, guiding DRR activities, and achieving disaster resilience in Sri Lanka. Information can be in the form of loss and damage assessments, research findings, hazard and vulnerability assessments, disaster forecasts, early warnings, and weather data. Data on losses and damages are particularly important to understand the economic impacts of disasters.



The Desinventar database, managed by the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) is the only available source for disaggregated data. However, it does not encompass all the vital information needed to formulate DRR tools and garner disaster-related investments. As the draft National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP 2018-2030) highlights, there are notable gaps in terms of research-based information on natural disasters.



While early warnings and disaster relief mechanisms are vital in reducing the impacts of disasters, mitigation and preparedness remain the key strategies for reducing the impacts of disasters. This is especially relevant to floods and landslides as they have a higher economic cost, when compared with droughts.



The draft NDMP 2018-2030 points out that the investments on structural measures, intended to provide physical protection from disasters, are low in Sri Lanka. Certain initiatives are in place in mitigation aspects. The Climate Resilient Improvement Project has a component which supports the implementation of such investments to ensure short-term integrity of flood control and irrigation infrastructure.





Strengthening DRM



Improving the local capacity to deal with disasters is vital for enhancing the effectiveness of early warning and disaster relief mechanisms. Such improvements can minimise the disaster related social costs, such as mortalities and injuries. Further, issues in the relief system should be eliminated to meet immediate basic needs of the disaster victims. This requires the formulation of a proper relief system, with clear criteria for relief distribution.



Effective DRM should be supported by timely and comprehensive climate information. The existing gaps can be eliminated to a great extent by developing a repository with online facilities to compile and share data among key users. The sharing of research-based information helps to integrate such information to decision making.

At the policy level, the need of the hour is to mainstream disaster resilience efforts when formulating and implementing development projects. Suitable policy and planning guidelines are crucial in this regard.



The National Physical Planning Policy and the Plan 2050 (draft), takes disaster risks into account and can serve as the basis for development projects at the national level. Disaster related aspects can be introduced at the initial stages of planning and obtaining approvals for projects.



The Initial Environment Examination (IEE) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) should be revised to include elements of disaster resilience. Proper integration of DRM aspects into planning will also enhance investment decisions on disaster resilience.

This was former US Ambassador Roland Bullen’s assessment of the government’s response to the flooding between December 2005 and January 2006, and he suggested that the initial “underestimate” of the situation showed that lessons of the previous year had not been learned.

“What is not questionable is the GoG[Government of Guyana]’s mishandling of the flood situation. After initially dismissing the media’s coverage of the flood problem as overblown, then saying it had not been properly kept abreast of the situation, the GoG is now engaged in a high profile scramble to address the matter,” he said in the January 13, 2006 diplomatic note released by WikiLeaks.

Bullen further noted that this “inept response presented opposition parties with a golden opportunity to score political points with a disaffected Guyanese public in an election year, but the rudderless opposition failed to capitalize.”

He said that many of the affected areas were also underwater during the previous year’s devastating floods. “The absence of simple factual data about levels of rainfall and status of drainage infrastructure combined with the GoG’s incoherent approach suggests that Guyana has learned little from the past and remains at the mercy of the rains,” he declared.

Flooding attributed to seasonally high rains had been plaguing most of coastal Guyana except greater Georgetown since the end of December, Bullen explained in his report. He further cited the Stabroek News’ report on December 25 that flooding in the eastern region of Mahaicony had been occurring for a week and the follow up on January 5 about flooding in Black Bush

Polder, in the Corentyne, and later about Canals 1 and 2 polders on the West Bank of Demerara, in the backlands of the Essequibo coast and the Pomeroon River region.

He did note that these were all agricultural areas a few miles inland from the coastal strip where 90% of Guyana’s population lives.

According to Bullen, after an initially slow response, the GoG has mobilized “a highly public flood relief campaign, with virtually every cabinet minister visiting one of the affected regions.”

Bullen said the Embassy had also been receiving data from the Hydromet Office, but pointed out that the data was of limited use, since 13 of 14 rainfall gauges were on the coast and therefore did not report interior rainfall.

Later, in a follow-up cable, dated January 17, 2006, Bullen also referred to the lack of adequate information on rainfall at the conservancy. He said that after a meeting held by the government with donors, the Head of the Civil Defence Commission, Chabilall Ramsarup acknowledged that there were no rainfall gauges in the conservancy or the conservancy watersheds “so assessing how much water is draining relative to how much is falling is impossible.” Bullen also cited the difficulty of obtaining accurate information on the EDWC. He said that on January 17, 2006 at a meeting of the Guyana Citizens’ Initiative for Flood Relief, Major General (ret) Joe Singh had said that the level that day in the EDWC was 58.65 GD (an increase of one inch overnight) and that he expected the Lama sluice to be opened immediately. Bullen said that an EDWC engineer related to embassy’s consul that same day that the EDWC level was 58.4 GD compared to the 58.5 GD the day before. Further, the engineer said that the Lama sluice was not open. “Such conflicting reports reflect the difficulty of obtaining accurate data on the status of the EDWC”, he said in the cable.

Bullen concluded that there are two major differences between the response in 2005 and that in 2006. He explained that the interventions after the 2005 floods to restore the drainage and irrigation infrastructure, while “leaving much to be desired,” worked. “Georgetown and the populated East Coast have not so far experienced and serious or sustained flooding, although many buildings built on ground in violation of building codes have experienced intermittent water intrusion,” he said.

Additionally, he said in 2006, the GoG was much more pro-active in sharing information and consulting concerned constituencies, including the donor community and the political opposition. “This in turn provides an environment in which people are able to make better-in-formed decisions and a political environment in which the government and opposition can concentrate on managing the situation rather than harping at each other,” he added.",2011-08-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['bullen', '06', 'response', 'data', 'mishandled', 'ambassador', 'flood', '2006', 'rainfall', 'cable', 'situation', 'flooding', 'opposition', 'govt', 'edwc', 'initially']",China,news article,English

1588,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,The link between Australia's bushfires and Kenya's torrential floods - Quartz Africa,https://qz.com/africa/1803479/the-link-between-australia-bushfires-and-kenya-torrential-floods/,"Many parts of Kenya have been experiencing torrential rainfall for a couple of months now. This has resulted in floods and landslides.

The unusual weather can be attributed to the Indian Ocean Dipole. This is the difference in sea surface temperatures between the eastern and western tropical Indian Ocean.

In Kenya, when warmer sea surface temperatures are experienced heavy rainfall occurs, while hot dry conditions (conducive for wildfires) are experienced in Australia. When warmer sea surface temperatures are experienced off the West Coast of Australia, Australia is likely to experience heavy rainfall, while Kenya experiences drought conditions.

The larger the difference in temperatures between the eastern and western tropical Indian Ocean, the more severe the climatic effects will be.

This event is similar to the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation that occurs in the tropical Pacific Ocean.

Sea surface temperatures are measured by the Interagency Global Climate Observing System just off the coasts of Kenya and western Australia. In some years, temperatures will be warmer in the western half of the Indian Ocean and in other years they will be warmer in the eastern half. This dipole cycles between these extremes over three to five year periods, ordinarily with a 1Â°C difference in sea surface temperature. Between these extremes, temperatures will be fairly uniform across the tropical Indian Ocean.

When sea surface temperatures off Kenya are warmer than those off western Australia, itâ??s called a positive Indian Ocean Dipole event. When sea surface temperatures off Australia are warmer than those off Kenya, itâ??s referred to as a negative event.

The 2019 to 2020 dipole has been unusually strong, with a temperature differential of 2Â°C. This is more than double the intensity of the average event.

As a result there have been very strong low pressure systems over parts of the region, such as Kenya, inducing heavy and prolonged rainfall. It is also, in part, responsible for the very hot, dry conditions over western Australia which have contributed to the conditions suitable for wildfires.

Causes

The Indian Ocean Dipole is caused by changes in trade wind strength which can make the ocean cooler. Trade winds are permanent winds that blow from east-to-west in the Earthâ??s equatorial region.

When trade winds blow, they push the surface water of oceans westwards. This causes upwelling â?? when deep, cold water rises towards the surface â?? off the west coasts of all southern hemisphere continents. Essentially, water is pulled away from the coastline, leaving a void which is filled by bottom water which moves up to the surface.

This upwelled water is not exposed to sunlight until it reaches the surface, and is therefore much colder than the surrounding surface water. So the water is colder along the western coast of Australia.

If the trade winds relax, the strength of upwelling is significantly reduced. This increases the temperature of these western coast areas, as the cooling effect of water from lower regions of the water column is reduced, and the sun has a larger impact in warming the sea surface.

The changes in trade wind strength can therefore result in the formation of tropical ocean dipoles.

Affecting the weather

The Indian Ocean Dipole can affect the weather because sea surface temperature in large water bodies affects the temperature and dynamics of the atmosphere above and adjacent to them.

Cold waters cool down the air directly above them, causing the cool, dense air to â??sinkâ? downwards and the formation of a high pressure system. By contrast, warm water heats up the air directly above it. This results in air molecules expanding, becoming less dense, and rising. This uplift brings on a low pressure system.

These systems then influence the surrounding continental and oceanic regions.

Low pressure cellsâ??caused when oceans are warmerâ??are atmospherically unstable, resulting in moist air rising, condensing to form clouds, and precipitating as rainfall. High pressure cells â?? caused when oceans are coolerâ??inhibit rainfall, and result in hot, dry conditions due to the subsidence, when air â??sinksâ? downwards.

The stronger the Indian Ocean Dipole, the stronger these pressure cells.

Future outlook

As of the end of January 2020, the Indian Ocean Dipole index returned to 0. This means that temperatures in the western and eastern tropical Indian Ocean are approximately equal, and that the low and high pressure systems will lose intensity.

This would signal the end of Indian Ocean Dipole-driven floods in eastern Africa and the very hot, dry conditions in Australia, likely for the rest of the season.

However, under climate change the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events is increasing. We can therefore expect to experience strong 2Â°C Indian Ocean Dipoles more often in the years and decades to come.

1648,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Fires in Brazil’s Pantanal wetland and Amazon rainforest worst in a decade - Unearthed,https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/09/04/fires-brazil-pantanal-wetland-amazon-rainforest/,"“Budget cuts, reducing emergency resources for those responsible for fire management, resources for training more firefighters, resources for equipment and vehicles for combat, and impunity for the causes of fire … [are also] factors that aggravate the situation,” said Garcia.

Critics say that in the Amazon and in the Pantanal, land-grabbers and ranchers have interpreted President Jair Bolsonaro’s vocal contempt for conservation as carte blanche to clear more land, and that environmental agencies, held back by budget cuts and a pandemic, have little recourse to stop them.

Just last week, Brazil’s Environment Ministry said it would halt all its efforts to stop deforestation in the Amazon, citing lack of funds, before dramatically reversing the decision hours later.

Vinicius Silgueiro, a forest engineer at ICV, said that it was clear as early as the end of 2019, from low rainfall and rainy season flood levels, that the Pantanal would be exceptionally vulnerable to fire this year. It ought to have been possible to plan more effectively for the disaster, he added, but the current administration lacked the political will to do so.

Silgueiro added that the tools existed to bring to justice those responsible for environmental destruction, but they were simply not being used.

“ICV studies show that in recent years, more than half of all the deforestation and fires in Mato Grosso states occur on properties registered with the CAR,” Silgueiro said, referring to the rural property registry. “This means that the federal and state governments have all the data on the owners of these areas, and accountability is possible.”

The coronavirus pandemic has also aggravated the situation, said Garcia, as indigenous firefighters – who make up a third of the Mato Grosso do Sul fire brigade – had to isolate within their territories.

Connected ecosystems

What this year’s fires show, experts say, is that the degradation of Brazil’s biomes, each ecologically crucial, is closely interconnected in a way that makes trying to protect one biome at the expense of another futile.",2020-09-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['amazon', 'say', 'responsible', 'worst', 'wetland', 'rainforest', 'fires', 'resources', 'stop', 'pantanal', 'pandemic', 'brazils', 'silgueiro', 'grosso', 'decade', 'situation', 'mato']",Brazil,news article,English
1405,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Opinion | Pakistans Most Terrifying Adversary Is Climate Change - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/opinion/pakistan-climate-change.html,"Not far from that drowned village in Sindh is the city of Jacobabad, where temperatures in the summer run as high as 124 degrees Fahrenheit. It is the hottest city in Asia, if not the world. Jacobabad has long electricity blackouts. Its poor die as they toil in the fields.

Temperature increases have brought plague after plague in rural areas. This year has brought Pakistan the most devastating locust infestations in nearly 30 years. The insects destroyed entire harvests, causing the government to call a national emergency as winter crops were decimated, resulting in losses of $2.5 billion. The locusts descend like a haze, so thick that from a distance it looked like a soft pink fog. Because of heavy rains and cyclones, there has been unprecedented breeding of locusts in the United Arab Emirates. They traveled to us from the Arabian Peninsula.

This is a climate war between the large industrial superpowers, financial predators that have polluted and poisoned our planet for profit, and the poor, who have done the least damage but will pay all of the consequences. Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but its people will bear the burden of the worlds deadliest polluters. If nothing is done to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Bank, 800 million people in South Asia will be at risk of amplified poverty, homelessness and hunger.

The World Bank has identified Karachi as one the planets climate hot spots. Temperatures across South Asia are estimated to rise by 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 30 years. Karachi is already struggling with poor road connectivity, dire educational facilities and limited market access. Its already pathetic public health system will plummet. The rich might buy generators for electricity, pay for water tanks and rely on expensive hospitals, but the poor will continue to be devastated.

Pakistans current government is speaking about climate change, but it is a conversation that has come too late, unaccompanied by serious action. In 1947, Pakistan was 33 percent forest. Today, we have tree cover of just about 4 percent, all because of deforestation. This destruction, largely caused by the illegal logging by timber mafias, has silted up our waterways and left us undefended against floods and storms.

The country can easily be whipped into hysteria over supposed religious infractions committed by minorities and can debate womens modesty and honor inexhaustibly, but it has little attention for the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate change.

Karachis rainfall, like the rising temperatures, is a consequence of the raging climate war. We have sat by and watched how cities die: slowly. We didnt watch closely enough when the villages sank and struggled. But it is clear now that this is how a planet burns, one fire at a time, one degree hotter until eventually all that remains will be the chalky bones of Karachis ancient saints, buried on disappeared cliffs.

654,DR-2011-000121-CHN,On Yunnan’s chromium trail - chinadialogue,https://chinadialogue.net/en/pollution/4493-on-yunnan-s-chromium-trail/,"In mid-August, the Yunnan-based blogger Dong Rubin revealed that a nearby factory in south-west China – Luliang Chemicals – had dumped 5,000 tonnes of toxic chromium tailings on a hillside in the township of Yuezhou. The resulting water pollution killed fish and livestock, endangered the drinking water of tens of millions of people and attracted widespread media attention across China.

Speaking to Guangzhou’s Yangcheng Evening News, Dong explained the impact of the pollution incident: “At its highest, the most toxic type of chromium, hexavalent chromium, was 2,000 times over the limit. Contaminated water was flowing directly into the Nanpan River, which feeds the Pearl River.” The Pearl River is an important source of drinking water for the downstream city of Guangzhou.

Globalisation has moved chemical production towards China and has turned the country into the world’s largest producer of chromium tailings – a waste product of chemical processes. Chromium and its various compounds have a wide range of uses: major ones include electroplating, drug manufacture and textile dyes. According to Ministry of Commerce statistics, 10% of all manufactured products involves chromium at some point.

A long history

Chromium is a major heavy metal pollutant found in surface water in China, where it often becomes hexavalent chromium, identified as genotoxic and carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO). It can be absorbed by humans through inhalation, digestion and skin contact. Pollution from chromium slag has occurred in the Chinese provinces of Jilin, Liaoning and Qinghai.

In 1992 a truck overturned in north-east China near the border with North Korea, spilling 1.5 tonnes of sodium dichromate – of which hexavalent chromium is a major part – polluting groundwater and poisoning 37 people.

After the recent news of chromium pollution in Yunnan, media investigations revealed that this was not a new problem – at least for local people. The website Yunnan.cn quoted residents of the village of Yangqiying as saying that trucks had been dumping “dark soil” since March, after which sheep started to die off, tobacco leaves grew mottled and white shirts washed in well water turned yellow. The villagers made a complaint to the local environmental authorities on June 12.

The official probe into the incident found that, starting in April this year, two truck drivers from Xingyi Sanli Fuel, in a bid to cut costs, had dumped over 140 truckloads of tailings in Luliang county’s Qilin district: one in Ciying village, 40 in Sanbao township and more than 100 in Yuezhou. In total, they dumped over 5,200 tonnes of chromium tailings.

But a reporter from New Express continued the investigation and looked through the local environmental protection bureau’s records of inspections at Luliang Chemicals. The reporter found that on six of seven visits between January 28 and July 25 this year, the bureau had recorded problems with the way chromium was handled. Further revelations came in a broadcast of CCTV’s News 1+1 on August 16: some chromium slag had been left untreated for as long as 17 years after production, dumped in the open near the Nanpan River.

According to the 2010 China Environmental Bulletin, by the end of that year there were still about 1 million tonnes of chromium slag piled in 12 provinces across China. Greenpeace discovered another seventy to ninety thousand tonnes of chromium slag in Yunnan in late August, said Ma Tianjie, a campaigner from the environmental group. They believe it was produced by Yundian Chemical Ltd. in Mouding, which has long since ceased production.

Governance problems

On August 13, Luliang county’s official microblog announced that two months earlier district environmental supervisors had informed the Luliang Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) that dangerous chromium waste had been found in the area, and asked bureau officials to inspect the chromium-tailings storage at the chemicals plant. It was later discovered that Luliang Chemicals and Xingyi Sanli Fuel had signed a deal in May regarding disposal of the chromium tailings without approval from the bureau. Drivers employed by Xingyi Sanli Fuel later dumped the tailings in Qilin district, also without authorisation.

The microblog also stated that on the morning of June 13 – the day the pollution alert was passed to the environmental protection bureau – government employees rushed to the scene, where they worked to remove 5,222 tonnes of chromium slag, 7,700 tonnes of polluted soil and 966 tonnes of polluted water (run-off from the tailings).

Officials from the EPB admitted to the Yangcheng Evening News that drivers had secretly dumped 1,000 tonnes of tailings, “polluting 100 cubic metres of stagnant water”. But despite local government claims on its microblog that all the waste had been cleared up in the three days after June 13, CCTV’s News 1+1 found on August 15 that the slag heap had been left uncovered, separated from the visibly dirty Nanpan River only by a wall. Under pressure, the plant ordered its workers to cover the tailings with asbestos tiles, build a covering and strengthen the wall.

On August 17, the Pearl River Water Resources Commission’s own investigation found that there were excessive levels of hexavalent chromium in the area of the Luliang Chemicals slag heap, describing it as a “serious matter that impacted the water security of both people and livestock.”

But there are also doubts about the monitoring. The local information office said that between 2009 and 2011 the county’s centre for disease control (CDC) took water samples from the reservoir at Xinglong village and that levels of hexavalent chromium had been found to be 0.004 milligrams per litre – within legal limits. But, according to the New Express, the centre’s head, Qian Xin, said that testing for hexavelent chromium had stopped in August 2009.

Following the discovery of the pollution, Yunnan’s environmental authorities failed to promptly inform the downstream provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong. After the incident was reported in the media, the Yunnan EPB announced that the water quality of the Nanpan as it left Yunnan was good, and on the same day Guangdong’s environmental authorities told Xinhua news agency that there was nothing unusual about water quality in the province and they would continue to monitor the situation carefully.

The two drivers who dumped the waste have since been arrested and face criminal charges; five others have been detained. Environmental officials from downstream Guangdong province said no changes in water quality had been observed and they would keep monitoring it closely. The drought in Yunnan might prevent the pollution from spreading to rivers – but, said Ma Tianjie from Greenpeace, if it rains no one knows what might happen to the lower reaches.

The continuing crisis

In the 1990s, China started to clean up the chromium industry, and many companies closed or merged. By 2005, only 25 were left, and the State Council – China’s highest administrative organ – ordered that all leftover tailings be safely dealt with by 2010. The Yunnan case shows this has not happened: large quantities of tailings are yet to be processed and dangerous dumping continues.

The incident is not at an end. Other reports show that “cancer villages” have started to appear. Chang Xiaoqiao, previously secretary of the technical office at Xinglong village near the chemical plant, told a Hunan-based newspaper that many villagers were suffering strange diseases, with 30 developing cancer. Qian Xin, from the Luliang CDC, confirmed that between 2002 and 2010 there were 14 incidences of cancer, with 11 people now dead – the youngest aged nine.

Chromium pollution has a major impact on the environment and restoring contaminated soil is difficult. In the 1970s, both Japan and the United States saw serious incidents of chromium pollution, the most famous being the 1993 case in California contested by the environmental activist Erin Brockovich, which formed the basis for the film of the same name. Developed nations have invested in methods for treating chromium waste, but to little effect. According to the China Chemical Times, many nations have instead reduced their production capacity and companies have closed down due to environmental pressures – and instead imported chromium compounds from developing nations, such as China. That has lead to rapid growth in the sector in China over the last 10 years, including the increased stockpiling of chromium tailings.

From Senegal to Ethiopia and beyond, record levels of flooding are devastating the African Sahel region, with the UN warning that the situation could worsen throughout September.

On September 7, Senegal recorded 124 millimeters of rain over the course of a seven-hour downpour. This is the same amount that would usually be expected across the entire rainy season running from July to September, and prompted authorities in the West African coastal nation to activate an emergency aid plan.

The unprecedented rainfall has decimated homes, livestock and plantations across multiple countries already battling the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, widespread food insecurity and a host of other concurrent shocks, such as the historic locust outbreak ravaging parts of the east, and various violent conflicts.

In Nigeria, particularly the northwestern Kebbi State, flooding has damaged more than 500,000 hectares of farm produce amounting to around 5 billion naira ($13 million), according to NKC African Economics. Rice farmers in the area have voiced concerns about food security and business sustainability given the lack of harvest this year, while agricultural output has been affected by terrorism and banditry.

• The June to September 2020 seasonal rains over the northern and western sector of the region were above average across much of the region. Devastating floods occurred at the peak of the rainfall season, affecting over 2.5 million people and causing significant crop damage in riverine areas in Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia,

Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya.

• Crop losses were significant in several riverine areas, including along the Awash River in Ethiopia, the While and Blue Nile Rivers in South Sudan and Sudan, and the Juba and Shabelle Rivers in Somalia.

Outside of flood-affected areas, the seasonal rains were generally beneficial for crop and livestock production, water availability, and hydro-power generation across East Africa. The water-levels in major lakes, rivers, and dams are among the highest on record, especially in the Lake Victoria basin, major Rift Valley lakes, and White and Blue Nile Rivers.

• Desert locust swarms continue to form, and breeding is underway in Ethiopia, north-central Somalia, Yemen, and eastern Sudan. The situation in Ethiopia is of high concern, where government and other sources report significant damage to meher crops in Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia regions.

• Rangeland resources and livestock production conditions are exceptionally above average across most pastoral and agropastoral regions of East Africa due to two consecutive rainfall seasons of above average rainfall performance since late 2019. However, atypically high disease prevalence and livestock deaths are reported in South Sudan due to severe floods in 2019 and 2020.

• The 1-2 weeks rainfall outlook depicts the gradual southward shift of the tropical rainfall system from the northern to equatorial sectors. This marks a timely onset of the seasonal rains in bimodal South Sudan and Uganda, while the rains will gradually subside and reduce the risk of associated flooding in Sudan, unimodal South Sudan, Yemen, and Ethiopia. However, much of eastern Horn is expected to remain sunny and dry, with a delayed and erratic onset of the short/deyr rains in eastern Ethiopia and southern Somalia.",2020-10-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'significant', 'south', 'seasonal', 'rainfall', 'livestock', 'rivers', '2020', 'east', 'yemen', 'monitor', 'ethiopia', 'sudan', 'rains', 'world']",Uganda,news article,English
1407,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Delivering bombastic speeches - The Nation,https://nation.com.pk/18-May-2021/delivering-bombastic-speeches,"Share:

You need to be unbearably audacious to flaunt hypocrisy in the manner most members of the National Assembly have thoughtlessly employed for expressing solidarity with besieged and relentlessly bombed people of Palestine.

They took more than 90 minutes to assemble for the first sitting of another session of the National Assembly Monday evening. At the outset of it, Asad Qaisar, the Speaker, announced the decision of devoting the entire sitting to the cause of Palestine only and invited Shehbaz Sharif, the Opposition Leader, to initiate a yawn-inducing round of trivial speechmaking.

After spending many months in jail, the PML-N leader had reached Islamabad to attend the assembly session. He might not have been here, if the government had not stopped him from flying to London, with the permission of Lahore High Court.

Seriously suspending my cynical approach to our representatives, I tried hard to carefully listen to each word of his speech. Except narrating facts, which even a school going kid must know regarding the history of Palestine, he never cared to furnish anything fresh and attention-worthy.

Repeatedly, he kept urging the government to lead from the front in furnishing solace to constantly bombed Palestinians. How to go about it and with what strategy? He had no answer to it.

Still, he did admit that emotional speeches wouldnt deliver any protection to abandoned people of Palestine. But forcefully suggested that the coming Friday should be observed as Al Quds day. The day of solidarity should end with a visit to UN Offices in Islamabad to handover a resolution in support of the people of Palestine, unanimously prepared by all the political parties of Pakistan. The expected resolution should also ask the United Nations Security Council to instantly move to stop Israel from vicious and barbaric attacks on Palestinian territory.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the foreign minister, on the other hand, consumed more time to reveal that Prime Minister Imran Khan had already been working around the clock to develop a workable strategy to check Israel with constant contacts with the rest of Islamic countries. Thanks to his persistence, Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) was finally motivated to hold a series of SOS meetings.

While profusely welcoming the activist role of the OIC, Shah Mahmood Qureshi also recalled with a hurt heart that the US had vetoed against a UNSC resolution, which attempted to condemn Israels atrocities against Palestinians but failed to explain how to convince the Biden administration to behave otherwise.

He seemed quite proud in claiming that foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority had acknowledged Prime Minister Imran Khans concern with grateful words. Doing this, he conveniently forgot that Israels recent barrages of bombs were primarily targeting Gaza-confined Palestinians and so far the people living in the West Bank had been spared. And Hamas and not the Palestinian Authority is in complete control of Gaza.

Similarly, he sounded laughably nave while stressing that after failing in getting some relief from the UN Security Council, the OIC should now force the UN to hold an urgent General Assembly sitting. To ensure the same, he would leave for Turkey Monday night and from there intends to fly on to New York, hopefully along with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Sudan, to intensify lobbying for an emergency session of the UN General Assembly on Palestine.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi is not a novice to foreign affairs; he had been our foreign minister during the Gillani-led PPP government as well. He surely needs no tutor to discover that UN General Assembly has no mandate to actively engage in atrocity-stopping actions. That remains the exclusive prerogative of the UN Security Council.

Our Foreign Minister also felt excited about the series of protest marches in metropolitan cities like London, Paris and Berlin etc. Praising these marches, he indeed appeared completely oblivious to embarrassing indifference that many metropolitan cities of the Muslim countries were displaying these days regarding the ceaseless atrocities in Gaza.

In the end, however, he had to helplessly admit that United States of America remained the one and only country, relishing leverage vis--vis Israel. Keeping this in mind, he also had focused on recent events in Palestine during his telephone conversation with the US Secretary of State Sunday evening.

Referring to the same conversation, he suddenly switched to criticize the Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, and began raising serious questions regarding his conduct during a critical phase of the Afghan issue, when the US and the NATO forces had already announced the intent of leaving Afghanistan by September 11, 2001.

His comments regarding Afghanistan made me suspect that the end game in that war torn country was not moving according to the plan Pakistan might have imagined. Things rather appear heading to fear-inducing explosion in our immediate neighborhood. Yet, our foreign minister kept feeling too proud in suggesting as if Pakistan was set to play a leading role to protect Palestine from Israels atrocities.

Delivering bombastic speeches, our worthy members should also have done sincere soul searching. Around two years ago on August 5, 2019, Modi government of India had unilaterally revoked the special status of the Occupied Kashmir. After announcing the said decision, it enforced a ruthless lockdown on the Valley of Kashmir. Its brute clamp down clearly emulated tactics, Zionists had been employing to encroach into Palestinian territories since 1948.

Our representatives, crowding the National Assembly miserably failed to imagine an effective strategy to ensure pushing back of the Indian onslaught on occupied Kashmir. With the start of 2021, we rather started to get a flood of credible-sounding stories, strongly suggesting that India and Pakistan were now seeking peace with each other through backdoor negotiations.

The nonstop flood of such stories never motivated our supreme to all pretending parliamentarians to force the Imran government and its foreign minister to stand up in the National Assembly or the Senate to explain even cursory details related to reported negotiations. While most of them keep boasting that the issue of Kashmir remains the core existential question for Pakistan. They remained equally clueless regarding the recent development in Afghanistan. Yet the same parliamentarians hardly felt any shame in flaunting deep concerns for the people of Palestine and boastfully pretending as if they have finally found a workable strategy to furnish solace to their wounds.",2021-05-17 21:39:47+00:00,"['assembly', 'minister', 'bombastic', 'strategy', 'pakistan', 'speeches', 'national', 'regarding', 'foreign', 'kashmir', 'palestinian', 'delivering', 'palestine']",Pakistan,news article,English
