2074,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Flood management - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1568505,"WHAT happens when other disasters hit during a pandemic? Various parts of the country are already experiencing early monsoon rains. Rain and thunderstorms are expected across Sindh, northern Punjab, KP, Islamabad, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan. The Met department has alerted local authorities to beef up preparedness for urban floods in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi-Islamabad and other cities. The disaster management authorities now face the dilemma of managing flood disasters in the midst of a pandemic.

Last month, the Met department issued a seasonal forecast of above average rainfall during the monsoon season. As much as a 20 per cent increase in rainfall was forecast for Sindh and the Kashmir region for the July to September period. The forecast indicates a higher probability of large-scale flooding in the country.

The frequency and intensity of hazards that develop into disasters has drastically increased over the years. This is the result of a rapidly growing population, urbanisation, climate change and poverty.

In 2010, floods ravaged the valleys of Swat and Nowshera causing death and destruction and resulting in 1,156 casualties in KP alone. As the flood wave slowed in the Indus floodplains of Punjab and Sindh, numerous breaches occurred as embankments succumbed to the might of the waters. A breach at Tori inundated thousands of villages, leaving 411 people dead and 7.2 million badly affected. In all, the 2010 floods cost the country an estimated $10 billion in direct losses.

The authorities will have to rethink their strategies.

Subsequent years (2011-15) provided little reprieve and further exposed the vulnerability of communities and the economy to flooding events. Heavy rains battered the plains of Sindh in 2011, killing hundreds and rendering millions homeless. The year 2014 brought heavy downpours across Kashmir and Punjab. The untamed Chenab inundated thousands of villages in Punjab, killing hundreds. The direct economic losses of the floods since 2010 are more than $19bn, outweighing the combined losses of all past floods since 1947.

Pakistans flood management policy has centred on structural interventions to mitigate floods through construction of embankments, and river training structures. Non-structural interventions have made rudimentary progress in early warning systems, which have been riddled with integration, adoption and forecast reliability issues.

The Federal Flood Commission was established to coordinate flood management at a national level. It provides technical and financial support to the provincial irrigation departments. Meanwhile, the NDMA and PDMAs, mandated to manage the whole Disaster Management Cycle, have relegated themselves only to the response and relief phase in the case of floods. The disaster management authorities, along with Rescue 1122, the armed forces and district administration provide search and rescue, evacuations and relief. It is no wonder that flood management, which requires clear decision-making on mitigation, preparedness, early warning, communication and response, finds itself lost between different organisations of the centre and provinces.

It is now, during the pandemic, that this annual surprise presents its deadliest twist. In case flooding is of an intensity that requires large-scale evacuations from villages, thousands of vulnerable people including the elderly, will be forced to live in closely packed relief shelters.

Relief shelters and camps, usually set up in nearby schools, would need to be expanded to ensure social distancing. Sanitation and hygiene facilities, including provision of masks, soaps and hand sanitisers at such camps would have to be ensured to prevent infection transmission. Similarly, the provision of medical facilities, healthcare supplies for the displaced, and PPE for the camp management would need to be ensured.

Globally, authorities are rethinking disaster evacuation and shelter plans in the face of simultaneous disasters in their respective regions. There are many lessons to learn from Asian countries. During the recent torrential rains and floods in the south-western Kumamoto prefecture in Japan, elderly citizens have shown reluctance in evacuating due to fears of Covid-19 exposure, preferring instead to shelter at home. The authorities prepared cardboard separation walls at evacuation shelters to maintain social distancing, and prevent the unmitigated spread of the coronavirus at temporary shelters.

In another example closer to home, Bangladesh authorities expanded the capacity of their shelters before Super Cyclone Amphan made landfall in May. The authorities scrambled to manufacture and distribute masks and hand sanitisers to the millions of evacuees, volunteers and officials. The management of Cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh has largely been hailed as a success, based on the low death toll during the super cyclone event.

Residents living along the river have also been urged to move to higher and safer grounds to avoid loss of lives.

The Meteorological Department has warned that the area will experience heavy rains in the coming days and this is likely to cause heavy flooding and disrupt water intake on the river.

Water CEC Abdi Omar said significant mud and debris expected to flow into Tana River would increase turbidity levels, reducing the quantity of water produced at the Garissa Water and Sewerage Company treatment plant. Turbidity is a measure of water clarity in streams, rivers, lakes, and the ocean.

He said when the turbidity of raw water is higher than 5,000 Nephelometric turbidity units it can cause operational problems for water treatment.

“There will be potential spillovers from hydroelectric power generating dams upstream that would consequently raise water levels. This will further increase the sediments and silts in the river, posing a huge challenge in water works,” he said.

“It would therefore be advisable for residents to store water and use it sparingly during this rainy season.”

Omar said his department has created a proactive and essential emergency response to cater for water shortages in the affected areas.

The CEC said the relevant departments, among them Gawasco, are closely monitoring water levels at the river.

On Friday last week, the Kenya Red Cross issued a similar call to residents living along the river, asking them to move to higher and safer grounds before the water levels rise.

Speaking to the press in Garissa town, Kenya Red Cross regional head Mohamed Abdikadir said all signs were pointing to the possibility of the water rising above normal levels.

He said the floods are likely to have devastating effects, especially on communities residing along the river.

“Our plea is that the communities residing along the river start moving out in earnest. They don’t have to wait for the water to submerge them because by then it will be too late. Chances of losing lives will also be high,” Abdikadir said.

1024,Drought Sri Lanka,When the storks came visiting - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/when-the-storks-came-visiting/article4062089.ece,"Asian Openbill Storks have found a safe haven in Bihar’s Danapur, though their numbers continue to dwindle in other parts of South Asia

Danapur in Bihar may be crowded, congested and polluted, but it remains the favourite nesting and breeding ground of the Asian Openbill Stork — thousands of which travel to this safe and secure site on the wetlands of the Ganges, making it the largest heronry in South Asia.

The site, which falls under the Danapur Cantonment, has provided a safe environment to this bird species at a time when it has recorded a drastic fall in numbers in the sub-continent.

According to a report of the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC), conducted by Wetlands International that conducts annual surveys on migratory birds throughout Asia, the number of Asian Openbill Storks in South Asia had fallen from 59,897 in 2002 to 16,771 in 2004. And by 2006-07, India had the largest number of these birds at 13,036.

In contrast, the number of these birds rose significantly in South East Asia during the period, thereby indicating that the birds preferred safer pastures in the east over the highly populated South Asia.

In South East Asia, their numbers registered an exponential growth from 3,395 to 55,336 between 2002 and 2004. And in 2006-07, Thailand alone recorded 244,015 of these birds.

“The reasons for the decline in numbers in South Asia and the rise in Openbill Stork population South East Asia could be many, including poaching and hunting. The work on compilation of data for the last five years is currently on,’’ said ecologist and conservationist T.K. Roy.

But the encouraging part, Mr. Roy said, is that in Danapur Cantonment, the birds continue to find a safe place to live in.

“Just about 300 metres from the Ganga and about 200 metres from a residential area is the breeding and nesting ground of these birds.” Mr. Roy conducted a census of the birds in June, when they come to the area, and then recently in the last week of October.

“These birds stay close together for security reasons. There are just 58 low-rise trees on which they perch and where they nest. For ages, this has been their annual nesting and breeding place. And now the Army has launched efforts to ensure that there is no hunting or poaching of these birds.”

As against the arrival of about 4,000 storks every year, this year only about 3,000 birds arrived in Danapur. However, their numbers have more than doubled since with them giving birth and now there is a total of about 9,000 storks in the heronry.

The Asian Openbill Stork ( Anastomus scitans) is one major species among the 11 stork species in Asia and apart from India it is found in small numbers in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in South Asia.

The storks migrate to north India in June and to the southern part of the country in November every year.",2012-11-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['safe', 'east', 'asian', 'asia', 'stork', 'visiting', 'south', 'numbers', 'birds', 'storks', 'came', 'openbill']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
122,DR-2015-000134-SOM,A Journey To Harar | JimmaTimes.com - Jimma Times,https://www.jimmatimes.com/a-journey-to-harar/,"I had come to Harar with a small group from Addis Ababa, which lies about 250 miles to the east, about a twelve-hour journey by road in good conditions. We chose to take the more widely preferred route, a flight into Dire Dawa, Ethiopia’s second-largest city. Located 35 miles west of Harar, Dire Dawa was established as Addis Harar (New Harar) in 1902 as the main rail station between Addis and Djibouti. (There are currently plans to refurbish the royal railcars used by Haile Selassie for an Orient Express–style excursion train on the line.)

On the mountain road from the airport, we passed several villages, workmen chipping stone by the roadside, and herds of cattle being driven to new pastures and markets. In the village of Aw Wadai, we paused to join the people congregated for market. The main commodities offered were fruits, vegetables, and the leaves of a mildly addictive though stimulating plant called chat (qat). Muslims are not allowed alcoholic drinks, but some spend their spare time hazily chewing chat.

Before entering Harar, we took a side road to a point overlooking the city. Its impressive walls and gates are intact, although Harar has clearly outgrown itself. New buildings, shops, and most of the non- Muslim population are located outside the old walls. Circling back to enter the city we passed Badr Beri, one of the original sixteenth- century gates. The area is relatively peaceful, with a few people walking in and out. The gate is now always open, but a look inside reveals that it was a double gate. If any invaders managed to get past the first gate, they would probably have received a rude greeting at the second one.

Harar is Ethiopia’s only walled city, its streets so narrow that they must be negotiated on foot. Historically it was a center of Muslim learning and today houses the world’s largest concentration of mosques, around ninety in all. The majority of those living within the walls are Muslim, and those walls have long been considered a symbol of the sanctuary Harar offered Muslims from Christian and animist attacks. That sense of protectiveness today extends toward tourism. Though the city wants to encourage visitors, holy Muslim sites are not made available, and it is not considered appropriate for outsiders to visit mosques.

Ethiopia has been Christian since the fourth century and has strong connections to the Egyptian Coptic Church. Ethiopians even claim that their emperors, up to and including Haile Selassie, were descended from Menelik I, the son the queen of Sheba bore to King Solomon. What I had not realized was that Ethiopia is also strongly Muslim. About 45 percent of the population is Christian, but an equal number are Muslim. (The remaining 10 percent are animist.) Ethiopia also boasts a direct link to the Prophet Muhammad. When the prophet was being persecuted for his faith in Allah, the One God, he sent some of his family to Axum, at that time the capital in northern Ethiopia. He called the Ethiopians “godly people” and knew his relatives would be safe there.

Even after the prophet’s death in 632, relations with Axum remained cordial. By 732, the Islamic empire had spread through Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, Egypt, North Africa, and Spain. The Kingdom of Axum was exempt from the jihad, or holy war of conversion. The Arabs considered Axum to be on a par with their own Islamic state, Byzantium, and China one of the world’s great kingdoms. Gradually Muslim traders established outposts along the coast of East Africa, from present-day Djibouti and Somalia south, further isolating the Axumite Kingdom.

During this time, the trading village of Harar was established, with emirs ruling from the tenth century. Over seventy of them are recorded, the most notable being Ahmed Gragn. From 1520 until 1560, Gragn and his nephew (Nur Ibn al-Wazir) launched a series of raids that nearly caused the collapse of the Christian empire. It was at that time that the walls of Harar were constructed to keep out the Oromo tribe, which had occupied much of southern Ethiopia due to a Muslim-Christian conflict.

Harar was an important center of Muslim trade and learning into the nineteenth century. The emirs even sent Islamic missionaries educated here to many parts of the world. But because only Muslims were allowed to enter Harar, many rumors grew up concerning it. The first European to penetrate its seclusion was the noteworthy British explorer Richard Burton (disguised as a Turkish trader) in 1854. He spent an uneasy ten days within Harar’s walls, at considerable personal risk. A more widely known foreign visitor was the French poet (and gunrunner) Arthur Rimbaud, who resided in Harar for a tumultuous ten years. The house associated with his time there is now promoted as a tourist attraction.

A world within itself

Harar’s independence ended in 1875. The city was captured by Egyptian forces, and its ruling emir was killed. Egyptian occupation collapsed in 1884, but in 1887 Harar was captured by the future emperor, Menelik II. He headed off religious warfare by naming several members of the emir’s family to his new administration, under a Christian governor named Ras Makonnen. He would be the father of Ras Tafari, the future Emperor Haile Selassie.

Despite Harar’s often turbulent past, most of its original wall remains. The wall can be observed from the road that follows the city’s perimeter. Some sections were rebuilt by the Egyptians and, more recently, the Italians. The parts that look newer are often in fact the older ones, with fresh paint or plaster added. We toured the city by entering through the Argo Gate, wandering about until we emerged at the Duke Beri Gate. We then made a quick trip to the Asedin (or Lion Faith) Gate. This portal, built by Emir Nur, is over four hundred years old; Bab al Nasr (Gate of Victory) is written on it in Arabic. Close by is the brand-new Belayneh Hotel, which opened in 1995. The gate marks the location of the chief outdoor market in the area. Bustling with men in mostly western clothing and women in black skirts or long, colorful dresses and head scarves, the market appears to have almost no physical structures or stalls, just piles of produce for sale. The area is permeated by the smell of animals waiting to be sold for ritual slaughter. But anything from vegetables to a laptop computer is available here, if you know to ask the right person.

Although visitors are not encouraged to explore Harar’s extraordinary number of active mosques, the city does offer several other places of interest. One is the former emir’s palace, which is now a museum. We also had the opportunity to share a meal in a “typical” Harar Muslim family home. The main room featured a raised platform where meals were taken, and family hierarchy was indicated by seating arrangements. On the walls were hung huge oval pots and bowls used for transporting food to other homes for festivals, weddings, major family occasions, or just visits. The pots were made of metal, clay, or reeds. The reed pots and their cone-shaped lids were woven in geometric patterns of orange, black, and dark earth colors.

Another attraction is the restored Rimbaud House. The house is inside a courtyard next to a whitewashed wall. A few blocks away is a small museum, kept in a school administrative building. There are spears and guns from Harar’s past and some paintings rescued from Haile Selassie’s reign, including a sign that once hung over the newest (Duke Beri) gate. But such relics really do not capture the city’s heart. “When you thought of Ethiopia, what images came to mind?” I asked myself. In modern times, it has been the nation where hundreds of thousands died of famine in the mid-1980s, due to drought and the deliberate mismanagement of food supplies by the Marxist government. More recently, of course, there has been the civil war with Eritrea. But in Harar, I encountered a world within itself, steeped in a culture uniquely protected within its own walls.

“Harar is a city with a rich history and high civilization,” Mohammed Garad, a native of Harar and now counselor-in-chief of trade and investment at the Ethiopian Embassy in Washington, D.C., comments to me. “I grew up near the Lion Gate and attended Islamic schools here before going to university in Addis Ababa. My class graduated in 1973, and we were the last to receive our degrees directly from Haile Selassie before he was overthrown. But I am most proud of the fact that my home city, because of its legacy of Qur’anic schools and the many teachers it sent into the world, is considered one of the four holy cities of Islam (with Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem). This city holds a special place within Islamic culture and heritage.”",2015-10-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['gate', 'muslim', 'harar', 'city', 'christian', 'haile', 'walls', 'islamic', 'ethiopia', 'family', 'journey']",Somalia,news article,English
278,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Gravel-bed river floodplains are the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600026,"Gravel-bed river floodplains in mountain landscapes disproportionately concentrate diverse habitats, nutrient cycling, productivity of biota, and species interactions. Although stream ecologists know that river channel and floodplain habitats used by aquatic organisms are maintained by hydrologic regimes that mobilize gravel-bed sediments, terrestrial ecologists have largely been unaware of the importance of floodplain structures and processes to the life requirements of a wide variety of species. We provide insight into gravel-bed rivers as the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes. We show why gravel-bed river floodplains are the primary arena where interactions take place among aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species from microbes to grizzly bears and provide essential connectivity as corridors for movement for both aquatic and terrestrial species. Paradoxically, gravel-bed river floodplains are also disproportionately unprotected where human developments are concentrated. Structural modifications to floodplains such as roads, railways, and housing and hydrologic-altering hydroelectric or water storage dams have severe impacts to floodplain habitat diversity and productivity, restrict local and regional connectivity, and reduce the resilience of both aquatic and terrestrial species, including adaptation to climate change. To be effective, conservation efforts in glaciated mountain landscapes intended to benefit the widest variety of organisms need a paradigm shift that has gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as the central focus and that prioritizes the maintenance or restoration of the intact structure and processes of these critically important systems throughout their length and breadth.

Keywords

Here, we synthesize decades of disciplinary research into an interdisciplinary review of the evidence for gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as essential focal points of biodiversity and productivity and as corridors for connectivity across the glaciated mountain landscapes of the northern Rocky Mountains. We examine the role of natural processes in maintaining diverse, viable, and interconnected populations of native species that are challenged to adapt to climate change and other human stressors. We review the underlying research in hydrology and geomorphology that sets the stage for ecological interactions on gravel-bed floodplains, where aquatic and terrestrial habitats are intimately intertwined. We explain why we believe that gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains are the ecological focal point of habitat complexity and biodiversity in glaciated mountain landscapes and the “arena” for ecological interactions between and among species. We conclude with the argument that research and management of river ecosystems have too often been approached from a narrow perspective of the river as just a channel plus a narrow riparian ecotone adjacent to it. We argue that river conservation and restoration efforts that consider only the river channel while largely ignoring an expansive floodplain will not be effective at achieving local- or regional-scale benefits. Similarly, efforts to protect upland systems and wildlife that do not address fracturing and connectivity of the river system to uplands will also be compromised. In glaciated mountain systems, conservation efforts intended to benefit a wide spectrum of plants and animals across the landscape must prioritize intact structures and processes throughout the length of gravel-bed rivers and the width of their floodplains.

This review provides insights into the ecological importance of gravel-bed river floodplains in glaciated mountain landscapes and is unique in the breadth of its focus. This effort considers the full continuum of species and processes that gravel-bed rivers support, from microbes and meiofauna within the subsurface of the gravel-bed river floodplain up to vertebrate taxa, including amphibians, fishes, birds, mammals, ungulates, and large carnivores. We make the case that the ecological importance of gravel-bed river floodplains as regulators of mountain landscapes has been overlooked because of the strong disciplinary approaches taken with classic fields in hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, and conservation biology. Simply put, syntheses between hydrologists, avian ecologists, freshwater biologists, and large-mammal ecologists have been rare on this subject.

Rivers and their riparian corridors are known to play an important role in regional biodiversity ( 1 ), but the mechanisms sustaining ecological integrity are less well understood across disciplines. Gravel-bed rivers, which commonly occur in the valley bottoms of heavily glaciated mountain systems ( Fig. 1 ), such as those found in the Rocky Mountains of North America, the Alps of Europe, the Andes of Patagonia, the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and the high Himalayas of Asia, are particularly characterized by dynamic fluvial processes that constantly change and renew the surface and subsurface of the river’s valley floor ( 2 , 3 ). In the glaciated regions of the Rocky Mountains, essentially from the Yellowstone area in northwestern Wyoming, United States, to Yukon, Canada, gravel-bed rivers are disproportionately important to regional biodiversity and to landscape-scale ecological integrity. Research conducted in this mountain region, across a wide variety of fields in ecology and diverse taxa, has highlighted the importance of these gravel-bed rivers to an unexpectedly high proportion of the region’s aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species. Although gravel-bed river floodplains play a disproportionately important role in sustaining native plant and animal biodiversity, they have also been disproportionately affected by human infrastructure and activities ( 4 ). In northern Rocky Mountain landscapes, dams, diversions, agriculture, flood control, exurban development, and transportation corridors are but a few of the vast array of human-mediated direct and indirect factors that affect river processes. First principles of ecosystem management ( 5 ) focus on the protection and conservation of the most diverse and the most productive places to maintain viable populations of native species and ecosystem types. Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes ( 6 ), including disturbance regimes ( 7 ), hydrologic processes ( 2 ), nutrient cycles ( 8 ), and connectivity across spatial and temporal scales ( 9 ), is central to sound conservation. Because gravel-bed rivers and especially floodplains are focal points for biodiversity in maintaining viable aquatic, avian, and terrestrial populations, we need to focus on their conservation, with particular attention to the processes that maintain them in space (across the valley floor) and time (over decades and centuries).

THE GRAVEL-BED RIVER AND FLOODPLAIN ECOSYSTEM

Hydrogeomorphic complexity and connectivity Broad U-shaped river valleys are characteristic of glaciated mountain landscapes where large alpine valleys have been deepened and enlarged in response to Pleistocene glaciation (10). Three linked hydrogeomorphic domains are found in these U-shaped valleys: canyons, lakes, and gravel-bed floodplains. The distribution of these domains depends on the underlying bedrock, the width of the valley, and the history of glacial advances and gravel deposition. Where a valley is narrow and bedrock is near or at the surface, the river will cut a canyon and flow as a single channel down a steep gradient. Where the valley is broad, the valley floor may be either filled with water, creating a lake, or filled with glacial and alluvial sediments, creating a gravel-bed floodplain. Often, these hydrogeomorphic domains will alternate and reappear several times as a river makes its way down the valley (11). Rivers in canyons support comparatively less biodiversity than floodplain segments because the narrow, linear river corridor of confined river segments has much less physical complexity and habitat diversity. By contrast, the gravel-bed floodplains on the same river system are extremely complex, creating an extraordinary diversity of habitats that support diverse communities of aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species (12, 13). In the Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) region glaciers, snowfields and rainfall feed into the valley’s surface water and groundwater. Flow volume in the river channel varies markedly by season, with the spring flood period providing most of the annual stream flow and with lower volumes in late summer, fall, and winter, barring unusual weather events. During the annual spring snowmelt, high volumes of water have enough energy to mobilize gravel and cobble bed sediments, scour river channels, and cut banks on the outer edge of river bends while depositing sediments to create gravel bars on the inside edge. This process, called cut-and-fill alluviation, is dynamic and, over many years, produces a legacy of sorted and unsorted cobbles and gravels distributed across the surface and subsurface of the entire floodplain. Thus, the channel changes both its shape and location repeatedly over time (14). Occasionally, during flood disturbance events, the river will completely change its channel as waters flow across the floodplain surface, cut a new channel, and leave behind an abandoned channel. These multiscale disturbance processes create a mosaic of cobble, gravel, and finer deposits across both the surface and the subsurface of the floodplain (3). For example, large cobbles with few interstitial fines are created by sediment mobilization during flood events and then get buried as the channel migrates, creating subsurface, heterogeneous flow networks (15). Across the surface of the floodplain, the mosaic of habitats is expressed in different successional stages, including new channels, very old channels, ponds, barren gravel bars, young vegetation stands, and gallery old-growth forests that are hundreds of years old (Fig. 2). The complex mosaic of surface and subsurface habitats is interconnected longitudinally with the river slope, laterally from the river channel across the floodplain, and vertically from the river channel into the subsurface gravels (16). Fig. 2 The three-dimensional structure of the gravel-bed river. Illustration shows the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dynamics of the floodplain system. The floodplain landscape is created and maintained by biophysical processes that lead to a complex and dynamic habitat mosaic at the surface and in the subsurface. In this cutaway view, the hyporheic alluvial aquifer, characterized by river-origin water flowing through the gravel subsurface, is shown from valley wall to valley wall. The larger blue arrows signify the hyporheic waters that develop at the upper end of the floodplain and flow through the gravel substratum to discharge into the surface at the lower end of the floodplain following long flow pathways. The smaller arrows near the surface illustrate the water exchange between the surface waters and the upper hyporheic waters in the shallow bed sediments that occurs repeatedly along the length of the floodplain. The smaller U-shaped arrows at the interface between the hyporheic zone and phreatic groundwaters illustrate the small exchange that occurs between the hyporheic zone and deeper, phreatic groundwaters that are stored for longer periods of time. The black crescents represent the legacy of cut-and-fill alluviation, characterized by highly sorted open-network cobble substrata with interstitial flow pathways left behind as the river channel moves laterally on the floodplain surface (E. Harrington, eh illustration, Missoula, MT). Throughout the year, water is constantly flowing out of the river channel and into the gravels below and laterally beyond the channel (that is, “hyporheic zone,” from the Greek hypo, meaning “under,” and rheic, meaning “river”). This river-origin water extends across the U-shaped valley bottom, often from valley wall to valley wall and often hundreds of meters to more than a kilometer laterally from the river channel (17). The water that flows in and out of the channel, both vertically and laterally, reappears as upwelling springs directly in the river or in other lateral features such as side channels, springbrooks, and pond habitats on the surface of the floodplain. Water can travel hundreds of meters per day through the floodplain gravels. River water that flows in and out of the channel and the subsurface alluvium creates an extraordinary diversity of ecological niches within the gravel-bed river floodplain. During summer, surface waters heated by solar radiation are cooled by hyporheic groundwater discharge to the surface, creating spatial heterogeneity of water temperatures across the floodplain. The wide variety of temperature regimes is a function of solar warming in the main channel and shallow shorelines and the cool groundwater upwelling into those same habitats (Fig. 3A) (18). During winter, those locations that are summer-cooled become winter-warmed, which prevents the river water in that reach from becoming frozen as anchor or surface ice (19).

Nutrients, microbes, and aquatic insects in the gravel It is broadly understood that river channels support aquatic life and the cycling of nutrients. However, outside of the discipline of stream ecology, it is not as widely appreciated that nutrient-rich waters below and lateral to the channel support a complex food web composed of microbes, mesofaunal crustaceans, and aquatic insects that are hydrologically connected to the river and dependent on the surface water and groundwater exchange. Simply put, most terrestrial ecologists assume that the river and aquatic interface is confined to the river channel. However, the expansive nature of the river corridor in floodplain reaches leads to the aquatic habitat diversity of these unconfined reaches being much higher than that of confined river reaches, subsequently leading to a significantly higher diversity in the aquatic food web (17, 20). Downwelling water from the river channel into the gravel-bed subsurface carries both particulate and dissolved organic matter (20). Oxygen concentrations in the river water are near saturation as the water enters the gravel. At the point of entering the subsurface, particulate organic matter is trapped and filtered from the water. This concentration of particulate organic matter at the oxygen-rich points of downwelling supports abundant and productive communities of microbes and particulate-feeding aquatic insects (20). The dissolved organic matter continues to travel into the gravel with the subsurface water. As this water moves through the subsurface gravels, the oxygen becomes depleted by microbial decomposers, which release both CO 2 and biologically available forms of nitrogen and phosphorus (21). These bioavailable nutrients flow through the subsurface gravels to reemerge at the surface in springbrooks, ponds, and backwaters, or they may upwell directly into the river channel. Bursts of algal growth occur where these nutrients, which are carried by upwelling of the hyporheic groundwater, come to the surface (Fig. 3B) (22). Grazing aquatic insects achieve high densities and growth rates at these sites of high algal growth (19). Many small crustaceans and large aquatic insects spend early stages of their life histories in these nutrient-rich subsurface gravels throughout the gravel-bed river floodplain, again hundreds of meters lateral to the river channel (17), reflecting the expansive nature of the alluvial, hyporheic aquifer. They are nourished not only by the dissolved organic matter carried into the gravels by downwelling river water but also by the decomposition of organic matter (such as coarse woody material) that has been buried in the gravels by cut-and-fill alluviation. This buried organic matter forms concentrated sites of decomposition and microbial activity, including anaerobic methanogenic bacteria that account for as much as 99% of energy flow in some species of the hyporheic food web (Fig. 3C) (23). The aquatic insects that live in the gravel can be found from valley wall to valley wall and from the top to the bottom of the floodplain in the spaces between the cobbles created by periodic rolling of the rocks through hydrogeomorphic processes. These aquatic insects return to the river channel through the interstices in the gravels and then emerge and reproduce. Hyporheic invertebrates can form a significant portion of the total production of invertebrates of the river (17) and, thus, directly affect higher levels of the river food web, including fishes, amphibians, birds, and bats and other mammals (9).

Native fishes and floodplain fluvial processes Many of the habitats that are essential for growth, survival, and persistence of native fishes in the Y2Y region are found exclusively on gravel-bed river floodplains. This is particularly true for native and threatened or endangered salmonids, such as the bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and the westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) that occupy gravel-bed river floodplains for their entire lives or travel hundreds of kilometers to seek out these areas to complete their life cycle (24). Trout and other native fishes are dependent on cool water in the summer and unfrozen conditions in the winter, keying into a fundamental character of the groundwater and surface water interaction with the hyporheic zone, as discussed above. Moreover, salmonid reproduction is heavily concentrated in habitats directly associated with groundwater upwelling from the subsurface into the gravels of the river channel (19, 25). In such upwelling sites, incubation temperature is ideal, and there is well-oxygenated water and a sufficient flow to carry away nitrogen waste products from the incubating embryos. Adult female trout construct their redds (that is, nests for incubating eggs) in gravels that have been rolled and swept clean of fine sediments, first by fluvial processes during the spring snowmelt flood and then, again, by the spawning fish. Thus, a suitable spawning habitat is dependent not only on cool water per se but also on the hydrologic process of flooding and the groundwater–to–surface water exchange that is maintained by the shifting habitat dynamics of the gravel-bed river floodplains on the alluvial valley floor (Fig. 3D) (25). The habitats created by fluvial processes on and in the gravel-bed river floodplains are essential not only for spawning but also to the rest of the life cycle of native salmonids. Juvenile salmonids typically use side channels, springbrooks, and low-velocity shoreline habitats for early rearing and feeding (26), whereas subadult and adult fishes require deep, complex areas of the channel with channel-edge vegetative cover for feeding and protection from predation (27). Trees that fall in the river channel through the process of cut-and-fill alluviation create pools and structures and provide shade that is important during the summer months (28). Groundwater upwelling from the floodplain gravels creates an ideal overwintering habitat because of the relatively warm, ice-free conditions provided by hyporheic return flows to the river (19). Alluvial valley segments support relatively higher levels of genetic diversity and abundances of native salmonids (29), underscoring the importance of these habitats as “biological hot spots” for evolutionary potential (that is, adaptive capacity), resiliency to environmental change, and overall persistence.

Amphibians in ephemeral floodplain habitats Amphibian reproduction requires pond and nearshore channel environments with specific thermal and hydroperiod conditions (that is, the length of time that surface water is present). Often overlooked is the fact that, in glaciated mountain environments, the greatest diversity of thermal and hydroperiod conditions is found among the ponds and disconnected backwaters of gravel-bed river floodplains. Many amphibians select ephemeral ponds for breeding to avoid predation. The short hydroperiod of such ephemeral ponds prevents predatory fish from accessing the same habitat that amphibians select for eggs and immature aquatic stages. However, to exploit these ephemeral habitats, larval amphibians must grow and develop rapidly before the water disappears. Pond habitats on the open floodplain that are created by the spring flood receive direct sunlight and can be warmed to >25°C, yet have bottom temperatures of <7°C because of subsurface groundwater entering the bottom of the pond through the gravels. Ponds in paleochannels that thread through an adjacent forest tend to be much cooler from top to bottom because of shading by the surrounding mature vegetation and the upwelling of groundwater. This array of thermal and hydroperiod conditions supports not only a diverse amphibian assemblage (30) but also high levels of intraspecific genetic diversity and plasticity in phenotypic expression (31).

Disturbance and vegetation diversity across the floodplain The ecological importance of vegetation to aquatic ecosystems has been widely studied (32, 33). However, riparian vegetation is often considered as a relatively narrow band (that is, 25 to 50 m in width) next to the channel, whereas the relevance of plant communities that extend across the floodplain is ignored in the context of “vegetation in the riparian zone.” This understanding is inaccurate and is now realized to be too limited. On the gravel-bed river floodplains of the Y2Y region, riparian plant communities extend hundreds of meters to kilometers from the active channel to the lateral edges of the floodplain (see Fig. 1). Water from the river channel downwelling into the hyporheic zone of the floodplain and then flowing subsurface from lateral edge to lateral edge of the floodplain nourishes the trees and other plants (34). The combination of these nutrient pulses with multiscale disturbance of cut-and-fill alluviation, larger-scale flood disturbance history, and fire disturbance creates a highly productive and biodiverse vegetation community. Native cottonwoods (Populus spp.) and willows (Salix spp.) dominate early succession of gravel-bed river floodplains in the Y2Y region, and their life history traits are tightly linked with the natural flow regime (35). Cottonwoods and willows are intolerant of established vegetation, and seedling recruitment requires barren sites newly formed by flood disturbance events and scour, as described above. Although these species are prolific seed producers, the tiny seeds are annually released in a short interval after the spring snowmelt peak and are only viable for a few weeks. The seeds are blown or floated onto moist and barren sites left behind on the exposed cobble bars by the receding river water. After germination, the small seedlings will only survive through the first summer of highly xeric conditions on the bare cobble and gravel bars if the river stage recedes slowly enough for the root elongation to track the falling groundwater zone, which is tightly linked to the river level. If the rate of decline following the peak in the flood hydrograph is too rapid, then seedlings desiccate and die with resulting poor recruitment (36). Conifer-dominated stands often eventually replace cottonwood stands in areas of the floodplain that are undisturbed for a long period of time (14), and with their lower productivity, conifers also tend to harbor lower biodiversity (37). Thus, highly stable floodplains (that is, lacking disturbance flooding) in the Y2Y region become dominated by less diverse and less productive conifers. Gravel-bed river floodplains contain a complex set of habitats that includes soil moisture ranging from extremely xeric to mesic and hosts an extraordinarily high diversity of plant species. More than 60% of plant species from the floodplain valley floor to the alpine occur on the heterogeneous habitats of the gravel-bed floodplains (38). This is because moisture gradients that occur across hundreds of meters of elevation on mountainsides are highly compressed over short elevation differences on floodplains but support similarly diverse species assemblages. These rich and diverse floodplain plant communities are shaped by, and in many cases are dependent on, the natural dynamic processes of the river. Many of the plants of gravel-bed river floodplains are pioneering species that not only are tolerant of flooding but also are actually dependent on the physical disturbance of the cut-and-fill alluviation process that creates open cobble bars for their reproduction (39). These plant communities also influence the river’s hydrological and geomorphic processes as large trees of old-growth forest patches are eroded, and large wood debris is captured by the river during flood events. The largest wood creates hydraulic complexity with deep scour in one location and high deposition in another (3, 28). Likewise, paleochannels with scour holes become pond habitats with hydric soils and wetland plants. These often occur directly next to floodplain surfaces 2 to 3 m in elevation above the groundwater table, which is directly controlled by the river stage. Thus, old-growth cottonwoods and spruce forests are often seen growing directly adjacent to both the contemporary channel and old paleochannels (14).

Avian direct and indirect use of floodplains Many bird species are known to rely on river corridor habitats. In the Y2Y region, more than 70% of the species diversity is associated with gravel-bed rivers and floodplains to complete part of their life cycle (if not the entire cycle) (40). The continuum of floodplain use among bird species in the region ranges from those entirely reliant on near-channel habitats (for example, water and shore birds), to birds that seasonally occupy adjacent riparian forest habitats for breeding activity (for example, flycatchers, wet woodland passerines, and raptors), to short-term inhabitants of the river floodplain during migrations or seasonal temporary users before local connectivity to uplands (for example, neotropical migrants). The highest bird densities (41) and greatest bird diversity (42) are associated with expansive floodplains containing a variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitats with large and complex patches of deciduous gallery forests intersected by side channels and a range of successional plant communities. The dependence of passerines on riparian vegetation, especially in the semi-arid west, has led ornithologists to refer to gravel-bed river systems as the “aorta” of mountain landscapes (43). The diverse structure and composition of floodplain vegetation that result from fluvial processes lead directly to high bird diversity (42). The cottonwood gallery forests, which are highly dependent on fluvial processes, provide nesting and perching sites. Freshly exposed gravels are a critical habitat to spotted sandpipers (Actitis macularius) and other shorebirds. Gravel-bed floodplains are also important to birds typically thought of as upland breeding species. Following their spring migration to the Y2Y region, many upland species rely on the gravel-bed river floodplain habitats along the valley floor early in the season before breeding or as they prepare to migrate south in the fall. For instance, ruby-crowned kinglets (Regulus calendula), categorized as “coniferous forest specialists,” inhabit gravel-bed floodplains during the winter and early spring. Some stay in the coniferous forest adjacent to the floodplain, whereas others move to an upland forest habitat as resources become available for breeding activity later in the spring (44). Migrating insectivorous birds prefer floodplains because of the predictable and abundant food resources and a lower predation risk than other environments (45). Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) that breed in coniferous forests often forage over floodplains (46), and although falcons do not rely solely on gravel-bed floodplains, these areas provide critical prey resources (for example, waterfowl, passerines, and shorebirds) that attract and support peregrine populations and those of other raptors.

The arena for ungulate and wolf interactions Many large mammals, such as moose (Alces alces), beaver (Castor canadensis), and river otter (Lutra canadensis), are obligate users of wetlands, rivers, and floodplain habitats. However, the wide variety of large mammals generally considered as upland species but which rely heavily on gravel-bed river floodplains for many portions of their life histories is often overlooked. Throughout the Y2Y region, large-mammal communities are shaped by elevation, climate, precipitation, and primary productivity gradients created by the mountain ecosystem (47). Gravel-bed river floodplains in the region provide the overall highest annual primary productivity (48), the earliest appearance of spring-emergent vegetation, and the latest continuance of fresh vegetation in the fall (49). Critical grasslands and shrub and aspen stands required for winter maintenance of large ungulates, such as bison (Bison bison), elk (Cervus elaphus), and deer (Odocoileus spp.), dominate the vegetation of alluvial fans, which extend onto broader gravel-bed river floodplains at the lower elevation valley bottoms. Gravel-bed river floodplains provide boreal lichens for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and a key habitat for large carnivores such as wolves (Canis lupus), grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), and mountain lions (Felis concolor) (50, 51). Gravel-bed floodplains provide not only critical habitats but also the arena for key ecological interactions among several large mammals (Fig. 4A). Carnivory and herbivory are important ecological processes that affect both gravel-bed river floodplains and upland habitats in mountainous ecosystems (52). In the Y2Y region, wolves commonly den along the edge or directly on large gravel-bed river floodplains (53). Wolves find preferred materials for denning in gravel and sand deposits along banks exposed by the processes of cut-and-fill alluviation. Gravel-bed floodplains also provide a significant predation advantage to wolves. Spring migratory corridors of their prey, from winter ranges to alpine summer ranges, follow valley bottoms, passing close to active wolf dens (54) and increasing the likelihood of successful predation during spring and fall (55). In summer, risk of mortality is greatest when ungulates cross lower-elevation valleys between alpine ranges (55), whereas during winter, an estimated 40% of all wolf kills within Banff National Park occurred on gravel-bed river floodplains. Moreover, the attraction of ungulates to spring green-up near warmer groundwater upwelling zones may create an ungulate “hot spot” during the time of year when large ungulates are in poor body condition (56). These hot spots are then exploited by large carnivores, resulting in the important late winter–early spring spike in mortality of all ungulate species on the gravel-bed floodplains (57). Many studies show that ungulates pursued by predators on uplands will descend onto the floodplain of the valley bottom, attempting to use the river as an escape strategy. When this strategy proves unsuccessful, the kill invariably occurs on the floodplain. Thus, in the case of wolves and coyotes, it is particularly disadvantageous for prey to escape by running downhill (58).

(A) A spatially explicit frequency distribution of radio-collared elk (purple) and wolves (red) and locations of elk kills by wolves (green stars). (B) A map of grizzly bear subpopulations in the United States–Canada transboundary area of the Y2Y region derived from fragmentation synthesis. Numerical values represent subpopulation estimates. The yellow dotted lines delineate fragmentation between subpopulations and follow fragmented gravel-bed river floodplains [modified with permission from the study by Proctor et al. (65)]. The predation that occurs on gravel-bed floodplains also affects the health and reproduction of cottonwoods on the floodplain and upland aspen forests. Wolf predation on elk, which occurs primarily on gravel bars, is capable of providing top-down controls on elk density in some systems (52). Eradication of wolves and other carnivores across the southern half of the region in the 1930s to 1960s led to the extreme overpopulation of large ungulates, in particular elk, throughout many river valleys (59). The increased elk numbers, in turn, led to a marked increase in herbivory by elk on woody browse species such as aspen, cottonwoods, and willow, which then cascaded to declines in beaver and other obligates of early willow and mature forest species, such as riparian passerine birds (52). The loss of the deciduous cottonwood and aspen forests not only had a direct effect on beaver populations but also had a significant effect on the role large wood has in hydrogeomorphic processes of the gravel-bed river floodplains. In the last several decades, the restoration of wolves in Banff and Yellowstone has reversed the loss of woody browse species on gravel-bed river floodplains (60). Results from spatial risk models for Yellowstone National Park and the Ya Ha Tinda and Bow Valley in Banff National Park show that since the 1990s, wolf predation on elk has also resulted in a marked rejuvenation of upland aspen (52, 61). Predation on ungulates on gravel-bed floodplains also likely results in an overlooked but important source of nutrient flow. The role of salmon as a nutrient subsidy from the marine environment to gravel-bed floodplains around the north Pacific Rim has been well documented (62). Similarly, a study on Isle Royale (63) showed that the distribution of wolf-killed moose carcasses had strong and persistent effects on terrestrial nutrient cycling by concentrating nutrients at the site of the kill. Work in Yellowstone National Park has shown high pulses of nutrients from carcasses to terrestrial systems. Because predation risk is highest on gravel-bed floodplains, high nutrient concentrations around large ungulate carcasses are likely to reach the aquatic system (63).

Floodplains as “connectors and fragmentors” of grizzly bear populations There was once a large contiguous population of grizzly bears (U. arctos) across western North America from Mexico to Alaska. Today, south of Alaska and central and northwestern Canada, the southern part of the Y2Y region holds the remnant distribution in what was the southern half of their North American distribution (64). In this area, there is a contracted suite of subpopulations, some of which are small with high conservation risk, whereas others are healthier and act as core anchors to the whole system (65). Direct mortality and habitat loss were the initial causes of severe range contraction, but such mortality and habitat loss have been significantly reduced in many areas. Now, population fragmentation is a major threat to the remaining grizzly bears (65). Grizzly bears have ecological characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human activities. They occur in sparse densities and have low reproductive rates and male-biased dispersal. In the southern Y2Y region, population fragmentation for grizzly bears is concentrated on gravel-bed river floodplains. Floodplains are critical to grizzly bears for two reasons. The well-known reason is that floodplains are the first areas to green up in the spring and, thus, are disproportionately used when bears emerge from hibernation. The insight that they are critical for reasons of fragmentation is novel. Previously, fragmentation has been a more generalized concern about human transportation and settlement corridors (65), but now, we observe that the gravel-bed floodplain portions of these areas are a seasonally critical habitat and paradoxically serve as a source of fragmentation. For grizzly bear populations in southern Canada and the northern United States, the human settlement and transportation corridors within gravel-bed river floodplains and river valleys in general actually define the boundaries of grizzly bear subpopulations (Fig. 4B) (65). The opposite of fragmentation is movement enabled by connectivity. It is important for all wide-ranging species but is especially important for grizzly bears. For grizzly bear populations, female movement is critical. Females provide population viability, and in-migration of females is required to rescue small, fragmented populations from extirpation (65). In the Y2Y region, movement of females between mountain ranges is both concentrated (66) and most at risk across gravel-bed river floodplains. Female connectivity is not a dash across a human settled valley but a process where female offspring disperse away from their mother into their adult home range that usually overlaps a portion of their maternal range (67). Because female grizzly bear dispersal is gradual (67) and over relatively short distances (68), linkage areas are not narrow movement corridors but need to be large secure areas (that is, kilometers long and across whole gravel-bed river floodplains) where female bears can live portions of their lives with minimal mortality risk. Where gravel-bed river floodplains are intact in remote places such as the Flathead Valley in southern Canada and the western boundary of Glacier National Park (United States), there is no population fragmentation (68). By contrast, in the adjacent but more heavily used Elk River Valley along Highway 3, north of the Flathead watershed, human developments on gravel-bed floodplains have inhibited female movements, although males still cross the valley (68). Farther west, human developments in the Nelson, British Columbia, area have completely blocked valley bottom movements of both males and females, leading to genetic differentiation and isolation of the southern Selkirk Mountain population (Fig. 4B) (65). These patterns hold across the southern Y2Y region. Both males and females demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. Female movement rates reduced markedly when settlement increased to >20% of a fracture zone. Male movement continues past the 20% level but declines gradually. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. The result is that several small bear populations that have male-only immigration are not viable over the long term (65). In the Y2Y region, floodplains are often in private hands. The paradigm where human settlement patterns usurp entire river valleys could be improved to better serve biodiversity objectives that include large carnivores if portions of these valley systems contain low human densities and are managed for or restored to a condition closer to their natural state (65, 68). Thus, conservation efforts that focus on securing gravel-bed river valley bottom habitat on private land are essential in maintaining healthy connected grizzly bear populations across the Y2Y region (65, 68). Further, for public lands such as the Canadian Flathead where valley bottoms have both an intact gravel-bed river floodplain structure and hydrological processes, conservation management that minimizes human densities, and thus mortality risk and habitat disturbance, is critical for the regional grizzly bear metapopulation to persist.",2016-06-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['river', 'channel', 'ecological', 'floodplains', 'valley', 'glaciated', 'habitats', 'mountain', 'landscapes', 'processes', 'floodplain', 'nexus', 'species', 'gravelbed', 'water']",India,news article,English

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) set a new record with the launch of 20 satellites in 26 minutes on June 22, 2016.

The space agency of the Indian government, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), successfully launched 20 satellites on the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C34) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR in Sriharikota, in Andhra Pradesh (South East) on June 22, 2016.

The satellites include Cartosat-2, two student satellites from Indian universities and 17 satellites from US, Germany, Canada and Indonesia.

The 727.5 kilograms Cartosat-2 series satellite would be used for Earth observation and according to ISRO, the imagery sent by the satellite will be useful for many applications: cartographic ones, urban and rural applications, coastal land use and regulation, utility management, water distribution, creation of land use maps, precision study, changed detection to bring out geographical and manmade features and various other Land Information System (LIS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) applications.

Sathyabamasat and Swayam from India, Lapan-A3 from Indonesia, Dove (12 satellites) and Skysat Gen 2-1 from US, Biros from Germany, M3MSAT and GHGSAT-D from Canada, are the other satellites launched into the orbit.

“With this mission, we have launched the current generation Earth observation satellite along with 17 satellites from foreign countries. Each of these small objects will carry out their own activity, which is independent of the other and each of them will live a wonderful life for a finite period,” A.S. Kiran Kumar, ISRO chairman said.

PSLV’s 35th consecutive successful mission

The total weight of all the 20 satellites carried on PSLV-C34 was 1288 kilograms and this is the 35th consecutive successful mission of PSLV and the 14th in its XL configuration.

Most of the satellites will enter the orbit to observe and measure the Earth’s atmosphere, while one of them aims to provide service for amateur radio operators.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the launch as a monumental accomplishment for the state-run ISRO.

ISRO also used the occasion to test its capabilities to launch multiple satellites into different orbits.

B Jayakumar, the mission director, said that multiple launches in a single mission required complex technology and ISRO is working on resolving certain problems that may arise during such launches.

“Initially we were a little hesitant to take 20 satellites in one go but we soon resolved the problems. What we have achieved shows we have the expertise to take up complex missions,” he said.",2016-06-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['continues', 'mission', 'space', 'launch', 'satellite', 'isro', 'break', 'land', 'technology', 'satellites', 'india', 'indian', 'barriers', 'launched', '20']",India,news article,English

1528,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Typhoon Vamco triggers worst floods in Philippine capital in years - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/typhoon-vamco-triggers-worst-floods-in-philippine-capital-in-years/,"MANILA (Reuters) – Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday ordered government agencies to rush aid to people affected by Typhoon Vamco, after the storm killed at least two people and brought the worst flooding in the capital Manila in years.

Tens of thousands of homes in low-lying suburbs were submerged by the floods, prompting residents to scramble onto rooftops awaiting rescue.

Vamco, the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, battered a nation still reeling from Goni, the world’s most powerful typhoon this year that killed 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes early in November.

“Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind,” Duterte said in a national address, pledging shelter, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counselling.

The latest typhoon, which has also left four missing, comes as the Philippines is still grappling with a wave of COVID-19 infections and a battered economy.

In some suburbs east of Manila residents took refuge on their flooded homes.

“Just a few steps remaining on our third floor and we have yet to see any rescuer,” Carla Mhaye Suico, a resident in Pasig City, told DZBB radio, while sheltering with 15 family members and neighbours.

Roughly 40,000 homes had been either fully or partially submerged in Marikina City, its mayor, Marcelino Teodoro, told DZMM radio station, calling the situation “overwhelming” and the worst since a typhoon flooded large swathes of Manila in 2009.

“The local government cannot handle this,” Teodoro said, requesting motorized boats and airlifts.

Nearly three million households in and around Manila were without power as people waded through waist-high floods, carrying valuables and pets.

Coast guards had to swim in flood waters as high as electricity poles, while rescue workers used rubber boats and makeshift floats to carry children and the elderly to safety.

Big waves and strong winds in Manila Bay budged a tanker, damaging a bridge.

Flights and mass transit in Manila were suspended while the coast guard stopped port operations. Government work was suspended and financial markets were shut.

Vamco has now weakened, with sustained winds of 130 kilometres (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), after exiting Luzon island, home to half of the Philippines’ 108 million people.

The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, experiences around 20 tropical storms a year that often continue on their track to hit Vietnam, China and Taiwan.

Vamco is forecast to head towards Vietnam. Floods and mudslides over the past month have killed at least 160 people in central Vietnam, left dozens missing and damaged 390,000 houses.",2020-11-12 08:00:00+00:00,"['philippines', 'vamco', 'floods', 'killed', 'capital', 'homes', 'vietnam', 'thousands', 'told', 'typhoon', 'triggers', 'worst', 'winds']",Egypt,news article,English
1167,FL-2016-000114-EGY,The Nile: Longest River in the World - Live Science,https://www.livescience.com/57023-nile-river-facts.html,"The Nile River, considered the longest river in the world, is approximately 4,258 miles (6,853 kilometers) long, but its exact length is a matter of debate. Flowing northward through the tropical climate of eastern Africa and into the Mediterranean Sea, the river passes through 11 countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt.

The Nile has two major tributaries: the longer White Nile, considered the prime stream and headwaters; and the Blue Nile, which carries about two-thirds of the river's water volume and most of the silt.

The White Nile begins at Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, which touches the countries of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. But Lake Victoria isn't necessarily the most distant and ""true"" source of the Nile River because the lake itself has many feeder rivers coming in from the surrounding mountains. In 2006, a British explorer named Neil McGrigor said he'd traveled to the Nile's most distant source at the beginning of the Kagera River, Lake Victoria's longest feeder river.

Still, experts do not agree which tributary of the Kagera is the longest — and therefore the most distant — source of the Nile. Ultimately, it would be either the Ruvyironza in Burundi or the Nyabarongo from the Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda.

Much less disputable is the Blue Nile's source at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. The Blue Nile meets up with the White Nile near Sudan's capital city, Khartoum. From there, the river flows north through the desert in Egypt, and finally, by way of a large delta, the Nile flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

The Nile Delta

The Nile waters flow at an average volume of 300 million cubic meters (79.2 billion gallons) per day, according to Travelling Along Rivers, a Dutch bilingual travel magazine. It takes approximately three months for the waters near the town of Jinja, Uganda (the point where the Nile leaves Lake Victoria), to reach the Mediterranean Sea.

The Nile Delta is approximately 100 miles (161 km) long from north to south, and it spreads out along about 150 miles (241 km) of Egyptian coastline, from Alexandria in the west to Port Said in the east. It is one of the world's largest river deltas with about 40 million inhabitants — approximately half of Egypt's population. Just before reaching the Mediterranean Sea, the river splits into two main branches, the Rosetta Branch (to the west) and the Damietta (to the east).

Ancient mythology of the Nile

Perhaps no river on Earth has captured the human imagination quite like the Nile River. From stories of Pharaohs and man-eating crocodiles to the discovery of the Rosetta stone, it was here, along the river's fertile banks, that one of the world's most remarkable civilizations — Ancient Egypt — was born around 3000 B.C. The Nile was not only the source of life for the ancient Egyptians, but is still so today for the millions of people living along its banks.

Known as both the ""Father of Life"" and the ""Mother of All Men,"" the Nile was the center of life in Ancient Egypt. In the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile was called ?'pi or Iteru, meaning ""river."" The Ancient Egyptians also called the river Ar or Aur, which means ""black,"" in reference to the black silt left behind after the yearly flooding.

The Nile River was central to the Ancient Egyptians rise to wealth and power. Since rainfall is almost non-existent in Egypt, the Nile River and its yearly floodwaters offered the people a fertile oasis for rich agriculture.

The Nile is associated with many gods and goddesses, all of whom the Egyptians believed were deeply intertwined with the blessings and curses of the land, weather, culture and abundance of the people. They believed the gods were intimately involved with the people and could help them in all facets of their lives.

In some myths, the Nile was considered a manifestation of the god Hapi who blessed the land with abundance, according to the Ancient History Encyclopedia. Isis, the goddess of the Nile and the ""Giver of Life,"" was believed to have taught the people how to farm and work the land.

The water god Khnum, who ruled over all forms of water, even the lakes and rivers in the underworld, was believed to be in charge of the amount of silt that flooded the river banks every year. In later dynasties, Khnum branched out to become the god of rebirth and creation as well.

Flooding

Each year, heavy summer rains upstream and melting snow in the Ethiopian Mountains would fill the Blue Nile well over its capacity and send a torrent of water downstream. The extra water would then spill over the banks onto the dry desert land of Egypt. Once the floods subsided, thick black silt, or mud, would be left behind on the ground. The silt created rich, fertile soil for planting crops — vital in this land of so little rain. Approximately 96 percent of the sediment carried by the Nile River originates in Ethiopia, according to the New World Encyclopedia. The silt area was known as the Black Land, while the desert lands further out were known as the Red Land.

Each year, the Ancient Egyptian people eagerly awaited and thanked the gods for the life-giving floods. If the floods were too small, there would be difficult times ahead with little food. If the floods were too large, it could cause flooding harm in the surrounding villages.

The Egyptian calendar was divided into three stages based on the yearly flood cycle: Akhet, the first season of the year, which covered the flooding period between June and September; Peret, the growing and sowing time from October to mid-February; and Shemu, the time of harvesting between mid-February and the end of May.

In 1970, the Aswan High Dam was built in Egypt to help regulate the Nile's flooding. Although the floods were desperately needed in older times, they are less necessary and even a nuisance to modern civilization with its irrigation systems. Even though the floods no longer occur along the Nile, the memory of this fertile blessing is still celebrated in Egypt today, mainly as an entertainment for tourists. The annual celebration, known as Wafaa El-Nil, begins on August 15th and lasts for two weeks.

Sharing the Nile

Because 11 countries must share one precious resource, there are bound to be disputes. The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), an intergovernmental partnership among all the Basin States, was formed in 1999. It offers a forum for discussion and coordination among the countries to help manage and share the river's resources.

Joseph Awange is an associate professor in the department of spatial sciences at Curtin University in Australia. Using satellites, he has been monitoring the volume of water in the Nile River and reporting the findings to the Basin countries so they can effectively plan for sustainable use of the river's resources.

Of course, getting all the countries to agree on what they believe is fair and equal use of the Nile's resources is no easy task. ""Lower countries (Egypt and Sudan) rely on some old treaty that they signed with Britain decades ago to impose unrealistic water use conditions to the upper countries,"" said Awange. ""For this reason, some countries, e.g., Ethiopia, have decided to disregard the treaty and are busy constructing large hydropower dams within the Blue Nile.""

Awange is referring to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), currently under construction on the Blue Nile. It is located just over 300 miles northwest of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. When complete, the GERD will be the largest hydroelectric dam in Africa and one of the largest in the world. Controversy has surrounded the project since its beginning in 2011 as downstream nations rely heavily on the Nile's waters for their drinking water, agriculture and industrial needs.

Wildlife

The Nile River and its banks are abundant with many varieties of animal life. These include the rhinoceros, African tigerfish (the ""piranha of Africa""), Nile monitors, enormous Vundu catfish, hippopotamuses, wildebeests, baboons, frogs, mongooses, turtles, tortoises and over 300 species of birds. Hundreds of thousands of water birds spend their winters in the Nile Delta. This includes the world's largest concentrations of little gulls and whiskered terns.

Possibly the most well-known animal — and most feared — is the Nile crocodile. This fearsome predator has a reputation as a man eater and rightly so. Nile crocodiles can reach lengths of 18 to 20 feet, and unlike their American cousins, can be quite aggressive toward people. Estimates say that about 200 people a year are killed by these reptiles, according to National Geographic.

The giraffe, named Asiwa, was one of eight stranded due to days on intense rain that cut off access to the mainland, leaving the herd imprisoned on Longicharo Island.

Asiwa was loaded into the barge made of steel and empty drums, with the help of the team, and then transported four miles down the river to safety.

The group intends to rescue the seven remaining giraffes the same way in the next several weeks.

Wildlife conservationists braved crocodile infested waters to rescue a critically endangered Nubian giraffe trapped on a flooding island in Kenya

The remarkable rescue was organized by Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) today joined forces with the US-based non-profit Save Giraffes Now and an African non-government organization.

Conservationists with KWS, Save Giraffes Now and Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) collaborated with local community members to undertake the monumental task of moving the massive animal to Ruko Community Wildlife Conservancy, a protected wildlife reserve.

Aswia has been brought to safety, however seven more giraffes' lives are in limbo.

There are two juvenile females, Susan and Pasaka that are scheduled to be moved later this week.

The giraffe, named Asiwa, was one of eight stranded due to days on intense rain that cut off access to the mainland, leaving the herd imprisoned on Longicharo Island

The boat was is strong enough to hold a massive giraffe and is designed in a fashion that keeps it from escaping

The four remaining adult females, Nkarikoni, Nalangu, Awala and Nasieku, and one adult male, Lbarnnoti, will be moved early next year.

The area has been plagued with intense rain, which has caused the water level of Lake Baringo, which is surrounding the peninsula, to steadily rising up to six inches a day.

David O'Connor, president of Dallas, Texas-based Save Giraffes Now, said: 'There is great urgency to execute this rescue.'

'We couldn't have asked for a better result, and we're eager to move the others soon. With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters.'

Asiwa was loaded into the barge made of steel and empty drums, with the help of the team, and then transported four miles down the river to safety

The animals are Rothschild's, or Nubian, giraffe, which is a critically endangered subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and into Uganda.

Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya.

Dr. Patrick Omondi, KWS Director Biodiversity Research and Planning, said: 'These giraffes are critical to our ongoing efforts to implement the National Giraffe Recovery Strategy 2020-2025.'

'At Ruko, they'll be protected from predators, poachers and other threats.'

The giraffe were originally reintroduced to the peninsula in 2011, in hopes that the isolated location would provide shelter from poaching and increase the population in their native Western Kenyan range.

Asiwa boarded a custom-made steel barge, then was taken four miles down the river to the 4,400-acre fenced sanctuary within the Ruko Conservancy.

The barge, build by the Ruko community, is designed and built specifically to carry tall, heavy giraffes.

The rectangular steel structure floats atop a series of empty drums and the sides were reinforced to keep the giraffe from jumping out.

Susan Myers, Save Giraffes Now founder and CEO, said: 'Each giraffe has its own personality.'

'Some are very timid, while others are brave and go onto the barge readily. This is a painstaking process, and the team is being very deliberate about the training.'

For years, the local communities of the Baringo Lake region â?? the Pokot and the Ilchamus tribes â?? were in deep and often vicious conflict.

Yet the plight of these giraffe worsened to such a degree that the elders of those tribes in these areas (Rugus and Komolion) put years of warfare aside to unite and protect the giraffe.

The area has been plagued with intense rain, which has caused the water level of Lake Baringo, which is surrounding the peninsula, to steadily rising up to six inches a day. David O'Connor, president of Dallas, Texas-based Save Giraffes Now, said: 'There is great urgency to execute this rescue'

Conservancy rangers have been taking supplemental food to the island for them, as well as conducting routine health checks

Mike Parkei, a ranger at Ruko Conservancy, said: 'These giraffe are the heart of our homeland.

'We knew we had to come together and do everything possible to save them.'

As the lake water slowly claimed the peninsula, the giraffe were forced onto a shrinking slice of land on which to forage.

Conservancy rangers have been taking supplemental food to the island for them, as well as conducting routine health checks.

Nkarikoni is also pregnant, seven months into a 15-month gestation and officials hope she will give birth at Ruko Conservancy.

'In 40 to 50 years, we hope to have repopulated the entire Western Rift Valley through the chain of community conservancies,' O'Connor said. 'It's unthinkable to imagine an Africa without giraffes, and this rescue may well help ensure the future of this species.'

In a trial run for the larger move, several other animals were recently relocated to Ruko, including two rather aggressive ostriches and a handful of impala and warthogs.",2020-12-02 08:00:00+00:00,"['nubian', 'barge', 'giraffe', 'conservationists', '16foot', 'ruko', 'island', 'save', 'rescue', 'peninsula', 'stranded', 'steel', 'kenya', 'community', 'flooding', 'giraffes', 'wildlife']",Kenya,news article,English

1813,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Pandemic delays gender parity by a generation: WEF - Macau Business,https://www.macaubusiness.com/pandemic-delays-gender-parity-by-a-generation-wef/,"The pandemic has rolled back years of progress towards equality between men and women, according to a report released Wednesday showing the crisis had added decades to the trajectory towards closing the gender gap.

A range of studies have shown that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women, who have lost jobs at a higher rate than men, and had to take on much more of the extra childcare burden when schools closed.

The effects will be felt in the long-term, according to the World Economic Forum, which in its annual Global Gender Gap Report found that the goalposts for gender parity appeared to be moving further away.

The organisation, which usually gathers the global elite in the plush Swiss ski resort of Davos each year, had found in its previous report, published in December 2019 right before the pandemic hit, that gender parity across a range of areas would be reached within 99.5 years.

But this year’s report shows the world is not on track to close the gender gap for another 135.6 years.

“Another generation of women will have to wait for gender parity,” the WEF said in a statement.

The Geneva-based organisation’s annual report tracks disparities between the sexes in 156 countries across four areas: education, health, economic opportunity and political empowerment.

– Workplace equality in 267 years –

On the plus side, women appear to be gradually closing the gender gap in areas such as health and education.

But inequality in the workplace — which has long appeared to be the stickiest area to fix — is still not expected to be erased for another 267.6 years.

And the pandemic has not helped.

The WEF pointed to a study by the UN’s International Labour Organization showing that women were more likely to lose their jobs in the crisis, in part because they are disproportionately represented in sectors directly disrupted by lockdowns.

Other surveys have shown that women were carrying a greater share of the burden of increased housework and childcare during lockdowns, contributing to higher stress and lower productivity levels.

Women were also being hired back at a slower rate than men as workplaces opened up again, according to LinkedIn data referenced in the report.

“The pandemic has fundamentally impacted gender equality in both the workplace and the home, rolling back years of progress,” WEF managing director Saadia Zahidi said in the statement.

“If we want a dynamic future economy, it is vital for women to be represented in the jobs of tomorrow,” she said, stressing that “this is the moment to embed gender parity by design into the recovery.”

– Political gender gap growing –

It was in the political sphere that the march towards gender parity did the biggest about-face, with several large-population countries seeing the political gender gap widen, the WEF study found.

Women still hold just over a quarter of parliamentary seats worldwide, and only 22.6 percent of ministerial positions.

On its current trajectory, the political gender gap is not expected to close completely for another 145.5 years, the report found.

That marks a 50-percent hike from the estimated 95 years in the 2020 report, WEF pointed out.

Progress across the categories varies greatly in different countries and regions.

The report pointed out that while Western European countries could close their overall gender gap in 52.1 years, countries in the Middle East and North Africa will take nearly 142.4 years to do so.

Overall, the Nordic countries once again dominated the top of the table: the gap between men and women was narrowest in Iceland, for the 12th year running, followed by Finland and Norway.

New Zealand took fourth place, ahead of Sweden.

But how many strikes of lightning did we see and why was there no rain with that storm?

The Bighorn Fire was started naturally by a dry thunderstorm over Oro Valley that produced more than 25 lightning strikes in under 30 minutes. But no rain poured down in the area that day.

""The reason why they are dry is because the dew point hasn't reached the sweet spot needed to deliver us rain,"" Chief Meteorologist Matt Brode said.

According to the Tucson National Weather Service, storms like these are common in the weeks leading up to the monsoon.

""We can still get thunderstorm development,"" Ken Drozd of NWS Tucson said. ""But since there is not a lot of lower-level moisture, those storms will not produce a lot of rainfall at the surface.""

Brode continued, ""We can actually have good thunderstorms. We can have lightning coming out of the clouds. We can have thunder and gusty winds. But if you have very dry lower levels of the atmosphere despite the fact that it might be raining up high, it's just going to evaporate before it reaches the ground.""

The west wind Southern Arizona saw and the mountains also contributed to the thunderstorm development.

""During the hot part of the day, you get air to rise,"" Drozd said. ""It's going to be push up going through the valley and against the mountain and lifting upward.""

That upward lift also caused more lightning to develop in the storm. Lightning is caused when a storm is so tall that ice crystals start to develop in the clouds.

Those crystals then rub against each other creating static electricity. If you get enough static, that could cause a lightning strike.",2020-07-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['30minute', 'going', 'rain', 'bighorn', 'dry', 'tucson', 'lightning', 'valley', 'strike', 'started', 'thunderstorm', 'strikes']",India,news article,English

REUTERS/Sivaram V/Files

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India saw 18% more rainfall than average in June as the monsoon covered the entire country nearly two weeks earlier than usual, the state-run weather office said on Tuesday.

Monsoons deliver about 70% of India’s annual rainfall and are the lifeblood of its $2.9 trillion economy, spurring farm output and boosting rural spending on items ranging from gold to cars, motorcycles and refrigerators.

Soybean, pulses and cotton-growing regions in central and western India saw 31% more rainfall in June, while rice, coffee, rubber and tea growing southern India saw 8% higher rainfall, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.

A good start to the June-September monsoon season has accelerated planting of summer-sown crops, with farmers sowing crops on 31.56 million hectares as of June 26, doubling from 2019, when the monsoon arrived late.

Cotton sowing was up 165%, while rice planting rose by 35% during the period.

India is the world’s biggest exporter of rice and the biggest cotton producer. A rise in rice and cotton production could lead to higher exports of both products.

Oilseed plantings have risen 525% from a year ago, which could help the world’s biggest edible oil importer reduce imports.

India is likely to see above average monsoon rainfall even in July, a crucial month for sowing of summer crops, said an official with IMD, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.

IMD said last month that India is likely to see above average monsoon rain for the second straight year in 2020, boosting hopes for higher farm output in an economy reeling under the impact of the coronavirus.",2020-06-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['rainfall', 'average', 'sees', 'higher', 'crop', 'saw', 'accelerating', 'rice', 'biggest', 'crops', 'sowing', 'india', 'monsoon']",India,news article,English

Over 56,000 people have been affected in various cities and rural areas in Golestan and Mazandaran as a result of heavy rainfall that hit the two provinces on March 19 and 20. The severe flooding has so far killed at least five people.

On Monday, Iranian social media users launched an online effort using the Persian hashtag #رفیق_گلستان_باشیم (Let’s be friends with Golestan) in coordination with the Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation (IKRF).

The campaign is aimed at raising money and gathering basic commodities required to start the reconstruction and rehousing operations. IKRF offices around the country are ready to receive the aid items and deliver them to the flooded areas.

The Iranian Red Crescent Society, a non-governmental organization (NGO), launched a similar campaign on Sunday.

Residents in Aqqala in Iran's Golestan province are moved to safety.

On Saturday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei called on officials and the nation to assist the flood-affected people.

The Leader’s official website has since been updated with a new feature that allows direct contribution to relief efforts.

Iranian celebrity figures have also joined in on the effort by encouraging their huge online fanbase to help relieve the difficult situation.

It was reported on Monday that donors have already contributed large sums of money to speed up the reconstruction process in Mazandaran.

Senior official Kamal Akbari said the Ministry of Interior had received numerous requests from NGOs offering voluntary aid services in flood-hit areas, adding they will begin their work from Tuesday.

Armed forces at work

Major General Mohammad Baqeri, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said Saturday that he had ordered additional and coordinated efforts to help the relief campaign.

Commander of Iran's Basij resistance force Gholamhossein Gheybparvar speaks to residents in Aqqala which has been inundated by historic floods.

He has authorized commanders in the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), the Iranian army, police, and the defense ministry to use forces under their command to provide “full and organized” assistance in flood-hit areas in a coordinated manner.

Baqeri has appointed his deputy, Major General Ataollah Salehi, as the field commander at the head of a group of high-ranking military chiefs to coordinate relief efforts between the armed forces and civilian organizations on the ground.

Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, who has been touring the flood-hit regions, told reporters that relief efforts have been going forward at a strong pace thanks to coordination among all sides.

Authorities in Aqqala, one of the cities hardest hit by flooding, said they had to detonate a small part of the railway network in the area in order to speed up drainage and prevent greater damage to the tracks.

During the operation, explosives were placed underneath the tracks to help drain the flood waters.

Guwahati: Most in the Bhawraguri village of Kokrajhar, about 190km from here, had taken a chance and made their way out of the flooded hamlet on banana rafts. It's dangerous, exhausting and barely a guarantee for safety. Nirmali Ray, 60, decided to wait it out. And it helped.

Within 24 hours since Wednesday, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) sprung into action and rescued her and more than 3,000 others like her.

""The weather suddenly turned favourable. We wasted no time. Rescue operations were conducted in full swing in Kokrajhar district. People stranded in their houses - mostly older people, women and children - are being evacuated,"" said Rajib Kalita, an SDRF personnel deployed in the rescue operations.

Besides SDRF, the National Disaster Response Force and the Army have been at work across flooded Assam .

""At least 100 rescue boats were deployed in the flood-affected districts of lower Assam. In Kokrajhar district alone, some 1056 persons were rescued since Wednesday. Some six boats of SDRF, NDRF and state fire and emergency service were working round the clock in Kokrajhar district,"" a report released by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said.

On Wednesday alone, around 2,026 persons were evacuated across the state.

Official figures also highlighted that on Thursday alone, some 1,072 people were rescued from various locations of Baksa, Nalbari, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri and Morigaon district.

The highest number of people were rescued in Kokrajhar district (459), followed by Nalbari (271).

According to the latest report of the Central Water Commission (CWC), rivers like the Manas, Beki and Gaurang were flowing in the severe flood situation in the districts of Baksa, Kamrup, Nalbari, Barpeta, Kokrajhar and Dhubri.

The situation will continue in severe to above normal flood for the next two to three days, the CWC said.

Till now, 833 relief camps are operational in 13 districts - Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, Goalpara, Kamrup, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat and Jorhat . Besides, 102 relief distribution centres have been set up in Lakhimpur, Darrang, Barpeta, Kokrajhar, Kamrup, Morigaon and Sivasagar districts.

Five rivers continue to flow in spate - the Brahmaputra at Nematighat and Dhubri, the Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur, the Puthimari at NH Road Crossing in Kamrup, the Manas at NH Road Crossing in Barpeta and the Beki at Road Bridge in Barpeta.

Robert Lewandowski broke a dry spell that spanned 208 minutes by firing home from the penalty spot against Real Madrid

Bayern Munich are teetering on the brink in the Champions League, and the German giants can point to a recent lack of goals as the principal culprit.

Dani Alves rules out Barca return

After opening the scoring against Real Madrid through Arturo Vidal last week, Bayern conceded a Cristiano Ronaldo brace to go down 2-1.

Having drawn a blank at the weekend away to Leverkusen, the return of Robert Lewandowski failed to inspire the Bavarians to a breakthrough in the Champions League second leg as they went into half-time 0-0.

KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western Ugandan district of Rubanda on Saturday, police said here Sunday.

Elly Maate, the Kigezi regional police spokesperson in a statement, said two female juveniles were swept away by running water at Karengyere village, Muko Sub County, amid a heavy down pour.

""Police in Muko received information that two female juveniles were yesterday (Saturday) swept by running water amid heavy down pour. Bodies were retrieved pending postmortem,"" said Maate.

Several parts of the east African country, especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects, according to the weather department.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.

On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.

The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.

The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.

On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh 400-500 mm, Quang Tri 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City 1,100 mm, Quang Nam 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai 600-800 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In this period, more than 130,000 houses, mostly in Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue provinces had been flooded, with some submerged by four meters.

Streak of tragedies

Around 3 a.m. on October 8, cargo vessel Vietship 01 of a Hanoi-based logistics firm was swept away by floods and rough seas as it docked at Cua Viet Port in Quang Tri.

The ship had 12 male crew members on board when swept off. Four crew members who had fallen from the vessel made it safely to shore on October 9 and 10. One member, aged 45, had also jumped into the water but went missing before his body was retrieved on October 11.

Heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas derailed rescue efforts and the vessel sank to the bottom in shallow waters, leaving the rest of the crew and one fisherman, part of a rescue squad, stranded at sea.

It took rescue teams three days to reach the stranded vessel.

""It was difficult for modern vessels to reach the stranded ship so we had to rely on rudimentary boats and experienced fishermen for the mission,"" explained Colonel Le Van Phuong, head of Quang Tri Border Guard.

On the morning of October 11, the fisherman and a crew member jumped into the water and battled their way back through the rough seas and strong waves. Two teams of rescuers rushed to deliver them safely to shore.

Within the same day, a military helicopter was sent to the scene to rescue the remaining six crew members stuck on the vessel. Two days after he was rescued, however, ship captain Nguyen Van Bao, 51, passed away due to multiple organ failure and sepsis.

At midnight on October 12, a hill collapsed onto an operation center of Rao Trang 3 Hydropower Plant, located deep in a jungle of Phong Xuan Commune, Phong Dien District in Thua Thien-Hue.

The landslide buried 17 workers after 40 others escape to a nearby plant, called Rao Trang 4.

The story of the 17 workers is even more tragic since a 21-member rescue team that had set out to verify reports of their predicament got struck by the same calamity.

At midnight the next day, a landslide had buried the ranger station housing the entire rescue team. Only eight members managed to escape, with the remaining 13 confirmed dead, including Major General Nguyen Van Man, deputy commander of the 4th Military Region of Vietnam People's Army. The bodies of the 13 victims have all been found and identified, though only five of the 17 workers' bodies have been retrieved.

During funeral procedures for the 12 soldiers and their deputy commander, another landslide struck a barracks housing 27 personnel of Defense Economics Division 337, also managed by the 4th Military Region.

The division had been assigned to assist five remote communes in Huong Hoa District of Quang Tri, which borders Laos, in mitigating the impacts of prolonged flooding and landslides triggered by abnormally heavy downpours across the central region.

As the mountain collapsed onto their barracks in the first hours of October 19, the 27 division members were all sleeping, with only five managing to escape. Three more landslides buried the remaining 22.

By the afternoon of that day, all 22 bodies had been retrieved.

Luong Thi Ly, who lost her son Le The Linh to the landslide, said she could not believe he and his comrades had lost their lives during peace time.

New flood waves

And as mountainous areas reeled under repeated landslides, urban and coastal areas were hit by a new wave of flooding on October 18 and 20 due to the impact of tropical storms, the intertropical convergence zone and east winds in tandem with water discharged from dam projects.

On October 18, flood peaks recorded on the Hieu River of Quang Tri hit 5.36 m, passing the record level of 1983 by 0.78 m, while the peak on the Thach Han River rose to 7.4 m, 0.11 m higher than the 1999 record. In Quang Binh, floodwaters were measured at 4.88 m on October 19, or 0.97 m higher than the record in 1999.

For the second flood wave, more than 177,000 households in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri were inundated by floodwaters 1-4 m deep.

Many elderly people in Ha Tinh said for the past 40 years, they had never seen such severe flooding causing such serious damage.

In Quang Binh's Le Thuy District, a family who lost their 75-year-old grandmother, on October 17, had to hang her coffin from the roof of their house for nearly a week to avoid floodwaters.

More storms, floods and landslides

With heavy rains yet to show any signs of receding, Storm Saudel developed in the East Sea on October 20, though it had weakened and turned into a tropical depression as it reached the central coast on October 25.

Two days later, Molave entered the East Sea and headed straight to central Vietnam. It landed over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28 as the most powerful storm to have hit Vietnam in 20 years.

The storm had inflicted economic damage worth around VND10 trillion ($430.16 million), according to statistics from affected provinces. The loss was nearly 1.5 times higher than 2019s total natural disaster-induced damage of VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), mostly ascribed to flooding, storms and landslides.

Subsequently, the storm triggered heavy rains that had led to more floods and landslides.

On October 28 alone, two different landslides struck Tra Leng and Tra Van communes in Quang Nams Nam Tra My District.

The Tra Van landslide buried 20, killing eight and injuring 12 while in Tra Leng, a mountain collapsed on 53 villagers, with 33 managing to escape, eight confirmed dead, and 12 still missing.

One day later in Phuoc Loc Commune, Phuoc Son District of Quang Nam, another landslide buried 11 victims. Seven have since been confirmed dead and four are still missing.

A survivor of the Tra Leng landslide, Nguyen Thanh Son, 56, had lost his wife to the accident. The bereaved husband cannot believe he has lost his family, house and entire village in the mere blink of an eye.

""Altogether, tumbling soil, mud, rocks, water and trees smashed in the roofs of our houses, sweeping everything away until hitting the foot of another mountain,"" Son recalled.

By the night of October 28, more than 4,000 families in Nghe An and Ha Tinh had been evacuated to safety after their neighborhoods had been submerged by up to two meters of water.

The third flood lasted until October 30 and by November 1, had receded.

While central Vietnam residents recuperate from Storm Molave and prior flooding, Storm Goni entered the East Sea on Monday morning, forecast to strike central areas from Da Nang to Phu Yen in the next few days.",2020-11-03 08:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'quang', 'central', 'landslide', 'month', 'tragedies', 'mm', 'crew', 'storm', 'rescue', 'day', 'm']",Vietnam,news article,English

“Egypt stands by her brothers in Sudan to counter the ramifications of this accident on the basis of the brotherly ties between the people of the Nile Valley, the historical relations and the sharing of the same course and destiny that all bring the two countries together,” the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a Sunday statement.



The dam contained about 5 million cubic meters of irrigation and drinking water. Its collapse threaten the displacement of thousands in the Blue Nile state, not only because of the severe damages, but also because the area hosts a major market and nine schools and has been a safe haven for the displaced from all over the state, Sky News Arabia quoted Sudanese official Nasiba Colul as saying.

CAIRO - 27 November 2017: Years ago, Gamal Abdel Nasser; Egyptian former leader, instructed to build Egypt’s biggest national project: the High Dam. Do displaced Nubian migrants deem the dam as great or it is true that every pro has a con?The High Dam was built under the name of Aswan Dam. It was mainly meant to generate power and regulate the seasonal flooding of the Nile. Being one of the former leader’s greatest achievements, for the Egyptians, especially the farmers, the dam was the dream that came true as they have suffered for years from the loss of their crops due to the seasonal unexpected floods.The establishment of the Dam started with Aswan Dam/reservoir in 1902. The increasing rate of water flow behind the dam flooded 44 Nubian villages and displaced 18000 Nubian families in the aftermath. The area is known now as “old Nubia.”Nostalgic were the Nubians who deserted their houses and saw them sink beneath the rising water, they had to migrate to Kom Ambo area known as “New Nubia.” The biggest migration took place when the construction of the High Dam occurred in 1963. Nubians witnessed a shift in the way of life around the Nile view to a new desert life in villages built for them in Kom Ambo.As sad as the story might sound, the full half of the cup is that the old Nubian Area is full of picturesque remains and main attractions made the place as a main destination for tourists worldwide.Amada Temple, the oldest Egyptian temple in old Nubia built in the eighteenth century and located 180 KM behind High Dam. Though small and abandoned, Amada contains some important inscriptions. For instance, some inscriptions on one of the temple’s columns describes Amenhotep II leading an Egyptian military campaign into Asia, and bringing back the bodies of rebel chieftains to hang on the walls of Thebes. On another column a story describes his ship sailing through Nubia as a warning for his rivals.Qasr Ibrim is an archeological site in old Nubia. It was originally a major city perched on a cliff above the Nile, but the flooding of Nasser's Lake after the construction of Aswan High Dam transformed it into an island and flooded its outskirts. Ibrim stands as the only major archaeological site in old Nubia to have survived the Nile floods.Ramses II Temple in Abu Simbel is one of Egypt’s most famous archeological sites and a top attraction for visitors despite its far distance from Cairo. The temple was designed in the 13th Century BC to strike awe into travelers, introducing them to the grandeur of Egyptian culture. The four largest statues in front are Ramses II, and the smaller ones next to them are fashioned to resemble his favorite wife, Nefertari and Prince Amonherkhepshef, his son. Egyptian engineers moved the temple block by block to save it from the rising waters of Nasser Lake in the late 1960.",2017-11-27 08:00:00+00:00,"['nubian', 'old', 'egyptian', 'temple', 'high', 'page', 'nubias', 'aswan', 'nile', 'dam', 'memories', 'bittersweet', 'nubia']",Egypt,news article,English

As our world becomes warmer the chances of climate extremes, such as droughts and floods, become greater.

We can’t control the weather, but we can manage the water. A technique known as managed aquifer recharge, where flood water is captured and injected into aquifers, is already helping the US state of Texas ride out the worst of its weather extremes.

Gentle drizzle is good at recharging aquifers, but heavy rain tends to run across the surface and ultimately ends up back in the sea. Managed aquifer storage diverts and captures some of that flood water, by storing it temporarily at the surface and then injecting it gradually into depleted underlying aquifers.

More than 1,000 such schemes already exist worldwide and now a study in Texas (which has three managed aquifer storage schemes) has demonstrated the potential of this technique.

Weather and river data from the past 50 years suggest that if flood-capture systems were installed on the 10 major rivers discharging into the Gulf of Mexico, Texas could replenish much of its depleted groundwater in just a few years.",2019-08-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['texas', 'schemes', 'ride', 'water', 'weather', 'storage', 'captured', 'weatherwatch', 'minute', 'managed', 'aquifer', 'storms', 'rain', 'surface', 'help', 'flood']",Ghana,news article,English
1853,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Skies Turn Black as Billions of Locusts Take Flight; Emergency Declared - Weatherboy,https://weatherboy.com/skies-turn-black-as-billions-of-locusts-take-flight-emergency-declared/,"Swarms of locusts are taking flight over portions of Africa, turning the afternoon sky dark, prompting authorities to issue state of emergency declarations there. Similar to an outbreak that happened there last spring, local officials say the clouds of hundreds of billions of locusts are harming the food supply of people there.









Locusts are a collection of short-horned grasshoppers that go through a swarming phase. In great numbers, they can wipe-out crops, harming the food supply needed by people. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, locusts don’t attack humans or animals and there doesn’t seem to be evidence that they carry diseases that could harm humans. Nevertheless, because of their sheer number, it’s difficult to walk outside without getting locusts in your mouth, in your hair, and in your clothes.

This week, Namibia appears to be hit hard. Local elected official Immanuel Shikongo told the newspaper “The Namibian” that many crops have been destroyed there this week. Beyond eating crops that humans eat, they’re also decimating grasses that grazing animals depend on for their feed. In his interview with the newspaper, he said, “I would like to urge our people to yell and burn tyres when they see locusts in their mahangu fields.” Local police have also been using their sirens to help spook the locusts away.

Swarms of locusts impacted Angola earlier this month, Kenya in March, and Somalia in February.











Wet weather could be to blame for the locust outbreaks. Experts believe that tropical cyclones that left portions of the continent wetter than usual in 2018 followed by warmer than usual temperatures in 2019 helped spawn the massive population of locusts that hit eastern Africa, portions of the Middle East, and southeastern Asia last year. In November of last year, Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Gati made landfall in Somalia, making it the most powerful tropical cyclone to make landfall there. Scientists believe the moisture left behind by the massive storm helped create the locust problem that exists today.









“At no other point in history have agri-food systems confronted such an array of new and unprecedented threats, including megafires, extreme weather, unusually large desert locust swarms, and emerging biological threats like the COVID-19 pandemic,” FAO said.

“These hazards not only take lives but also devastate agricultural livelihoods and inflict cascading negative economic consequences… that can endure for generations,” it added.

By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja

A bill seeking to amend the fire service act of 1963 and include other natural disasters as emergencies to be given urgent attention has passed for second reading in the House of Representatives.

The bill is titled An Act to repeal the Fire Service Act Cap. F29 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and enact the Fire and Emergency Service Act 2021 to provide for additional powers for effective service delivery; and for related matters.

The non-fire occurrences listed by the bill needing emergency rescue included flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters.

The sponsor of the bill is Rep. Adejoro Adeogun Akoko South East: South West Federal Constituency of Ondo State.

Leading the debate on the general principle of the bill at Tuesday plenary, Adeogun said that the bill when passed into law would provide stricter penalties for violation of building codes and fire regulations.

He said: The fire service act (1963) saddled the Fire service with the responsibility of mitigating fire disasters and combating fire emergencies. This narrow scope of responsibility precludes non-fire disasters such as flooding, building collapse, air and road accidents and other natural disasters that may or may not be accompanied by fire and for which emergency rescue is required.

Also read:

This bill addresses this gap by expanding the scope of responsibilities of the fire service to include fire and non-fire related emergencies such as flooding, building collapse, construction site accidents, mining collapse, and related land, sea and air accidents.

This bill also seeks to introduce stricter penalties for violation of building codes, fire regulations, impersonation of fire service personnel and unlawful disclosure of privileged information obtained in the course of emergencies.

According to the lawmaker, the goals of the bill are essential to prevent and mitigate all fire disasters as well as accidents occasioned by flooding, construction accidents, road and air accidents and other preventable disasters; encourage investment in fire and emergency equipment by States, Local government councils and corporate organizations to improve response to emergencies; establish the office of the Fire and emergency Chief for day to day management of the activities of the Fire and emergency service; empower the Fire and emergency service chief to mobilize resources for the training, equipping and deployment of fire and emergency personnel for prompt response to emergencies; and provide for the establishment of a Fire and Emergency Service Reward Fund to reward fire and emergency fire officer.

Mr Speaker, Hon. colleagues, the major achievements of this amendment bill, if passed would be to build the capacity of the fire and emergency service to respond to disasters with greater synergy and efficiency.

It will also elevate the fire and emergency service from the backend to the frontline of disaster management. The bill will also open new frontiers for the creation of jobs through the engagement of able-bodied youths into the fire and emergency service.

Nigeria has in the past lost lives and billion-dollar assets to fire, flood and similar disasters. This bill hopes to lay the foundation for mitigating of future disasters and saving the nation from avoidable loss of lives and resources. I am therefore seeking the support of all distinguished Honorable members of this house for the second reading of this bill and eventual passage, Adeogun submitted.

The bill eventually received the overwhelming support of the House majority when subjected to a voice vote by the presiding officer, Ahmed Idris Wase and passed for second reading.

2231,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Vietnam Airlines Flies Over 24 Tons Of Aid To Flood-Affected Areas - Simple Flying,https://simpleflying.com/vietnam-airlines-aid-floods/,"Vietnam Airlines has flown over 24 tons of aid to flood-impacted areas in Vietnam. After devastating storms and floods, the airline worked to transport thousands of aid packages to help areas in central Vietnam.

Aid transportation

Vietnam Airlines flew over 24 tons of goods and more than 2,000 packages from organizations like the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee, the Red Cross, and individual donations, among others, to support operations in central Vietnam in cities like Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi.

This is just part of Vietnam Airlines aid operations. The airline is expecting to fly more than 100 tons of cargo to support relief operations.

Vietnam Airlines, along with its affiliates, is receiving and transporting goods to Central Vietnam free of charge.

Stay informed: Sign up for our daily aviation news digest.

For passengers, Vietnam Airlines is also giving people to Vinh, Hue, and Dong Hoi one extra free bag in addition to their class of service baggage allowance. This will allow passengers to also fly with additional relief items or essential items.

Vietnam Airlines is expecting to fly over 10,000 pieces of luggage free of charge. This will help those who are bringing relief items to the region.

Central Vietnam is facing awful flooding

Devastating floods, some of the most severe in decades, according to CNN, have claimed over 100 lives and led to immense destruction. Over 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and over 691,000 cattle and poultry have either been killed or swept away. Hundreds of thousands of meters of roadways have also been damaged.

In addition to the flooding, landslides have also caused deaths and damage. However, Vietnam, which is no stranger to rain and typhoons, became overwhelmed after facing a particularly fierce set of storms.

Relief agencies rely on airlines to help transport goods and people. Another set of storms is, including a tropical storm, made its way to Vietnam this last weekend as well.

For the flag carrier of Vietnam, it was now time to step up and fly relief. After facing some operational disruptions due to the storm, the carrier became one lifeline to bring much-needed supplies to the region.

Airlines and aid flights

Over the last few months, aid flights have become common when it came to transporting medical supplies. However, airlines are no strangers when it comes to running aid and relief flights.

Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines partnered to send 20,000 pounds of aid on a brand new Boeing 787. Emirates has flown tens of thousands of kilograms of aid to Lebanon since a blast rocked Beirut.

Flag carriers, in particular, tend to step up when the country needs airlines to fly in (or fly out) people and supplies. Vietnam Airlines has used aircraft, like the ATR 72, to fly in aid.

675,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,This new solar-powered device can pull water straight from the desert air - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/new-solar-powered-device-can-pull-water-straight-desert-air,"This new solar-powered device can pull water straight from the desert air

You can’t squeeze blood from a stone, but wringing water from the desert sky is now possible, thanks to a new spongelike device that uses sunlight to suck water vapor from air, even in low humidity. The device can produce nearly 3 liters of water per day for every kilogram of spongelike absorber it contains, and researchers say future versions will be even better. That means homes in the driest parts of the world could soon have a solar-powered appliance capable of delivering all the water they need, offering relief to billions of people.

There are an estimated 13 trillion liters of water floating in the atmosphere at any one time, equivalent to 10% of all of the freshwater in our planet’s lakes and rivers. Over the years, researchers have developed ways to grab a few trickles, such as using fine nets to wick water from fog banks, or power-hungry dehumidifiers to condense it out of the air. But both approaches require either very humid air or far too much electricity to be broadly useful.

To find an all-purpose solution, researchers led by Omar Yaghi, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, turned to a family of crystalline powders called metal organic frameworks, or MOFs. Yaghi developed the first MOFs—porous crystals that form continuous 3D networks—more than 20 years ago. The networks assemble in a Tinkertoy-like fashion from metal atoms that act as the hubs and sticklike organic compounds that link the hubs together. By choosing different metals and organics, chemists can dial in the properties of each MOF, controlling what gases bind to them, and how strongly they hold on.

Over the past 2 decades chemists have synthesized more than 20,000 MOFs, each with unique molecule-grabbing properties. For example, Yaghi and others recently designed MOFs that absorb—and later release—methane, making them a type of high-capacity gas tank for natural gas–powered vehicles.

In 2014, Yaghi and his colleagues synthesized a MOF that excelled at absorbing water, even under low-humidity conditions. That led him to reach out to Evelyn Wang, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, with whom he had previously worked on a project to use MOFs in automobile air conditioning. After synthesizing the new zirconium-based MOF, dubbed MOF-801, Yaghi met Wang at MIT and said, “Evelyn we have to come up with a water-harvesting device.” She agreed to give it a shot.

Device pulls water from the air At night setup soaks up water vapor from air, and uses heat from the sun to release it as liquid water during the day.

The system Wang and her students designed consists of a kilogram of dust-sized MOF crystals pressed into a thin sheet of porous copper metal. That sheet is placed between a solar absorber and a condenser plate and positioned inside a chamber. At night the chamber is opened, allowing ambient air to diffuse through the porous MOF and water molecules to stick to its interior surfaces, gathering in groups of eight to form tiny cubic droplets. In the morning, the chamber is closed, and sunlight entering through a window on top of the device then heats up the MOF, which liberates the water droplets and drives them—as vapor—toward the cooler condenser. The temperature difference, as well as the high humidity inside the chamber, causes the vapor to condense as liquid water, which drips into a collector. The setup works so well that it pulls 2.8 liters of water out of the air per day for every kilogram of MOF it contained, the Berkeley and MIT team reports today in Science .

“It has been a longstanding dream” to harvest water from desert air, says Mercouri Kanatzidis, a chemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who wasn’t involved with the work. “This demonstration … is a significant proof of concept.” It’s also one that Yaghi says has plenty of room for improvement. For starters, zirconium costs $150 a kilogram, making water-harvesting devices too expensive to be broadly useful. However, Yaghi says his group has already had early success in designing water-grabbing MOFs that replace zirconium with aluminum, a metal that is 100 times cheaper. That could make future water harvesters cheap enough not only to slake the thirst of people in arid regions, but perhaps even supply water to farmers in the desert.

More than 30,000 people are estimated to have fled the Kokang Self Administered Zone after fighting erupted on 6 March between the Myanmar Military and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army. Fighting continues around Laukkai. The Government of China and humanitarian partners confirmed the arrival of more than 20,000 people across the border. In addition, humanitarian organizations estimate more than 10,000 migrant workers left Laukkai to return home to other parts of the country. In another incident, at least four civilians were reported to have been killed in fighting between the Myanmar Military and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army in Kutkai Township in northern Shan State.

On 13 March, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck north of Yangon at a depth of 10 km. The earthquake killed two people and injured 36 people. Homes, offices and religious structures were damaged in Taik Kyi near the epicentre of the tremor.

PHILIPPINES

As of 15 March, nearly 8,000 people remain displaced (6,400 inside evacuation centres) in the town of Datu Salibo (Maguindanao province) as a result of continuing law enforcement operations against non-state armed actors that began on 13 March. The municipal social welfare office is providing relief assistance with support from the regional DSWD offices.

Local health clinics are also continuing to monitor the health status of the displaced people.

As of 4 March, Bangladesh confirmed that 384 undocumented Myanmar nationals returned to Myanmar through the Damdamia check point. With the fluid movements along the border, verifying the returns, however, remains a challenge. Additional WASH services and facilities are urgently needed by the new arrivals particularly in Kutipalong and Balukhali.

2403,FL-2017-000067-BRA,IPB Expert Dissects Situation as Brazil Wins WTO Poultry Trade Lawsuit - Tempo.co English,https://en.tempo.co/read/1459239/ipb-expert-dissects-situation-as-brazil-wins-wto-poultry-trade-lawsuit,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Brazilian chicken meat products will likely start to flood the Indonesian market after Indonesia lost the lawsuit filed by Brazil at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on poultry products trade barriers. It effectively forces Indonesia to open its imports from the Latin American country.

According to IPB University’s animal husbandry faculty lecturer Rudi Afnan, as written in a statement released in the university’s website ipb.ac.id, the chicken meat imports from Brazil may likely threaten local chicken farmers. Rudi argued it is best for Indonesia to halt poultry product imports.

“This is closely related to the issue of policy in international trade where we are obliged to accept chicken imports from Brazil. Meanwhile, we have self-supported our need for broiler meat since 2008 and have even succeeded in exporting,” the lecturer wrote.

Due to its production capacity, he said, Brazil plans to export poultry products to Indonesia with a relatively low price of Rp14,000/kilograms. Rudi believes that it will make it difficult for Indonesian poultry farmers to compete.

He said one of the solutions is through production efficiency, which can be a tall order as local whole chicken products sold around Rp30,000-40,000 per kilogram while local broiler chicken is sold around Rp14,000 per kilogram. Another solution is for the government to provide subsidies to Indonesian chicken farmers.

epa02686856 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (2-L), Chinese President Hu Jintao (3-L) gestures as they chat while Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (L), Brazilian President Dilma Vana Rousseff (2-R) and South African President Jacob Zuma looks on at a joint press conference during the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) Summit in Sanya, Hainan Province, China 14 April 2011. Leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa held talks on 14 April aimed at coordinating their positions on the global economy and other international issues, host nation China said. EPA/HOW HWEE YOUNG / POOL Since 9/11, Western economies have stagnated while the BRICs – Brazil, Russia, India, and China – are surging [EPA]

Ten years after 9/11, the instant history is being written. In the French newspaper Le Monde, a highly intelligent commemorative supplement dubbed the period “The Decade of bin Laden”. But is that right?

In the ten years since 9/11, the combined GDP of Brazil, Russia, India, and China (the BRICs) rose from 8.4 per cent of the global economy to 18.3 per cent. Anglo-Saxon-style capitalism crashed.

Moreover, it was the decade when Internet access went global – from 360 million people in 2000 to more than 2 billion people today. It was a time when the war in Iraq divided the world, but also when a civilian surge for freedom finally hit the Middle East, as millions of Muslims turned for inspiration to democratic governance, not global jihad.

None of this was the doing of Osama bin Laden. To be sure, al-Qaeda was (and is) a new and serious kind of threat. Born of 30 years of tumult in the Muslim world, al-Qaeda has a worldview, not just a local view. It aspires not just to change, but to revolution.

Indeed, the notion of a “war on terror” in reply was misguided in part because it allowed people to think that al-Qaeda was just another terrorist group like the IRA, the Baader-Meinhof Gang, or the Red Brigades. It wasn’t – and isn’t. But it also aggrandised Bin Laden’s claim to be a world historical figure.

The fight – led by the United States, with the rest of the West providing lower-key support – has weakened Al Qaeda’s influence and capacity. But it has also been an enforced detour from the vital diplomatic task of building new rules and institutions for an interdependent world.

I don’t see any alternative to our determination, in 2001, to drive the Taliban from control of Afghanistan. The tragedy is that, once that battle was won, the peace was lost. The Bonn Conference of December 2001, which was called to draft a new Afghan constitution, excluded the vanquished. Whereas the US built its own democracy from below, on federalist principles, Afghanistan had imposed upon it one of the most centralised states in the world – despite being one of the world’s most decentralised societies.

Tragically, the signals from former Taliban in their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar were misread. The Taliban, who demanded to be left alone in exchange for staying out of politics, were driven into Pakistan, where they reconvened. The new security threat called for a military response, though the struggle should have been predominantly political and diplomatic.

The best way to understand the current situation comes from an analogy offered by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Foreign policy during the Cold War, she says, was like steering within the Panama Canal; after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was like steering within the English Channel – plenty of water on all sides, but land visible, too. Today, foreign policy is like being on the open seas, with no rules beyond countries’ 200-mile maritime borders, and no land in sight.

If that is right, we face urgent tasks – the first being to reassert diplomacy’s place in international politics. The late US statesman Richard Holbrooke once said to me that the United States since 9/11 had suffered a “militarisation of diplomacy”. We now need the opposite. In a world of asymmetric threats, we should follow the US defense department’s field manual: In counterinsurgency, politics require primacy.

Second, we must rethink our notions of a balance of power, because they no longer concern just states, but also peoples. As the Arab Spring has shown, the ubiquity of information means that future coalitions need to be formed at the micro level, in the villages and valleys of places like Afghanistan and Pakistan, rather than only at the macro level of managing the global system.

Third, we are entering an era of resource scarcity. Aside from the atomic bomb, this is the most dangerous security development in two centuries. If you think the blame game in Europe over Greece is bad, just wait for arguments about who is causing drought and food-price inflation. These are not just “environmental” questions. They are questions of justice and responsibility, and stronger regional and international institutions are needed to address them.

Finally, the West must rediscover the joys of multilateralism and shared sovereignty. That is tough when, in Europe, nobody wants to pay Greece’s bills. But multilateralism is a global insurance policy against abuse of power by any state. The problem is not that the European Union and other multilateral institutions are too strong; it is that they are too weak. Indeed, regional institutions in the Arab world, Africa, Latin America, and East Asia are still in their infancy – and need to grow up fast.

Over the past few centuries, there have been three systems of international order: economic and military domination; a balance of power; and shared sovereignty. They can coexist, as they more or less did in the years after 1945 in various parts of the world. But the US today is on the back foot, economically and militarily. New powers like China and India are rising, not risen, mixing assertiveness with emphasis on their continued “developing” status. Europe, where shared sovereignty has been embraced, is struggling to solve its own problems, never mind becoming a global player.

So no one is in charge. This is all the more problematic at a time when the world’s states and people are more intertwined than ever, as ideas, information, finance, migrants, and problems flow ever more seamlessly across borders.

A century ago, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Norman Angell argued in The Great Illusion that economic security enables military expansion, not vice versa. In fact, neither is achievable without political vision. That is the most important lesson of the post-9/11 decade.

1324,FL-2019-000084-IND,Assam floods: Why we need to act fast to save Kaziranga and its wildlife - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/assam-floods-why-we-need-to-act-fast-to-save-kaziranga-and-its-wildlife/article28720848.ece,"The animal corridors leading to the Karbi Anglong hills — where Kaziranga’s animals would take refuge during the monsoon each year — are now blocked by quarries and hotels

Hamida Khatun, 42, has never visited Kaziranga National Park (KNP), although it is some 900 metres behind her house in Harmoti, Assam. Her populous village adjoins the Bagori range of the wildlife preserve, best known as the address of the greater one-horned rhino.

On the evening of July 18, Khatun froze when she found a tiger by her home. So did the tiger. The tiger was some 10 ft away from Khatun, between her and a tube-well in the backyard to which she was headed to wash her plates. She clanged the steel plates to chase the animal away, and the tiger disappeared into the bushes.

The people of Harmoti are used to the odd deer taking refuge in their village during the annual floods in Kaziranga. But a tiger has never crossed their path in more than four decades. Nor has a rhino or elephant.

What happened after Khatun’s encounter was also unprecedented: angry villagers almost lynched Bagori Range Officer Pankaj Bora and other forest officials who had been trying to guide the animal back to the forest.

They were angry that the foresters had let the tiger lie all day inside scrap dealer Rafiqul Islam’s house. “They should have tranquillised the animal and taken it away instead of endangering our lives,” says Khatun’s 24-year-old son Hafizuddin Sheikh.

The villagers were in no mood to understand that tranquillising was not a good idea for an animal that was probably hungry and tired after having swum through a flood. “We think the tiger slipped into the hills of Karbi Anglong district in the dead of night when there was less traffic on the highway,” says Bora.

A 750 sq. km. stretch of hills in Karbi Anglong, south of NH 37, which runs along the southern periphery of KNP, has been the natural refuge for all animals when the park floods each monsoon. Unfortunately, commercial activities on or close to the animal corridors, especially along the 60 km stretch between Jakhalabandha and Bokakhat towns (on the western and eastern ends of KNP), have forced the animals to take unconventional monsoon migration paths over the years. Within the park, 144 artificial highlands were created for the animals, but they cover only 50 acres.

“Stone quarrying in Karbi Anglong over 15-16 years has virtually blocked some of the corridors, preventing animals from moving higher into the hills. This makes them vulnerable to poachers too,” says environment activist Rohit Choudhury, whose petition in the Supreme Court led to a ban on stone mining this April.

Follow the floods

This year, when forest officials followed a few animals, including rhinos and elephants, they found them foraging around the abandoned stone quarries; they also found tiger pug marks there, underlining the importance of leaving animal corridors alone.

While wildlife activists are encouraged by the fact that wildlife is returning to the areas around the quarries, they point out that the bigger picture is far from heartening. “Floods are necessary for Kaziranga even though they kill scores of animals every year. The park won’t survive without the floods — they replenish the wetlands and grasslands that the region’s flagship species, the rhino, is dependent on,” says N.K. Vasu, former Principal Chief Conservator of Forests. “The water, most importantly, helps drain out aquatic weeds that would otherwise choke the water bodies.” So clearly it’s not the flooding that’s the problem. The biggest problem, as Vasu says, is the “construction and increasing human presence along and around the highway.”

There are, for instance, scores of dhabas, restaurants and guesthouses on a 10 km stretch between the Bagori range office and the Burapahar range office. Many of these, allegedly without permits, came up after KNP was declared a tiger reserve in 2007. The scrap dealer’s shack, where the tiger rested on July 18, was one such structure. Local people say the area also has an illegal cement block-making unit in Najan near Harmoti, whose effluents flow into the Gelubeel water body. The walls built around these structures also hinder animal movement.

Bending rules

“These structures are beyond our jurisdiction. Ideally, the civil administration should intervene,” said a KNP official, speaking anonymously.

While officials of Golaghat and Nagaon districts, which Kaziranga straddles on the southern bank of the Brahmaputra, claim that no land has been bought in the vicinity of the park for more than a decade, local people say that the circle offices have been bending rules to let investors usurp land to expand hotels and other tourism-related activities. Dhabas, for example, have virtually turned into truck terminals.

River Diffolu, Kaziranga’s lifeline, has suffered because of contamination of some of its tributaries by stone mining in the hills. “Quarrying affects the water quality, impacting wildlife habitats in and around Kaziranga,” says a report by the Divisional Forest Officer of Eastern Assam wildlife division, which was sent to the national park director last June.

Much of Kaziranga’s existence, since it was made a ‘Proposed Reserve Forest’ in June 1905, has depended on the cooperation of people who live along its periphery. Over the years, villagers have tipped off park officials about poachers, and also volunteered to rescue animals during floods. They have also taken rare attacks by wild animals in their stride; a few years ago a wild buffalo that had escaped the flooded park injured a person in Silimkhowa village on the foothills of Karbi Anglong.

Which is why forest officials were taken aback by the anger in Harmoti this time. They attribute it to the anxiety among people living along Kaziranga’s periphery that they might lose lands and livelihoods if a 10-km Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) is demarcated around the park, which would ban several activities.

ESZs are envisaged as ‘transition zones’ for wildlife moving from areas of high to low protection. In March this year, a Central Empowered Committee submitted to the Supreme Court a recommendation for an ESZ around Kaziranga as “some kind of shock absorber for the protected areas”. The next month, the Supreme Court asked the Assam government to respond to the recommendation.

“We are not opposed to the ESZ, but it cannot be 10 km everywhere around the park,” says Jitu Sarma Rajkhowa, president of Greater Kaziranga Human Resource Development and Environment Protection Committee. “Yes, we need environment protection, but we cannot let the people suffer. Villages have always existed 50-100 metres from KNP’s boundary. It will be a great injustice if they are shifted. Kaziranga sustains more than 5 lakh people.” .

Shrinking spaces

Deben Konwar of Jakhalabandha talks of the sacrifices made by local people for Kaziranga. “We were from Gotonga, a revenue village that was inundated by the Brahmaputra in 1969. We then moved to Kawoimari, which was acquired after Kaziranga became a national park in 1974. We moved again. Now we may be displaced again if an ESZ is established. Why should Kaziranga keep expanding and our space keep shrinking,” he asks.

But KNP director P. Sivakumar points out that Kaziranga is not expanding. “People usually talk about its core area, which is 430 sq. km., but the national park is 898 sq.km, and Kaziranga Tiger Reserve, demarcated in 2007, covers 1,080 sq. km.” Sivakumar says the ESZ need not be 10 km all around the park. “It can vary from zero to 10 km, depending on the level of sensitivity. There are stretches on the highway that animals do not use. We have no issues with commercial activities there. But areas along the nine animal corridors and about 50 dandis (paths) have to be protected.”

On June 27, at a meeting headed by Assam Chief Secretary Alok Kumar, following the Supreme Court’s direction of April, a suggestion was made about a possible relaxation of the ESZ width where necessary: “in areas of conflict the zero kilometre (boundary of KNP) limitation should be delineated and a minimum of 300/400 metres should be spared where there may be already existent public utilities/interest, government installations, building, etc,” the minutes of the meeting stated.

Assam forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya says “We are yet to take a call on how wide the ESZ will be. The people will be taken into confidence to work out a formula that suits both humans and animals.”

Forest officials believe these fears have been fuelled by commercial stakeholders. “The ESZ protects villagers and agricultural lands and prescribes a ban on new commercial and industrial activities. We believe the hospitality lobby is behind this misinformation campaign,” says a senior forest official.

Communication gap

The Kuthari-Bagmari Eco-Development Committee is one of many such formed by the KNP authorities to involve villagers in conservation efforts. Its president Jayanta Rajkhowa points to a communication gap between foresters and the people. “Most people here are poor and subsist on agriculture. They don’t know what the changing status of Kaziranga from reserved forest to national park to World Heritage site and tiger reserve entails in terms of conservation.”

To address misconceptions, a meeting was held recently between Sivakumar and the people of Silimkhowa village, some 5 km south of the highway, facilitated by Pranab Bora of the World Wide Fund for Nature-India.

As Jonah Sing Engti of Silimkhowa explains, “Unlike commercial establishments along the highway, our houses have traditionally been spaced apart, so animals can pass through between them during floods. But the stone quarries not only came in their way, they have dried up five streams and damaged farmlands downstream. We are ensuring these quarries don’t come up again.”

Park officials know that Kaziranga needs tourists. But there are plans now to contain them within the centrally-located Kohora, the most popular halt for tourists, which is away from the animal corridors. Plans are also afoot to develop Bokakhat and Jakhalabandha towns as tourist hubs. A three-lane elevated highway in three stretches, totalling 35 km, has also been proposed to free up the nine animal corridors between the park and the hills.

“The world recognises Kaziranga as one of the best conservation stories of a century. But if we don’t act fast, we might lose the park in less than 100 years,” warns a range officer.",2019-07-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['fast', 'act', 'forest', 'knp', 'wildlife', 'save', 'kaziranga', 'floods', 'assam', 'animals', 'tiger', 'need', 'esz', 'officials', 'km', 'animal', 'park']",India,news article,English
1649,FL-2021-000021-IND,Fact Check: Avalanche video from Nepal shared as Uttarakhand glacier burst - India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-avalanche-video-from-nepal-shared-as-uttarakhand-glacier-burst-1767146-2021-02-08,"A video of a huge mass of snow sliding down a mountain is being circulated on social media with the claim that it shows the glacier burst in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli on Sunday.

A portion of Nanda Devi glacier broke off on February 7 morning, triggering an avalanche and flooding that washed away hydroelectric stations and homes, leaving at least 15 people dead and over 100 missing till last reports. Two NTPC hydel power projects, Tapovan-Vishnugad and Rishi Ganga, were extensively damaged and scores of labourers trapped in tunnels as the waters came gushing in.

The 30-second video is being shared with a caption in Hindi which translates to, “Video of glacier breaking off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli”. Onlookers can be heard hooting with excitement in the clip.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. This video is of an avalanche at Kapuche Glacier Lake in Nepal in January 2021. No lives were lost in the incident.

Some netizens also claimed that this is the first video captured of the Uttarakhand glacier burst. The archived versions of similar posts can be seen here, here and here.

AFWA probe

With the help of InVID tool, we found that the video is from last month and it shows an avalanche in Nepal. It was uploaded on January 9, 2021, by an Instagram user naren32 with the caption, Deadliest avalanche.

On January 11, the user uploaded a longer version of the same video on his Instagram handle and YouTube channel, stating that it is an avalanche at Kapuche Lake in Nepal.

The description to the YouTube video says, “Huge Avalanche ( ) at Kapuche Lake Sikles. The Kapuche Glacier lake is located at an altitude of 2546 meters from sea level. It lies inside the small village Sikles of Kaski district in the Annapurna region. This lake has been declared as the lowest altitude glacier lake in the world. We had to spend overnight at lake in order to catch this moment and it eventually paid off we were filming ourselves and all of sudden avalanche started, rest is history”.

Taking a cue from this, we did a keyword search on the Internet and found reports confirming that the video is from Kapuche Glacier Lake at Parche in Nepal’s Kaski district.

According to reports, a tourist named Shambhu Adhikari stumbled upon this view as he was recording himself playing a guitar.

We also found a report on the avalanche by The Weather Channel published on January 26, 2021. The report also says there were no casualties in the incident. Further, India Today’s Kathmandu correspondent confirmed to us that the video is from Nepal.

Hence, it is clear that the video in question is around a month old and of an avalanche at Kapuche Glacier Lake in Nepal.

The floods are also the worst in the state since 1988, residents and state officials told PREMIUM TIMES, amidst fears the floods could worsen Nigerias current food insufficiency that has led to an increase in prices of basic food like rice.

The Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) said the deaths occurred in about 19 local government areas of the state

Hadejia Emirate, with eight council areas, is the worst hit, the executive secretary of SEMA, Sani Yusuf, told PREMIUM TIMES.

Mr Yusuf said the deaths were recorded since the commencement of the current rainy season.

These are the number of deaths so far reported to the agency since the beginning of this rainy season, he said.

He explained that the agency, with federal government support, is doing the needful to cushion the effects of the disaster by providing emergency needs to the victims of the flood.

He added that the agency has so far distributed 30 canoes to communities affected by the flood, as well as materials to the affected communities to build embankments in order to control the water.

Worst Flood in over 30 years

Hamza Muhammad, special assistant to Governor Muhammad Badaru on community development and social inclusion, said this years flood is the worst since 1988 with Hadejia emirate as the worst affected area.

He listed the affected local governments as Buji, Hadejia, Ringim, Taura, Jahun, Miga, Malammadori, Auyo, Kafinhausa and Guri.

Others include Gwaram, Kiyawa, Kaugama, Birninkudu, kirikasamma, Garki and Babura.

Cause of flood

Mr Muhammad attributed the cause of the flood to an overflow of Tiga and Challawa dams in Kano State as well as effects of climate change.

He also said torrential rainfall, as earlier forecast by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, contributed to the disaster.

In an earlier report done by this newspaper, Isa Mustapha, the executive director, Exceptional Leadership and Integrity Promotion, listed the major causes of the flood as insufficient drainage channels, silted dams, weeds, trypa grass overgrowing on river channels and river beds, as well as illegal diversion and encroachment of waterways.

Other causes, according to Mr Mustapha, include lackadaisical attitude towards the desiltation of the Hadeija-Yobe Kwamadugu River basin, as well as poor coordination among stakeholders on the control of the menace of flood.

Governments intervention

Mr Muhammad said the state government has been doing its best since January 2020 to prevent the flood including directing officials to conduct a survey in flood-prone areas of the state.

He said the government had also deployed water pumping machines to the affected communities to evacuate the flooded water.

Where we cannot use the machines to evacuate the water, we organized self help groups in such communities and empower them with tools for embarkment, he said.

Affected communities deny governments intervention

Contrary to Mr Muhammads claims, residents of the affected communities said the government is not doing enough.

They accused the government of not providing any remedial measures to help mitigate the impact of the flood.

Mr Mustapha and some officials of SEMA, while on an assessment visit to some of the flooded areas on Monday, were mobbed by angry residents who decried the governments negligence of the areas.

One of the vehicles conveying the officials got damaged while journalists trying to take footage of the flooded areas were also chased away by the angry residents.

Impact of Flooding on Food Production

Officials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, are already lamenting the impact of the flood on food production in Jigawa, and Nigeria, especially rice production.

Jigawa is one of the states that has benefitted most from the federal governments Anchors Borrowers Programme to assist farmers boost rice production in the country.

Mr Muhammad, the governors aide, expressed the fear that the state may experience food shortage, saying that Sixty-five per cent of Fadama farmland were washed away by the flood especially in Hadejia where much anticipated rice is expected.

He added that grains like millet, maize and sorghum were also lost to the flood.

Officials could not give the exact number of farmlands and houses that were destroyed by the flood but said the damage is unprecedented while assessment is ongoing.

In his reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari described this years flood in Jigawa as unprecedented and devastating.

In a statement by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, Mr Buhari, on Tuesday, sympathised with the victims of the flood while assuring them of federal governments intervention.

He described the flood, which has reportedly destroyed over 100,000 hectares of rice farms in the state, as a setback to agriculture especially rice production which his administration has actively promoted and discouraged its importation.

The price of rice has also doubled in the past few months across Nigeria due to various reasons including the floods affecting rice-producing states like Jigawa and Kebbi.",2020-09-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['experiences', 'affected', 'destroyed', 'flood', 'governments', 'food', 'farms', 'dead', 'muhammad', 'communities', 'worst', 'jigawa', '40', 'officials', 'state', 'maize', 'rice']",Nigeria,news article,English
505,DR-2021-000054-SOM,"At 30, Somaliland Still Alive, More Vibrant Than Ever - MENAFN.COM",https://menafn.com/1102102320/At-30-Somaliland-Still-Alive-More-Vibrant-Than-Ever,"(MENAFN - SomTribune)""> WhatsApp

Thirty years after declaring independence, Somaliland is still at the margins of the international system despite its considerable successes.

30 years ago, on 18 May 1991, the Republic of Somaliland declared independence from Somalia. This bold move lacked preparation and was not supported by any other state. For over a decade, it was unclear where secession would lead. Today, it is clear: Somaliland is a most successful de facto state. It has a clearly demarcated territory (at least on paper), a permanent population, and a legitimate government; but it is still not internationally recognised.

Somaliland's breakaway from collapsing Somalia in 1991 followed a decade of state repression and civil war in the region. However, the roots of secession go back to colonial times. Between the 1880s and 1960, northwest Somalia was a British protectorate, while the rest of Somalia was controlled by Italy. The British installed indirect rule that incorporated local customary law handled by lineage leaders. The Italians introduced a more direct administration that undermined local traditions and weakened elders.

Somaliland gained independence on 26 June 1960. The rest of Somalia followed on 1 July. The same day, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic. The Somali government faced considerable challenges harmonising different administrative traditions and balancing power between various clans. As early as 1961, military officers in the northwest attempted a coup because they felt disadvantaged. Somalia was also immediately in conflict with Kenya and Ethiopia, where large Somali minorities reside. Mogadishu insisted on uniting all Somali territories in the Horn of Africa under one rule.

In 1969, military and police officers led by General Mohamed Siyad Barre toppled the nepotistic democratic government. The officers allied with Moscow and created a strong security apparatus against internal and external enemies. The dispute with Ethiopia peaked in the Ogadeen War (1978-79). Somalia's defeat severely weakened Barre's domestic position. The USSR sided with Ethiopia, but Somalia soon aligned with the US.

Around this time, renegade Somali military officers formed the first clan-based guerrilla groups and set up bases in Ethiopia, protected by Barre's enemy. The Somali government reacted with punitive measures against civilians in the northeast (now Puntland) and northwest (now Somaliland), who were clan relatives of the rebels. In 1988, the army bombed the north-western towns of Hargeysa and Bur''o after guerrillas had partly occupied them. Thousands of civilians were killed and hundreds of thousands fled to camps in Ethiopia.

With the end of the Cold War, President Barre lost external support. More guerrilla movements were founded. They finally drove the government out of Mogadishu in January 1991. However, Barre's fall did not end the civil war. Rather, clan militias began to fight among themselves for power. While southern Somalia sank into violence, the people in the north sought to resolve their conflicts. Elders who, thanks to the lighter touch of the British colonial administration, still enjoyed respect among northerners cooperated with militia leaders and local intellectuals. Several smaller peace-agreements led to a major clan conference in Bur''o, where, besides region-wide peace, Somaliland's independence was declared, claiming the boundaries of the former British protectorate.

The dominant guerrilla group in the area, the Somali National Movement (SNM), supported by members of the Isaaq clan-family, controlled only about 60% of the country. The west and east of Somaliland were held by local militias from different clans. A transitional SNM-government was established in the new capital, Hargeysa. But the massive destruction of infrastructure, lack of resources, and the spread of small arms among the population made effective governance impossible. Additionally, SNM commanders from various Isaaq clans fought over the region's few valuable resources.

To settle these issues, another clan conference was held in Borama in 1993. After months of negotiations, elders and other clan representatives from the region adopted a peace charter and a national charter. The former dealt with demobilisation, security, and establishing a police force; the latter served as the provisional constitution separating the executive, legislative, and judicial branches and introducing a bicameral parliament consisting of a house of elders (Golaha Guurtida, generally abbreviated as Guurti) and a house of representatives (Golaha Wakiilada). This created the hybrid political order integrating traditional Somali and Western elements of politics, which guaranteed the political stability of Somaliland for years to come.

The conference delegates elected Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal as new President. He was an experienced Isaaq-politician but had not supported the guerrillas. His government demobilised the militias and introduced the Somaliland Shilling as the new currency. Reconstruction work began, especially in Hargeysa and Bur''o. Diaspora Somalis invested in shops, hotels, and schools. The first university of the country was established in Borama in 1998. Some international aid organisations reluctantly engaged in the country, but the UN remained focused entirely on the civil war in southern Somalia. In retrospect, this lack of international attention was a blessing in disguise. It allowed the local actors to experiment with peace and state building and to develop a locally working formula of rule.

President Egal's government held a constitutional referendum in 2001. At the heart of the new constitution were the reaffirmation of independence and the introduction of a multi-party system. A large majority agreed. Democratisation began with the establishment of political parties and the holding of elections in 2002. The unexpected death of Egal that May did not stop the momentum. Since then, several presidential and parliamentary elections have taken place, leading to peaceful transfers of power. The next parliamentary elections are planned for end of May 2021.

Somaliland's success story rests heavily on the will of the members of the Isaaq clan-family to secede from Somalia. However, the country is also inhabited by members of other clans with different political orientations. Members of the Darood clan-family in eastern Somaliland stood against secession early on. Most did not participate in the referendum and subsequent elections. As a result, Somaliland has largely become a ''mono-clan state'' today; Isaaq hold all important offices. The Gadabursi, a clan in the west, participate as well, but they are confined to secondary positions. From the early-2000s onward, armed resistance formed in the east. The more Hargeysa tried to take control of the area, the more bitterly local clan militias fought back. Puntland, an autonomous state in northeast Somalia, supported the anti-secessionists.

Today, the majority of people in central and western Somaliland favour independence. Here, infrastructure, private businesses and the educational sector have developed tremendously over the past 15 years. Nowadays, numerous international NGOs and national development agencies engage in the country. Hargeysa has become a bristling centre, at eye-level with major east African cities.

The eastern parts of the country, however, are not yet at peace. There, Somaliland's influence is limited and occasionally its army clashes with militias. This is where part of the former colonial border runs. To advance its claim to recognition, it would be important that Hargeysa controls this border. But local militias cooperating with Puntland are preventing this; they desire Somali unity.

Globally, most states are against recognising Somaliland. Italy retains economic interests in southern Somalia, and members of the older Somali elite still have relations to the former colonial power. Egypt supports Somali unity to keep Ethiopia, its rival over the Nile-water, under control. The Arab states prefer a united, strong Somalia in the Horn. The US and most EU countries seek to stabilise Somalia, which wouldn''t be helped by recognising Somaliland. The African Union (AU) meanwhile insists that the continent's colonial borders should be respected to avoid unpredictable secessionist dynamics. Eritrea and South Sudan are seen as absolute exceptions (Eritrea had the support of the Ethiopian government, and South Sudan had considerable external backing).

The usual position of those taking a benevolent stance towards Somaliland's independence is that Mogadishu and Hargeysa should negotiate. Some discussions have taken place already, albeit without results. Mogadishu does not want to let Somaliland go, while Hargeysa refuses to return to the status quo ante.

30 years after its declaration of independence, Somaliland is still at the margins of the international system, despite considerable successes regarding peace and state building and massive diaspora investments. Generally, non-recognition in itself is less of a problem; Somaliland shows that political order, democratic process, and a certain degree of development can be achieved without much international assistance. What is worrying is the prospect that a future Somali government could attempt to subdue Somaliland as an unrecognised polity, which could provoke new military conflict.

AIZWAL: Over 5,000 people were lodged in relief camps and more than 4,000 people were being evacuated in Mizoram following floods triggered by heavy rain for the last seven days, officials said on Wednesday.

State disaster management and rehabilitation department officials said the floods had affected 1,968 families in 205 villages, besides destroying 1,523 houses in all the eight districts of the north-eastern state.

Rain-related incidents have so far claimed five lives in Mizoram. At least 5,070 people were lodged in 66 relief camps and 4,322 people were being evacuated, the officials said.

Lunglei district in south Mizoram was the worst hit, they added. Over 700 houses in the low-lying areas of the district were inundated by the swollen Khawthlangtuipui river.

Paddy fields in the low-lying areas were also submerged by the raging waters of the rivers.

The monsoon rainfall has wreaked havoc in the famed Kaziranga National Park, killing as many as 209 animals in the 430 square km park situated along the Brahmaputra river. The casualty has been the highest among Hog deers, small deers with unusually large round ears. A total of 111 Hog deers, 18 Wildboars, 17 Rhinos, 12 Sambars, seven Swamp Deers, three porcupine, two water buffaloes and one elephant has drowned in the submerged park.

Animals have moved to the boundaries of the park and some have even attempted to cross the park to reach nearby higher grounds. As many as 16 Hog deers and one Sambhar was killed after they got hit by vehicles on the national highway-37 bordering the park, as per the data shared by the state government.

The forest officials with the help of local people have been trying to rescue as many animals as they can. As on Tuesday, at least 64 animals have been rescued. Five animals who were rescued and put under care, however succumbed.

The flood waters have destroyed several lakh hectares of cropland across the state, damaging houses, embankments and other buildings. The road connectivity to some far-off villages has also been affected.

According to the latest Central Water Commission (CWC) report river Manas, Beki and Gaurang which are tributaries of the mighty Bhahmaputra river are flowing in severe flood situation in the districts of Baksa, Kamrup, Nalbari, Barpeta, Kokrajhar and Dhubri.

The CWC has directed authorities to step up the disaster relief measures, as rivers- Aie, Champamati, Gaurang, Manas and Beki are currently flowing very near to their Highest Flood Level and may flow above the level also during the next 24 hours.

On Tuesday, the state received 42.9 mm rainfall against the normal of 13.5 mm during the 24 hours. Meghalaya too received 86.6 mm against the normal of 23.8 mm during the day. Western Assam districts have been the worst hit.

The state weather department has predicted heavy rainfall at isolated places to continue over the next three days, however, the forecast by India Metrological Department (IMD), has indicated that the intensity of rainfall over Assam, Meghalaya and Sikkim could reduce after Thursday.

“There is a likely southward shift of the monsoon trough (a low pressure area associated with rainfall) and probable formation of a low pressure area over coastal areas of West Bengal around 26 July,"" stated IMD in its forecast. This would lead to increase in rainfall intensity over Central India, adjoining northern parts of peninsular India and along the northern plains, starting Wednesday.

The situation remains grim in Bihar as well, where rivers Bagmati, Adhwara Group, Kamla Balan, Kosi and Mahananda continue to flow in severe to above normal flood situation. “This is likely to continue for another two-three days and then slowly recede as rainfall activity has been forecasted to reduce,"" as per CWC.

The year 2020 will, without a shadow of a doubt, be etched into the collective memory of human society for a long, long time. It began with the novel coronavirus emerging out of Chinaâ??s Wuhan and reaching all corners of Earth. It's only now, with the year coming to an end, that the world has begun its retort against COVID-19 through vaccination drives.

While a majority of the global population remained indoors all year to escape the clutches of the pandemic, natural disasters were out in full force, confronting many parts of the world with a catastrophic double whammy.

Here are five such major natural calamities from across the world in the bleak year that was 2020:

Locust Attacks in East Africa and Asia

The 2020 locust outbreak was the worst Kenya has seen in 70 years, and the worst in 25 years for countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, and India. It began in May 2018, when Cyclone Mekunu produced heavy rains over a vast, unpopulated desert in the southern Arabian Peninsula, thereby allowing locusts to breed there undetected. Thereafter, Cyclone Luban in October 2018 exacerbated the locust breeding, enabling three generations of locusts to mass-reproduce over a nine-month period. This led to an 8,000-fold increase in the locust population across the Arabian desert.

These mega-swarms then began migrating as per the wind direction, and by April 2020, the aerial armies had successfully invaded 23 countriesâ??African nations like Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda; Arabian countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia; Paraguay and Argentina in South America; and South Asian nations such as Iran, Pakistan, and India.

The outbreak in India began in late 2019 and January 2020, with kilometre-wide swarms disrupting lives across ten statesâ??Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Haryana, and Uttarakhand.

Subsequently, the Rajasthan government reported crop damage of 33%, while less than 33% crop damage was reported by the governments of Haryana (6520-hectare area), Madhya Pradesh (4400 ha), Maharashtra (806 ha), Uttar Pradesh (488 ha), and Uttarakhand (267 ha).

Bushfires in Australia

Bushfires in Australia tend to be a regular and widespread occurrence. However, the fires witnessed on the continent last summerâ??towards the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020â??were unusually intense and far more destructive, earning this bushfire season the name â??Black Summerâ??. While both natural and manmade causes started these fires, factors like high temperatures, drought conditions, high fuel load (accumulation of fallen bark, leaf litter, small branches), and global warming combined to enhance this disaster.

These raging bushfires led to tremendous destruction across the eastern half of the country, burning an estimated 18.6 million hectares of forests, destroying over 5,900 buildings, and directly killing at least 34 people. A further 445 fatalities were caused due to smoke inhalation, and 65,000 people were displaced, as this disaster affected nearly 80 per cent of Australians one way or another.

The fires also reportedly killed or affected at least 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs, also pushing some threatened species such as the long-footed potoroo, the marsupial, and the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo closer to extinction! These ecological consequences aside, the bushfires also caused tremendous air pollution and carbon emission.

Overall, economists estimate the 2020 bushfires may have cost over 103 billion Australian Dollars in property damage and economic losses, thereby making them Australia's costliest natural disaster to date.

Cyclone Amphan

The year 2020 was another active year in terms of cyclones in the North Indian Ocean, with nine depressions forming in the region and five of them intensifying into cyclonic storms and more. Together, these systems caused damage worth $15.78 billion (one lakh fifty-seven thousand crore rupees), and killed about 269 people.

Advertisement Among these, Amphanâ??the first super cyclonic storm to have formed in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha cycloneâ??was one of the strongest cyclones to hit India, while also being the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean in terms of damage caused.

On May 18, Amphan hit its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph), and two days later, made landfall over West Bengal. It caused great damage across coastal West Bengal, Odisha, Northeast India, and Bangladesh claiming 128 lives and causing overall destruction worth $13.7 billion (one lakh thirty-seven thousand crore rupees).

A few months later, Cyclone Nivar became the second-most destructive cyclone to hit India in 2020, as it made landfall over Tamil Nadu in late November and caused damage worth $600 million (four thousand crore rupees), killing 14. Other cyclones, namely Nisarga, Gati and Burevi, did cause significant local impacts. But, fortunately, the damages were not as high as Amphan and Nivar.

China Floods

Southern China, particularly the Yangtze basin and its tributaries, was affected by severe floods this year, as heavy rains wreaked havoc across the region during the rainy season between June-September. This disaster also extended to central and eastern China during July, effectively creating the worst flood situation the region has experienced since at least 1998. A total of 443 rivers were flooded nationwide, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded!

As per the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), a spike in rainfall activityâ??caused by climate change-induced rise in vapours emergence from the Indian and Pacific oceansâ??led to the flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors like the reclamation of lakes and wetlands, urban development, and mass-disappearance of lakes also helped escalate the events.

By August, the floods had killed at least 219 people across the country, affected about 63.46 million people, and damaged 54,000 houses, 76 key national cultural relics, and 187 provincial cultural heritage sites. Overall, the disaster caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY.

The destruction in China aside, the release of water from these swollen rivers may also have contributed to the flooding that occurred in adjoining Indiaâ??s northeastern state of Assam during this period.

Assam Floods

Monsoon floods are a common occurrence for northeast India. But, the year 2020â??s Indian monsoon season was particularly difficult for Assam, as the state remained constantly flooded due to persistent spells of heavy rainfall and above-average seasonal precipitation in the region.

The initial flooding began with heavy showers in May, and it wasnâ??t until October that the statewide situation began to improve. By then, however, the floods had already affected over 50 lakh residents across 30 districts and 5,474 villages, killed 123 and forced over 1.5 lakh people to seek refuge in 627 relief camps and 1662 relief distribution centres set-up by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA). The floods also induced landslides, which further claimed 26 more lives.

Floods also exacerbated the spread of novel coronavirus in Assam, with the state recording over 2 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases in this period. Stagnant waters and lack of access to clean water, hygiene supplies are also believed to have caused a spike in dengue, malaria, and Japanese encephalitis cases.

The inundation and subsequent landslides damaged bridges, government buildings, roads, embankments, and schools while putting at least 2.67 lakh hectares of crops to ruin. The flooding also affected the wildlife within the state, with more than 45,000 domesticated animals forced to flee or be abandoned, more than 150 wild animals rescued from the Kaziranga National Park, and 125 animals in the park, including 12 rhinoceros, succumbing to the floodwaters.

1658,FL-2021-000021-IND,Uttarakhand glacier burst: Experts cite impact of climate crisis - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-flood-experts-cite-impact-of-climate-crisis-101612730031647.html,"Massive inundation in Uttarakhand’s Rishi Ganga valley caused by a suspected glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) on a clear winter’s day has unnerved scientists. GLOFs and resulting disasters downstream during extreme rainfall events in glacial regions are commonly forecast by scientists. But this time scientists have seen it happen in winter, when such events are least expected.

The Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation is stills investigating the matter and has not been able to zero in on the exact reason for the flooding as yet.

“Our team is there. We do not suspect an avalanche. There may be glacial lake formations, but we cannot say with certainty now. We are investigating the entire region,” said Jimmy Kansal, joint director at SASE.

The flood caused large-scale devastation in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas, with 50-100 labourers working on the Rishi Ganga power project missing. Homes along the way were also swept away as the waters rushed down the mountainsides in a raging torrent

It is difficult to say exactly what happened, said D P Dobhal, a former glaciologist at Dehradun-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.

“Locals have told me that water and debris were flowing at great speed for about 15 to 20 minutes this morning and then the flow reduced gradually. This indicates a lake outburst. It’s possible that water and debris accumulated in a lake in the glacial region of Rishi Ganga valley breached due to an avalanche. Its also possible that the avalanche took place earlier, like yesterday or very early in the morning today. The water filled up in the lake and breached. It may be very similar to what happened in 2013 with the Chorabari lake during the Kedarnath disaster. Only difference is that this time it’s in winter and that was during monsoons,” said Dobhal

In the early hours of June 17, 2013 a flash flood came down upon the overflowing banks of the Chorabari lake in Uttarakhand. Carrying huge amounts of silt and rocks, it killed at least 5,700 people, and left unprecedented damage and destruction.

Dobhal added that GLOFs will increase because of climate change. “Lakes have always formed in glaciers and some glaciers have retreated while some advanced. These are stages. But due to global warming, more glaciers are melting or retreating and there is less snow. This is very apparent in Nepal and Sikkim and not so much in Uttarakhand,” Dobhal added.

Prof Anil Kulkarni of Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, also suspected that the flooding may be linked to a GLOF.

“When glaciers retreat, glacial lakes are formed. These lakes are formed in the area vacated by the glacier. Several lakes have formed in the Rishi Ganga valley. We don’t know which one may have burst. In winter, the top layer of these lakes is frozen. During an ice avalanche or a landslide this top layer is breached and water can flow downstream, toppling the earthen dam. This is a common problem seen in glaciated terrain. We have seen this in Nepal but not in Uttarakhand so far. This is a classic case of climate change impact on the glacier. We have again and again highlighted that such disasters will become exceedingly common due to climate change as more and more glaciers retreat,” explained Kulkarni, a glaciologist and scientist at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change, IISc.

Kulkarni’s team has studied various aspects of such glacial lake discharge events. For example, last year the team modelled the impact of a GLOF on a hydroelectric project downstream of Satopanth glacial lake and found that a GLOF, combined with an extreme flood event, can cause extensive damage to the project. The study recommended regular monitoring of the Satopanth lake, especially during post-monsoon season, due to the potential risk it poses to the downstream region when combined with high-intensity rain events.

A large number of hydroelectric power plants (HEP) were damaged in the 2013 cloudburst and GLOF inKedarnath. The 400 MW Jaypee (JP) Vishnuprayag hydro-electric project (HEP), located 28 km downstream of the Satopanth lake, was one of the projects damaged by the 2013 cloudburst.

“Due to the fact that a number of glacial lakes exist within the limits of the Vishnuprayag HEP catchment, GLOF risk assessment for this hydropower station becomes very vital,” a study by Kulkarni’s team said.

Kulkarni’s team, in its science brief on GLOF, recommended long-term strategies to prevent GLOF disasters including identifying locations vulnerable to such events using computer simulations, monitoring lake expansion, determining structural strength of the moraine dam, maintaining safe water level in the lake through siphoning, and determining future glacier lake sites using remote sensing techniques.

On Sunday, there was an avalanche in Rishi Ganga valley 50 to 100 metres upstream of its confluence with Dhauliganga West. A small hydroelectric project of about 11 MW in the Rishi Ganga valley was totally destroyed. The barrage of the Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project has also been damaged and water entered the intake tunnels. Around 50 workers were working at the plant at that time out of them 30 to 35 are feared to have been washed away.

Around 10 villagers who were out with cattle on the mountain slopes may have also been washed away, according to initial reports received by Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute and chairman of the Supreme Ccourt-constituted high powered committee monitoring the Char Dham road project in Uttarakhand.

“We cannot comment on this specific event because the ministry of earth sciences doesn’t monitor avalanches. We know that the 2013 Uttarakhand disaster was related to a glacial lake. However, from the climate change perspective we can definitely say that the glaciers to the western side of the Himalayas are retreating while many of those in the eastern side have also recorded advancement of glaciers. So glacial lake disasters are expected,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.",2021-02-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['glacier', 'glaciers', 'lakes', 'impact', 'crisis', 'glof', 'water', 'glacial', 'lake', 'ganga', 'project', 'climate', 'cite', 'burst', 'experts', 'uttarakhand', 'rishi', 'avalanche']",India,news article,English
1821,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Last Two Giraffes Rescued From a Disappearing Island in Kenya - Smithsonian Magazine,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/last-two-giraffes-rescued-disappearing-island-kenya-180977512/,"On April 12, wildlife authorities and conservationists completed a tall task: ferrying the final two giraffes off of a sinking island in Lake Baringo, Kenya, George Dvorsky reports for Gizmodo.

For many years, Rothschild’s giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) have lived on a peninsula in the lake. The lake's water levels had been slowly rising over time, but in 2020, torrential rains caused severe flooding, covering a stretch of the giraffes’ peninsula and turning the end into a muddy, shrinking island. Nine giraffes became stranded with limited resources available for survival. Planning the complex rescue mission took 15 months to coordinate and implement.

Now, the last two individuals—a mother and a calf, named Ngarikoni and Noelle—stuck on a remote part of the land mass have been safely transported to the mainland.

When the giraffes reached the shore, they galloped out onto the 4,400-acre Ruko Wildlife Sanctuary, where conservation groups involved in the project hope to support a growing population of the endangered subspecies.

And here's another clip of the giraffe named Lbarnoti's excited gallop once he's safely gotten off the ferry. Video Credit: Mike Parkei, Northern Rangelands Trust/Save Giraffes Now pic.twitter.com/AcH7PHkE7M — Aylin Woodward (@AylinWoodward) January 31, 2021

When the giraffes first became stranded on the island, Ruko wildlife rangers began delivering food for them, per Gizmodo. But they soon realized the need for a more sustainable long-term solution. The flood became severe last year, damaging businesses and homes along the shore of the lake, and one giraffe, named Asiwa, became separated from the rest of herd when flooding bisected the island once again.

Convincing a 14-foot-tall animal to get on a boat is no small feat, however. First, the team needed to develop a vessel fit for the task. The result, a barge that is kept afloat by 60 empty drums, decked-out with reinforced walls and pulled by a motorboat, was named the “GiRaft.”

To guide the animals to the raft, the team first had to sedate them, and then quickly apply a reversal drug. (When a giraffe is tranquilized and falls to the ground, it is in danger of choking on its own saliva, or being harmed by a change of blood pressure to its brain.) During the brief period when a giraffe is sedated, the team covers its face with a blindfold and sets up guide ropes around its shoulders. Then when the giraffe is able to walk, the team guides it to the raft.

When the rescue brought Asiwa to the raft, “she was incredible,” said O’Connor to CNN’s Ami Vitale in December. “She's a very, very tough girl. … Once we got her onto a more open space where there was an established track, she just walked straight onto the barge. Sometimes it looked like someone was walking a puppy on a Sunday afternoon. It was amazing.”

Rescue workers accompanied the GiRaft on its one-mile journey to shore by standing on the steel beams or boating alongside in kayaks and canoes.

As Mindy Weisberger reports for Live Science, the Rothschild’s giraffe has lost about 80 percent of its population in the last 30 years, making it one of the most imperiled giraffe subspecies. Out of a population of less than 3,000 animals, 800 live in Kenya. Now that the once-stranded giraffes are on the mainland, the conservation groups hope to relocate other giraffes of the same subspecies to the wildlife sanctuary to support a healthy, genetically diverse population.",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['kenya', 'team', 'named', 'population', 'lake', 'task', 'rescued', 'giraffes', 'island', 'disappearing', 'shore', 'giraffe', 'wildlife']",Kenya,news article,English

Almost seven seasons and over 300 games have passed since the Argentine arrived at Camp Nou, and he finally broke his duck on Wednesday

Javier Mascherano finally ended his amazing goal drought for Barcelona by firing home from the penalty spot during the Catalans' clash against Osasuna.

Incredibly, the former West Ham and Liverpool star had never previously scored in Blaugrana colours, despite playing for the club for almost seven seasons.

'Alli can become a true great'

But when Denis Suarez was chopped down in the penalty at Camp Nou with Barca already cruising 5-1 up, Masche stepped forward to convert the penalty.

He beat Salvatore Sirigu to end a run of 319 games without hitting the net, to the delight of his team-mates who mobbed him after the successful effort.

The goal also brought up a milestone for Luis Enrique, who saw Barca score their 500th goal since he took charge back in 2014.

A midfielder at Liverpool and with the Argentina national team, Mascherano dropped back into the centre of defence after moving to Camp Nou, and rarely crosses the halfway line.

Wednesday's effort was only the fourth goal of his professional club career, while he has scored another three with the senior Argentina team in 136 appearances. The last goal Mascherano scored came on June 4 2014, when he converted against Trinidad & Tobago for Argentina.

In Assam, 12 more people died on Saturday, taking the number of deaths to 59, while around 44 lakh people remain affected by floods, the state disaster management authority said. Five more people died in Bihar on Saturday, taking the toll to 97.

Assam

The Assam State Disaster Management Authority’s flood bulletin said five deaths were reported in Morigaon district, three in Barpeta, two in South Salmara and one each in Nalbari and Dhubri districts, taking the toll to 59.

Twenty-four of the 33 districts in the state and 3,024 villages have been affected by the floods, the flood report said. Flood water has shown receding trends in Baksa, Hojai and Majuli districts, according to PTI.

The deluge has submerged nearly 1.51 lakh hectares of cropland and a large part of Kaziranga National Park. Over 12 lakh animals across 17 districts have been affected by the floods, with 129 animal deaths reported from Kaziranga National Park, including 10 rhinoceros, a statement by the park’s divisional forest officer said on Saturday.

The flood bulletin said over 1.32 lakh displaced people have moved to 689 relief camps and 240 relief distribution centres set up by the district administrations.

The Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger level at Neamatighat in Jorhat district, Goalpara, Dhubri, Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat district and Kopili at Dharamtul in Nagaon district, the report said.

The Army is conducting large-scale flood relief operations in flood-hit areas of lower Assam, a defence statement said. The National and the State Disaster Response Forces are involved in relief operations too.

“The Assam government is doing everything to provide relief to people affected by floods in the state,” Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said. “I want to thank central government and Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on behalf of the people of Assam for their help.”

Five more deaths were reported in the state on Saturday, taking the toll to 97, the state’s disaster management department said. Four deaths were reported from Madhubani district, where 18 people have died so far, and one person died in Darbhanga, where a total of 10 people died in the deluge.

Sitamarhi, where 27 deaths were reported, remained the worst-hit district, the disaster management department said. Twelve districts of Bihar have been affected by flash floods that hit the state after torrential rainfall in the catchment areas of Nepal last week. The deluge has affected 69.3 lakh people in the 12 districts, with over 1.15 lakh sheltered in 131 relief camps.

Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi toured Sitamarhi to take stock of relief and rehabilitation work in the district on Saturday.

Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav said on Saturday that the Centre should declare the flood and drought situations in the state a national disaster, PTI reported.

“Bihar is reeling under both flood and drought situations,” he said. “The Centre should announce the situations as national disaster and give the state Rs 10,000 crore.

54,DR-2014-000109-CHN,KCON a mini-Coachella for Korean pop music - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-kcon-20140808-story.html,"Despite the growing popularity of South Korean pop music in the U.S., the genre has always faced one particular challenge. Very few American fans can see K-pop acts perform live.

Some popular South Korean bands like Girls’ Generation or 2NE1 have played showcases in major U.S. cities, and the girl group Crayon Pop just toured with Lady Gaga. Yet for most such acts, it’s never made logistical or financial sense to play the States, despite a fervent fan subculture here.

This year’s KCON, the third installment of the annual K-pop festival in downtown L.A., might be changing that line of thinking.

Four rising and established South Korean pop acts — Bangtan Boys, IU, Jung Joon Young and SPICA — are making their American live debuts this year. KCON isn’t just a sprawling fan convention anymore — it’s becoming a hub for Korean acts to make their first steps into the U.S. touring market.

“A lot of [K-pop] acts have met with the top U.S. booking agents, but they couldn’t afford the cost of giving up tour dates in Asia,” said Angela Killoren, co-project manager of KCON. “But festivals like KCON are a great way for them to meet fans and perform without committing to the infrastructure of a full tour.”

Last year, the event moved from Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine to the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena downtown and dramatically expanded its scope. An estimated 20,000 fans attended two days’ worth of concerts, workshops, panel discussions and Korean pop-culture exhibitions. The festival has become a kind of K-pop Coachella or South by Southwest.

“The reputation for the stateside KCON festival back in Korea is big news,” SPICA’s members said in a jointly answered email interview. “Many K-pop artists and companies see this as an important portal into the American marketplace, as the festival has been growing every year.”

Last year’s headlining concert, featuring the likes of G-Dragon, and Teen Top, capped the weekend (with American MC Missy Elliott hopping onstage with G-Dragon). The sets finally scratched the live itch of many U.S. fans.

“Our fans know way more about this music than even we do, but we always try to bring new artists to them,” Killoren said. “Last year, Dynamic Duo and 2AM weren’t as well known over here, but fans went crazy for them.”

Since last year, the genre’s crossover has ramped up in America. 2NE1 released “Crush,” a dark and modern dance-pop album that debuted at No. 61 on the Billboard 200 chart in March and, at 5,000 copies sold, earned the biggest first-week sales for a K-pop album in the U.S. G-Dragon appeared on EDM producer Skrillex’s debut major-label LP and collaborated with well-known U.S. producers like Diplo and Baauer on his album “Coup d’Etat.”

In K-pop culture, each of these groups is an established act in America. But now that K-pop (or hallyu, as it’s known) culture has grown past the novelty factor here, there’s a question of how to introduce new generations of artists in America.

Internet exposure is no problem. Videos like Girls’ Generation’s “I Got a Boy” can rack up a hundred million YouTube views, and there’s a rich ecosystem of hallyu-centric online media to document its stars’ comings and goings.

Yet for U.S. audiences outside New York and L.A., digital fandom might not be enough.

“So much fan interaction in K-pop is virtual. Fans are crazy about it, but they never get a chance to touch it,” Killoren said. Without in-person ways to connect, American fans could lose enthusiasm.

KCON’s increasing focus on U.S. debut performances gives fans something more to see, and crowds are willing to travel for that experience. Killoren estimates that 40% of ticket sales this year have been to fans outside California — from Texas and New York but also from Mexico and Sweden.

For South Korean stars without a big American audience, the fest isn’t just a way to make a splashy U.S. debut. It can bolster their reputations back home too.

“It’s big news back in Asia when K-pop artists play in the States,” SPICA said. “It helps their reputation back home. I think K-pop artists are very careful and selective about what they do in the States. They want to develop fan bases over time and build the confidence to play live here.”

SPICA will perform its first English-language single, “I Did It,” at the fest as part of a rollout to capture more such markets.

Outside of Psy, the viral sensation behind “Gangnam Style,” K-pop hasn’t yet made a big dent in U.S. top 40, but it’s not necessarily KCON’s job to crack that ceiling. It’s to keep the K-pop faithful and newly curious fans feeling like they have a stake in the music.

As Killoren put it, “This is a way to recharge your K-pop fandom.”

Nature-based solutions to the Americas' climate change risks - Environmental Finance,https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/market-insight/how-can-we-finance-climate-adaptation-nature-based-solutions-to-the-americas-climate-change-risks.html,"How can we finance climate adaptation? Nature-based solutions to the Americas' climate change risks Companies: Scotiabank People: Melissa Menzies

Partnered content

The concepts of 'natural capital' and 'nature-based solutions' are gaining attention in the global capital markets, as public and private sector issuers consider ways to finance projects to enhance their physical asset resiliency to climate change or support reforestation and native species regeneration.

While these forms of sustainable debt are well suited to financing diverse adaptation and resiliency activities, the volume of issuances to date is still low, when considering that just five per cent of the proceeds from green, social or sustainability bond issuances in 2020 went to sustainable land use projects, compared to 85 per cent directed to the categories of energy use/efficiency, green buildings and clean transport1.

Melissa Menzies and the team at Scotiabank's Sustainable Finance group are actively introducing clients across the Americas to the potential of these climate adaptation and nature-based financial instruments, to tackle pressing environmental challenges, from destructive flooding in central Canada to deforestation in Chile and Brazil.

The new frontier in sustainable finance

Nature-based solutions are earning profile in the Americas, following early moves by European policy-makers and business leaders, notes Melissa Menzies, Associate Director, Sustainable Finance at Scotiabank: ""There is growing recognition by corporations and governments around the role of nature-based solutions in creating climate resilience and sustainable infrastructure, and preserving the planet's biodiversity.""

She also points out that, ""The market for green financing for resilience and adaptation programs is still maturing, as organizations build an understanding of the opportunities, and begin to align their capital-raising programs with their ESG priorities."" Although global green bond issues reached $1 trillion by 2020, just five per cent of all green bonds issued in the past decade were categorized as 'adaptation,' with their proceeds allocated to adaptation and resilience projects2.

Menzies and the Sustainable Finance group are helping clients understand terms like 'natural capital' and 'ecosystem services,' which have arisen from growing consensus that the world's longstanding focus on 'financial capital' did not adequately account for other important forms of capital. In particular, 'natural capital' includes all the natural resources that humans use to provide a return3. 'Ecosystem services' are the benefits that people obtain from the planet's rich biodiversity4. Although natural capital enables companies to create value, historically these natural elements were undervalued or it was difficult to calculate their financial benefit.

""These topics are attracting much attention, as we witness natural disasters and the deterioration of critical biodiversity and natural capital – from the Amazonian jungle to Canada's boreal forests, which serve as natural 'carbon sinks' that sequester carbon in the ground to reduce GHG emissions,"" explains Menzies. It is estimated that 85 per cent of the world's wetlands have been impacted, 75 per cent of land surface has been altered and millions of hectares of primary forest have been lost5.

And there is growing acceptance that nature-based solutions are an efficient remedy. For example, research shows that improved land management rules through natural climate solutions can deliver 37 per cent of all cost-effective CO² mitigation needed to the year 20306. This means that countries can use products like sustainable land bonds to access inexpensive capital, transition to sustainable, low-carbon land management practices and preserve their resource economies. In fact, sustainable finance instruments can also directly help countries meet their nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

Turning awareness into action

Awareness of climate and biodiversity risks is prompting many stakeholders to act, including investors like BlackRock Inc., which urged companies to disclose how their business practices are consistent with the sustainable use of natural capital7. And, industry groups are tallying the impacts of climate change, including the Insurance Bureau of Canada (ICB), which determined that severe weather in Canada caused $1.9 billion in insured damage in 20188.

Now there are multi-lateral efforts to incorporate natural capital into economic and political decision-making, and ensure the conditions are in place to help the private and public sectors leverage nature-based solutions. For instance, the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), GRI, CDP and Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) are developing a comprehensive corporate reporting framework to ensure that environmental, social and governance metrics are represented in financial statements. Simplified, unified accounting and reporting systems will help organizations satisfy stakeholder demand for transparent ESG disclosure and equip them to design investment programs focused on adaptation and resiliency.

Since the natural question is, ""How will these massive adaptation projects be funded?"", the green bond market – in which bond proceeds are applied to finance or refinance eligible green projects – can help organizations bridge the financing gap. In fact, the Green Bond Principles provide guidelines for the use of proceeds of green bond financing, ranging from sustainable land and resource use to climate change adaptation and development of resilient infrastructure.

Under these guidelines, an array of innovative financial instruments, from green bonds to blue bonds to climate bonds, are coming to fruition. On the grand scale, they include the Netherlands's recent EUR 5.98 billion green bond, which will fund coastal and river ecosystem projects to safeguard the low-lying nation against severe flood risk9 – part of the country's recent Green Bond Framework to become climate-proof and water-resilient by 205010.

On a smaller scale, Central Arkansas Water recently issued a US$31 million municipal green bond, to acquire 4,300 acres of watershed land at risk of development. It is believed to be the first issuance of its kind to buy and protect forests in order to secure clean drinking water, in this case for the small utility firm's 500,000 customers11.

""Such success stories are helping to create greater awareness,"" says Menzies, who notes that sustainable finance debt has more than doubled year-over-year, and it has often resulted in a green pricing benefit for issuers. ""Demand for green assets will only continue to grow, when you consider spiking interest in impact investing, the rise of ESG-integrated asset managers, and net-zero commitments made by a growing number of organizations.""

Sleuthing out green opportunity

Scotiabank's Sustainable Finance group is helping clients identify the unfolding opportunities and challenges of green financing. They often advise clients on methods to establish in-depth, corporate ESG reporting and data collection to identify their priority material issues and to build out robust ESG frameworks and governance structures.

Clients often require support steering through the green financing market, since corporate treasury departments may lack in-house resources to focus on unfamiliar considerations in the nuanced sustainable debt sector. For example, since green bond transactions often involve a sizable financial threshold, smaller organizations and municipal or regional governments might turn to green term loans. Or, clients may opt for sustainability-linked instruments, such as sustainability-linked bonds, which enable the issuer to allocate the proceeds of funding across various initiatives for general corporate purposes. They can set material and ambitious targets to the pricing of such instruments tied to achieving nature-based metrics over a set timeframe, such as the number of hectares of forest conserved or the birth-rate of an endangered species.

Menzies guides clients through these multi-faceted issues as part of Scotiabank's dedicated Sustainable Finance group, a team helping the Bank mobilize billions of dollars to reduce the impacts of climate change, support clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy and contribute to the global conversation on climate change.

For example, Scotiabank served as joint bookrunner on two of the Province of Ontario's benchmark green bond issues in support of climate adaptation and resilience projects. The proceeds of the province's two green bonds issued in 2019-20, totalling CAD$1.2 billion, will be directed to the Port Lands Flood Protections program. This colossal project will fortify 240 hectares of downtown Toronto land that is at risk of flooding with earthworks/flood protection infrastructure, parks, roads and bridges, naturalized greenspace and wetlands.

In Latin America, Scotiabank also acted as joint bookrunner on significant transactions such as ARAUCO's US$1 billion in sustainability bond issuances in 2019. These issuances will enable the global leader in sustainable forestry to protect native forests and high conservation value areas in Chile. Similarly, the Bank helped Empresas CMPC launch its UF$2.5 million, 10-year green bond in 2019, with proceeds dedicated to restoration of native pine and eucalyptus forests in Chile and Brazil. Scotiabank also supported Klabin's 2019, US$500 million green bond issue to help Brazil's largest paper manufacturer protect vast swaths of forest conservation areas and perform endangered species reintroduction and reproduction at the specialized Klabin Ecological Park.

Menzies is enthusiastic about the impacts of nature-based solutions for the planet's diverse stakeholders – and Scotiabank's ability to bring value to the process: ""Green financing for adaptation and resiliency is an opportunity to connect project developers and investors in sustainable development. There is a lot of room for the Scotiabank's creativity and capability in this area to flourish, and deliver significant, enduring benefits to our clients and communities.""",2021-04-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['risks', 'finance', 'adaptation', 'change', 'climate', 'green', 'bond', 'capital', 'naturebased', 'solutions', 'sustainable', 'natural', 'americas']",Brazil,news article,English
2442,FL-2017-000067-BRA,"Study: Climate Disasters Displaced 8M People Internally in Philippines, Bangladesh in 2020 - benarnews",https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/philippine/climate-disasters-05202021173444.html,"A forest fire burns next to a palm-oil plantation, in this aerial photo taken above Kumpeh Ulu, a district in Muarojambi, Indonesia, July 30, 2019.

In a year when millions were forced to flee their homes due to climate-fueled natural disasters, the Philippines and Bangladesh were among the most affected countries in 2020, according to a report published Thursday by a group that monitors internal displacements of people worldwide.

More than 40 million people around the world were displaced last year within their nations’ borders by natural disasters or conflict despite many governments imposing lockdowns or movement restrictions due to a global pandemic, the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) reported.

“Weather-related events were responsible for 98 percent of all disaster displacement recorded in 2020,” the group said in its annual Global Report on Internal Displacement (GRID).

“Most disaster displacements were the result of tropical storms and floods in East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia. China, the Philippines and Bangladesh each recorded more than four million new displacements, many of them pre-emptive evacuations.”

And, according to a report published earlier this week by Forest Trends, a Washington-based conservation NGO, Southeast Asia suffers terribly from the effects of climate change, with Indonesia and Malaysia contributing to climate erosion.

Between 2013 and 2019, Indonesia, the region’s largest country and a top producer of palm oil, was responsible for 20 percent of the world’s illegal razing of tropical forests through agricultural clear-cutting fires that increased carbon emissions in the region, the study by Forest Trends said.

Tropical cyclones, typhoons, monsoon rains and floods hit highly exposed areas that are home to millions of people in South and Southeast, according to the report by IDMC.

“It’s shocking that someone was forced to flee their home inside their own country every single second last year,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which IDMC is a part of.

IDMC’s “Grid 2021” report tracked displacement from extreme climate events as well as war and conflict.

The year “2020 was, for many of us, a year of lockdowns and travel restrictions but not so for the millions who fled for their lives because of conflict, violence and disasters,” Egeland said.

“[W]e have documented that, 40 million times [last year], a man, a woman, or a child have been forced out of their homes because of disaster or conflict. It’s the worst figures in a decade.”

As the United States Geological Survey noted, climate change plays a role in exacerbating disasters.

“With increasing global surface temperatures the possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for more powerful storms to develop,” the U.S. government agency said.

“More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical storms.”

Typhoon Vongfong, also known as Ambo, the first tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2020, caused more than 298,000 displacements, mostly in the form of pre-emptive evacuations.

Later that year, Typhoons Goni and Vamco cause more than 3 million displacements in the Philippines and Vietnam in October and November, according to IDMC.

‘Proactive measures that build resilience’

Elsewhere, South Asia accounted for almost a third of the world’s new disaster displacements in 2020.

Around 9.2 million displacements were recorded in the region, which IDMC said was an above-average figure for the second year in a row.

A big contributor was Cyclone Amphan, which triggered nearly 2.5 million displacements in Bangladesh alone, of a total 5 million in the region.

“It damaged and destroyed homes and other infrastructure and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless,” IDMC said.

“The damage it did to embankments led to the flooding of homes, farms and fields that have been underwater ever since,” IDMC said.

Powerful storms and cyclones have become more frequent in South Asia due to warmer temperatures in the Indian Ocean. When combined with rising sea levels, the phenomena cause even more devastating storm surges that flood larger and larger areas, IDMC said, adding that Cyclone Amphan illustrated the problem.

“The need for more inclusive and proactive measures that build the resilience of those regularly exposed to similar hazards is also clear,” IDMC said.

Lush forests turned into palm-oil plantations

In Southeast Asia, palm oil, soy and cattle products drive global figures of illegal deforestation, according to the report by Forest Trends.

Most of the forest clearing took place in in Brazil and Indonesia during 2013-2019, the years the report studied.

Southeast Asia has 80 percent of the world’s palm oil plantations, and many of Indonesia’s and Malaysia’s palm oil, paper, and pulp plantations are built on illegally razed tropical forests, the NGO said.

“The criminal destruction of rainforests for commodities such as beef, chocolate, soy and palm oil knocks down 4.5 million hectares and releases 2.7 gigatons of emissions a year,” said a press release which accompanied the report by Forest Trends, titled “Illicit Harvest, Complicit Goods: The State of Illegal Deforestation for Agriculture.”

Palm oil is the biggest forest risk commodity in Asia-Pacific, said the study, and Indonesia led other Southeast Asian nations in forest-clearing, the report said.

“The global average proportion of illegality for palm oil (59 percent) is constrained by low data availability in Malaysia. …These [forest] losses have been tied to billions of dollars in economic losses, such as those resulting from the El Niño drought-linked forest fires that created massive haze events.”

In Indonesia, companies and farmers clear land by burning their vegetation. The fires often spread to protected forestlands. And the resulting giant blazes emit greenhouse gases and cause a heavy haze that crosses national boundaries and engulfs other Southeast Asian countries.

While the findings of Forest Trends seem dire, there is hope, as Indonesia has successfully reduced its deforestation every year since a peak in 2016, the report said.

Indonesia’s deforestation rate hit a historic low in 2020, according to the country’s Environment and Forestry Ministry.

The government attributed the reduction to policies such as a moratorium on licenses for new palm oil plantations, and a ban on clearing primary forests and peatlands.

But other experts have noted that drop was likely due to more rains, falling oil palm prices, and an economic slowdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-05-20 21:35:00+00:00,"['internally', 'indonesia', 'bangladesh', 'oil', 'palm', 'displaced', 'forest', '2020', 'million', 'philippines', 'idmc', 'climate', 'asia', 'disasters', 'study', 'displacements', '8m', 'report', 'according']",Brazil,news article,English
713,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"New Walmart stores, new hotels among investments planned in Oaxaca - Mexico News Daily",https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/new-walmart-stores-new-hotels-in-oaxaca/,"Just 10 months ago the Oaxaca economy was said to be collapsing and Walmart México was considering an exit from a state where roadblocks by protesting teachers and their allies had cost an estimated 1 billion pesos.

Yesterday, Governor Alejandro Murat Hinojosa offered a rosier outlook: far from leaving, Walmart is going to open at least three new stores and Mexican hotel owner Grupo Posadas will build a new 200-room hotel in Oaxaca city.

The governor said during a meeting yesterday with members of the Mexican Association of Real Estate Professionals, or AMPI, that the conditions are in place to guarantee investment in the state, reactivate the economy and create jobs.

In addition to a third project — a 200-million-peso boutique hotel at the Yagul archaeological site, about 36 kilometers from Oaxaca city — the governor revealed he had met recently with Mexican and foreign investors who are considering projects worth US $2 billion.

In order to make things smoother, he said, the state will create a new agency to reduce bureaucratic procedures for those who wish to invest.

Although the sites of the new Walmart stores were not revealed, Grupo Posadas’ new Gran Fiesta Americana hotel will be located near the Parque El Llano in Oaxaca city’s historic center. The 500-million-peso property (US $27 million) will be self-sustaining, said company official Mariano Rosales, employing energy-saving lighting and systems to recycle and save water.

He said construction is almost set to begin and completion of the project will take about 18 months. The hotel will employ 250 people.

Meanwhile, the Oaxaca local of the CNTE teachers’ union, Section 22, is planning to mobilize in May, as it has done for years, and reorganize in order to “resist the assault by the state.”

1465,FL-2019-000179-CAN,More military members deploy to Ontario cottage country in response to flooding - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/more-military-members-deploy-to-ontario-cottage-country-in-response-to-flooding-1.4398710,"Communities in central Ontario's flood-ravaged cottage country worked to stave off more damage on Monday while bracing for heavy rainfall forecast for later in the week.

More military personnel were deployed throughout the region and municipalities called on volunteers to help replenish the supply of sandbags as parts of the Muskoka and Kawartha regions remained under water thanks to surging lakes and rivers.

Local authorities said the rapid rise of water levels had begun to slow but the spectre of intensified flooding surfaced in the latest Environment Canada forecast.

A special weather statement covering much of central Ontario called for between 20 and 40 additional millimetres of rain to fall beginning on Wednesday, placing potential new strains on the handful of communities that have already declared states of emergency.

In Bracebridge, Ont., where an emergency declaration was issued last week, residents prepared to welcome additional military members brought in to help manage flood conditions.

Mayor Graydon Smith said 30 more soldiers were slated to join the 60 had that arrived in the area on Sunday, adding all would spend their time filling and deploying sandbags while helping with emergency evacuations as needed.

""We were very pleased to see support from our Canadian military,"" he said. ""We appreciate it greatly, and you're making a profound difference to the folks here in Bracebridge.""

Smith said that while a drinking water advisory issued by the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit remains in place for those consuming well water, municipal water sources have not been contaminated by the flooding.

Bracebridge was one of three municipalities in the Muskoka District to declare a state of emergency after spring runoff and heavy rainfalls drove water levels to historic highs.

The district declared its own state of emergency for the whole area in addition to the local ones in place in Bracebridge, Huntsville and Muskoka Lakes Township. The community of Minden Hills, east of the Muskoka area, also declared a flooding emergency.

Muskoka Lakes Township issued an update Monday saying water levels had begun to recede in Huntsville and stabilize near Bracebridge, but noted the Moon River had risen 16 centimetres in the past 24 hours. Lakes Muskoka, Rosseau and Joseph rose modestly by between two and six centimetres, the township said.

Despite the slower rise, the township issued a call for volunteers to come fill sandbags for two hours on Monday afternoon. It also urged those living near the Moon River to consider evacuating from their properties.

Ontario Natural Resources Minister John Yakabuski issued a statement of support for cottage-country residents that also outlined measures the Progressive Conservative government previously took in anticipation of higher water levels, including removing logs to ensure water flow and drawing down lakes in the area.

""This is a very challenging time for many residents in Muskoka who are experiencing high water in their community and flooding in their homes,"" Yakabuski said. ""I want to assure residents that my ministry has taken action to mitigate flooding and will continue to do what we can to assist.""

1505,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egyptian women flood Instagram with #MeToo stories as suspect arrested - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-women-harassment-trfn-idUSKBN2482PP,"AMMAN/CAIRO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Hundreds of Egyptian women are speaking out about sexual violence after a #MeToo campaign on Instagram led to the arrest of a man accused of raping and blackmailing multiple women.

The Instagram account Assault Police said more than 100 women had given testimonies since it was set up to target the man on July 1, and the public prosecution office said on Monday that the man was under arrest as it carried out investigations.

Lawyer Tarek Elawady said the events of the last few days showed that Egypt was starting to take sex crimes seriously and women should have the courage to speak out, even though it was difficult in the patriarchal society.

“This is now the start of an opportunity (for change) that we must take advantage of,” said Elawady, who represented his own daughter in a harassment case and won.

“We must shed our culture of victim blaming. We cannot keep telling girls, ‘It’s because you were walking wrong or were dressed inappropriately’.”

A 2017 Thomson Reuters Foundation poll found Cairo to be the most dangerous megacity for women and 99% of women in Egypt interviewed by the United Nations in 2013 reported sexual harassment.

An outcry over attacks on women near Cairo’s Tahrir Square during President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s inauguration celebrations in 2014 prompted a new law punishing sexual harassment with at least six months in jail.

Seeing convictions under this law has gradually encouraged the public to be more sympathetic toward victims, Elawady said.

PRIVACY

Egypt’s public prosecution office said that the man targeted by the Instagram account Assault Police was being held for 15 days while it investigated the allegations made by four women, one under the age of 18.

Women’s rights activists said Egyptian women were now finding their voice because they saw the legal system was protecting their identities.

“With the public prosecution protecting the right of the girls to privacy of their data, they have been encouraged to go and testify,” said Nehad Abul-Komsan, director of the Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights, an advoacy group.

“It will also encourage other girls and will pave the way for other sexual harassment cases to be revealed.”

The government’s National Council for Women said on Tuesday that it had received 400 complaints and enquiries about violence against women from 1 to 5 July.

The country’s top Islamic clerical authority al-Azhar also encouraged women to report incidents, saying that silence posed a threat to society and led to more violations.

PROUD

Despite having been shunned by her family for accusing her father of abusing her, Egyptian-American journalist Reem Abdellatif joined the online campaign in a video message of encouragement for women sharing their stories.

“The fact that these girls are speaking out this loudly with this kind of momentum - I’ve never seen it before,” she said by phone from the Netherlands where she is currently based.

“And it’s not just this guy. Like I said in my video, he’s only a symbol for what we’ve been having to deal with for decades.”

There has been some backlash on social media, with some calling the accusers liars and hypocrites and others saying women who were raised properly should know to dress appropriately.

But most comments were supportive, with many using the #MeToo hashtag - used to reveal sexual misconduct by powerful men, including now jailed former movie producer Harvey Weinstein - to highlight the taboo issue of sexual harassment in Egypt.

“I am very proud of this new generation of young girls who speak up. Harassment and rape are shameful for those who commit it, not the victim,” tweeted Cairo-based Tunisian actress and lawyer Hend Sabry.",2020-07-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'public', 'harassment', 'egyptian', 'suspect', 'elawady', 'instagram', 'prosecution', 'encouraged', 'man', 'metoo', 'arrested', 'women', 'girls', 'sexual']",Egypt,news article,English

Cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, and Dengue fever were reported in neighborhoods that were still flooded a week after the deluge started, city administration spokesman Ali Sajid said.

Patients with minor to severe symptoms started streaming into the hospitals on August 31, Sajid added.

The situation could worsen in the coming days if immediate measures are not taken, said Dr. Iqbal Memon, a specialist for infectious diseases.

Almost 50 people have so far been killed in the heaviest rains to ever hit the city, Pakistan's disaster management agency said.

Nearly half of the metropolis with around 20 million inhabitants was still inundated, despite heavy machinery deployed by the military and municipal authorities to drain out the water. It could take rescue agencies a few more days to pump out the stagnant water from streets and buildings, Sajid said.

Pakistan's largest charity, Edhi Foundation, also said their ambulances had picked up a large number of patients with water-borne diseases from inundated areas.

""The number [of total cases] today was double as much as on a normal day,"" Edhi's spokesman Mohamed Bilal said.

The problem was severe among children and in neighborhoods where water supply lines are mixed with those for sewerage, Bilal said.

951,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Europe key to game's progress in Romania - Southland Times,https://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/sport/rugby-world-cup/5592017/Europe-key-to-games-progress-in-Romania,"POTENTIAL: Romania assistant coach and All Black World Cup title winner Steve McDowall hopes his team can be competitive in the group stages of the World Cup.

Romanian assistant coach Steve McDowall believes his adopted nation has the potential to improve on the world stage in the coming years if they can get more players into the top European leagues.

The former All Black prop, who was part of New Zealand's 1987 World Cup winning team, has been working with the Romanians since 2008 and said the game was slowly developing in the southeastern European country.

Eight members of the Romanian World Cup squad ply their trade professionally in France, with hardnosed prop Paulica Ion also playing abroad with London Irish in the English premiership.

McDowall said for Romania to become more of an international threat in the future they needed to have more players breaking through into the top-level European club competitions, where they would be exposed to tougher competition and a higher level of coaching.

""We've some good young guys. It's about getting them out to play in other teams in France and England at a better level. A lot of the older guys that have been playing in France are now basically finished. We've got two or three guys that are going into France, but we need to have a few more guys going back in there to maintain a certain level.""

McDowall also stressed there needed to be much more of a focus on rugby in the schools and said the country battled from a lack of grass fields to play the game on.

""Just about every school does not have fields. It's all bricks and concrete slabs around. If we can encourage schools to come in and be a part of a sport activity and slowly build the relationship, then hopefully we can grow from Rippa Rugby into the touch and obviously the sevens, leading into the 15s.""

Romania have qualified for every World Cup since 1987 but have never won more than one pool game at any of the tournaments.

The Oaks will be up against it at this year's spectacle, being grouped with England, Argentina, Scotland and Georgia. Their first three opponents should prove too difficult an obstacle to overcome but they will back themselves in their final pool game against the Georgians in Palmerston North.

McDowall said they were aiming to be competitive at the tournament and was confident they could surprise those sceptics who predict they will be the whipping boys of the group.

His contract with the Romanian Rugby Federation expires after the World Cup, but he said his wife and four children were adjusting well to their new life in the Romanian capital of Bucharest, and he was keen to stay on in the job.

McDowall, who played 46 tests for New Zealand between 1985 and 1992, said he would be keeping a close eye on the All Blacks during the World Cup and was optimistic they had the people and the ability to break their 24-year title drought. ""From what I've seen in the past, they do have the ability to go through and win. It's not going to be a given thing. They're going to have to work hard and hopefully the lessons from 2007 give them some direction at this World Cup.""

1397,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Canada residents split: to move or not after two floods in two years - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2019-04-canada-residents-years.html,"An official report published earlier this month said Canada is warming at twice the rate of other countries, bringing a higher risk of extreme weather events, including wildfires and floods

Michelle Lorrain climbs into a canoe and paddles down a flooded street to check in on her parents desperately trying to save their ""dream home"" from rising waters in Canada's capital region—the second time in two years.

""We're all discouraged and ready to give up,"" she told AFP, holding back tears as waters creeped from the nearby Gatineau and Ottawa Rivers.

Her father, she said, cried when she last saw him a day earlier. He'd just finished renovating his basement and it was now water-damaged.

""This is his dream house,"" she said, pointing to a modest two-story house in the distance shored up by sand bags and surrounded by flood waters, adding that neighbors in this part of Gatineau, Quebec ""are all in the same boat.""

A few blocks over, Gilles Raymond in hip waders surveilled the flooding.

""We had the same thing in 2017,"" he recalled. ""We expect it's going to be the same thing again this year.""

""It's nerve-wracking,"" he said. If his water pump fails, his home will be lost. But he's optimistic that everyone is better prepared this time.

Climate change

Homes lost now, however, could be gone forever.

There is mounting pressure, led by Quebec Premier Francois Legault, to not rebuild those at risk of repeat flooding.

Twenty-three homes damaged in 2017 in the neighborhood have already been demolished.

Firefighters check on people in their homes in preparation for increased flooding in Gatineau, Quebec

Ghost lots dot the area, filled with water several feet deep. Sand bags as high as six feet protect those remaining.

""I'm not interested in leaving,"" Raymond said. ""I'm 69 years old today. If next year it starts again we'll see. I'll be 70.""

His sister lives further up the street.

""When she saw the vacant lots (where homes were demolished) she started crying, it was very emotional, we grew up with these people and now they're just gone.""

Jocelyn Laplante, checking on his parents, said they have lived in their house for more than 50 years and ""they hope to continue to until they die.""

The biologist is of the opinion that damaged homes in flood plains shouldn't be rebuilt, but acknowledges that it is a hard sell for many.

""It make sense,"" he said, ""to give the land back to Nature especially if it's going to be flooded year after year.""

Soldiers have been helping fill sandbags and even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie dropped by to assist

New reality

""Trying to keep waters from overwhelming dykes is exhausting—both physically and morally,"" he said.

""But people are very attached to their homes. They're working day and night to save them.""

It's a picturesque single-family residential neighborhood with thick woods all around and a river view.

Many of the homes are worth much more than the Can$200,000 (US$150,000) buyout proposed by the Quebec government.

The mayor of Gatineau Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin said more aid monies are needed to help communities cope and adapt to climate change.

An official report published earlier this month said Canada is warming at twice the rate of other countries, bringing a higher risk of extreme weather events, including wildfires and floods.

Floods in progress at Rigaud in the suburbs of Montreal, Quebec, Canada

""We want a solution that is long lasting. But that will take more discussions and hard decisions,"" he said.

More than 300 local residents have asked the municipality for help; 80 are staying in emergency shelters.

Soldiers have been helping fill sandbags. Even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie dropped by to help.

""Unfortunately, we are once again in a flood situation here in Quebec,"" Trudeau commented.

""Across the country we know that with climate change, it will happen more and more often,"" he said.

""This is a new reality that we will be facing in the coming years, we have to start thinking about how we are going to adapt, how we are going to help people.""

Close to 1,000 troops have been deployed in Quebec to prevent a recurrence of the devastating floods of 2017, the worst in half a century.

Though no fresh casaulty was reported in Bihar in the past 24 hours, 13 districts continued to remain under water affecting 88.46 lakh people, a state disaster management department statement said.

Good news came from Assam too, where death count stayed unchanged at 86 Wednesday.

Bihar has been witnessing flood since early this month due to torrential rainfall in the catchment areas of Nepal .

According to disaster management department report, 88.46 lakh people in 1269 panchayats of 111 blocks of 13 districts have been affected by floods in the state.

The worst-affected districts are Sitamarhi and Madhubani which account for 37 and 30 casualties respectively taken together more than half of the state-wide death count.

Food is being prepared for the affected population at 442 community kitchens and distributed by 876 personnel equipped with 133 boats, who are assisted by 19 teams of NDRF dispatched from the headquarters of its 9th battalion here.

With people returning to their homes after water receding in several areas, the number of relief camps has reduced to four in which 1250 people have taken shelter.

The flood water has started receding from Darbhanga, where more than 16.33 lakh people have been affected by inundation, and the traffic on Darbhanga-Samastipur rail section is likely to start again in next two-three days, Darbhanga District Magistrate Thyagrajan SM said.

According to Water Resources department daily bulletin, the number of rivers flowing above the danger level has reduced to four from five. The rivers- Baghmati, Burhi Gandak, Adhwara and Khiroi- are flowing above their danger level at seven places in Bihar.

1854,FL-2021-000038-KEN,The United States Announces More Than $95 Million in Humanitarian Assistance for the People of South Sudan - South Sudan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/united-states-announces-more-95-million-humanitarian-assistance-people-south,"Office of Press Relations

press@usaid.gov

Today, the United States announced more than $95 million in additional humanitarian assistance for the people of South Sudan who are affected by ongoing political conflict and are facing extreme food insecurity, including likely famine. This funding includes more than $52 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and nearly $43 million from the U.S. Department of State. It brings the total U.S. humanitarian assistance to more than $482 million so far in Fiscal Year 2021.

With this new assistance, USAID will help provide emergency food and nutrition assistance, essential healthcare, shelter, safe drinking water, and sanitation and hygiene services to some of the nearly 4 million people impacted. When possible, the Agency procures food from South Sudanese farmers who were able to harvest their crops. This life-saving assistance will also support people who are internally displaced, as well as South Sudanese refugees in host communities in Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

South Sudan is facing the highest levels of food insecurity and malnutrition since its independence in 2011. The upcoming May-to-July lean season is expected to be the most severe on record and has the potential to leave more than 7 million people, including more than a million children, in need of food assistance. Recent floods, political instability, and COVID-19 have further exacerbated a dire situation.

The United States is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the South Sudan response efforts, and we remain committed to helping the people of South Sudan. Humanitarian assistance will not solve the conflict, but it is vital to keeping civilians alive. Ultimately, a political solution is the only way to end the suffering of the South Sudanese people.",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['95', 'united', 'million', 'food', 'sudan', 'sudanese', 'usaid', 'announces', 'states', 'assistance', 'humanitarian', 'south', 'political']",Kenya,news article,English
748,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Increased atmospheric vapor pressure deficit reduces global vegetation growth - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaax1396,"Atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is a critical variable in determining plant photosynthesis. Synthesis of four global climate datasets reveals a sharp increase of VPD after the late 1990s. In response, the vegetation greening trend indicated by a satellite-derived vegetation index (GIMMS3g), which was evident before the late 1990s, was subsequently stalled or reversed. Terrestrial gross primary production derived from two satellite-based models (revised EC-LUE and MODIS) exhibits persistent and widespread decreases after the late 1990s due to increased VPD, which offset the positive CO 2 fertilization effect. Six Earth system models have consistently projected continuous increases of VPD throughout the current century. Our results highlight that the impacts of VPD on vegetation growth should be adequately considered to assess ecosystem responses to future climate conditions.

Changes of VPD are important for terrestrial ecosystem structure and function. Leaf and canopy photosynthetic rates decline when atmospheric VPD increases due to stomatal closure ( 9 ). A recent study highlighted that increases in VPD rather than changes in precipitation substantially influenced vegetation productivity ( 10 ). Increasing VPD notably affects vegetation growth ( 11 – 13 ), forest mortality ( 14 ), and maize yields ( 15 ). In addition, rising VPD greatly limits land evapotranspiration in many biomes by altering the behavior of plant stomata ( 9 ). Given that the global precipitation is projected to remain steady ( 16 ), the changing VPD and soil drying would likely constrain plant carbon uptake and water use in terrestrial ecosystems ( 17 ). However, the large-scale constraints of VPD changes on vegetation growth have not yet been quantified. In this study, we determined the changes in VPD trends through observation-based global climate datasets, and then quantified the impacts of these VPD changes on vegetation growth and productivity, using satellite-based vegetation index [i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] and leaf area index (LAI), tree-ring width chronologies, and remotely sensed estimates of gross primary production (GPP).

Vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which describes the difference between the water vapor pressure at saturation and the actual water vapor pressure for a given temperature, is an important driver of atmospheric water demand for plants ( 1 ). Rising air temperature increases saturated water vapor pressure at a rate of approximately 7%/K according to the Clauius-Clapeyron relationship, which will drive an increase in VPD if the actual atmospheric water vapor content does not increase by exactly the same amount as saturated vapor pressure (SVP). Numerous studies have indicated substantial changes of relative humidity (ratio of actual water vapor pressure to saturated water vapor pressure) not only in continental areas located far from oceanic humidity ( 2 ) but also in humid regions ( 3 ). Although the long-term trend of globally averaged land surface relative humidity remains insignificant ( 4 , 5 ), a sharp decrease has been observed since 2000 ( 6 , 7 ), implying a sharp increase in land surface VPD. However, the causes of changing atmospheric water demand are still unclear ( 8 ).

RESULTS

This study used four observation-based globally gridded climate datasets—CRU (Climatic Research Unit), ERA-Interim, HadISDH, and MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) (table S1)—to analyze the long-term trend of VPD over vegetated land. Similar to previous analyses (4, 5, 7), anomalies in all four datasets showed that VPD trends were temporally and spatially heterogeneous over recent decades (Fig. 1). A piecewise linear regression method was used to quantify the change in trends and detect the potential turning point (TP) in each dataset. It was observed that VPD increased slightly before the late 1990s but increased more strongly afterward with 1.66 to 17 times larger trends according to the four datasets (fig. S1). The datasets showed that 53 to 64% of vegetated areas experienced increased VPD trends since the late 1990s (fig. S2). To illustrate the magnitude and spatial variability of VPD change, we calculated the global pattern of the percentage change of annual growing season mean VPD between two periods of 1982–1986 and 2011–2015 (fig. S3A). On average, the annual growing season mean VPD of 2011–2015 was 11.26% higher than that of 1982–1986, and the VPD increased larger than 5% in more than 53% area. In addition, the increases of global mean VPD over 12 months were positively correlated with the mean VPD values of 1982–1986 at more than 64.5% areas (fig. S3B), which implies that the higher VPD increases in the months with high VPD.

Fig. 1 Global mean vapor pressure deficit (VPD) anomalies of vegetated area over the growing season. Anomalies are relative to the mean of 1982–2015 when data from all datasets are available. Vegetation areas were determined using the MODIS land cover product. Blue line and gray area illustrate the mean and SD of VPD simulated by six CMIP5 models under the RCP4.5 scenario.

Apart from HadISDH, datasets showed that the increased saturated water vapor pressure and decreased actual water vapor pressure jointly determined the increases of VPD after the TP. On average, the rate of increase in saturated water vapor was 1.43 to 1.64 times higher after the TP year than before, and the actual water vapor exhibited stalled or decreased trends (fig. S4). Increased air temperature explains the changes in saturated water vapor pressure (fig. S4). The HadISDH dataset indicates a decrease in saturated water vapor because of large spatial gaps in the dataset.

A change of oceanic evaporation is the most important mechanism for the observed decrease in actual water vapor pressure over the land (18). Oceanic evaporation is the most important source of atmosphere water vapor, and approximately 85% of atmospheric water vapor is evaporated from oceans, with the remaining 15% coming from evaporation and transpiration over land (19). Most of the moisture over land is transported from the oceans, which accounts for 35% of precipitation and 55% of evapotranspiration over land (19). We analyzed long-term changes of oceanic evaporation based on a global oceanic evaporation dataset [Objectively Analyzed Air–Sea Fluxes (OAFlux)] (20). The almost 60-year time series showed that the decadal change of global oceanic evaporation (E ocean ) was marked by a distinct transition from an upward to a downward trend around 1998 (Fig. 2A). The global oceanic E ocean has decreased by approximately 2.08 mm year−1, from a peak of 1197 mm year−1 in 1998 to a low 1166 mm year−1 in 2015 (Fig. 2A), and 76% of the sea surface revealed a decreased E ocean after 1999 (Fig. 2B). Rhein et al. (16) reported stalled increases of sea surface temperature after the late 1990s based on multiple global datasets, which substantially limited oceanic evaporation (20). Some studies using global climate models (GCMs) also highlighted that VPD trends over land were predominantly explained by dynamic mechanisms related to moisture supply from oceanic source regions (8, 21). Changes in the recycling of atmospheric moisture over land controlled by soil moisture in supply-limited regions may be an additional contribution to the observed increase of VPD. Koster et al. (22) showed that moisture variability contributed to total precipitation variance in mid-northern latitude regions such as the western United States. Drier soils evaporate less and thus lead to lower water vapor in the atmosphere (23). Previous study reported a decreased trend in the global land evapotranspiration after the late 1990s limited by soil moisture supply (24).

Figure 3 illustrates that the satellite-based NDVI substantially increased from 1982 to 1998 (y = 0.0014x − 1.86, R2 = 0.43, P < 0.05), while NDVI remained constant and then stalled after 1999 (y = −0.0004x + 1.23, R2 = 0.06, P = 0.65) (Fig. 3A). From 1982 to 1998, approximately 84% of the vegetation surface showed an increased NDVI trend (28.50% with a significant increase; Fig. 4A). In comparison, after 1999, the trends of NDVI over many regions reversed, and 59% of vegetation areas showed a pronounced NDVI browning (decreasing) trend (21.50% with a significant decrease; Figs. 3B and 4). Mean NDVI trends for 12 months after 1999 were lower than those from 1982 to 1998 over globally vegetated areas (Fig. 3C). Moreover, we analyzed long-term trends of LAI based on four global LAI datasets [Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), GLOMap, LAI3g, and Terrestrial Climate Data Record (TCDR); table S1] (25). Despite the large variability of the estimated interannual LAI among the four products, all four LAI datasets exhibited a transition from increasing trends before the late 1990s to decreasing trends afterward (fig. S5). The LAI showed a decreasing trend since the late 1990s over vegetated areas of 64.72, 72.62, 62.73, and 80.11% for GLASS, GLOMap, LAI3g, and TCDR datasets, respectively (fig. S6). The differences of NDVI and LAI trends during these two periods are the opposite of VPD trends derived from four VPD datasets.

Partial correlation analysis indicated significant correlations of detrended VPD with detrended NDVI and LAI when the impacts of air temperature, radiation, and atmospheric CO 2 concentration were excluded (Fig. 5). Detrended NDVI over 62% of the vegetated areas shows a negative correlation with detrended VPD (about 14% with a significant negative correlation) (Fig. 5A). Similarly, four detrended satellite-based LAI correlated negatively with detrended VPD over 65 to 70% of vegetated areas (16 to 22% with a significant negative correlation) (Fig. 5, B to E). In addition, all five satellite-based datasets show highly consistent signs of correlation with VPD, and at least three datasets revealed consistently negative correlations with VPD over 72% of vegetated area (Fig. 5F). A machine learning method [i.e., random forest (RF)] was used to reconstruct NDVI based on atmospheric [CO 2 ] concentration and five climate factors (air temperature, precipitation, radiation, wind speed, and VPD) over the last 34 years in each pixel (fig. S7) and then model experiments were applied to separate the impacts of VPD as well as of other variables (see Materials and Methods). Globally, the model experiments suggest that the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, air temperature, and VPD are the most important contributors for the variability of NDVI (fig. S8A). Rising VPD was found to significantly decrease NDVI, indicated by the larger negative NDVI differences from 1999 to 2015, suggesting that substantial increases of VPD strongly limited NDVI (fig. S8B).

Fig. 5 Spatial patterns of correlations between VPD and satellite-based NDVI/LAI. Partial correlations between detrended CRU VPD and detrended satellite-based NDVI/LAI were shown: GIMMS NDVI (A), GLASS LAI (B), GLOBMap LAI (C), LAI3g LAI (D), and TCDR LAI (E) during 1982–2015 (GLOBMap and LAI3g from 1982–2011). The insets in (A) to (E) show the relative frequency (%) distribution of significant negative correlations (Neg*; P < 0.05; dark green), negative correlations (Neg; light green), positive correlations (Pos; light red), and significant positive correlations (Pos*; P < 0.05; dark red). (F) Number of satellite-based NDVI/LAI datasets with the same sign of correlation: e.g., (5, –) indicates that all five satellite-based NDVI/LAI datasets showed negative correlations with VPD.

This study used two satellite-based models [revised eddy covariance–light use efficiency (EC-LUE) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)] to investigate the impacts of VPD on long-term changes of global GPP (26, 27). EC-LUE and MODIS showed quite similar long-term trends of GPP, with a significantly increased trend from 1982 to the late 1990s, averaged at 0.73 Pg C year−1 (P < 0.05; from 1982 to 1998) and 0.26 Pg C year−1 (P < 0.05; from 1982 to 1997) over globally vegetated area, respectively (Fig. 6A). The GPP trends then stalled and decreased afterward (−0.016 Pg C year−1, P = 0.67 and −0.032 Pg C year−1, P = 0.44) (Fig. 6A). The GPP trends derived from the two models during the two periods are the opposite of VPD trends derived from the four VPD datasets.

(B) GPP sensitivity to climate variables, NDVI/fPAR, and atmospheric CO 2 concentration. (C) Contributions of climate variables, NDVI/fPAR, and atmospheric CO 2 concentration to GPP changes over the two periods. Three climate variables are included: vapor pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature (T a ), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

To quantify the impacts of VPD on GPP, we further explored GPP sensitivity to climate variables (i.e., air temperature, VPD, and radiation), atmospheric CO 2 concentration, and satellite-based NDVI/fPAR (see Materials and Methods; Fig. 6B). Two satellite-based models showed the similar GPP sensitivity to VPD, whereby global GPP decreased by 13.82 ± 3.12 Pg C and 18.29 ± 3.65 Pg C with a VPD increase of 0.1 kPa (Fig. 6B), which is comparable to the GPP increase with a 100–parts per million (ppm) rise of atmospheric [CO 2 ] (i.e., β CO2 = 19.01 ± 4.01 Pg C 100 ppm−1). On the basis of the estimated GPP sensitivity, we estimated the contributions of climate variables, CO 2 fertilization, and vegetation index to global GPP over the two study periods (table S2). After the late 1990s, VPD increased by 0.0017 ± 0.0001 kPa year−1 according to the CRU dataset (fig. S1), which resulted in GPP decreases of 0.23 ± 0.09 Pg C year−1 and 0.31 ± 0.11 Pg C year−1 according to the EC-LUE and MODIS models, respectively (Fig. 6C and table S2). The VPD-induced GPP decreases partly counteract the CO 2 fertilization effect (0.38 ± 0.08 Pg C year−1) after the late 1990s with the rising rate of atmospheric CO 2 concentration by 2.02 ± 0.01 ppm year−1. From 1982 to the late 1990s, CO 2 fertilization played a dominant role in the GPP increase (Fig. 6C). According to the EC-LUE model, GPP increases of 0.28 ± 0.15 Pg C year−1 occurred because of the rising atmospheric [CO 2 ] (Fig. 6C and table S2).",2019-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['reduces', 'vegetation', 'global', 'atmospheric', 'gpp', 'water', 'vapor', 'deficit', 'pressure', 'ndvi', 'trends', 'increased', 'fig', 'vpd', 'growth', 'c']",Ghana,news article,English
