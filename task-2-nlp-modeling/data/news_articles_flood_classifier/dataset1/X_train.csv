1395,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Canada: extreme floods show climate threat as experts warn of further tumult - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/30/canada-flooding-quebec-montreal-justin-trudeau-climate-change,"News footage showed people boating where they once walked, homes and cars filled with muddy water, volunteers searching for lost pets. Thousands of people in eastern Canada have been forced from their homes as heavy rains and meltwater cause unprecedented flood evacuations.

One of the worst-hit areas was a Montreal suburb where more than 6,000 people were evacuated after a dike burst on Sunday. A further 3,000 people were evacuated in other parts of Quebec, and in Ontario and New Brunswick, hundreds more are waiting out the floods in hotels and shelters.

“This year’s flooding is very extreme,” said Ursule Boyer-Villemaire, an associate professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal who specializes in disaster management and climate resilience planning.

Climate change means that catastrophic flooding will only become more common, but experts say the events of the past week highlight the fact that Canada has still not done enough to prepare for such disasters.

The current mass evacuations have forced Canadian politicians at every level to confront this dramatic evidence of climate change in a federal election year. Speaking on Sunday night, Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, suggested that using federal money to help relocate communities affected by flooding was a possibility. “Once we secure the situation through this spring flooding season, we will have to have significant reflections and conversations on how we move forward,” he said, according to the Canadian Press.

This is not the first time Quebec has seen large-scale flooding: in 2017, Quebec rivers reached similar levels.

The fact that two so-called “hundred-year floods” occurred so close together has climate preparedness experts concerned.

Rapid temperature increases in spring and huge variation in the amount of precipitation, two factors in the flood, are related to climate change, said Laura Coristine, a biologist at the University of British Columbia.

But Canada has done little to prepare for flooding that is likely to become even more common as the planet continues to warm, she said. “Responding to disaster is going to be a lot more expensive than being proactive in vulnerable sites.”

Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, whose government has fought hard against the imposition of a country-wide carbon tax aimed at curbing emissions, toured flooded areas near the Ottawa River on Friday night. According to the Canadian Press, Ford did not explicitly mention climate change but did say “something is going on and we have to be conscious of it”.

Meanwhile, the leaders of Quebec and New Brunswick, the other affected provinces, are starting to talk about permanently relocating communities in flood-prone areas.

That is not a simple thing to consider, said political scientist Daniel Henstra, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo who studies flooding in Canada: when a similar strategy was tried in Calgary after 2013 flooding, only 30% of homeowners in a high-risk flood area took the offered buyout so they could move.

Currently, Quebec is offering residents C$200,000 (US$150,000) to move, but that may not even cover the mortgage for many.

There are some other options, Henstra said, such as building flood barriers to keep the water in the river. “These types of barriers are really expensive to install and maintain,” he said “and they cause environmental impacts downstream.” A more widely adopted strategy, globally speaking, is just to plan for flooding and keep people from building in flood plains.

More extreme attempts to get them to move, such as mandating a buyout, could be politically damaging, but that might be what it takes to get everyone out of a flood-prone area, said Henstra. “These are the kind of tough decisions we’re facing,” he says, “and we’re just at the beginning of having those hard conversations.”",2019-04-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['change', 'water', 'warn', 'threat', 'quebec', 'floods', 'canada', 'tumult', 'climate', 'flood', 'extreme', 'university', 'canadian', 'flooding', 'experts', 'henstra']",Canada,news article,English

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has announced a £150 million funding package to be shared between 25 local schemes aiming to improve waterway defences and coastal resilience.

This is part of the Government’s new Flood and Coastal Resilience Innovation Programme – an effort to develop and test new approaches to tackling coastal erosion and mainland flooding – and will be managed by the Environment Agency.

A wide range of approaches tailored to local communities will be trialled, including the restoration of sub-tidal habitats like kelp beds, oyster reefs and sea grass near South Tyneside, and an app to warn residents about the threat of groundwater in Buckinghamshire.

Artificial intelligence and new sensor technology to detect rising water levels will be used in Northumberland, and in Cornwall sand dunes will be protected and saltmarshes restored.

In Slough, the Chinese “sponge city” concept will be deployed, which is the use of permeable roads to soak up surface water, along with natural vegetation to improve drainage.

Environment minister Rebecca Pow said the Government has pledged to invest £5.2 billion in 2,000 new flood and coastal defences over the next six years, adding that “long-term approaches to improve communities’ resilience” is vital in the face of climate change.

She said: “These 25 projects will not only help to inform future approaches to prepare communities for flooding and coastal change across the country, but also help reinforce the UK’s position as a world leader in innovation and new technology as we build back better.”

Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said the project is “extremely exciting” and could be replicated on a larger scale around the world if successful.

She said: “The innovation programme is extremely exciting as it begins to put new aspects of the national flood and coastal erosion risk strategy to the test.

The Story of Economic Genius

Sylvia Nasar

Simon & Schuster: 559 pp., $35

Today’s economy may seem the bleakest in recent memory: plunging consumer confidence, slumping home prices, a stubbornly high unemployment rate. But as Sylvia Nasar reminds us in “Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius,” in 1933 a full 25% of the nation was out of work, suicides were rising sharply, and stocks were trading at one-fifth of their 1929 prices.

Then, as now, public leaders struggled with solving the spiraling economic crisis. In 1934, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt met with John Maynard Keynes, a British economist known for his love of art, his taste in young men and his brilliant if controversial theories. He urged the president to spend more on stimulus programs to shake the country out of its stupor. At a New York dinner the next evening, Keynes told some of his colleagues that every dollar spent by the government — deficit or no — would have a great effect on the nation’s economy.

“Were the seven wonders of the world built by thrift?” he once asked. “I doubt it.”

Keynes and his theory about the benefits of deficit spending still resonate today, as is evident by the debate over the Obama administration’s stimulus program. The exploits of Keynes — he bullied Britain’s National Gallery into buying hundreds of modernist paintings from a fire-sale auction in Paris on the eve of World War I, securing a Cezanne and two Delacroix for himself — would be enough to fill a book. But Keynes is just one of the economists Nasar features in “Grand Pursuit.”

Beginning her book in the era of Charles Dickens, “when the specter of hunger was stalking England,” Nasar takes us through the times that influenced economic thinkers and the theories they put forth. We see Marx — a lazy procrastinator who impregnates his wife and a housekeeper in the same year — walking through the streets of London with his generous, patient sponsor Engels, “their extreme myopia and the sulfurous yellow London fog obscur[ing] everything more than a foot ahead.”

We also see Joseph Schumpeter, who theorized that entrepreneurs were the key to economic progress and who had a habit of challenging university librarians to duels and arriving at lectures in jodhpurs. Beatrice Potter Webb, who advanced the idea of a welfare state and advocated for a government safety net, arrived at that conclusion only after a failed love affair with Joseph Chamberlain, the father of a future British prime minister. Alfred Marshall, a founder of modern economics, wore a handlebar mustache and took up knitting during an illness, and discovered, Nasar writes, that businesses didn’t just exist to produce a profit for their owners. He realized they were also meant to “produce higher living standards for consumers and workers.”

It is the quirks and personalities of these economic thinkers that bring “Grand Pursuit” to life. Nasar argues that the details of their personal successes and failures — along with the weighty history revolving around them — inspired their individual conclusions about how the system works.

But the book can seem at times like just a grab bag of different economists, countries and ideas. In “A Beautiful Mind,” Nasar’s 1998 biography of John Nash Jr. that was made into a movie and nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, the author focused in depth on one man’s theories and personal life. In “Grand Pursuit,” Nasar tries to tackle dozens of men and women, and at times the book gets confusing as different characters — Milton Friedman, for example — wander in and out of chapters. Chapters on Indian economist Amartya Sen and on Joan Robinson’s adulation of the communist governments of Russia and China feel superfluous, making the reader want to jump back to the early 20th century, which Nasar paints more vividly.

Still, through Nasar’s ambitious storytelling, we see Western society evolve from one in which most people live in poverty to one in which government tries to grapple with unemployment and inflation and raise the standard of living for all. If Nasar puts perhaps too much emphasis on the influence of early economic thinkers — who after all were observing conditions rather than creating them — she does show how fully the profession has become entwined with the way governments run. We see the rise of economic forecasting in her pages, as well as the increasing influence of figures like Keynes on leaders like Roosevelt. The number of economists in Washington, D.C., she says, shot up from 100 in 1930 to 5,000 by 1938.

Much of “Grand Pursuit” may be a reminder that as bad as things seem now, they have been worse — much worse — and that those difficult times can shed light on what is happening today. Economists have always tried to come up with theories about how to stimulate flaccid economies. The reader finishes Nasar’s book wondering what brilliant and quirky thinker may fill in the next chapters of our economic history and come up with an idea that shakes our current economy out of its funk.

2048,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"Record Rains, Urban Flooding Woes Continue in Karachi - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/record-rains-urban-flooding-woes-continue-karachi,"ISLAMABAD - Parts of Pakistan's commercial hub, Karachi, continued to be submerged Monday, days after record-breaking rainfall caused heavy flooding.

""Normal rainfall in Karachi in the month of August is 68 millimeters (6.8 centimeters). This year, we have recorded 587.5 millimeters (58.75 centimeters) so far,"" said Muhammad Riaz, the director general of Pakistan's Meteorological Department.

Last Thursday, the city received more than 23 centimeters of rain, the highest on record in a single day.

Residents in the port city posted cellphone footage of houses destroyed, streets resembling rivers, cars and motorcycles floating, and people swimming.

""What we have witnessed in Karachi today was apocalyptic in some ways. The true hurt & damage will be visible after the water recedes. Nothing but devastation,"" resident Fakhr e Alam tweeted along with cellphone video of his neighborhood, where water covered almost half the walls and gates of surrounding houses.

Another video shot from inside a car showed the bottom part of the steering wheel submerged.

The flooding severely hampered movement, including for emergency vehicles.

""My Uncle in Karachi had a heart attack this evening and relatives and neighbors tried everything from trying to drive him to physically carrying him on their shoulders to get to the hospital, but they couldn't make it on time and he passed away,"" Fatima Akram Hayat said in a tweet.

Residents complained of sewage on the streets and in water tanks. Power was out in several areas for days amid sweltering heat and humidity. The outage also caused disruptions in cellphone service, interrupting emergency management and leaving citizens out of touch with loved ones.

In some cases, the electricity cables broke, causing fears of electrocution.

""Few residents located in these zones have also requested us not to power up supply since it may be a safety hazard for them,"" tweeted Karachi's electricity provider, K-Electric.

Meanwhile, authorities said another weather system was hovering over Sindh province, increasing the likelihood of more rains in the coming days.

The large metropolis, considered to be Pakistan's economic lifeline, has faced problems of overcrowding and unplanned development since the country's independence in 1947.

""[A] very large majority of its population lives in informal settlements in poorly designed housing with inadequate services,"" according to a 2017 working paper, titled, ""Drivers of climate change vulnerability at different scales in Karachi.""

Much of the city's planning woes have been exacerbated over the decades due to corruption coupled with political rivalries among local, provincial and federal governments.

Parts of Karachi are owned by the federal government. In addition, local and provincial governments have set up parallel structures of service delivery, like trash pickup, diluting resources.

""We need to clearly understand who is responsible for what. Until the municipal functions are divided between the federal and provincial governments, problems of delivery will remain,"" Murtaza Wahab, the spokesman for Sindh government, told local news channel Geo News.

According to the working paper, bad governance and development shortcomings in Karachi ""have created vulnerabilities at different scales that are likely to exacerbate the impacts of climate change-related weather events taking place within the city and elsewhere in the country.""

Development professional Zaigham Khan said overcrowding and slum developments were a result of the city absorbing the social and economic problems of the entire country.

""If there is terrorism in FATA (erstwhile tribal area), locals move to Karachi. When there is war in Afghanistan, the most refugees arrive in Karachi. When there are floods in the country, the affected go to Karachi. If there is insurgency in Balochistan, locals escape to Karachi. If there are no jobs in southern Punjab, the preferred refuge is Karachi,"" he said.

Like other metropolitan cities of the world, he said, Karachi needs to be managed by a strong municipal government and an empowered mayor, but he added that local politics intervened in the execution of such an idea.",2020-08-31 07:00:00+00:00,"['woes', 'rains', 'city', 'problems', 'local', 'record', 'pakistan', 'water', 'rain', 'pakistans', 'flooded', 'flooding', 'karachi', 'urban', 'continue', 'provincial']",Pakistan,news article,English
500,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Rising food prices threaten world's most vulnerable - Kitco NEWS,https://www.kitco.com/commentaries/2021-05-18/Rising-food-prices-threaten-world-s-most-vulnerable.html,"When we think of global food insecurity, the United States is not top of mind. At least, it shouldn't be. In fact, over 50 million American households out of a population of 328 million are food insecure — ie., lacking access to healthy food.

A study by Northwestern University found the pandemic has doubled food insecurity and tripled it among households with children, meaning one in six adults and one in four kids are not eating properly due to economic reasons.

Of course, hunger didn't begin with the coronavirus, but it has made it worse. Feeding America estimates 35.2 million people faced hunger in 2019, compared to 54 million in 2020.

The current throng of unemployed workers, nearly 10 million who have lost their livelihoods owing to virus-related layoffs/ business closures, contributes to another problem — less people working means fewer contributions to the needy.

Certainly the plight of the poor, and working poor, has improved over the past few months in the United States. Trillions in covid-19 stimulus has been rolled out, including direct payments of $600, $1,200 and $1,400. Large swaths of the economy (more so than Canada) have opened up, a third of the population, or 107 million people, has been vaccinated, and unemployment has fallen to a less dire 6.1%.

US stock markets were knocked back this week but that might not be a bad thing. They are looking decidedly bubbly, as investors throw everything but the kitchen sink into equities, confident that a booming economy will keep stock valuations lofty and dividend payouts secure.

Yet despite all of this good news, an elephant in the room threatens to stomp all over the tender green shoots of economic recovery, and that is inflation — or more specifically, food inflation.

Everything going up

North Americans have likely been noticing their trips to the grocery store are getting more expensive.

The pandemic has put tremendous pressure on supply chains, and the prices of many agricultural commodities such as grain, corn and soybeans, have skyrocketed. This is due to a number of reasons including heavy demand from China, the world's largest consumer of commodities whose economy grew at a blistering 18% in the first quarter, bad weather and drought —dealt with separately in an upcoming section.

A shortage of supply, and a need to replenish hog herds after an outbreak of deadly African swine fever, is expected to push corn imports to 28 million tons this season, the most on record, according to Bloomberg data.

The news sent corn prices to over $6 a bushel, an 8-year high.

Over the past year, corn has nearly doubled (+84%), soybeans have gained 72%, sugar is up 59%, wheat has climbed 19% and coffee has risen 13%.

According to the World Bank, global food prices have gone up by 38% since January, 2020.

Increases in the prices of grains, like corn and soybeans used in animal feed, typically get passed down the supply chain to the prices of meats, including chicken, pork and beef.

A recent Troy Media column states many food manufacturers have already signaled that processing costs have gone up, making it practically certain that retailers will mark goods higher to protect their margins.

Canada's Food Price Report predicts that prices will increase as much as 5% this year, representing almost $700 more for groceries, for the average Canadian family.

In the United States, food prices climbed 2.4% in April, compared to the same month a year ago, including a 3.8% rise in restaurant and take-out meals.

It isn't only groceries that are increasing in price.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the US consumer price index (CPI) surged in April by 4.2%, the most in any 12-month period since 2008, as economic activity picked up but was constrained in some sectors by supply bottlenecks.

Among the costlier items, gasoline rose 50%, while the prices of used cars, representing a third of the CPI increase, climbed by 10%, the most on record; car and truck rentals shot up 82% and airline fares leapt 9.6%.

Gas prices were recently influenced by a cyberattack on the nation's largest energy pipeline network. The May 7 attack on Colonial Pipeline prompted it to halt 2.5 million barrels a day, triggering fuel shortages panic buying and higher pump prices in the southeastern United States.

A video embedded into the WSJ story, narrated by a reporter, states that rising prices are being noticed in a wide range of consumer products, everything from produce, apples and berries, to meat, packaged foods, foil wrap, home appliances, and lawn & garden products.

As for what is causing this inflation, part of it is bad weather, such as the winter storm in Texas that interrupted the supply chain for resin, used in packaging.

Lumber, also used to package goods, has quadrupled due to skyrocketing demand for housing, fueled by rock-bottom interest rates, as well as a shortage of processed wood.

Some companies are running low on drivers and are having to pay them more, which is trickling down the supply chain to higher shipping costs.

Consumers are reacting to the price increases by choosing store brands over name-brand products, buying cheaper frozen food instead of fresh, enrolling in awards programs and driving less.

The reporter who looked into the issue thinks that prices will continue to rise both for food and household products — a view that appears to be shared by experts.

""The CPI data point feeds into a myopic narrative that the US is overheating and the Fed is one step away from tightening,"" Bloomberg quoted Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, a wealth management firm.

US stocks slumped this week after a report showed inflation rose more than forecast, stoking concerns that price pressures could stifle a recovery.

Producer prices surged the most on record in April, a year-on-year increase of 6.2%, beating expectations of 5.8%.

""There is more inflation coming,"" Zero Hedge quoted Luca Zaramella, chief financial officer at Mondelez International Inc. Speaking on the food and beverage maker's April 27 earnings call, she added ""The higher inflation will require some additional pricing and some additional productivities to offset the impact.""

The US Federal Reserve has already said it will tolerate inflation above the normal 2% target, and let the economy run hotter before stepping in to cool it with rate hikes.

China

Adding to inflation worries is what's happening in China. The Chinese economy has led the world in growth, being the first to emerge from the pandemic. Like in the United States, however, the recovery after months of strict lockdowns in cities like Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, is pressuring prices.

Chinese exports rose sharply in March and imports grew to the most in four years, suggesting improved global demand amid worldwide vaccination programs.

After months of deflation (falling prices) China's producer price index (PPI) rose 4.4% in March, the most since July 2018, as the cost of oil, copper and agricultural goods rallied. As the world's biggest exporter, China's rising prices threaten to stoke inflation around the world.

Its factory gate prices climbed more than expected in April while the PPI rose 6.8%, the most since October of 2017.

Going hungry

The global food price increases are clearly of most concern, especially for seniors living on fixed incomes, the poor on social assistance, and the working poor getting by paycheck to paycheck.

For the most vulnerable, not only is food getting more expensive, in some places, it has become less available.

The Guardian reported that people living in poverty around the world are in danger of food shortages as the coronavirus continues.

""Food systems have contracted, because of Covid-19. And food has become more expensive and, in some places, out of reach for people. Food is looking more challenging this year than last year,"" the British newspaper quotes Agnes Kalibata, special envoy to the UN secretary general for the food systems summit 2021.

She noted the main impact of covid has been the shutdown of food markets, which has made it very difficult for farmers. Africa was worst hit, with several countries experiencing serious food prices and shortages, made worse by a drought in East Africa affecting northern Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.

The Guardian reports that many underlying problems have grown worse over the past year, as people have exhausted their reserves of food, cash and family support and now are facing a long crisis without backup.

""We are facing a greater threat this year, as economies have shrunk,"" she said. ""That is happening across the globe, everywhere. Countries are in a very distressed situation, and it is not getting easier – it is getting more difficult. Some countries have hung on, but for how long?""

Kalibata's thoughts are confirmed by the World Bank, which in a May 7 briefing note, states that COVID-19 impacts have led to severe and widespread increases in global food insecurity, affecting vulnerable households in almost every country, with impacts expected to continue through 2021 and into 2022.

Other observations in the note include:

Higher retail prices, combined with reduced incomes, mean more and more households are having to cut down on the quantity and quality of their food consumption.

Numerous countries are experiencing high food price inflation at the retail level, reflecting lingering supply disruptions due to COVID-19 social distancing measures, currency devaluations, and other factors. Rising food prices have a greater impact on people in low- and middle-income countries since they spend a larger share of their income on food than people in high-income countries.

Rapid phone surveys done by the World Bank in 48 countries show a significant number of people running out of food or reducing their consumption.

As of April 2021, the World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that 296 million people in the 35 countries where it works are without sufficient food — 111 million more people than in April 2020.

Us ‘mega-drought'

Back to supply chain issues in the United States, one of the most serious factors likely to worsen higher food prices is the major drought engulfing much of the western US.

Last year a team of scientists reported that the current ""mega-drought"" in the region, lasting nearly two decades, is as bad or worse than any in the past 1,200 years.

As of May 6, 67% of the US West was in a state of ""severe"" drought, and 21% is already in ""exceptional drought"", the worst category out of six in the US Drought Monitor's framework.

The states most at risk are southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. In California, where over a third of the country's vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown, 90% is experiencing drought conditions — an alarming statistic considering the state last year had its worst fire season in history and just saw its second consecutive dry winter, with most areas 75% of normal snowpack.

It's only May, the amount of extreme and exceptional drought is unbelievable.

According to National Geographic, tree rings from northern Mexico and the US West present a record that goes back to around 800 AD. In that 1,200-year span, the region experienced 35 major droughts and four mega-droughts. Most Americans probably identify the 1920s Dust Bowl as among the nation's worst, but that drought only lasted five to 10 years. The current dry stretch started in 2000 and hasn't let up, putting it second only to a highly arid period in the last 1500s.

Climatologists who analyzed the data say the drought would have been bad from natural causes anyway, but the addition of climate change pushed it into extreme territory. Global warming has bumped average temperatures in the American West up 1.6 degrees F since the early 1900s.

Temperatures in California's Central Valley to southern Arizona are expected to climb into the 90s and above 100 in many places Thursday and Friday — not record-breaking but much higher than normal for mid-May.

The problem this year has been made worse by the La Nina weather phenomenon, that began last fall. In a La Nina year, a cooling of Pacific Ocean surface waters shifts precipitation-rich weather patterns northward, making them miss the US Southwest.

Looking at the country as a whole, the US Department of Agriculture says drought coverage across the US continues to approach record levels.

""There have only been four times in the history of the drought monitor that we have seen more than 40% U.S. drought coverage as we come into early May,"" KIWA Radio quotes USDA meteorologist Brad Rippey. ""The current U.S. drought coverage is 46.6% of the lower 48 states in drought. That is a 2.6% increase from what we saw five weeks ago.""

As farmers tend their fields for this year's growing season, 26% of US corn production is in drought, 22% of the soybean crop faces dryer than normal conditions, 35% of winter wheat is in drought, 33% of sorghum and 31% of cotton.

As of May 4, 36% of US cattle production areas were showing drought, while hay producing regions are looking at 33%.

Water concerns

The two decades-long dry spell is taking its toll on western US water supplies. Not only is the area receiving less rainfall, good for filling lakes and streams, the snowpack is far lower.

Folsom Lake in California, normally fed by melting snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains, this year is only half full. Lake Mead, one of two major reservoirs in the Colorado River basin, on which 40 million Americans depend, is reportedly creeping towards a water level minimum that would trigger the first official shortage declaration for the basin.

With Mead just 39% full, the Bureau of Reclamation expects a water conservation plan to be implemented in June. Water allotments to the states that draw from the lower part of the river, like Arizona and Nevada, would see major cuts.

Farmers are bracing for another season of tight water supplies.

In the Klamath River basin along the California-Oregon border, levels are so low that farmers will receive only 8% of the water they usually get, reports National Geographic, adding that local tribes are concerned they won't have enough water to keep salmon populations healthy.

Less water and warmer temperatures in California's rivers and reservoirs led the state to concoct a plan to truck 17 million smolt to San Francisco Bay from various hatcheries, an emergency step not taken since the last major drought in 2014, Reuters reported on Thursday.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a drought emergency in 41 of 58 counties, which according to Modern Farmer, comes with a huge reduction in the amount of available water for agriculture in the region—primarily grapes in wine country…

[W]arnings have been sent to tens of thousands of water rights holders, asking them to start conserving water. For farmers, this likely means that what water remains will be used to maintain perennial crops like fruit and nut trees, rather than planting usual annual crops like vegetables.

Darker times ahead

Without life-giving bands of precipitation to wet parched soil, US farmers are expected to go through another rough growing season.

Lower crop yields mean higher prices for agricultural commodities. Food producers see their margins squeezed by higher input costs and pass these onto consumers.

A higher-income household can shrug off a 5, 10, even a 20% increase in grocery prices. Not so for families and individuals whose grocery budgets are tighter than a shrunken orange peel.

As incomes rise, households spend more on food but it represents a smaller share of their overall budget. Lower-income people don't have room in their budgets for much other than food and shelter.

According to the USDA, in 2019 the poorest households spent an average 36% of their disposable income on food, compared to the 10% that most Americans spend.

With the difficulties covid-19 has placed on grocery supply chains, 2020's figure is expected to be higher. Some are predicting the percentage of disposable personal income the average US household spends on food will reach 40%, with poorer families having to spend well over 50%.

As stated earlier, the prices of many agricultural commodities including corn, wheat and soybeans, are going haywire amid supply disruptions and robust demand. This past March, pork chops and chicken breasts were both up 10%, while the prices of eggs and cheese increased 6% compared to a year earlier.

The latest inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the largest month-to-month CPI increase in almost nine years.

The Economic Collapse blog takes this a step further by pointing out that the bulk of the stimulus spending the Biden administration has promised, has yet to be rolled out, meaning inflation is likely to get a whole lot worse:

Almost everybody loved it when the federal government started sending out big, fat stimulus checks.

But you aren't going to love it when a cart of food costs you $400 at the grocery store.

Whenever the government hands out ""free money"", someone has got to pay for it, and one way we are paying for it is through higher prices.

If you do not believe that this is a major national crisis yet, you will soon, because it won't be too long before most of the country is loudly complaining about how nightmarish inflation has become.

Another commentary notes that ""the [covid] war is far from over,"" with 100 countries yet to receive a single vaccine shot, some vaccinated countries still seeing cases surge, and global supply chains likely to remain disrupted for a long time.

Michael Every of Rabobank thinks we could even be looking at price controls such as occurred during the 1970s when government put restrictions on the amount that wages and prices could increase, or Second World War-era rationing.

It all points to a pretty grim picture.

Conclusion

Nobody wants to see hyper-inflation in North America, where stable prices are the norm, or anywhere else for that matter, but the risk is certainly there.

US food price increases are already at their highest in nine years, and the consumer price index rose the most in April of any 12-month period since 2008.

The situation is particularly bad in the US Southwest which is experiencing the continuation of a 20-year drought that is the worst in 1,200 years.

Among the crops already seeing drought conditions are corn, soybeans, wheat, sorghum and cotton. Hay crops and cattle production are also expected to be hit hard.

A lack of snow-melt runoff and precipitation, in an El Nina year made worse by climate change, has left reservoirs at a fraction of their normal levels, endangering millions of people that depend on them including farmers and ranchers that need to irrigate crops/ water herds.

California has already declared a drought emergency in nearly three-quarters of the state, and an official water shortage declaration for the Colorado River basin is expected by June.

Continuing the US (and Canadian) economic recovery is obviously important but it should not come on the backs of the poor who bear the most weight of inflation, particularly increases in food prices.

Government officials need to be aware of how their monetary and fiscal policies are impacting the most vulnerable in society.",2021-05-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['million', 'water', 'food', 'prices', 'supply', 'price', 'worlds', 'drought', 'threaten', 'vulnerable', 'states', 'rising', 'inflation', 'higher']",Somalia,news article,English

ENVIRONMENT

Musa Ecweru, the Minister of state for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees, has released a statement on the floods, landslides and windstorms disaster situation in the county. Here goes:

____________________________

The second rain season has reached its peak in most parts of the country and heavy rainfall will continue upto end of December 2019, according to the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA). It has caused many destructive flooding in several lowlying parts of the country and landslides in the Mountanious parts of the Country. Destructive wind and hailstorms have ravaged plantations and crops across the whole country.

1.1 On Monday 2nd December rains began falling in the Mt Elgon subregion and several parts of the country at about 11.00 pm and continued upto 3.00 pm (15 hrs of rainfall) on Tuesday 3rd December. This heavy unusual rainfall followed a near daily rainfall for the past three Months of November, September and August.

1.2 It caused multiple landslides in the villages of Namasa, Naposhi and shukururu in Bushika subcounty of Bududa district killing 4 people, injuring 5 and displacing over 6,000 people (750 hhs). Review of villages households registers is ongoing to establish number and names of missing persons. Assessment of the number of hectares of houses, plantations, crop and livestock destroyed is also on-going.

1.3 In Sironko District, 2 adults and 2 children were killed in Nabodi village, Bumumulo Parish of Zesui subcounty. A rapid assessment established over 4,000 people (500 hhs) were affected and they lost hundreds of acres of plantations, crop and livestock. A detailed assessment is taking place to determine exact numbers of houses and livelihood assets were lost.

1.4 Multiple landslides / floods also occurred in the following subcounties of Sironko District; Bukise , Bumasifwa, Masaba, Bumalimba and Budadiri Town Council without deaths and injuries as most people in the affected areas had shifted earlier to safer locations.

1.5 River Manafwa a major river draining Mt Elgon burst its banks and washed away 25 houses downstream whose occupants had early heeded OPM alert messages and shifted to safer areas.

1.6 Sironko Town the Headquarters of Sironko District was flooded with water flowing along all streets and into houses, however, no person within the Town council was injured.

1.7 A number of villages in the districts of Bukedea, Serere, Ngora, Katakwi, Amuria, Kapelebyong, Tororo and Otuke are submerged, however, no injuries reported as residents had early shifted to safer locations.

1.8 Murchison falls got filled up submerging the tourist viewing rocks, protection fencing and access staircase.

1.9 River Nile cut off road transport to West Nile subregion when its submerged the road near Pakwach bridge.

1.10 The risk of more flooding and landslides is real.

1.11 Warning messages urging the population to keep away from river banks, and steep slopes are continuously being sent out.

1.12 People should not walk, or allow boda-boda riders and cars carry them across flooded section of roads and bridges.

1.13 Government has released shs 20.0 billion for emergency procurement of inflatable boats, tarpaulins, blankets, relief food, drugs for water borne diseases and culverts for fixing washed away bridges under the life-saving and rescue phase (Nov 2019- Jan 2020) of the flooding/landslides situation.

1.14 Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) will be conducted in January 2020 to determine total level of damage and losses and actions for the Recovery and Reconstruction.

1.15 A rapid assessment conducted in the most affected subregion - Mt Elgon ( Bududa, Sironko, manafwa, Namisidwa and Mbale puts the number of displaced persons at 25,000; affected households at 85,000 and damaged acreage of crop and plantations at 21,500 hectares.

1.16 The number displaced in the two subregions of Teso and Bukedi subregions stands at 55,000 people with over 120,000 hectares of crop destroyed. The population affected (not displaced) in these two subregions is bigger but the impact is comparatively lower compared to Bugisu.

1.17 Districts along the banks of river Nile in West Nile subregion have equally suffered losses of crop and homes to flooding. Assessments are on-going 1.18 Also affected are the hilly parts of the subregions of Kigezi and Rwenzori, and the low-lying district of Ntoroko.

1.19 The subregions of Buganda, Ankole, Bunyoro, Acholi, and Karamoja suffered more infrastructure losses (roads and bridges) and less livelihood ( plantations, crop and livestock) losses.

MITIGATION, PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMUNITY

1.20 The IGAD Climate Outlook is held Quarterly. It brings together National, Regional and International Climate Scientists and in that forum they forecast rainfall for the next three months.

1.21 The 53rd Forum for the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook was held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from 26 th to 28th August 2019 for the period September to December, 2019.

1.22 Above normal rainfall was predicted.

1.23 Relevant sectors of government that would be affected positively and negatively were informed and they did preparations early.

1.24 On receipt of the Sept-Dec Forecast, The OPM Disaster Dept reviewed the satellite images of the landslides prone and risky areas of the subregions of the hilly Elgon and flat areas of the subregions of Teso and Bukedi.

1.25 Villages at high risk were physically visited and awareness and sensitization meetings held with persons at risk.

1.26 Safe homes in the neighbourhoods were identified and requested to accept to host households at risk for the period September – December 1.27 OPM provided hosting and hosted families with 200kgs of rice (China donation), 100 kgs of beans, 5 pcs of tarpaulins and 5 pieces of Mosquito nets.

1.28 Early warning messages were also run on TV stations, FM radio Stations, News Papers and SMS on phones.

1.29 As the rains began pouring, OPM acquired and stocked for rapid response: 100 roles of tarpaulins, 5,000 pieces of blankets, 5,000 pieces of sleeping-mats, 1,500 pieces of jerricans, 500 cartons of soap, 2,000 pieces of buckets and 2,000 pieces of spades.

1.30 National Emergency Coordination Center (NECOC) was fully activated to operate 24 hours to receive information from all parts of the country with a Toll Free line 0800177777.

1.31 Our partners from the Police, UPDF, UNRA, MoH, MWE and MAAIF were also stocked relevant disaster response requirements including rehearsals, culverts, waterborne treatment drugs, livestock treatment drugs etc.

1.32 The killer flooding and landslides is not a new disaster in this country, you will recall on 1st March 2010 a landslide disaster in Bulambuli District claimed the lives of over 150 people and displaced over 5,000.

1.33 Cabinet then directed two solutions (1) resettlement of the survivors in part of the Refugee settlement land in Kiryandongo and (2) long term solution for those at risk of future landslides.

1.34 The 5,000 survivors were all transferred and resettled in Kiryandongo. The number of Bagisu from Bududa resettled in Kiryandongo, however, has now increased to 10,300 people as many others voluntarily followed on their own and settled alongside those brought to Kiryandongo by Government. This is contrary to reports that most Bududa landslides survivors resettled in Kiryandongo have abandoned the place and gone back to their former homes in the risky steep slopes of Bududa because of alleged poor services.

1.35 In 2011, a standing Cabinet Subcommittee headed by Rt. Hon. 1st Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of Government Business in Parliament Gen. Moses Ali was appointed by Cabinet to established the population at high risk of landslides in the districts of Bududa, Sironko, Manafwa and Bulambuli.

1.36 The committee together with technical officers after three weeks of field work established that close to 100,000 people were at high risk of landslides and recommended their relocation to safer places, giving Bugisu sub region priority.

1.37 A ten year resettlement project for the 100,000 people (12,500hh) at risk of landslides was drawn and approved by Cabinet. It was entitled, ‘RESETTLEMENT OF LANDLESS PERSONS AND PERSONS AT RISK OF LANDSLIDES.’ The project was supposed to be implemented in a phased manner with on average 10,000 people each year.

1.38 The resettlement project, however, did not start in the year 2011 as had been planned because a few negative minded politicians from Bugisu subregion misled the population to resist the resettlement plan. 1.39 As a result, there was an eight-year delay in operationalization of the resettlement plan.

1.40 Implementation of the resettlement plan only resumed in November 2018, following a directive from H.E.The President and after another landslide had killed 53 people in Bukalasi subcounty of Bududa District.

1.41 The Engineering Brigade of UPDF, together with the Constructions Unit of the Uganda Police Force and the Mechanical Unit of Uganda Prison Services have managed to construct 241 houses of which the first 101 have been occupied and the 140 are at completion stages.

1.42 If the eight years of negative political mis-guidance had not occurred, by now the challenges of landslide would be minimal in Bugisu subregion.

1.43 This Bulambuli Resettlement Project is being implemented in three phases and will take a total of 7,200 people in 900 houses at its completion in June next year.

1.44 After the Bulambuli Project which is being implemented on Government land; the subsequent resettlement strategies will include identification and procurement of land for resettlement in safely locations within the districts of Bududa, Manafwa, Namisidwa, Sironko and Bulambuli. And in situations of places of high population densities and no land for purchase at subcounty level, the people at risk in such areas will be consulted and upon agreement be relocated to other parts of the Country.

1.45 The beneficiary families of the Bulambuli project, have each receive a permanent two-bedroomed house made of concrete blocks and iron-sheet roofs of gauge 28, sitting on one acre of land, piped water, solar and hydro power lighting.

1.46 The purpose of this media statement is to enable me appeal to the media, Hon Members of Parliament especially those from the most affected subregions of Bugisu Teso, Bukedi, Kigezi, Rwenzori, Lango and West Nile; Cultural Leaders, Opinion Leaders and all persons in leadership positions to convince our people to:

a. Desist from crossing walking across flooded sections of any road or bridge

b. Not to allow boda-boda riders and vehicle drivers carry them across sections of flooded roads and bridges

c. Shift from their homes located in risky steep slopes especially in Bugisu subregion to homes of relatives, friends, Churches, Mosques and School buildings, as a temporary emergency safety measure.

d. Government will continuously provide them with relief food while at those places of safety as it has done in the past. The above-normal rains are expected to subside within the next three weeks, i.e by end of December 2019, and people can then after begin going back to their homes.

1.47 On behalf of the Government, I convey condolences to families who have lost their dear members.",2019-12-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['landslides', 'resettlement', 'risk', 'rainfall', 'sironko', 'parts', 'subregions', 'govt', 'disaster', 'situation', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'speaks', 'bududa']",Uganda,news article,English

Overview

Multiple and consecutive shocks have caused the current acute food insecurity situation in Mozambique. While drought and pests affected much of the country, the central area was severely hit by cyclones Desmond and Idai, and the northern area by Cyclone Kenneth as well as conflict and insecurity.

As a result, major agricultural losses, destruction of infrastructure, assets and livelihoods, internal displacement and other damages were observed. It is estimated that 1,648,646 people currently (April – September 2019) face difficulties in accessing food to meet acceptable food needs.

In the projection period from October 2019 to February 2020, it is expected that this number of people could increase to 1,994,538 if there are no humanitarian interventions and taking into account that this is the lean season.",2019-07-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', '25', 'acute', 'insecurity', 'analysis', 'face', '2019', 'food', 'area', '2020', 'situation', 'shocks', 'taking', 'severely', 'issued']",Mozambique,news article,English

This unique phenomenon takes place just twice a year—once on October 22 to mark the king’s birthday and the beginning of the growing season, and again on February 22 to celebrate his coronation and the start of harvest season.

On these two days, the temple opens its doors for tourists at 3 am in order to facilitate viewings of this special occurrence, which lasts for just 20 minutes.

Thousands of tourists line up in what is known as the country’s “longest tourist queue” in order to witness the sunlight penetrate sixty meters into the temple, lighting up the king’s face.

The sun also shines on statues of the sun gods Re-Horakhte and Amon-Re, seated next to Ramses II. The statues sit in the company of the Theban god of darkness, Ptah, who remains in the shadows all year.

Ramses II was the third pharaoh of Egypt’s 19th Dynasty. He is regarded as the most powerful and celebrated pharaoh of Egypt, and was the husband of the famous Queen Nefertari.

The king was responsible for numerous military campaigns that expanded the empire, as well as the construction of temples and statues throughout the region.",2020-10-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['face', 'ramses', 'statues', 'pharaoh', 'growing', 'temple', 'simbel', 'photos', 'illumination', 'ii', 'abu', 'kings', 'king', 'order', 'tourists', 'lights', 'biannual']",Egypt,news article,English

Vietnams flood death toll rose to at least 23 and authorities said the incoming storm Nangka would dump more heavy rain on the country in the coming days.

The floods also left at least 14 people missing in Vietnams central provinces, the government said in a statement on Monday.

Most of the victims were washed away by floodwaters, the national disaster management authority said, adding local authorities evacuated nearly 46,000 people from affected areas.

The floods have inundated more than 109,000 homes and 1,443 acres (584 hectares) of crops and damaged roads and bridges, the agency added.

According to weather forecasters, water levels will keep rising, swelling rivers and submerging more communities in the region, the state-owned Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.

The situation worsened over the weekend when Tropical Storm Linfa, which weakened to a depression when it hit the country, brought more rain to the region.

670,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Growth In Middle Class Drives Private Education Boom On Continent - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/growth-in-middle-class-drives-private-education-boom-on-continent/,"April 2017

Private universities and schools are mushrooming across Africa, as parents increasingly seek a quality education for their children outside of the state offering – a move which is largely attributable to the rapid growth of the middle class on the continent.

“The private education sector is experiencing unprecedented growth, with private providers in the rest of Africa lining up to partner with credible and experienced counterparts in South Africa, to be able to sustainably grow in response to the huge demand for quality basic and higher education institutions,” says Jaco Lotz, who heads International Business Development at ADvTECH, Africa’s largest private education provider.

Research about the growth of the middle class in Africa, conducted by the African Development Bank, shows that by 2010, the middle class had surged by 60% from a decade before, and the number keeps growing. The report highlighted the fact that increased prosperity led to a rise in investment in education, and that private education was increasingly seen as an attractive option for parents.

“We are really starting to see the effect of this continued rise in the ranks of those joining the middle class,” says Lotz.

In addition to the growth of the middle class, the sharp rise in demand for private education is also fuelled by the fact that the average age of Africa’s population is getting lower – in other words there is also growth in the younger population – as well as the fact that governments and the public sector simply can’t keep up with the demand for space in schools and public universities.

“Throughout Africa, governments are under pressure in terms of resourcing, and are battling to increase capacity in the public sector,” notes Lotz.

“As a result, private schools and universities are popping up all over Africa as business tries to capitalise on the demand, however many of these institutions don’t have full accreditation or, at present, a benchmark quality assurance standard.

“However parents are becoming more informed, demanding that institutions prove their track records and credibility, and that they are able to provide a quality education.”

Owing to ADvTECH’s track record in schools and higher education, and because they are a listed entity, the company is being approached by numerous education institutions throughout the continent who seek to partner with them, Lotz notes.

“Additionally, we are able to prove sustained good corporate governance, and as a result we are constantly being approached by institutions responding to the demand from parents who seek not only a private education for their children, but a quality, accredited private offering,” he says.

Last year, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, acquired a 4% equity stake in ADvTECH, in a partnership aimed at supporting the company’s plans to expand into the rest of Africa.

IFC Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Oumar Seydi, noted at the time that the investment would further enable ADvTECH to fill gaps in the education market on the continent, which will enable Africa’s workforce to meet the challenges of changing job markets in Africa and globally.

“This partnership with the IFC has enabled us to work on numerous projects, from acquisitions and partnerships, to developing new schools and universities. The pipeline is growing, and we are anticipating a domino effect in the future,” Lotz says.

“We already have a significant footprint across Africa, with 6% of revenue coming from our African operations outside the borders of South Africa, which include Gaborone International School in Botswana, the University of Africa in Zambia in which we recently secured the majority stake, and CA Global and Africa HR Solutions, which fall under the Resourcing division.”

Lotz says ADvTECH has expanded its delivery model through the implementation of technology-enabled models in both blended and distance learning, and that the IFC partnership is providing valuable on-the-ground insight to identify additional suitable investment opportunities and partners in other African markets.

“As a result, we expect to provide a quality education to thousands of new students in the foreseeable future, which is a very exciting prospect.”",2017-04-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['education', 'africa', 'private', 'middle', 'growth', 'class', 'quality', 'institutions', 'continent', 'boom', 'schools', 'drives', 'demand']",Ghana,news article,English
1818,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Claims Against Cuomo: A Look At The Womens Allegations - News18,https://www.news18.com/news/world/claims-against-cuomo-a-look-at-the-womens-allegations-3586646.html,"NEW YORK: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is facing allegations that he sexually harassed or behaved inappropriately toward women who worked with him or met him elsewhere now including one he encountered while on official business. The woman, Sherry Vill, said at a press conference Monday that Cuomo forcibly kissed her cheeks and made her uncomfortable while examining flood damage at her home.

Other accusations range from groping under a woman’s shirt and planting unwanted kisses to asking unwelcome personal questions about sex and dating.

The Democratic governor has said that he “never touched anyone inappropriately and never made any inappropriate advances, and that no one ever told him at the time that he was making them uncomfortable. He has called some allegations false.

Cuomo has also suggested that he was simply being an old-school politician in greeting people with hugs and kisses but that sensitivities have changed.

Here’s a look at some of the workplace allegations, in the order they became public:

LINDSEY BOYLAN, 36, a former state economic development adviser, says the governor kissed her on the lips as she was leaving a one-on-one meeting in his office and suggested playing strip poker on a state plane. Cuomo says both stories are false. Among her other allegations: Cuomo summoned her alone to his office after a holiday party and made what she took to be a reference to former President Bill Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The governor also sent Valentine’s Day roses to Boylan and other female staffers, she said.

CHARLOTTE BENNETT, 25, a former Cuomo aide, said the governor asked her about her love life including whether she ever had sex with older men and talked about his own, saying that age differences didn’t matter in relationships and he was open to dating women over 22. During a meeting alone in his office, the governor said he was lonely and talked about wanting to hug someone, Bennett said. She said she swiftly complained to Cuomos chief of staff and was transferred to another job. She said she spoke to a lawyer for the governor, but didnt insist on further action because she liked her new post and wanted to move on.

ANNA RUCH, a guest at a wedding where Cuomo officiated, told The New York Times that right after meeting her, he put his hand on her lower back, called her aggressive for removing it, placed his hands on her cheeks and asked to kiss her. She said she turned away.

ANA LISS, 35, a former aide, said Cuomo asked her whether she had a boyfriend, once kissed her hand at her desk and called her by patronizing names, including blondie,"" sweetheart and honey."" At a reception, the governor hugged her then put his arm around her lower back and waist as they posed for photo, Liss said. She said she eventually asked for a job transfer. In an interview, Liss said she was not claiming sexual harassment per se, but felt the administration wasnt a safe space for young women to work.

KAREN HINTON, who worked for Cuomo when he was Clinton’s federal housing secretary in the 1990s, said Cuomo gave her an overly long and intimate hug after calling her to his hotel room for a conversation that turned to personal topics on a trip where she was serving as a consultant to the housing agency. Cuomo said Hinton’s account was not true.

A MEMBER OF CUOMO’S STAFF alleged that he closed a door, reached under her blouse and fondled her after summoning her to the governors mansion in Albany for help with his cellphone, according to the Times Union of Albany. The newspaper didnt name the woman, who said that she told Cuomo to stop groping her and that he had touched and flirted with her previously.

The Times Union’s reporting is based on an unidentified source with direct knowledge of the womans accusation.

The woman recently told a supervisor, and at least one of her bosses reported the allegation to a lawyer for the governor this month, according to the newspaper.

Cuomo called the report gut-wrenching in a statement and said: I have never done anything like this.

ALYSSA McGRATH, 33, a current administrative assistant in Cuomo’s office, told The New York Times that he looked down her shirt, quizzed her about her marital status, and told her she was beautiful, using an Italian phrase she had to ask her parents to interpret.

McGrath didnt say the governor made sexual contact with her but thought his behavior was sexual harassment. She recalled Cuomo kissing her on the forehead and gripping her firmly around the sides while posing for a photo at a 2019 office Christmas party.

Cuomo lawyer Rita Glavin responded by reiterating his denials of inappropriate advances and touching. She told the Times he has greeted both men and women with hugs and kisses on the cheek, has put his arm around people for photos and uses such Italian phrases as “ciao bella (“hi, beautiful"" or ‘bye, beautiful), though she said he didnt say that to McGrath.

None of this is remarkable, although it may be old-fashioned,"" Glavin added.

SHERRY VILL, 55, said she felt manhandled when Cuomo grabbed her face and kissed her cheeks while visiting her Rochester-area home in spring 2017. He was there to inspect the aftermath of flooding near Lake Ontario.

The governor planted kisses on both her cheeks in front of her family members, told her she was beautiful, and then held her hand, grabbed her face and kissed her on the cheek again outside her home, she said.

Vill said she found Cuomo’s behavior was flirtatious and inappropriate, his body language made her uncomfortable and the episode embarrassed her in front of her family and neighbors.

There was no immediate comment from the Cuomo administration on her allegations.

320,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Surfing helps veterans cope with PTSD - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/surfing-helps-veterans-cope-with-ptsd-60472,"Surfing often conjures up images of freewheeling hippies, but now military veterans are turning to the waves to help them deal with the traumatic legacy of war. They say it gives them a wonderful “freeing” feeling, and helps them manage the psychological turmoil of their everyday lives. Our research is among the first to document the positive influence surfing can have for veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

PTSD is a debilitating psychological condition that some veterans experience in the aftermath of combat. The symptoms can include flashbacks, vivid nightmares, traumatic memories, and a profound and enduring sense of sadness. There are other symptoms of PTSD too, including hyper-vigilance (such as scanning rooftops for concealed snipers) and hyper-arousal (the classic example of jumping when a car back-fires).

You could be forgiven for believing that all soldiers inevitably come home from war damaged by their experiences, and that a “tidal wave” of PTSD cases are flooding out of the military. But research from Kings College London suggests that the rate of combat veterans being diagnosed with PTSD is around 7%.

Moving meditation

So how could surfing help? In our research we asked British war veterans about their experiences. Their stories – collected over a series of in-depth interviews and observations – reveal the strong emotional benefits that surfing brings. According to the veterans, surfing is like having PTSD “pummelled out” of their system by the force of the waves.

The mental state veterans report when surfing has many parallels with what psychologists call “flow”, where a person becomes fully and completely involved in an activity to the exclusion of everything else. Their minds are emptied of the traumatic memories that continually cycle through them. They become immersed in the activity, much like a moving form of mindfulness or meditation.

When surfing, veterans are rooted in the present moment and experience it with a renewed sense of intensity and pleasure. There’s also a connection with nature that helps to bolster veterans’ sense of mental well-being. When surfing, veterans are immersed in the natural environment, which has mental health benefits according to a growing body of research. As studies conducted with veterans in California suggest, it also helps build resilience, and alleviates the troubling symptoms associated with PTSD and depression.

But surfing is not the only complementary therapy being proposed for veterans suffering from PTSD. A wide range of activities are now being tested. These are often provided by charities and include horse therapy, gardening therapy, fly-fishing, sailing, drama therapy and yoga.

The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends psychological therapies, including trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy and eye movement desensitisation and reprogramming. Antidepressants are also recommended for those who don’t want, or don’t respond to talking therapies. Although these treatments help some veterans, they don’t work for everyone. That’s why it’s important that different forms of treatment and support for veterans experiencing PTSD can be shown to be effective.

Indeed, at a time when military charities are coming under increasing pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed solutions to veterans’ mental health, identifying the impact that new approaches have, and the reasons behind such impact, is crucial.

One priority for research in this area now is to understand how innovative approaches like surfing can work alongside clinical approaches to benefit the mental health of veterans struggling to adapt in the aftermath of trauma.",2016-06-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['research', 'ptsd', 'helps', 'traumatic', 'veterans', 'cope', 'therapy', 'health', 'symptoms', 'surfing', 'mental', 'war']",India,news article,English

Ayaz Younus's father Muhammad Younus and mother Maqsooda Bibi flew from Pakistan to attend the funeral for their son at Baitul Huda Mosque in Marsden Park on Wednesday.

The pair, who arrived in Australian over the weekend, were granted permission to leave quarantine to attend a prayer service and burial.

Mr Younus' three siblings were denied permission to fly from Pakistan.

The 25-year-old software engineer was on the way to his first day at a new job in Glenorie on March 24 and was on the phone to emergency services just before he died.

The emotional couple were unable to touch their son's body or coffin, and were kept apart from Younus' friends due to COVID restrictions.

In a pre-recorded message broadcast in the mosque, Younus' parents spoke of their son's love for Australia, and his promise to work two jobs in order to bring his family to the country to live.

""When I stepped out of Sydney airport, my eyes were looking for him,"" Mr Younus said.

""I wished he would have been there to welcome his parents.

""I wished we could have hugged him once more.

""But alas, it didn't happen.

""Rather we are here to say goodbye to him.

""We all belong to God Almighty and we all shall return to him.""

Later, the pair were confined to a car for their son's burial, forced to watch and film from a distance through a partially wound-down window.

Mr Younus was only briefly allowed outside the car to shovel some sand on his son's coffin.

The funeral for Mr Younus was delayed by a coronial inquiry and because of the complications involved getting permission for his family to attend.

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia helped pay for the family's travel, accommodation and funeral costs.

Hamad Chaudhry remembered Mr Younus as a keen sportsman who was very involved with the community.

""Ayaz was a very happy and friendly person who loved his sport and was extremely community-minded. He is deeply missed,"" Mr Chaudhry told AAP.",2021-05-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['younus', 'car', 'funeral', 'wished', 'son', 'farewelled', 'permission', 'parents', 'sons', 'flood', 'ayaz', 'mr', 'watch', 'nsw', 'victim']",Pakistan,news article,English

On April 29, Bishop Louis Nguyen Anh Tuan was installed as apostolic administrator of Ha Tinh Diocese at Van Hanh Cathedral in Ha Tinh City in central Vietnam.

Archbishop Joseph Nguyen Chi Linh of Hue, president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Vietnam, presided at the special ceremony concelebrated by 15 archbishops and bishops and joined by 300 priests. Some 8,000 people attended the Mass, with many watching the ceremony from outside the cathedral.

The event also marked the retirement of Emeritus Bishop Paul Nguyen Thai Hop, who reached the age of 76 in February.

Bishop Tuan, who was born in Da Nang and grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, said his late father came from An Hoa Parish in Ha Tinh province.

His father left home in 1943 to study and got married to his mother in 1949 in Da Nang. His mother, who married when she was 16, is 93 years old and attended his installation. She has nine children including him.

I plan to connect family ministry to other pastoral activities to unite local people

Bishop Tuan said strengthening family ties and developing basic ecclesial communities will be his priority as families are the foundation and future of humankind and the Christian church. The solid foundations of family life are undermined by divorce, separation and family members living far away due to financial problems.

""I plan to connect family ministry to other pastoral activities to unite local people, develop the local Church and foster evangelization work,"" the 58-year-old bishop said.

The prelate said he will continue the pastoral services his predecessor provided and is ready to listen to sound advice from him, local priests and other people to build the diocese and promote evangelization.

Bishop Hop built firm foundations for the diocese, which was established separately from Vinh Diocese in 2019.

Bishop Hop said during the past two years, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and severe floods, the local Church had repaired a building as the temporary bishops house, built the St. Pope John Paul seminary and two centers to hold religious and cultural activities and to provide safe places for local people in annual floods. Other such facilities and three new resettlement areas for flood victims in Quang Binh province will be built soon.

The Dominican prelate, who also led the neighboring diocese of Vinh, said many churches and church facilities in Ha Tinh and Quang Binh provinces had also been erected in the past decade. Local people had suffered war damages, poverty, natural disasters and religious persecution from the government. A lot of churches, parish houses and schools were ruined and devastated.

The dioceses first bishop said the local Churchs development marks the restoration of local Catholics faith life.

He will be committed to cultural, educational, health care and charitable activities

Bishop Hop, who dedicates himself to religious freedom, human rights, victims of natural disasters and human activities, and environmental protection, said the diocese should focus on bringing Good News to other people, offering faith education to the faithful, cementing family relationships and giving opportunities to youths to study further, work for the common good and crave for prosperity and human dignity.

The former head of the Episcopal Commission for Justice and Peace of the Vietnamese bishops said it is painful seeing many youths who have not yet finished high school seek jobs abroad. What will such people do for the country and Church? he asked.

Bishop Hop said he had completed his episcopal mission but is still involved in evangelization. He will be committed to cultural, educational, health care and charitable activities and hopes to work with others to serve the needy and disabled people and foster human rights and the truth, good and beauty.

1586,FL-2020-000164-IND,Monsoonal moisture makes its 2020 debut - ABC 4,https://www.abc4.com/weather/monsoonal-moisture-makes-its-2020-debut/,"SALT LAKE CITY, Utah (ABC4 News) – Utah is closing in on the Independence Day holiday and weekend, and ironically, on par with 2020, as many of us head to the outdoors, a subtle monsoon push will move into the state.

This monsoonal moisture arrives most clearly on Friday and Saturday and will impact eastern, central and southern Utah. Weather models bring in the threat of thunderstorms south of Provo and Evanston, Wyoming for the weekend.

This initial push will increase mid level moisture, but what does that even mean? Well, the translation means we could see dry thunderstorms pop up with a lack of rain, but plenty of lightning and gusty winds. An elevated risk for fire danger will be around for the Fourth of July, and it’s noteworthy for any of us packing up the family for a camping trip to the Uintas or any mountainous area in central, eastern and southern Utah.

Keeping those eyes to the skies is critical over the holiday weekend, but it’s a great habit to get into because the start of the monsoon season in Utah indicates the start of several Utah weather phenomena. To understand what that means, we back it up a little and breakdown exactly how the monsoon season happens in the Beehive State.

The word “monsoon” actually means the seasonal reversal of winds. The seasonal change occurs in upper level winds from the polar westerlies to tropical easterlies and includes a switch from dry west winds high up in the atmosphere to moist winds from the east or southeast. Rain actually starts to the south of us over southern Mexico, when heavy rainfall starts in May and June. Rain quickly spreads north along the western slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, and starts to move north. Typically, the monsoon season begins in the Southwestern United States in early July and can hold on until mid to late September.

Be ready for t-storms, dry lightning at time & flash flooding thru Sept. @abc4utah pic.twitter.com/reQAub0uYC — Alana Brophy (@AlanaBrophyNews) July 2, 2020

For Utah, we have a couple of key players when it comes to the monsoon, that includes the “Four Corners High” and our sources of tropical moisture. We have two different sources of tropical moisture with the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of California. The Four Corners High sets up near southeastern Utah and has a clockwise flow, which helps draw moist, humid air into Utah. We get thunderstorm development when hot, unstable air rises and with plenty of mid and low level moisture present during monsoon season, we can tap into heavy rain, numerous thunderstorms and frequently trigger severe storms and flash flooding. Utah has plenty of steep terrain and slick rock, and flash flooding can tear through slot canyons and popular landscapes throughout the state. For a visual of how this happens, you can watch the video.

It’s the time of year when Utahns flock to the outdoors, so you always want to know when we get a surge of monsoonal moisture. This weekend from Thursday through Saturday, we get some mid-level moisture and not so much low level moisture, so we can often see dry thunderstorms as a result.

Maharashtra received 21 per cent above rainfall in June, while Marathwada outperformed the other meteorological sub-divisions in the state with 57 per cent surplus rainfall.

Even though cyclone Nisarga, which hit Raighad district on June 3, caused significant damage to property and livelihood of people living along coastal districts, the associated rainfall eventually contributed to the surplus in the state in June.

The monsoon then entered a weak phase before activity picked up last week.

The rainfall figures for June are Madhya Maharashtra (48 per cent), Konkan and Goa (3 per cent) and Vidarbha (-1 per cent).

The India Meteorological Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall over Pune, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Satara districts between July 2 and July 4.

‘Winds accompanying lightning can aggravate hazards’

Strong winds at the time of thunderstorm and lightning events can aggravate destruction and damage even leading to greater loss of life, said Soma Sen Roy, scientist, Nowcast Department, National Weather Forecasting Centre at IMD, Delhi.

She was speaking on ‘Thunderstorm, Duststorms and Lightning’ as part of a webinar series organised by the Ministry of Earth Sciences on Tuesday. Last week, lightning strikes killed more than 100 people in Bihar. According to Roy, lightning and thunderstorm events are prone to occur in the June to September period over Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and northeastern regions.

Higher casualties are linked with more farmers in the fields who are involved in sowing activities. “Predicting thunderstorms poses great challenges as there are still gaps in sharing forecast information to the last person.

Floodwaters are also threatening to damage Sudan's ancient Meroe Pyramids, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The River Nile has crested to its highest level in one hundred years. At least 103 people have been killed by drowning, houses collapsing and road accidents caused by the flooding.

Now, thousands of Sudanese families are sleeping in the outdoors, waiting for shelter, food and medicine.

40-year-old widow Aisha Adam is one of them.

Adam says she is sleeping in the street after the river suddenly destroyed her house in Northern Khartoum; she says she is looking after her sister and five children, and waiting for shelter and aid.

The Sudanese government has made an urgent call for organizations and civil society to provide assistance. U.N. agencies started efforts this week to supply medicine, tents and safe drinking water.

This is Tinago Chikoto, deputy head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Sudan.

He says help is definitely required from the government and their partners in the U.N. and NGOs besides civil society. The urgent needs are for plastic sheets, tents, health supplies and the provision of safe drinking water.

712,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Oil Majors See Huge Opportunity In Eastern Mediterranean - OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Majors-See-Huge-Opportunity-In-Eastern-Mediterranean.html,"Quite suddenly, there is remarkable oil industry news to come out of the East Mediterranean region. If the plan is executed, in the space of seven years the balance of energy security in Western Europe will be radically changed. In geopolitical terms, this will be immense; when the planned Israel-Cyprus-Greece-Italy gas pipeline is built, European countries will be able to cut their ever-increasing dependence on Russian gas supplies.

The story of major gas discoveries in the East Mediterranean started in the shallow-water offshore Egypt, with Miocene Nile Delta discoveries progressively stepping out into deeper and deeper water. The first discovery was made by Phillips Petroleum in 1969, when it drilled the play-opening Abu Qir 1 NFW. It discovered gas in the Messinian Abu Madi sandstones. Subsequent exploration was led by the likes of AMOCO, BG, BP, Eni and Shell. There are now over 100 mainly gas and wet gas fields in the offshore Egyptian Nile Delta, with all production being piped onshore. The story continues to the present day, with recent large discoveries in the deeper Oligocene play, such as Salamat (2013) and Atoll (2015), alongside large Messinian discoveries including Nooros (2015) and Baltim South West (2016).

The latest super-giant and play-opening discovery is, of course, Zohr in 2015 lying over 160km offshore, and in WD of 1,450m. Over 30 Tcf of dry gas was discovered in a massive Miocene-Cretaceous reef structure, on the edge of the Erastothenes Platform. Italian giant Eni is pressing forward quickly to bring this onstream, and pipe-laying from the field to shore (150 km) by the Saipem deep water lay-barge “Castoro Sei” is ongoing and should be completed later in 2017. Imponderable for the moment is the possibility of oil; current well Zohr Deep 1 is targeting a deeper Cretaceous-Jurassic carbonate reef play below the gas field. The initial Zohr prospect was postulated to be oil prone. However, Egypt has a large negative energy balance, and serving the large domestic market with more gas is the number one priority.

Levant Basin Steps Up

But the gas that is getting the European politicians so excited is from the Levant Basin in Israel and Cyprus. In the Israeli offshore sector, a series of discoveries has been made in waters of up to 1,500m. Noble Energy, starting its exploration in 2008, has made major gas discoveries; Tamar (2009), Dalit (2009), Dolphin (2011), Noa 2 (2011), Leviathan (2011), Tanin (2012), Pinnacles (2012) and Karish (2013). Most of the biogenic gas was found in a thick succession of deep marine turbidite sands of Oligo-Miocene age, with smaller but significant amounts found in younger, Pliocene turbidite sands. Out of the Noble discoveries, so far only Tamar and the smaller Noa are onstream, with Leviathan to follow in 2019. The Israeli government, fearful of dominance of the sector by just one player, has ordered the divestment of Karish and Tanin to Energean, a Greek company, which is in the process of farming down.

In the Cyprus offshore sector to the north-west, Noble also discovered Aphrodite (2011), where the gas resource figures are most recently estimated at 4.54 Tcf. So, taken together, we now see quantities of gas to make potential export look much more attractive to offset the considerable deep water investments which will be required. Noble Energy currently cites in excess of 35 Tcf of gross resources in these two offshore sectors.

The big export markets for gas are not in the Middle East; they are in Western Europe. The principal challenge is to lay a 1300km deep sea pipeline through the Mediterranean to Greece (west coast) and across the Adriatic to landfall in Italy. The European high-pressure gas transmission network (ENTSOG) can be picked up there. Alternatives have been suggested – such as landfall in Southern Turkey – but the former is preferred for many non-technical reasons.

Project Looks Feasible

So the key revelation in this last week is that the technical feasibility of a pipeline has been passed by engineering consultants IGI Poseidon. Ministers from the EC, Israel, Greece, Italy and Cyprus signed an agreement in Tel Aviv, Israel and a time-frame of seven years is put on the project. The headline cost for a 1,300 km, 500 Bcf/annum pipeline is €5.34 billion (US$6 billion).

Unlike African gas mega-projects which face a Sisyphean challenge of putting the value chain together (witness Kudu in Namibia, or the Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline), the East Med Pipeline seems to be pretty solid. Financiers in New York and London are already expressing interest. Related: Drillers Remain Cautious Despite Shale Success

There is also a substantial exploration upside in the East Mediterranean region, and there is a major focus of interest here. In the Cyprus sector, the Third Licensing Round has just concluded with an ExxonMobil-Qatar Petroleum JV having signed a contract for Block 10. An Eni and Total JV has successfully bid for Block 6, while Eni secured Block 8 on its own. Given that the IOCs have already acquired 3D seismic data, the time lapse to first wells should be no more than one year (a commitment given at the signing ceremony). Cyprus Minister of Energy Lakkotrypis is far more expansive, saying “a total of twelve exploration wells will be drilled in the newly licensed Blocks 6, 8 and 10.” Some of these are likely to be contingent. The first well in the area, Total’s Onesiphonous 1 targeting a Zohr-like play in Block 11, should spud this summer.

Israel is currently holding its first offshore bid round and officials are hopeful of attracting major interest. Independent research found that at a best guess there were resources totaling around 6.6 Bbo and 75 Tcfg as yet undiscovered in Israeli waters.

In the Lebanese sector to the east of Cyprus, the authorities are gearing up for an offshore licensing round after several years of delay. Companies are encouraged by the success with Zohr, and no fewer than 46 have pre-qualified so far. But joining the Lebanon into an export consortium with Israel is an additional geopolitical dimension, and should not be assumed.

Export of gas into Western Europe can be achieved by 2020. A 48” pipe could deliver 10.5 Tcf (300 Bcm) over a period of 10-15 years. Further exploration success – which the majors are betting heavily on – could extend this towards 2050. In the case of major new exploration success in the Lebanon or Cyprus sector, one can imagine a second pipeline in a follow up phase.

What is the Russian dimension? The current dependency of Europe on Russian gas exports varies from 100 percent (in the Baltic States) to 38 percent in Germany.

One of the key gas developments to watch is the Nordstream pipeline, a dual 48” pipe bringing Russian gas under the Baltic Sea and into Germany and Europe. Russian state company Gazprom delivered 6.35 Tcf (180 Bcm) of gas to Europe in 2016, almost 12.5 percent up on 2015, and no less than 34 percent of the total market, according to Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Medvedev. Although there are of course other significant suppliers – for example Norway (24 percent), Algeria (11 percent), Nigeria and Qatar – the energy dependency on Russia is obvious. Shell predicts that Russia will remain the number one supplier of gas until at least 2035. There are currently substantive discussions on the doubling of capacity of the Nord Stream pipeline (by adding two more 48” lines). Although Germany is pro, Denmark and the Baltic States are firmly opposed to this expansion. Related: Oil Industry Worried About Trump’s “Buy American”

But the biggest drawback for any East Mediterranean gas is that it must compete with relatively cheap Russian gas. It is estimated the probable landed gas price in Europe would be at least US$ 7/MMBtu. This compares with the average price of Gazprom gas in Europe in 2016 of US$ 4.90-5.00/MMBtu – a differential of some US$ 2.00/MMBtu.

The intensity of competition from Russian gas in Europe is set to increase further with the proposed 1.94 Tcfg/annum Nord Stream 2 pipeline which will side-step transit fees across Ukraine and Poland. The 1,224km Nord Stream 2 pipeline which parallels Nord Stream 1 could be completed in 2019 (well before an East Med pipeline could become operational).

Given the very tense political situation between the West and Russia, a reduction in this dependency – by adding the East Med as a major new gas source – would be a highly desirable outcome. The politics should drive the development of this pipeline very quickly.

Hoang Tan Trong, watching over the family farm in Dong Hoi Town with his father and pregnant wife, witnessed floods tear through his home on the night of October 19. Dao, Trongs wife, was sitting on their bed, suspended in the air thanks to four ropes connecting it to the roof. But with the walls damaged, the bed wobbled about two meters above ground, leaning to the side.

Seeing what happened, Trong's father, 64-year-old Hoang Tan Truong, immediately jumped into the water and tried securing the ropes, lest Dao fell into the water below.

""We can't just stay here and suffer like this. We need to find a safer house,"" Dao said. That night, Trong rented a motorboat and brought the whole family to the town center, about 2 km away.

Trong later returned to his old home to herd his 30 remaining chickens out of 200 into tree branches to avoid the flood. His three dogs were given to a relative the next day for safe keeping.

""This is the most severe flood since my birth,"" Trong, 44, remarked.

In Dong Hoi, Pham Thanh Hien, 66, frantically relocated his belongings as half-a-meter-deep floodwater swept through his home. A long time resident, Hien said the fact water could invade the house when hydropower plants have yet to discharge water was ""unprecedented.""

Since October 6, heavy rains have inundated the lowlands of Quang Binh. While not suffering fatal landslides like Thua Thien-Hue or Quang Tri provinces, Quang Binh has been the most severely flooded.

The October 19 flood managed to submerge thousands of houses, making even the most hardy residents shudder in fear.

From 1 a.m. on October 16 to 5 p.m. October 20, Quang Binh recorded rainfall of up to 1,380 mm in certain areas. The most heavily flooded was in Le Thuy District, with over 32,000 houses swamped. Throughout the entire province, around 105,000 homes have been similarly affected.

Tran Cong Thuat, chairman of Quang Binh, said: ""Floods this year have eclipsed the record peak in 1979 by up to 0.98 m."" The historic flood peak was recorded on Kien Giang River at 3.91 m. This year, however, the peak remained at 4.89 m for several consecutive days.

""The flood came at night so it was very powerful. The peak was too high, catching certain areas off guard,"" Thuat added. On the night of October 19 alone, thousands of people throughout Quang Binh have called out for help via their phones or social media.

""We still lack boats, but we are doing our best to help alleviate the suffering,"" he said.

Floods in Quang Binh this year not only set new records, but also receded very slowly. By the morning of October 21, traffic across the province remained crippled due to several flooded locations. Over the last fews days, people have confined themselves to their homes, with many of their pets, livestock and vegetables perishing in the water.

It would take a long time for Quang Binh to recover following this historic flood, according to Thuat. As Storm Saudel approaches Vietnamese shores, the province has prepared plans to support people with necessities and food for the coming days.

""During the first days when flood levels rose quickly, we were met with many challenges. But now that the waters receding, weve been surveying heavily flooded and isolated houses so we could perform rescue operations and provide supplies more easily. We would not allow any family to be abandoned amid the flooding,"" said Thuat.

As of Thursday afternoon, at least 10 people have died in Quang Binh due to floods. Over 7,500 tons of food were soaked in water, while several roads and other infrastructure in the province have either been flooded or damaged. Around 30,000 families have had to be evacuated.",2020-10-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['flooded', 'binh', 'quang', 'water', 'flood', 'peak', 'province', 'worst', 'flooding', '41', 'trongs', 'night', 'suffers', 'family']",Vietnam,news article,English

1530,FL-2020-000038-EGY,South Asia counts losses from devastating monsoon floods - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/south-asia-counts-losses-from-devastating-monsoon-floods/,"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — When the Dharala River burst its banks in early July, Kamal Hossain left his home with five members of his family to take shelter in a school in northern Bangladesh, carrying their most prized belongings: cattle, a few sacks of rice and clothes.

Like him, an estimated 17.5 million people across South Asia are suffering as a result of the devastation of this year’s monsoon floods. Nearly 700 have died.

A third of Bangladesh went underwater, including Hossain’s district of Kurigram, after most of its 16 rivers overflowed following torrential rains and violent onrush of waters from upstream India, which was also tormented by the floods as rivers cut their ways from as far as the Himalayan nation of Nepal. Bangladesh, which is crisscrossed by 230 rivers, is the last channel through which waters are drained into the Bay of Bengal.

Experts have long been warning that a densely populated delta country like Bangladesh is one of the worst victims of climate change, and severe and frequent floods indicate that something has gone wrong.

“The current major floods affecting millions of people in Bangladesh along with super cyclone Amphan that hit the country a few months ago are both linked to human induced climate now becoming a reality,” said Saleemul Huq, a Bangladeshi expert on climate change and director of the International Center for Climate Change and Development.

He said Bangladesh needs to ramp up its diplomacy to convince global powers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as many countries had agreed in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015.

The impact of global warming in South Asia is evident by a steady sea level rise, changes in ambient temperature and rainfall patterns and an increase in cyclonic activity, experts say. More landslides and flooding are projected across the region, which is home to almost one-fourth of the world’s population. Thousands have already been displaced from low-lying islands in the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest straddling Bangladesh and India.

When upstream countries like India or Nepal flush out waters, a district like Kurigram pays the price.

“Some 300,000 people have either lost their homes or crops. Some 400 small river islands were completely under water,” said Mohammed Rezaul Karim, a top government official in Kurigram. “This is a great worry for us.”

Azmat Ulla, the Bangladesh head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said disasters like floods are becoming more frequent and dangerous.

“Waters are going down, but people’s homes and other infrastructures are being devoured by river erosion,” he said. “Rebuilding their lives is not so easy.”

While the national governments are assessing the extent of damage, the European Union said this week it will provide US$1.94 million in aid. The support comes on top of the $2.21 million announced earlier this year to support those affected by a series of disasters, including Cyclone Amphan that ravaged India and Bangladesh in May.

In Nepal, a repeat of the deadly 1993 floods that were caused by the biggest rainfall on record could be catastrophic, said Shreekamal Dwivedi, a senior engineering geologist at the government’s Venerable Landslides Management Project.

Authorities in one of India’s worst-hit states are also counting losses.

About 5.7 million out of Assam’s 30 million people have been hit by the deluge with the total loss of property and crops estimated at $306 million. Assam faces floods every year when waters of the Brahmaputra, one of Asia’s largest rivers that originates in the Tibetan Himalayas, and its tributaries overflow.

After more than 1.5 months in shelter, Hossain is preparing to return home, but faces uncertainty over how to rebuild with almost no money in hand. His only choice is to wait for the next harvest two months away.

“I have lost everything. I don’t know what will happen next,” he said.

1909,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Nigeria: Aftermath of Boko Haram Invasion - Niger State Communities in Panic Mode As Victims, Others Flood IDPs Camps - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/202104300443.html,"Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: ""I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

""I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

""We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.""

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists' presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. ""Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don't need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,"" he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: ""The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.""

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God's intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

371,FL-2021-000025-AUS,A flood-hit farmer's lament for his lost cows: 'It's the helplessness of hearing them bellowing' - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/23/a-flood-hit-farmers-lament-for-his-lost-cows-its-the-helplessness-of-hearing-them-bellowing,"It was the terrified bellows of his dairy cows as the flood waters rapidly rose around them that broke the Taree dairy farmer Rod Lattimore’s heart.

“It’s the helplessness of hearing them bellowing because they are obviously stressed, they are very panicked, and you cannot get to them to do anything for them,” Lattimore told Guardian Australia. “That’s the real heartbreaking thing. The loss is the loss, and as hard as that is to cope with it’s the helplessness and not being able to do anything.”

At half-past four on Friday morning, Rod waded out into boot-deep water to take his cows to higher ground. By the time he got them out of the paddock and on the way to the dairy, the water was up to his waist.

“I was whistling to them,” he said. “And there’s one block downstream from me – it’s only like a kilometre – and as I was whistling to my cows in the dark to get them out of the water they are in, the younger ones on the heifer block up the road could hear me whistling and all of them swam to me, which was pretty amazing against the flow.”

Lattimore, a third-generation farmer, managed to save all of his dairy cows but lost some 20 heifers. He has only managed to recover five of their bodies so far.

“I’ll get calls to say there is a heifer on this block in Taree, and you go to check on it and hope that it’s a live one and, you know, she might be distressed but we can get her home and save her,” he said. “And then you get there and you find that she’s drowned and she’s washed up there. And that’s sort of happened three times now, so it’s pretty heartbreaking.”

Further east along the Manning River, at Oxley Island, dead cattle lie twisted in trees, a snapshot of the violence that has savaged the area.

Three colliding weather systems have caused flooding chaos across swathes of New South Wales, leading to dozens of communities being declared disaster zones and forcing more than 18,000 people to evacuate their homes.

Quick Guide Is NSW flooding yet more evidence of climate change? Show Experts say it’s unusual to see so many places with such high rainfall across such a wide area. The extreme rainfall came after three weather systems combined, and fell on already saturated ground due to a wetter-than-average summer, thanks in part to the La Nina weather pattern. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture - about 7% for each degree of warming - so there's more available to fall as rain. If you do the maths, Australia has warmed by 1.4C, accounting for roughly 5-10% of the rain. But climate scientists say it's not that simple because of the many different factors that influence rainfall. Climate change could also be making weather patterns that deliver downpours more frequent, but again, more research is needed.

The floods have been devastating for farmers along the state’s mid-north coast, many of whom lost property, crops and precious livestock in a matter of hours.

A Facebook Group – Mid North Coast horse/ livestock flood recovery – has been set up to help farmers find lost animals and has so far gained more than 4,000 members.

Donald Hood, co-owner and veterinarian at Taree veterinary hospital, said he had watched helpless as cows were washed away.

“I live in Cundletown and I sat and watched cows flooding down the river, already dead,” he said. “And there is nothing you can do.”

Kempsey shire councillor Sue McGinn’s property: ‘We have just gotten through a drought, it zaps your spirits’

Of the animals that survived, Hood said he had been working around the clock to treat hypothermia, cuts and abscesses. Many horses and cattle are also suffering from damaged feet, having spent days stranded in water.

Hood’s colleague and vet hospital co-owner, Rob Brudar, has had better luck, rescuing a calf on Saturday and a cow yesterday morning who had been washed into the surf.

“The calf had been in the river for three days and had horrible pneumonia … We had no idea where it had come from,” he said. “It came out the entrance at Old Bar, the surf was wild, you wouldn’t have wanted to be out there.

“He survived and made it on to shore. The fact that he’s are alive on the beach is a miracle in its own right. He’s on a farm just out of Old Bar. We heard from the owner of the property and he said he is going really well.”

While the cow rescued on Monday ultimately didn’t survive, Brudar said it was heartwarming to see the community rally together to try and save its life.

“We had 10 guys trying to lift her, people trying to come around and help her and feed her, and it was just really good to see. The feat of getting a 700kg cow 500 metres up the beach and into a trailer; I don’t even know how we did it. But we did it because we all worked together and we weren’t going to give up on her.”

Others have found livestock washed up in residential back yards.

For some farmers, the floods are a breaking point.

The 2019 bushfires and unrelenting drought, which finally broke around a year ago, forced many, like Lattimore, into debt. Now, the floods threaten to undo months of toil and slow repayments, knocking back the recovery by at least two or three more years.

“I was 10 years old when we had the 1978 flood,” Lattimore said, his voice breaking. “But back then, farms were smaller, family farms … but now, you know, we’re going to milk twice as many cows for a fraction of the margin … Whether it’s droughts or floods that come along, we’ve got no reserves in the pricing system to keep farms operating. So this on top of the drought, it’s going to finish a lot of farms.

“There is no resilience in the agricultural system to recover from adversity.”

With the roads cut off, Brett McGinn pours fresh milk down the drain

A dairy farmer and Kempsey shire councillor, Sue McGinn, agreed that the floods needed to spark a bigger conversation about the price we are paying for fresh food and dairy products.

Her Macleay Valley property, east of Kempsey, flooded after water breached the Belmore River on Friday. While she and her husband, Brett, haven’t lost cattle, they fear dormant flood waters will starve their grass, destroying their cow’s main food source and preventing them from planting winter feed.

No feed means no milk, and no milk means no cashflow. Add to that road closures, which have prevented dairy collection trucks from reaching the farm and forced the couple to make the difficult call to pour fresh milk – their livelihood – down the drain.

“I’m certainly not asking for charity,” she said. “But any business that wears the financial impacts to put out a litre of milk needs to be paid well enough to continue to farm so that litre of milk still gets on the kitchen table.

“You can do all you can and … [make] what you do and efficient and productive, but I don’t think any business can sustain any big, large-scale whacks – even the best of us can’t sustain continual attacks. The scale of this and given we have just gotten through a drought, it zaps your spirits, but it certainly hurts your bank balance.”",2021-03-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'washed', 'helplessness', 'lost', 'bellowing', 'milk', 'floods', 'river', 'weather', 'floodhit', 'dairy', 'cows', 'property', 'farmers', 'lament', 'taree', 'hearing']",Australia,news article,English
2213,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Vietnam: Devastating landslides hit army camp - DW (English),https://www.dw.com/en/vietnam-devastating-landslides-hit-army-camp/a-55314564,"Rescue teams in Vietnam raced against the clock on Sunday in search for a dozen men, after a series of landslides overwhelmed an army camp.

Heavy rain has pounded over central Vietnam for more than a week, resulting in floods and landslides that have killed at least 64 people, according to the country's disaster management authority.

""From 2 a.m. until now, there have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,"" local official Ha Ngoc Duong said, as reported by Vietnamese newspaper VnExpress, warning that the situation could worsen.

The bodies of some 22 soldiers from the army camp were recovered early on Sunday morning, according to local media reports. Ongoing rain has hampered rescue efforts. Days before, 13 rescue team members died trying to reach a group of 30 employees of a hydropower plant that had been buried by the landslides.

The rains have flooded nearly 200,000 houses in the region.

Widespread damage

Authorities also warned that river levels in the country had reached their highest in two decades, state media said.

The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides. Torrential downpours have flooded nearly 200,000 houses and 300 schools in the region.

Since storms began on October 6, some 72 people have died and a further 19 are still missing, Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said in a report.

Though Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, which often bring flooding and landslides, this month's disaster has been the worst the country has faced in years.

Neighboring Cambodia has also been affected by heavy flooding in the region. The death toll there jumped to 20 on Saturday, according to disaster management authorities.

Footage released by charity Save Giraffes Now showed a female giraffe named Asiwa being loaded onto a steel barge and transported four miles down river to a nature reserve.

The NGO said that two of eight giraffes stuck on the island had now been rescued and the remaining animals are set to be moved in the next few months.

The Rothchilds giraffes were sent to the remote area in 2011 over fears they would be targeted by poachers, but became stranded from the mainland after recent intense rainfall.

Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) coordinated the daring rescue and was joined by Save Giraffes Now and the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT).

For years, Rothchilds giraffes have freely roamed Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley, but numbers have declined rapidly, partially due to poaching.

There are now only around 800 left in Kenya and fewer than 3,000 in all of Africa.

Susan is the name of the other giraffe who was saved by the groups. The four remaining adult females, Nkarikoni, Nalangu, Awala and Nasieku, one adult male, Lbarnnoti, and juvenile female Pasaka will be moved early next year.

(AP)

David O'Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now, said: ""There is great urgency to execute this rescue.

â??We couldn't have asked for a better result, and we're eager to move the others soon. With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters.â?

Inside, sits an ornate sandstone sarcophagus radiant with flowing curvilinear forms and calligraphy that tells us that the tomb is the last resting place of some Ali Beg. But that did not matter to my new friend.Later, in nearby Mong, the village that takes its name from the Scythian King Maues (1century BCE), known as Moga in Punjabi, I got another educational boost. Seeing that I was on the trail of Alexander, a rather contrary sort of middle-aged man took me under his wing. He spoke of the Macedonian’s victory over Raja Paurava (Greek: Porus) with admirable pride and how folks named their sons after the Macedonian. I asked if folks ever named a son after Paurava, he being one of our own. Pat came an angry, “Kyon? O koi Musalman cee?” Islam being nearly a millennium in the future, Raja Paurava was certainly no Muslim. But then neither was Alexander. On another similar occasion, my interlocutor burst out with an incredulous half-question, half-statement, “Alexander was Hindu?”Interestingly, even semi-educated persons in Pakistan cannot imagine a religion like the Greeks had, with a large pantheon of mostly fun-loving gods. They are caught in a mental box with four names — Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and a very distant and vague Judaism. No other religion appears on their radar.This man in Mong was smarter, however. He countered with the statement that Alexander was mentioned in the Holy Quran. The king we so desperately want to turn into Alexander is the Quranic Zulqarnain whose name means ‘Two-Horned’. He travelled across the great expanse of the world, ruled over a vast kingdom and was responsible for locking away the dreaded nation of Gog and Magog behind a rubble wall steeped in molten lead. This king, we read, travelled to the rising and setting places of the sun. That is, his sway extended across much of the known world of his time.But scripture does not reveal anything beyond this short reference. Now, there were two famous world-conquering kings in history who wore horns on their helmets. Cyrus the Great (ruled BCE 549-529) of Persia and, 200 years later, Alexander of Macedonia. Indeed, the latter’s depiction on coinage with diadem and ram’s horns is very well known.Now, both were great conquerors, therefore, either could be Zulqarnain. But mark: Cyrus established a kingdom only marginally smaller than Alexander’s.This kingdom lasted 200 years until Alexander unravelled it and became master of it. Alexander’s kingdom was larger. His governors presided on the affairs of men from Thrace (Bulgaria) through the Scythian steppes on the northern shores of the Black Sea, to the banks of the Jaxartes (Syr) River (in Uzbekistan) and across the entire Persian Empire, Afghanistan, Punjab and Sindh to Babylon. But it was a short-lived empire, lasting just over a decade until Alexander’s death in 322 BCE.So, really, which king was it that scripture refers to as the ‘Two-Horned’? If greatness were a measure in terms of longevity of kingdom, I would vote Cyrus. However, Alexander who did indeed embody traits that could arguably be termed ‘great’ left behind a kingdom that did not last beyond his own lifetime.But we, in Pakistan, embrace him. We stretch the words of scripture to make Zulqarnain fit into Alexander’s shoes. We do this only because he, an outsider, defeated a king of Punjab who, unfortunately, was a Hindu. We disregard the fact that Raja Paurava (of whose greatness of character I have written earlier in this column) was a Hindu because he predated Islam.Published in The Express Tribune, November 18, 2012.",2012-11-17 08:00:00+00:00,"['alexander', 'king', 'zulqarnain', 'paurava', 'known', 'kingdom', 'scripture', 'tomb', 'great', 'village']",India,news article,English
994,Drought Sri Lanka,Dalit man alleges attack at Sivaganga village - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dalit-man-alleges-attack-at-sivaganga-village/article4814049.ece,"A man belonging to Pudhirai Vannar, a scheduled caste community, who had applied for drought relief was allegedly abused and attacked by a cooperative union secretary at Satharasankottai in Sivaganga district on Tuesday.

Vettai Villan (50), who originally hails from Ponnali at Satharasankottai in Sivaganga district, was allegedly evicted from his village by members belonging to the dominant castes in 2004 following an incident of caste discrimination.

Since then Vettai villan and his family were living in Vavval Thottam near Uthangudi in Madurai. His son V. Murugan, a former member of Tamil Nadu Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board in Madurai, has moved the Madras High Court demanding retrieval of their house and land.

The Dalit family on Thursday staged a novel protest in Madurai — the family carrying a head load of firewood, earthen pots and stove marched towards the office of Inspector General of Police, symbolically suggesting that they were evicted forcefully.

Murugan said that on the day of incidence, Vettai Villan had gone to Satharasankottai to claim drought relief for his land (Patta No: 673) (Survey No: 219/9A).

He was allegedly attacked and abused in his caste name stating that “you are not in the village; how could we give relief money.”

The aggrieved Dalit had met the Village Administrative Officer but was again abused there as the latter was facing a High Court case filed by the former’s son. The land which belonged to Murugan’s family had been allegedly usurped by an intermediate caste family in Ponnali.

While they were marching to the IGP’s office, police intercepted them near Matuthavani Integrated Bus Stand and took them to the office. The family members submitted a petition demanding the police to arrest the persons who had abused them under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989.",2013-06-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['allegedly', 'abused', 'attack', 'village', 'dalit', 'office', 'man', 'villan', 'alleges', 'satharasankottai', 'relief', 'sivaganga', 'caste', 'family', 'scheduled']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

1965,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Nigeria: Food Security Threatened As Floods Destroy Farms - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202009030184.html,"Fear of food crisis is heightening in Nigeria following massive floods that are ravaging crop farms in many parts of the country.

Many farmlands were reportedly destroyed by floods in Kebbi, Zamfara, Niger, Rivers, C/Rivers, Sokoto, Bauchi and some parts of Kwara State.

Rice and maize farmlands were most affected and farmers fear this could further hike the prices of the staple food in the country.

A Daily Trust market survey showed that prices of food items are already going up in the market.

In Kano, a 100kg of maize now costs N20,000, N22,000 in Benue, N24, 000 in Abuja and as high as N25,000 in Lagos State.

The same size of maize sold between N9, 000 and N11, 000 last year across the country.

Also, 100kg of local rice now costs N55,000 in Kano, N58,000 in Abuja, while prices of beans range from N22,000 to N24, 000 per 100kg depending on the market and state.

- The warnings -

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had warned that the current water level in the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin portends some level of concern for Nigeria as there could be a likelihood of river flooding in the states contiguous to River Niger.

The states, according to the Agency, are Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The Director-General of the agency, Engr. Clement Onyeaso Nze said the country through Kebbi State might be flooded beginning from September 6

Reports from Kebbi had shown that several hectares of rice farms were washed away by flood and similar incidence was also reported in some parts of Zamfara, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kwara, Cross Rivers, Rivers and Niger states.

The incident is already a source of concern for stakeholders in the food sector as they are expressing fears that if the ugly trend continues, there might be food crisis in the country.

In Kebbi State, over 500,000 hectares of farmlands were reported to have been destroyed by flood.

The Chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, Sani Dododo, who announced the incident said rice farms accounted for about 450,000 of the hectares while the remaining 50,000 were for other crops.

- Farmers narrate ordeal -

It was reported that farmers in Kebbi State lost over N5 billon to the flood.

A victim and female rice farmer in the state, Lubabatu Bunza, said she lost about 16,000 hectares to the recent flood in the state.

Also, Mallam Isa Ahman, another victim from Patigi LGA of Kwara State, said early last month, flood washed away about six hectares of his rice farm and four hectares of his maize farm.

The farmer said he obtained a loan from a commercial bank and invested on the farm, saying it would be difficult to repay the loan.

Many of the affected farmers in Kebbi and Niger states said they got their inputs from the Anchor Borrowers' Programme of the federal government and wondered how they would be able to repay the loans.

President of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Ibrahim Kabiru, said even though it would be difficult to ascertain the damages done to the farms by the flood across the country, the trend portents a great danger ahead.

He said the flood-affected rice, maize, sorghum and other crops in the affected states.

According to him, the situation was being worsened by the insecurity in the rural areas where the farms are located.

The farmers' leader had earlier warned that bandits were preventing farmers from accessing their farms, which he said was a dangerous pointer to food security.

Mr. Mathew Ajayi, a food security expert told Daily Trust on phone yesterday that already the country was nearing food crisis as this could be seen in the skyrocketing prices of food items across the country.

""It is obvious that we are approaching a serious food crisis considering the rising prices of food items across the country.

""And now look at the flood ravaging the farms' couple with the bandits chasing away farmers from their farms,"" he said.

Alhaji Muktar Umar, a farmer and local rice miller in Sabo-Wuse, Niger State, told Daily Trust on phone Wednesday that the country might experience serious rice crisis this year because of the flood incidence and security challenges threatening the farmers.

""From my experience as a farmer, I know many people go into rice farming this year but the farms are being washed away by the flood.

""Many farmers can no longer go to their farms now, most especially here in Niger State,"" he said.

- Buhari orders release of food items from reserves -

President Muhammadu Buhari said Wednesday that the flood disaster in Kebbi State had exposed the country to a major setback in the efforts to boost local food production.

Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed concerns over the heavy floods that took a number of lives, submerged thousands of hectares of farmlands and houses, destroying farm produce and personal belongings in the affected communities.

The president said: ""I am particularly sad over this incident because it is a setback to our efforts to boost local rice production as part of measures to stop food importation.

""Kebbi State is the focal point of our policy to produce rice locally as part of this administration's commitment to agricultural revival, which suffered relative neglect in favour of food importation.

""With the loss of six lives and still counting; thousands of hectares of land flooded and estimated economic losses of more than one billion naira by rice farmers in Kebbi State, we face a major setback in our efforts to boost local food production.

""This bad news couldn't have come at a worse time for our farmers and other Nigerians who looked forward to a bumper harvest this year in order to reduce the current astronomical rise in the costs of food items in the markets.""

The president, while sympathising with the bereaved families and farmers affected by the devastating floods, assured that ""we are going to work closely with the Kebbi State government in order to bring relief to the victims.""

In another statement yesterday by Shehu, Buhari expressed the concern of his administration about the sudden spiral of food prices at a time when the economy was already mired in a slowdown occasioned by the global coronavirus situation.

Buhari, however, assured Nigerians that the situation was transient.

He said his administration had already begun looking and putting in place measures to ameliorate the situation.

""While Providence has been kind to us with the rains and as such an expectation that a bumper harvest would lead to crashing of food prices and ease the burdens on the population, the government's concern is that the exploitative market behaviour by actors has significantly increased among traders in the past few years and may make any such relief a short-lived one.

""This year has indeed tested us in ways that globalisation has never been tested since the turn of the century.

""These challenges have disrupted lives and supply chains all over the world and Nigeria has not been spared.

""The effect has been deeply felt in the delays encountered in the procurement of raw materials for local production of fertilizer (damaging standing crops before harvest) and the speculative activities by a number of rice processors who are ready to pay for paddy at any price to keep their mills running non-stop.

""But of all these problems, the most worrisome is the activities of ""corrupt"" middlemen (with many of them discovered to be foreigners) and other food traders who serve as the link between farmers and consumers found to be systematically creating an artificial scarcity so that they can sell at higher prices.

""In dealing with these problems, the administration has, in line with its ease of doing business mantra, avoided imposing stockholding restrictions in order not to discourage investments in modern warehousing and cold storage.

""The president has just approved the release of food items from the strategic reserves, including 30,000 tons of maize to animal feeds producers to ease the high cost of poultry production.

""President Buhari's administration has raised some of these issues with the various food producer associations involved, particularly those of rice and other grains.

""With their cooperation, the high food prices should soon be a thing of the past.

""In addition, investments in the agro-allied sector by the private sector will significantly increase domestic production of farming inputs especially fertilizer, further crash prices, create employment and ease the pressure on our foreign reserves.

""One of these major investments is the Dangote Fertilizer plant, which is projected to come on stream by the 4th quarter of 2020,"" the president said.

- Experts suggest ways out -

The National President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Arc. Ibrahim Kabiru noted that to mitigate the effect of these calamities on the food system or food security, farmers should be encouraged to embark on full-scale dry season farming, which could lead to all-year-round farming

He advised that government should expand the nation's irrigable lands by investing more in water resources.

He also advised farmers to quickly plant alternative crops that require little time to mature in order to mitigate the crisis.

He said government at all levels could support such farmers with seeds and other inputs.

""Whereupon the time left for the rainy season cannot be sufficient for any crop, some form of compensation commensurate to the ascertained loss could be given to the affected farmers,"" he advised.

The farmer's leader urged his members to insure their farms, adding that the association is already working with National Agricultural Insurance Company (NAIC) to that all farmers insure their farms.

The women leader of the Kebbi State Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Lubabatu Usman Kamba suggested that the way out for some of the challenges was for the farmers to be provided with good knowledge of forecasting the planting season.

She said flooding has been the farmers' biggest nightmare, adding that they could only be addressed with good forecasting knowledge on when and where to plant the crops, which she said was currently lacking because of the near absence of extension service workers.",2020-09-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'niger', 'food', 'kebbi', 'security', 'floods', 'farms', 'prices', 'threatened', 'nigeria', 'destroy', 'rice', 'hectares', 'state']",Nigeria,news article,English
1458,FL-2019-000179-CAN,'Urgent action needed' to preserve wetlands and mitigate flood risk: report - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/urgent-action-needed-to-preserve-wetlands-and-mitigate-flood-risk-report-1.4099915,"The Insurance Bureau of Canada is calling for “urgent action” when it comes to preserving Canada’s wetlands as a way of limiting flood risk.

A new report, issued Tuesday in partnership with the Intact Centre and the International Institute for Sustainable Development, indicates restoring ponds and wetlands can be a more cost-friendly and effective way of preventing flooding than man-made alternatives, such as dams or levies.

“Often, we overthink solutions,” Craig Stewart, the IBC’s vice-president of Federal Affairs, told CTV News. “We have a lot out there already buffering us from harm. In terms of our coastal wetlands, our inland wetlands, our forests, we need to be doing a better job of protecting these in the places where they protect us.”

Flooding has become a growing issue in the country. Insurance loses from extreme weather in Canada -- primarily flooding -- averaged $405 million annually from 1983-2008, but has since skyrocketed to $1.8 billion annually over the last decade.

In some areas of the country, maintaining or restoring waterways and wetlands has already proven economically beneficial.

In Gibsons, B.C., about 46 kilometres northwest of Vancouver, ponds are saving the community up to $4 million in annual rainfall storage. Meanwhile, in Manitoba, a restored wetland is helping save the surrounding area roughly $3.7 million annually in flood prevention and water filtration.

Despite the apparent benefits of maintaining Canadian wetlands, they are disappearing to development at staggering rates. According to the IBC, southern Ontario has lost 72 per cent of its wetlands to construction, while the southern Okanagan region of British Columbia has lost 85 per cent.

Both regions have been hit with costly flooding thus far in 2018.

In May, British Columbia’s southern interior was hit with catastrophic flooding that lasted several days. Torrential rain mixed with melting snow from the mountains forced thousands of people to evacuate and damaged hundreds of homes in the process.

In early August, a flash flood in Toronto submerged cars and flooded basements, leaving an estimated $80 million worth of damages in its tracks.

Anne Hammill, director of the Resilience Program at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, says wetland areas can also be effective in protecting urban areas from flooding.

“The vegetated lands can help buffer and sort of prevent water from moving as quickly and accumulating in places that are greater risk,” she said.

The federal government has committed $2 billion to build traditional infrastructure and restoring natural protections. In the Paris Agreement, it acknowledged the ability of natural ecosystems to protect against extreme weather.

The IBC says if the government truly intends to uphold its international promises, time is of the essence.

“If Canada remains committed to the Sendai Framework and the Paris Agreement, it needs to act now, in innovative and unprecedented ways, before it cannot act at all,” the report states.

MOGADISHU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The recent torrential rains across Somalia have affected around 166,000 people, the United Nations humanitarian agency said on Monday.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said while the rains have reduced in some areas, it is alarming that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on April 25 and recent heavy rains causing riverine and flash flooding.

According to OCHA, the combined impact of drought and floods is likely to exacerbate the already critical food security situation in Somalia, where more than 2.7 million people are projected to be food insecure.

""Furthermore, these climate shocks will cause displacement, jeopardize access to safe water, contribute to an increase of water-borne diseases and negatively impact livelihoods,"" OCHA said in its latest Floods Update report released in Mogadishu.

The UN said key air and road transportation routes have been affected, impacting on the availability of food supplies and partners' ability to reach affected populations.

It said the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan requires 1.09 billion U.S. dollars to assist four million people but is only 19 percent funded as of Sunday.

On May 9, the UN agency said at least 25 people were killed from May 3 to 9 due to heavy rains which were pounding several parts of Somalia.

745,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Ghana: Nyanyano Cold Storage Facility Abandoned - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201908010664.html,"Nyanyano — A, which was constructed by the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD) to address post-harvest fish losses, for the people of Nyanyano, a coastal fishing community, near Kasoa in the Central Region, has been.

Investigations by the Ghanaian Times has discovered.

The facility was commissioned in 2015 by the former Minister of the MoFAD, Ms Sherry Ayittey and former District Chief Executive for Gomoa East, Mr Moses Jehu-Appiah.

The Gomoa East District Assembly took custody of the facility on behalf of the chiefs and people as beneficiaries.

A visit to by the Ghanaian Times to the Nyanyano last Thursday, revealed that the facility which is equipped with a cold room, a blast freezer, an ice-maker, a standby generator, an electrical lifter and a cold van, has been left at the mercy of the weather, invaded by rodents and reptiles.

The compound was over grown with weeds.

The rationale for the construction of the cold storage facility, the Ghanaian Times gathered, was that fish losses recorded, especially during bumper harvests were high.

This was because fishermen were not sending ice to sea, hence the facility was to help improve their income during event bumper harvests.

The fishermen would also not be compelled to sell their catch at unattractive prices due to lack of storage facilities.

The facilities would serve as a source of supply of fish for fish mongers in the area as well.

Records available to the Ghanaian Times has it that the Nyanyano fish storage facility was part of seven million euros secured from the Government of Spain for the construction of a total of six storage facilities along fishing coastal communities in the Greater Accra, Central and Western Regions.

The Chief of Nyanyano, Nana Obeng Wiabo V, when contacted, expressed disappointment that the huge investment was not being utilised but abandoned by the fisheries authorities.

He therefore appealed to the sector ministry to revamp the facility and make it operational for an efficient fishing industry at Nyanyano and the Gomoa East District in general.

The Executive Director of the Fisheries Commission at the MoFAD, Mr Arthur Dadzie, in an interview corroborated the Ghanaian Times story and said the sector ministry was exploring various options including a Public Private Partnership (PPP) agreement to have the facility operational.

He said that from the onset some five companies namely, singer Ventures, OA Kranoc Limited, Sekumba Company Limited, Prampram Coldstore Company Limited, and Gabdor Limited, were contracted under a PPP agreement to manage the facilities but the companies according to him, have not been able to meet the conditions in the agreement, including the payment of the monthly fee to the ministry.

Mr Dadzie mentioned the high cost of electricity tariff, which all the managers complained about, also led to the non-functioning of the facilities.

Their services was therefore terminated hence leading to the equipment and the facilities to deteriorate.

He disclosed that the next step was for the ministry to take over the facilities and to collaborate with the respective assemblies to ensure that they are protected and put to use.",2019-08-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['abandoned', 'mofad', 'facilities', 'storage', 'cold', 'limited', 'ghanaian', 'fish', 'facility', 'times', 'nyanyano', 'ministry', 'ghana']",Ghana,news article,English

Above-average 2020 second season cereal harvest expected in bi‑modal rainfall areas

Delayed and reduced 2020 harvest gathered in Karamoja Region

Abundant seasonal rains benefiting pastoral livelihoods

Prices of maize at low levels due to adequate availabilities and depressed demand

Food security situation still affected by measures to contain spread of COVID‑19 pandemic, despite phasing out of some restrictions

Above-average 2020 second season cereal harvest expected in bi‑modal rainfall areas

In bi‑modal rainfall areas covering most of the country, harvesting of the 2020 second season crops is about to start and will be completed in January. The September‑November rainy season was characterized by abundant precipitations, especially in northern areas, favouring crop establishment and development. Vegetation conditions are good across the country (see ASI map) and an above-average crop production is expected. However, the torrential rains triggered flooding in September and October near Lake Albert and Lake Kyoga, in northwestern Amuru, Adjumani, Obongi, Packwach, Moyo, Lamwo and Arua districts and in eastern Butaleja and Mbale districts. In addition, landslides occurred in mountain areas of eastern Mbale, southern Kisoro and western Bunyangabo districts. Floods and landslides affected about 16 500 people and caused losses of lives, damage to infrastructure and localized crop losses. Subsequently, in late November, heavy rains caused floods in Mbarara District and landslides in Kasese District, both located in the South-Western Region, affecting more than 2 000 people.

The first season harvest concluded in July and production was estimated at above‑average levels due to abundant seasonal rains, despite localized but significant flood-related production shortfalls.

Total cereal production for 2020 is put at about 3.6 million tonnes, nearly 4 percent up from 2019 and similar to the average of the previous five years.

In February 2020, a desert locust outbreak affected northeastern Teso and Karamoja subregions and northern Acholi and Lango subregions. Damage to pastures and crops was localized as swarms were of relatively small size and the Government, with the support of FAO, carried out effective control operations. Although as of late November no swarms were present in the country, Cyclone Gati hit northern Somalia on 22 November 2020 bringing heavy rains and creating a conducive environment for the formation of several immature swarms in early December. Some of these swarms could reach northern Kenya by mid‑December. As a result, there is a concrete risk of another locust invasion of northeastern and northern areas of the country, characterized by an already fragile food security situation. The desert locust response plan is 90 percent funded through multiple donors and agencies, and contingency plans are in place for surveillance and control measures.

Delayed and reduced harvest gathered in Karamoja Region

In the uni‑modal rainfall agro‑pastoral Karamoja Region, the April‑September rainy season had an early onset in March, with heavy rains triggering flooding and waterlogging which resulted in delayed and reduced plantings, also due to seed shortages. As a result, although the good performance of seasonal rains benefitted yields, cereals and pulses were harvested in October, with about a one‑month delay, and production is estimated at 10‑20 percent below average due to a reduced planted area and to the continuation of seasonal rains into October, which resulted in increased post-harvest losses.

Abundant seasonal rains benefitting pastoral livelihoods

In the agro‑pastoral areas of Cattle Corridor and Karamoja Region, abundant rains between September and November have resulted in above‑average rangeland conditions (see Vegetation Condition Index Map). Ample availability of water and pasture benefitted animal body conditions, with above‑average levels of meat and milk production. However, in Cattle Corridor significant losses of pasture due to floods have been reported in western Ntoroko and Bullisa districts and in central Nakasongola District. In Karamoja Region, the restrictive measures introduced to curb the spread of the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and the COVID‑19 pandemic, coupled with persisting insecurity related to cattle raids, have disrupted livestock movements and, animal and milk sales.

Prices of maize at low levels due to adequate availabilities and depressed demand

Prices of maize decreased by about 50 percent between May and August in all monitored markets, including the capital, Kampala, as the commercialization of the first season harvest increased market availabilities. The COVID‑19‑related restrictions exerted further downward pressure on prices, as demand by restaurants, hotels, schools and urban households was constrained by a lower economic activity and declines in incomes. Prices increased by about 15‑20 percent in September, as seasonal patterns were compounded by flood‑related trade disruptions, remaining subsequently mostly stable in October and November. Prices of maize in November were almost 40 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

In the cereal deficit Karamoja Region, the availability of low priced cereals from neighbouring surplus producing areas in Soroti, Lira and Acholi regions has resulted in a generalized decline of cereal prices, despite the below‑average local harvest. In several markets of the region, including Moroto, Kaabong and Napak, prices of sorghum in September were up to 20 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

Food security situation affected by measures adopted to contain spread of COVID‑19 pandemic

The restrictive measures introduced in March and April 2020 by the Government to curb the spread of the COVID‑19 pandemic had a substantial adverse impact on the food security situation. Despite the easing of restrictions in June/July, the economic and livelihood recovery has been slow.

According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, conducted in Karamoja Region, refugee settlements, host communities and urban areas, 2 million people (17 percent of the analyzed population) are estimated to be severely food insecure (IPC Phase 3: “Crisis” and Phase 4: “Emergency”) in the period September 2020-January 2021. Of these 2 million people:",2020-12-09 08:00:00+00:00,"['seasonal', 'season', 'brief', '9december2020', 'giews', '2020', 'areas', 'security', 'region', 'karamoja', 'rains', 'country', 'uganda', 'production', 'harvest']",Uganda,news article,English
907,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Foods to tease your taste buds in autumn evenings|Life|chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-09/03/content_13610378.htm,"Foods to tease your taste buds in autumn evenings Updated: 2011-09-03 07:48 By Ye Jun (China Daily)

As autumn nears, Beijing's restaurant scene comes alive with foods to awaken the senses, at a range of tasting events and festivals.

The 7th Beijing International Western Cuisine Festival, which kicked off in mid-August and will last till Sept 30, is a case in point.

Diners can log on to http://xcwhj.huishua.com (in Chinese only) to download discount coupons to member restaurants of the Beijing Western Cuisine Association.

SOPEXA, an organization dedicated to cultural exchange between China and France, will organize the 10th French Festival at Sanlitun on Sept 24 and 25. From noon to 8 pm on these two days, one can sample French foods and wines, and learn about French products. Representatives from major French companies - Air France, Aussino World Wines, Evian, Nespresso, Sinodis and Michelin - will also be present at the venue.

With the evenings becoming cooler, many Beijing residents are seeking out outdoor dining options. The Scarlett wine bar and restaurant is one such. The restaurant offers a delectable combo platter with five cheeses and three cold cuts.

The chef's recommendation includes a very tender chicken main course, served with noodles, and a great value beef fillet, for 298 yuan ($47), which is good for at least two. The restaurant offers a range of international wines. The restaurant has a modern feel.

The most striking aspect of Bloo Dining restaurant is the round dining area with French windows that allow sunlight to stream in. A highlight at the eatery is Hainan chicken rice. According to chef Bob He, the restaurant uses a 1.5 kilogram Wenchang chicken from Hainan island, which he puts in seething hot water, then turns off the fire, and keep the lid on for 25 minutes. After that, the whole chicken is put in iced water, yielding a chicken that is tantalizingly tender. The chicken rice costs 80 yuan a person.

Yet another restaurant with a great outdoor ambience is Nuage at Houhai. Its second floor opens on to a great view of the lake. The restaurant offers Shandong cuisine on the first and third floors, and French-style Vietnamese foods on the second and fourth floors. At a recent tasting, I was delighted to discover the slightly sweet Vietnamese curry chicken, which made for a perfect combination with steamed rice.

I would also recommend chicken salad, and Vietnamese rice noodles, served with battered beef, onion slices and coriander.

876,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Dying Lake Gives New Life To Iran's Antigovernment Protests - RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty,https://www.rferl.org/a/dying_lake_revives_iran_protests/24314925.html,"An abandoned ship is stuck in the solidified salts of Lake Orumieh.

In April, demonstrators in Tabriz and Orumieh demanded Lake Orumieh be saved.

Iran's largest lake is dying, but it's giving new life to antigovernment protests along its receding shores.Lake Orumieh, one of the world's largest saltwater lakes, has shrunk by some 60 percent in recent years due to drought and misguided development policies. Environmentalists warn that unless something is done, the lake will disappear forever.This dire prospect has put locals who depend on the lake on edge. And seeing as the lake straddles the border of Iran's East and West Azerbaijan provinces, centers of the country's ethnic Azeri population that have a rich and volatile history of protest against Tehran, the central government is on edge too.Tensions over the lake's falling water levels boiled over last week, after parliament, the Majlis, decided against local lawmakers' proposed fast-track solution to the problem in an August 17 vote. Scores of locals took to the streets of Orumieh (aka Urmia) on August 27, and open conflict with security forces ensued.""Let's cry and fill Lake Orumieh with our tears,"" protesters chanted in Orumieh, as well as, ""Lake Orumieh is dying; the Majlis is issuing its death sentence"" (see video).And what might have been heard loudest by the authorities -- already sensitive to any signs of a return of the large-scale protest that followed the country's 2009 presidential election and wary of any outward signs of ethnic discord in the country's Azeri regions -- were chants like these: ""Azerbaijan rise up and cry out,"" and ""If Azerbaijan doesn't rise up, it will lose.""The protest was met with force by security forces, who reportedly used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowd. Videos purportedly from the protest that wereshow activists throwing stones, and antiriot forces firing back.Yashar Hakkapour, a Canada-based human rights activist, tells RFE/RL's Radio Farda that he heard reports of numerous injuries and arrests among protesters. ""Local sources informed us that some of the people were injured because the special forces attacked them with batons,"" he said.A protest planned the same day in Tabriz, the capital of East Azerbaijan Province that lies 80 kilometers east of the lake, never materialized.An eyewitness told RFE/RL that security forces prevented citizens from expressing their concerns over the state of the lake, and at least three people were detained.The failed protest came after a spate of arrests and incidents related to the outcry over the government's perceived inaction over the lake issue.Some 30 activists in the city were arrested on August 24 during a fast-breaking dinner in the middle of Ramadan. They were reportedly discussing the poor state of the lake.A day earlier, several activists were detained before and after a soccer match in Tabriz. Soccer fans assembled for the August 23 game reportedly chanted slogans against the Iranian parliament and accused it of issuing an execution order for the lake.In April, 70 people in Tabriz were reportedly arrested at a protest against the lake's rapid demise. Several of them were later sentenced to lashes and fined.The region's history as a hotbed of resistance -- highlighted by the Tabriz-centered constitutional revolution of 1906 aimed at bringing modern democratic practices to Iran -- could help explain the government's heavy-handed response.As Washington-based analyst Ali Afshari explains, Iranian authorities are concerned about an awakening of ethnic tensions that have led to large scale protests in the past. ""We have to see it in the frame of political and ethnic tensions that exists in that region between some of the ethnic Azeri Iranians and the government,"" he says. ""Some are after [more rights] while others might have separatist demands. This has led the government to react.""The development also comes amid strains in Tehran's relations with neighboring Azerbaijan that stem largely from Baku's concerns over the treatment of Iran's large Azeri minority.Activists in Azerbaijan have called on Iran to release Azeri political prisoners and to provide more cultural and political rights for Azeris in Iran. In the wake of the violence and arrests related to Lake Orumieh, groups such as the Association for the Defense of Azerbaijani Political Prisoners in Iran have condemned the Iranian government's response to the protests and have called for the release of those detained.Ardeshir Amir Arjomand, a top adviser to opposition leader Mir Hossein Musavi who left Iran a few months ago, told the opposition Kalame website that the Iranian government's response showed how much it fears protests of any kind. ""A government that is facing a legitimacy crisis is afraid of everything, from youths' joy, to having iftar in parks, everything,"" Arjomand said. ""They even see the water of Orumieh Lake as a security issue.""The security implications are not lost on those outside the government either. In covering the protests, the business-oriented website Aftab noted, ""If officials did not want to rescue the dying Lake Orumieh, then they should at least be aware that not doing anything serious about the issue can create deep security issues in the northwestern region of the country.""Questions have also been raised over whether the lake's demise is the true reason for the protests, or just a convenient excuse to air political grievances.Analyst Afshari doesn't think it really matters either way. ""Some of those who took part in the protests have genuine environmental concerns -- Lake Orumieh is a key factor for development and the environment of that region, not only the provinces of East and West Azerbaijan but also for other provinces, so some are really concerned,"" he notes. ""Others might use the issue for their own political and ethnic activities; yet we shouldn't forget that it's the people's right to protest.""If there is one point of consensus, it is that saving the lake appears to be the goal of all parties and in the interest of all Iranians. The polarizing point is just how to go about it.The parliament's August 17 vote against the ""double urgency"" bill was not the final nail in the coffin for Lake Orumieh, even if that is how the decision is perceived by some.What the vote did kill was a proposal submitted by lawmakers from Orumieh that called for allocating funds to channel water from the Aras River to raise the level of the lake. In rejecting the proposal, the parliament effectively opted to continue its current review of the situation.This has led to accusations of inaction by some, but those who voted against the bill defended their decision by saying it was submitted in haste and had little chance of restoring the lake.Among them is lawmaker Salam Khodadadi, who told Iran's official IRNA news agency last week that the regional representatives who proposed the bill should have presented the bill as a national project and not as a regional one.Only the central government can solve the problem of the lake, he said, adding that 8.5 billion liters of water evaporates from the lake every year.""If it continues like that, we will be left face-to-face with a national tragedy in two years' time,"" he said.Another lawmaker, Jamshid Ansari, described the drying-up of the lake as a national problem and warned that if the issue was not dealt with properly, 18 of Iran's 31 provinces would be affected.Iranian authorities have blamed a variety of factors, including drought, for the lake's dropping water level. And the government has announced a plan to invigorate the lake that includes reducing the amount of water drawn from the lake for irrigation and supplying it with remote sources of water. In 2010, Vice President Mohammad Javad Mohammadizadeh said 2 billion cubic meters of water would be added to the lake over five to 10 years.Environmental experts and others cite misguided policies and poor decisions as the biggest contributors to the lake's demise. ""We've built 35 dams and 10 more are being constructed,"" says Ismail Kahrom, a well-known environmental expert and university professor in Tehran. ""It means we have deprived Orumieh Lake of 5.5 billion cubic meters of water per year.""Experts have called for action before the lake -- a UNESCO Biosphere reserve home to hundreds of species of birds, reptiles, and mammals -- fades away forever.",2011-09-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['lakes', 'irans', 'protests', 'gives', 'protest', 'security', 'political', 'water', 'lake', 'dying', 'orumieh', 'ethnic', 'azerbaijan', 'antigovernment', 'life']",China,news article,English

With Assam inundated by floods, several countries including China, Russia and France collaborated with India on sharing satellite images of the scale of inundation. As signatories to the The International Charter Space and Major Disasters, any of the 32 member countries can send a ‘request’ to activate the Charter. This would immediately trigger a request by the coordinators to space agencies of other countries whose satellites have the best eyes on the site of the disaster.

Based on an activation request by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on July 17, France’s National Centre for Space Studies, China National Space Administration and ROSCOSMOS of Russia shared satellite images of the flood situation in the districts of Dhubri, Marigaon, Barpeta, Dhemaji, Lakhimpur in Assam with ISRO’s National Remote Sensing Centre. ISRO’s CARTOSAT satellites too got the Indian space agency its own images.

‘Standard practice’

Ravish Kumar, spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said in response to a query from The Hindu that combining earth observation assets from different space agencies allows resources and expertise to be coordinated for rapid response. This was a “standard practice” and in the past ISRO too had provided information to other space agencies in response to similar requests. In August 2014, for instance, ISRO’s CARTOSAT shared images after an activation request from China after an earthquake struck Yunan province and killed 398.

Phnom Penh (AFP)

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to get them to safety from rising floodwater on Saturday in Cambodia's western province of Battambang.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces -- Pursat, Battambang and Pailin -- have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall ahead of the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

""A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood,"" Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told AFP on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to worsen on Sunday.

In central Vietnam almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking north Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to sandbag and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

Authorities were distributing food packages and urged people to evacuate to community shelters.

The Khao Yai National Park was closed this weekend because of heavy rain and landslides.

In Laos, rising floodwater has damaged villages and rice fields along the Xepon and Xebanghieng rivers in Savannakhet province with more rain on the way.

903,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Trying to speak the same language|HongKong Focus|chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2011-08/31/content_13224667.htm,"Trying to speak the same language Updated: 2011-08-31 08:01 (HK Edition)

Students from Islamic Kasim Tuet Memorial College participate in a Chinese culture week before Lunar New Year. Writing Chinese can be a difficult task for them. Provided to China Daily Before Islamic Kasim Tuet Memorial College became a designated school, the majority of the admitted students were Chinese. Kahon Chan / China Daily Shirley Lo (left) and Edmund Chan. Kahon Chan / China Daily Students from Islamic Kasim Tuet Memorial College sample traditional festive food during a Chinese cultural week. Provided to China Daily

Summer finally comes to an end, but the heated debate over equal education for ethnic minorities carries on. Teachers and concern groups share their personal experience and views with Kahon Chan about the situation ignited by the Equal Opportunities Commission.

Summer holidays finally come to an end and students return to schools. Some have big plans. Among them is Akash Limbu. His goal as he heads back to school is to speak a bit more Chinese. He hasn't done very well with the language in his first 11 years in Hong Kong. He can only manage a few basic greetings and self-introduction.

""Maybe I did not work quite hard enough on it,"" said the 16-year-old Nepalese, attempting to explain his weak Chinese. ""It's kind of hard to understand and remember those Chinese characters.""

Hong Kong bills itself as ""Asia's World City"". The word ""diverse"" is part of the branding - creating the image of a city that is ""pluralistic and tolerant"". Akash may represent part of this so-called pluralistic community, but he has not experienced much tolerance in the education system at many levels.

Like a lot of Chinese fellows, he is not very well aware of the fact.

Akash plans to advance his studies at a local tertiary institution. His family can't afford to pay for overseas study. To move on, Akash will require a passing grade in both English and Chinese, in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education commencing in 2012. The prerequisite is a challenge for many Chinese, let alone Akash.

There is another way, the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) Chinese examination. It was introduced in May 2008 for non-Chinese speaking local students for alternative qualification for admission to universities. The institutions' recognition of GCSE's based on its low threshold on its Chinese standard is largely unenthusiastic.

Receipt for poverty

""The point is whether all courses in the university are lectured in Chinese? Not medicine, definitely not English Literature. Then why is it necessary to get passes in English and Chinese?"" James Lung Wai-man, chairman of Southern Democratic Alliance, questioned. He has advocated equality for ethnic minorities since 2002 and recently set up a food bank for minorities because the existing food banks cannot spare resources for translators.

""An ethnic Indian from Hong Kong may not be qualified for the language requirement, but why is an Indian from New Delhi admitted with exemption in Chinese? I can't imagine a local citizen would end up like that."" The language barricade for higher academic achievement, as James cited, may result in ethnic minorities ending up in cross-generational poverty.

Though the Education Bureau stated that there is also an increase in non-Chinese speaking students attending programs offered by Vocational Training Council (VTC) and other operators, James noted VTC only offers English courses on security and construction, suffocating the career options of minorities.

Going back the basic question: how does one speak so little Chinese when the language and the people are virtually everywhere in Hong Kong?

It can't be true for everyone. Akash has only a couple of Chinese classmates as he attends one of the ""designated"" secondary schools, where he is surrounded by other South Asian fellows and English is inevitably the sole teaching medium. There has been little pressure to learn Chinese at all.

Curriculum vacuum

At another designated school, the Islamic Kasim Tuet Memorial College, Chinese teacher Shirley Lo described her first encounter with ethnic minorities when she was still a fresh graduate five years ago. ""When I stepped into the classroom, I had no idea what was going on. I had never seen that.""

With help from colleagues, Shirley picked up the skills that were not part of her professional training in Chinese language education. ""South Asians of secondary schools might be learning numbers, from one to five. They are there to recognize a character at a time."" She said, ""My mind-set had to get back to the basic.""

Senior Chinese teacher Edmund Chan went through an even steeper learning curve. Before the Islamic school became a designated school, more than three quarters of the admitted students were Chinese. Chan could elaborate on cultural essence beyond the textbook.

Five years into the scheme, South Asians make up more than three quarters of all fresh faces showing up in September and change has to come.

""I felt they needed more help. Apparently, they are not well accommodated in Hong Kong as you don't see many of them working in a lot of industries."" He said, ""We want them to survive here.""

While Chinese teachers like Chan or those in 27 other designated schools across Hong Kong are aware of the children's vulnerable future, they are not equipped with the most needed survival kit.

Aside from a ""supplementary guideline"" supplied to the schools on Chinese language education, the Education Bureau told China Daily that ""tailor-made teaching and learning materials"" were provided to both teachers and students. But the teachers were only aware of piles of materials prepared by another designated school and with concern of breach of copyright laws, they are now using textbooks for GCSE Chinese exams instead.

The whole idea of not having a fixed curriculum for the non-Chinese speaking students is because the government expected a low recognition for a substandard curriculum, as the bureau told a working group under the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) in April.

But the absence of staged learning objectives and respective tools laid out by professional curriculum planners, as told by teachers from the Islamic school, leaves a lot of inconsistency. For instance, a discrepancy among primary school graduates has posed great challenges for secondary schools, so there can be little wonder that Shirley had to begin her class with numbers.

'They really don't care'

James Lung felt that government officials were reluctant to make greater effort because they are only working for the international instruments effective for Hong Kong. That includes the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Executive Director of Hong Kong Unison, Fermi Wong Wai-fun, identified a misconception of equality among the policy-makers through her decade-long lobby.

""From top to bottom, education officials felt they have done more than enough for the minorities because it would be unfair to Chinese citizens."" She said, ""One bowl of rice for everyone seems fair, but in fact some of us need two bowls to get filled. The ethnic minorities need more support to attain fair competition.""

When the EOC hosted a news conference in July to address all the concerns about education among ethnic minorities, friends of Fermi, familiar with the government, suggested the bureau should have responded with some trepidation. The threat of a judicial review of the Bill of Rights Ordinance, published on a local press, may have mounted more pressure.

But the Education Bureau is determined to keep its answer neat and short: ""The Education Bureau is re-examining our support measures with reference to the recommendations of the Report"".

Fermi felt that prejudice was prominent at the bureau. ""(Staff are) supposed to listen to what we have to say. The politically appointed officials come down to argue with the stakeholders. He never delivers our genuine demands back to the office, where no one really owns this issue and looks into it. No one.""

Despite a lot of disappointment, she still plans to present another proposal to the Education Bureau in late September. ""Thousands of Hong Kong kids have moved to other places like Canada and Australia and how are they treated? They were not put in designated schools but were given great resources. My proposal will follow this principle,"" Fermi said.

It was also clarified that only a few of the 100 complaints among minority students could be presented to the Equal Opportunities Commission as formal complaints. A judicial review would be only be a desperate last resort since the ethnic minorities are deeply worried about creating upset in the mainstream society.

Out of the many concerns, with which Edmund Chan did not fully agree, was the allegation of racial discrimination at designated schools. Chinese parents would take much of the blame. ""They don't understand us. They see more Pakistanis and Nepalese walking through the school gate, the parents and students won't get in to ask and opt us out. Without any policy change, I assume Chinese will disappear from here in ten years.""

He acknowledged the family background of certain South Asian students was no stimulus to their learning incentives, but he has seen outstanding students. Inadequate language support presents an obstacle to their future.

""There is a blank in our education system. Hardly any effort has been made from publishers, Examination and Assessment Authority to Education Bureau."" He said. ""The bureau informed you about the Chinese learning support operated by the University of Hong Kong, but it would be unnecessary if there is a full plan and curriculum.""

As the interview wrapped up, the teacher was informed that the story will be told in about 1,500 words and he responded: ""It is just too short to address this issue.""

950,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Batteries that Charge Themselves with Mechanical Energy - CleanTechnica,https://cleantechnica.com/2011/08/31/batteries-that-charge-themselves-with-mechanical-energy/,"MicroGen Systems has been working on electricity-generating chips designed to power wireless sensors like those used to monitor tire pressure and environmental conditions.

These chips convert the mechanical energy of vibrations into electricity, which is then used to charge a small battery, which in turn powers the sensors.

If the chips are capable of generating adequate electrical energy, then they could mostly (or maybe even completely) eliminate the need to replace the batteries.

The core of MicroGen’s chips is a 1 cm2 array of silicon cantilevers that oscillate when the chip is jostled. At the base of the cantilevers is a bit of piezoelectric material: when it’s strained by vibrations, it produces a voltage that can be used to generate electrical current. Voltage is what causes current to flow.

The array of cantilevers is mounted on top of a postage-stamp-sized, thin-film battery that it charges. The current passes from the piezoelectric array through an electrical device that converts the current to an appropriate DC current that is suitable for charging the battery. When the chip is shaken by the vibrations of a rotating tire, for example, it can produce about 200 microwatts of power.

An efficient vibration-energy-harvesting device has the potential to be very beneficial because there are so many vibrating devices, such as mechanical machines, in general, including automobiles, generators, engines in general, and fans, as well as humans walking, arm and hand movements, and much more.

David Culler, chair of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley said: “If you can get it down to a small size, 200 microwatts is potentially quite useful.”

Robert Andosca, the founder and president of MicroGen Systems, said that what sets this technology apart from other piezoelectric generators is the fact that it is made of a non-toxic material known as PZT.

200 microwatts of power might not be much, but if it is small enough, it could be very beneficial to tiny sensors that need to be integrated into small places.

673,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Ministry Takes Steps To Rebrand Work Of Environmental Health Officers - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/ministry-takes-steps-to-rebrand-work-of-environmental-health-officers/,"The Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources is to rebrand the scope of work of the Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) popularly known as “Samasama” to expande Sanitary Inspection and Compliance Enforcement (ESICOME).

Under the ESICOME the EHOs are to first identify a nuisance, educate households on the services being rendered by their respective assemblies in the abatement of nuisance and to ensure compliance of acceptable behaviour.

“After a household or the landlord failed to abate the nuisance he or she would be served with summons as part of the enforcement to comply with the assemblies’ bye-laws.”

Mr Kweku Quansah, the Chief Environmental Health Technologist at the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development made this known to the Ghana News Agency at a two-day technical workshop for health officers, technologists and analysts of the 11 Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) in the Greater Accra Region at Tutu in the Akuapem South District of the Eastern Region.

It was on the Review of Environmental Health Prosecution Manual and MMDAs Model Bye-laws and was sponsored by the World Bank as part of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area-Sanitation and Water Project (GAMA-SWP).

Mr Quansah told the participants that the workshop was to strengthen the capacity of the EHOs to review their outmoded bye-laws and prosecution manuals to bring their penalties to conform with modern day realities in their jurisdictions.

“This is to curb the environmental and insanitary problems that have engulfed the MMDAs in the country.”

He urged the officers to look out for a more appropriate way of data management and resist political interference in their work through phone calls by politicians.

“We need MMDAs laws to compliment the national laws to ensure that the public infrastructure and services are well catered for to strengthen regulations and enforcement standards to change behaviours,” he said.

Mr Samuel Akwei Allotey of the Environmental Health Directorate of the Ministry of Local Government said the environmental sanitation challenges were serious and called for pragmatic steps to deal with them.

Major challenges which were identified by participants were; political interference , lack of logistics and inadequate capacity-building and outmoded bye-laws.

I am privileged to be given this opportunity to present the Second H.R. Khanna Memorial Lecture.

I remember the days of Emergency when we, the public, were very unaware of what was happening as there was total censorship of newspapers.

During the height of emergency, the people of the country were wholly unaware of what was happening in regard to the challenges which would have an impact upon the future of the country. During these times, I myself had appeared in various political detention matters in the Karnataka High Court and in matters such as the dismissal of the Karunanidhi Government on 31st January, 1976 just before the General Elections were to be held in Tamil Nadu State, really with intention of eliminating the political rival in the State. If any attempt was made by newspaper to publish any of the news relating to challenges to the Central Government, the censure would straightway cut it out and there would be a white blank triangle, square or rectangle where the news would appear. Where the newspaper enclosed a blank square in a black border depicting important news, the censure would have even the black border removed.

It was in this atmosphere of fear that one person stood out in defence of the Constitution and for the liberty of the individual. It was Justice H.R. Khanna who was prepared to declare in his dissent that notwithstanding the suspension of the Right to Life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution or the Right to Equality in Article 14 of the Constitution or the various freedoms contained in Article 19 of the Constitution, nevertheless no person could be detained without authority of law or contrary to law.

When this judgment was delivered, Justice H.R. Khanna had no doubt, whatsoever, that though he was the senior-most Judge, he would stand superseded, but, nevertheless he went ahead and delivered his dissent. As expected, he was superseded, and he straightway submitted his resignation as a Judge of the Supreme Court.

I was in Madras at the time when my friends at the Bar in Delhi informed me about this great Judge who had upheld, during the time of Emergency, the human values which permeate the Justice delivery system. The New York Times, in its issue of 30th April 1976 declared:

If India ever finds its way back to the freedom and democracy that were proud hallmarks of its first eighteen years as an independent nation, someone will surely erect a monument to Justice H.R. Khanna of the Supreme Court.

No statue was put up in the Supreme Court, but in Court No.2, a life size portrait of his was put up so that even now, the new generation of advocates would notice it and ask who it is. They would then be told the entire history of his battle to uphold the basic human rights enshrined in the Constitution even though the fundamental rights to life and to equality had been suspended during the Emergency.

Almost a quarter of a century later, it is but fitting that we remember Justice Khanna’s legacy through this commemorative lecture of the Indian Institute of Public Administration on “The Rule of Law and Human Rights in India”. Both “Rule of Law” and “Human Rights” are familiar phrases, which all of us have often heard, but when we delve into the subject, we find that different thinkers and jurists have understood them in a variety of different ways. Justice H.R. Khanna himself, in his autobiography titled “Neither Roses nor Thorns” - a clear reference to another great Judge, late Justice M.C. Chagla, the title of whose autobiography was “Roses in December” - mentioned that:

If there are three prime requisites for the rule of law, they are a strong Bar, an independent judiciary and an enlightened public opinion. There can, indeed be no greater indication of decay in the rule of law than a docile Bar, a subservient judiciary and a society with a choked or coarsened conscience.

The Indian Parliament has also defined Human Rights, in The Protection of Human Rights Act 1993, to mean:

The rights relating to life and liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by Courts in India.

The International covenants which would be relevant for the purpose would be the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which, as proclaimed by the United Nations in 1948, in Article 1, itself sums up the basic doctrine on which Human Rights are founded, namely: all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”

The Declaration includes various civil and political rights, which we find enshrined in Part-III of our Constitution which was adopted the year after the Universal Declaration (the Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26th November 1949). However, in addition to these basic civil and political rights, it has also incorporated in Part-IV of the Constitution what are generally viewed as ‘socio-economic rights’. For instance, it is expressly stated in Article 23 of the Declaration that “everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment; everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work; everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.” Again, Article 25 of the Declaration states that “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age.” Under Article 26, “Everyone has the right to education which shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages”. And finally, Article 8 of the Declaration speaks of “Access to justice for enforcement of these fundamental rights”.

Many of these socio-economic rights found in the Universal Declaration like, the right to work, to education, to live, to nutrition, standard of living and all adequate means of livelihood are all found in our Constitution in the Directive Principles of State Policy which, in terms of Article 37 of the Constitution, as stated - “are fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws”.

However, if one were to dispassionately consider the ground reality, one would find a very different and stark picture. Even though 60 years have elapsed since the adoption of the Constitution, we are faced with the grim reality of over 30% of the population of this country being subjected to dire poverty. India is crippled, in my view, by staggering poverty, which results in grave hunger, malnutrition and disease. While the rule of law may have come to be accepted as part of the basic structure of our constitutional system, to my mind, it is difficult to argue that the rule of law is a core value so long as millions of Indians are not free from want. Poverty in India constitutes, at the most fundamental level, a denial of the rule of law. The reality is that the Constitution’s promise of equality rings hollow for an unconscionably large section of Indian society even today.

It is true that we are fed, on an almost daily basis, with the idea of an India that is fast emerging as an economic powerhouse. No less a person than the President of the United States, on his recent visit to India, had remarked, in his address to the India Parliament that “India is not simply emerging. India,” he said, “has already emerged.” This statement was greeted with enthusiasm and self-congratulation in wide sections of the media and by the public. One may not have to look very far to see what inspired the U.S. President to say these words: a clutch of high-profile, high-value acquisitions of foreign firms by Indian companies, with just the top ten high value acquisitions so far being worth around USD 21.5 billion which is more than double the amount involved in the acquisitions of Indian companies by American companies; foreign direct investment in India, till November 2010, totaling to USD 140 billion; and an average quarterly GDP growth rate of 8.4% for the period 2004 – 2010, reaching a high of 10.10% in September 2006. India’s economy, as one article put it, has had its head in the clouds (As India’s clout grows it will reshape the world around it, The Economist, 29 September 2008).

This headline-grabbing growth unfortunately masks a quite different reality. A few kilometres beyond the plush five-star luxury and swanky board-rooms that the U.S. President visited in Bombay, is a rusty sprawl of shanties where grinding poverty prevails. With the incessant hype about India’s triumphant arrival on the global stage, it is perhaps easy to lose sight of the fact that India, according to latest UN statistics, is home to 410 million people living below the UN estimated poverty line of $1.25 a day, an increase of a 100 million from the year 2004. What this means in real terms is that no less than 410 million Indians (or about 37.2 per cent. of India's population) cannot afford two square meals a day that meet minimal nutritional needs.

According to a new 'multi-dimensional' poverty index developed by the United Nations Development Programme, acute poverty in eight Indian States (400 million, including Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal) together account for more poor people than in the 26 poorest African nations combined (410 million, including war-ravaged Somalia and Sierra Leone). The new measure takes into account not only per capita income but also access to resources, education and medical care.

There was a view in the 1950s and 1960s, dominant amongst Western sceptics that India was too vast, too poor and too diverse to succeed as a nation. Born against a background of privation and civil war, divided along lines of caste, class, language and religion, independent India has defied numerous prophets of doom who believed that its poverty and heterogeneity would force it to break up or come under autocratic rule. Today, India can be justifiably proud of its vibrant democracy, its strongly secular tradition and its fiercely independent judiciary which has breathed life into the promises of the Constitution.

At the same time, in the face of daunting statistics on poverty, hunger, malnourishment, starvation deaths, illiteracy and lack of medical care, one cannot help but wonder: of what use is the lofty rhetoric on the right to life to a starving child in rural Chattisgarh or a homeless person on the streets of Delhi? Do India’s constitutional guarantees truly have meaning for those who suffer great deprivation of basic needs?

I must say, therefore, that while the discourse on human rights has usually focussed on civil and political rights, and their deprivation, such as violations of personal liberty without authority of law, rights of undertrial prisoners and so on, to my mind, the failure of the State, over the period of the last six decades, to eradicate the abject poverty which more than a third of the population of this country has to suffer, and to ensure that all its citizens are extended the minimum benefits of nutritious food and basic healthcare, is the single most important violation of human rights of our citizens. To repeat, one would ask oneself the question as to what purpose the rights such as freedom of speech, equality and access to justice would serve when a person has to suffer debilitating hunger and end his day without a meal, be unable to access the basic health services, and be compelled to sleep on pavements at the height of winter with only a sheet to cover himself - in other words, suffer what can only be termed as a mere animal existence.

It is not as if the three organs of the State have not made any effort to address the problems of poverty, hunger and disease, and the consequent denial of human rights. Each has been attempting to take steps to remedy the rather appalling situation that India finds itself in. For instance, The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 was enacted by Parliament to meet the national as well as international demand for the constitution of the National Human Rights Commission, State Human Rights Commissions in the States and Human Rights Courts for a holistic protection of human rights. In addition, innumerable laws have been enacted to implement some of the Directive Principles of State enshrined in Part IV of our Constitution and these laws strive and aim at protecting and promoting human rights. Some noteworthy instances are the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2006, which guarantees a minimum employment of 100 days each year to eligible adults, and the Right to Education Act, 2009, which guarantees the right to education to all children between the ages of 6 and 14. The task of implementing the policies incorporated in the various laws made by Parliament, and the State Legislatures, falls on the shoulders of the executive wing of the State.

However, it is really the judiciary in India, especially the higher judiciary, which really stands out as the institution which has exhibited the most concern, understanding, as well as positive action in the field of human rights. The Supreme Court of India has, through its various pronouncements, enhanced the coverage of the various rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It was Justice P.N. Bhagwati, who, in Francis’s Coralie’s case, declared that the “right to life is not a mere right to life under Article 21 and cannot be restricted to mere animal existence. It means much more than just physical survival and that further that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in adverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and mingling with fellow human beings…. there is implicit in Article 21 the right to protection against torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.”

The Court has forged remedies and brought about dramatic and

far-reaching changes. For instance, in Hussainara Khatoon (III) v. State of Bihar, (1980) 1 SCC 108, the Court stated:

2…The Government in a social welfare State must set up rescue and welfare homes for the purpose of taking care of women and children who have nowhere else to go and who are otherwise uncared for by the society. It is the duty of government to protect women and children who are homeless or destitute… We direct that all women and children who are in the jails in the State of Bihar under ‘protective custody’ or who are in jail because their presence is required for giving evidence or who are victims of offence should be released and taken forthwith to welfare homes or rescue homes and should be kept there and properly looked after.

8…We, therefore, direct the Government of Bihar to inquire into these cases and where it is found that the investigation has been going on for a period of more than six months without satisfying the Magistrate that for special reasons and in the interest of justice the continuation of the investigation beyond the period of six months is necessary, the Government of Bihar will release the undertrial prisoners, unless the necessary orders of the Magistrate are obtained within a period of one month from today.

Shantistar Builders v. Narayan Khimalal Totame, (1990) 1 SCC 520



Basic needs of man have traditionally been accepted to be three — food, clothing and shelter. The right to life is guaranteed in any civilized society. That would take within its sweep the right to food, the right to clothing, the right to decent environment and a reasonable accommodation to live in. The difference between the need of an animal and a human being for shelter has to be kept in view. For the animal it is the bare protection of the body; for a human being it has to be a suitable accommodation which would allow him to grow in every aspect — physical, mental and intellectual. The Constitution aims at ensuring fuller development of every child. That would be possible only if the child is in a proper home. It is not necessary that every citizen must be ensured of living in a well-built comfortable house but a reasonable home particularly for people in India can even be mud-built thatched house or a mud-built fire-proof accommodation.



Mohini Jain (Miss) v. State of Karnataka, (1992) 3 SCC 666



Right to life” is the compendious expression for all those rights which the courts must enforce because they are basic to the dignified enjoyment of life. It extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue. The right to education flows directly from right to life. The right to life under Article 21 and the dignity of an individual cannot be assured unless it is accompanied by the right to education. The State Government is under an obligation to make endeavour to provide educational facilities at all levels to its citizens. The “right to education”, therefore, is concomitant to the fundamental rights enshrined under Part III of the Constitution. The State is under a constitutional mandate to provide educational institutions at all levels for the benefit of the citizens. The educational institutions must function to the best advantage of the citizens. Opportunity to acquire education cannot be confined to the richer section of the society.



People's Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India, (1982) 3 SCC 235

6… But apart altogether from the requirement of Convention 59, we have Article 24 of the Constitution which provides that no child below the age of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. This is a constitutional prohibition which, even if not followed up by appropriate legislation, must operate proprio vigore and construction work being plainly and indubitably a hazardous employment, it is clear that by reason of this constitutional prohibition, no child below the age of 14 years can be allowed to be engaged in construction work . There can therefore be no doubt that notwithstanding the absence of specification of construction industry in the Schedule to the Employment of Children Act, 1938, no child below the age of 14 years can be employed in construction work and the Union of India as also every State Government must ensure that this constitutional mandate is not violated in any part of the country.

Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, (1984) 3 SCC 161



Moreover, when a complaint is made on behalf of workmen that they are held in bondage and are working and living in miserable conditions without any proper or adequate shelter over their heads, without any protection against sun and rain, without two square meals per day and with only dirty water from a nullah to drink, it is difficult to appreciate how such a complaint can be thrown out on the ground that it is not violative of the fundamental right of the workmen. It is the fundamental right of everyone in this country, assured under the interpretation given to Article 21 by this Court in Francis Mullin case1to live with human dignity, free from exploitation. This right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39 and Articles 41 and 42 and at the least, therefore, it must include protection of the health and strength of workers, men and women, and of the tender age of children against abuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief. These are the minimum requirements which must exist in order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no State — neither the Central Government nor any State Government — has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic essentials.



There is no area of human endeavour with regard to which the Supreme Court has not sought to bring its judicial activism to bear to bring relief to those whose human rights have been infringed.

A very significant step, undertaken by the Supreme Court, in my view, is the exercise to extend to the poverty stricken population the ‘right to food’. In April 2001, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL, Rajasthan) filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking legal enforcement of the right to food, a basic human rights issue.

The legal basis of the right to food has also been underscored by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). In the course of a hearing held on 17 January 2003, it has declared:

Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees a fundamental right to life and personal liberty. The expression ‘life’ in this Article has been judicially interpreted to mean a life with human dignity and not mere survival or animal existence. In the light of this, the State is obliged to provide for all those minimum requirements which must be satisfied in order to enable a person to live with human dignity, such as education, health care, just and humane conditions of work, protection against exploitation, etc. In the view of the Commission, the right to food is inherent to a life with dignity, and Article 21 should be read with Articles 39(a) and 47 to understand the nature of the obligation of the State in order to ensure the effective realization of this right(Article 39(a) of the Constitution enunciated as one of the Directive Principles, fundamental in the governance of the country, requires the State to direct its policy towards securing that citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood. Article 47 spells out the duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people as a primary responsibility).

The reading of Article 21 together with Articles 39(a) and 47 places the issue of food security in the correct perspective, thus making the right to food a guaranteed fundamental right which is enforceable by virtue of the constitutional remedy provided under Article 32 of the Constitution.

The NHRC went on to state that “there is a fundamental right to be free from hunger”. PUCL’s petition was filed at a time when the country’s food stocks reached unprecedentedly high levels while hunger in drought-affected areas intensified. Initially, the case was brought against the Government of India, the Food Corporation of India, and six state governments in the context of inadequate drought relief. Subsequently, the case was extended to the larger issues of chronic hunger and under-nutrition and all the state governments were added to the list of respondents.

Despite the interventions of an activist Supreme Court, almost every national social-security programme, theoretically serving as cradle-to-grave buffers against destitution, has been racked by failure. For instance, most tribals who are officially poor have no access to five major national schemes (subsidised food, child health care, mid-day meals, jobs for work and old-age pensions) on which India is slated to spend Rs 118,000 crores in 2010-11. This is illustrative of a deepening gulf between legal entitlements and ground realities.

A grim reminder of the depth of deprivation in the country recently emerged from a village, Ganne, in its most populous state, Uttar Pradesh (UP). The front page of a national newspaper recently reported that malnourished children in Ganne have been eating moist lumps of mud laced with silica - a raw material for glass sheets and soap - because they are not officially classified as poor and are therefore ineligible for subsidised food and other state programmes. The state governments came forward with a cruel and unbelievable defence - that the children were eating mud out of habit, and not hunger.

In Ganne, which is incidentally part of the former constituency of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, the effects of a faltering system are evident. 33% of the villagers are tribal, another 30% schedule castes, driven out of the jungle when forests were cleared for “development”. Many of the BPL cards in Ganne have been issued to rich or influential families. Two anganwadis (child health centres) serve the area. They are too distant for the villagers. It is a twelve-kilometre walk from the nearest road. With most land being unfit for cultivation, villagers have little choice but to work in the silica mines for exploitative contractors under conditions close to bonded labour.

They are not covered by any labour laws or medical benefits. Nine of ten mud-eating children are in the last stage of malnutrition. Eight of ten people are deprived of every national social-security net and starvation and hunger are their constant companions. The average life span of the people here is 40 years(Hunger stares you in the face, Samar Halarnkar, Hindustan Times, 28 May 2010).

A Supreme Court inquiry team that visited the area following the newspaper report had this to say:

A grim, catastrophic picture emerges from enquiry of commission (sic)…there is a total collapse of food-security related schemes,” said the report, recommending several “emergency measures” in up to 46 villages. “Protruding stomach, dry, whitish hair, ashen skin, skinny children — hunger stares you in the face.

The day after the Supreme Court’s enquiry team’s report was made public, the state government, as already pointed out, refuted this assessment, saying ""habit, not hunger"" made children eat mud. The report attributes the crisis to “apathy, insensitivity, nexus between vested interests and elected representatives with active approval of administration and state”. Written by Arundhati Dhuru, an advisor to the Supreme Court, and noted economist Jean Drèze, the report is the latest indicator of the frailty of India’s vast but inefficient and corruption-ridden social-security systems.

The Supreme Court, in some of its landmark pronouncements, has taken the view that the Government is under a constitutional obligation to provide healthcare facilities to For instance, in Vincent Panikurlangara v. Union of India, (1987) 2 SCC 165, the Court observed:

A healthy body is the very foundation for all human activities. That is why the adage “Sariramadyam Khaludharma Sadhanam”. In a welfare State, therefore, it is the obligation of the State to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions congenial to good health.

Again, in State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh Chawla, (1997) 2 SCC 83, the Court stated that:

It is now settled law that right to health is integral to the right to life. Government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities.

The problem is, for all its talk of pro-poor policies, the Indian government’s overall expenditure on health until the fiscal year 2000-01 did not even amount to 1% of total GDP. Public expenditure on health for the current fiscal year (2009-10) is expected to be a measly 1.45%, according to figures published by the Government of India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

According to a study published by the World Health Organisation, aggregate government expenditure on health by all central government departments (health, defence, labour, etc.), state departments, local bodies and public enterprises amounts to 1.3% of India’s GDP for each of the years from 1999 to 2002. On the other hand, public spending on health in the year 2002 even by relatively poorer African governments, for instance, in Rwanda and Senegal exceeded India’s, amounting, respectively, to 3.1% and 2.3% of each country’s GDP.

Faced with the collapsing and/or woefully inadequate medical infrastructure in some of the poorest parts of India, one might well question the priorities of the leaders in Delhi and each of the state capitals. Surely the measure of the civilization of a nation lies, at least to some extent, in the way it cares for its sick and needy? There can be no greater irony than a country which loses no opportunity to advertise its world-class pharmaceutical and technological advancement to medical tourism but which does not have the wherewithal to care for its own most vulnerable citizens, thus grossly violating their human rights.

As the statistics quoted above will show, the goal of securing health for the poor is riddled with challenges at multiple levels: a lack of prioritization of the health sector vis-à-vis other sectors which receive (and have historically received) a greater share of public expenditure, a consequent paucity of resources, and finally, challenges stemming from faulty implementation, including leakages and other inefficiencies. These are ultimately largely policy questions within the domain of the legislature and the executive. At the same time, over the course of the last few years, orders of the Supreme Court in the “right to food” case have had some bearing on the right to health in the context of the government’s social security programmes.

Conclusion

India’s Constitution is celebrated the world over as an expression of progressive, liberal ideals symbolizing the hopes and aspirations of its founding fathers for a pluralistic society founded on values of democracy, secularism, equality and liberty. The Supreme Court has, in great measure, fulfilled its role as a vanguard of the Constitution, not only preserving and protecting the rights of individuals against arbitrary state action, but also asserting the rights of the vulnerable and weak in the face of glaring state inaction.

The Central Government cannot close its eyes to large-scale fraud in the public distribution system by taking the narrow constitutional position that implementation is each state’s responsibility. A shocking 58% of India’s subsidized food grain does not reach BPL families. After all, there are limits to what the court can achieve without decisive, collective action from every level of the administration if we are to make any

dent in the lives of the 410 million Indians who go to bed without a square meal a day. For so long as there are Indians who live in poverty and in want, the Constitution’s promise of rule of law is bereft of meaning, and human right of a vast population is reduced non-existent.

Long years ago, one of India’s greatest statesmen, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, remarked in his now legendary Tryst with Destiny speech, that the service of India means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. I will conclude with his words, to remind us, as he said, whither we will go and what shall be our endeavour:

There is no resting for any one of us till we redeem our pledge in full, till we make all the people of India what destiny intended them to be.

It is a great tragedy that his vision and hope for India remain unfulfilled even after six decades of the working of the Constitution.

Reviewed by Jeffrey Kauffman, November 12, 2012

When one of her earliest Hollywood claims to fame was being labeled The Sweater Girl, it probably goes without saying that the professional film community wasn't overly impressed or frankly overly concerned with Lana Turner's acting ability. The young (as in--namely 16) girl caught the eye of a powerful publisher at a local soda fountain and got the girl an agent (Zeppo Marx, no less) almost within minutes of his discovery. Even the legendary Jack Warner simply assumed Lana was just another pretty face, and didn't put up much of a fuss when Lana matriculated to the much more glamorous ranks of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. But even at Metro Lana was thrust into roles that depended more on her physique than any intrinsic acting ability, and while she made any number of high profile films during her forties heyday, and was at least reputably professional in virtually all of them, few would ever accuse her of having the sort of innate performance abilities that some of her Metro cohorts did. Turner occasionally was able to hint at untapped depths in films like, but Metro seemed insistent on casting her in glitzy roles, and once her box office appeal started waning, and the studio system itself was on the verge of collapse, Metro didn't seem to know what exactly it wanted to do with her. It was toward the end of Lana's long contract with Metro that she made, a Fox behemoth that was in fact a remake of a 1939 Fox film that Lana had been considered for back at the beginning of her career. Turner had a long history of conflict with many of her leading men (she couldn't stand John Garfield in, for example), and that evidently was the case once again in this film, as she found Richard Burton intolerable. (It's ironic how bothandsimmer with sexual tension between the respective stars, so either Lanaa great actress or perhaps, to paraphrase a famous quote from, the lady doth protest too much.Lana and Michael Rennie portray Lady Edwina and Lord Albert Esketh, two jaded souls entangled in a marriage of inconvience. Edwina like Albert's classy sounding title, and Albert loved Edwina's fabulous fortune. Unfortunately the years have not been kind to the couple, and they barely tolerate each other, as is made clear in a blistering little opening scene where they lay their emotional cards on the table. They're on the way to Ranchipur, where Albert hopes to buy a prize show horse from the local Maharini (Eugenie Leontovich). Once they arrive, a ""childhood friend"" of Edwina's, local ne'er-do-well ""town drunk"" Tom Ransome (Fred MacMurray) shows up, seemingly riling Albert just a little. Tom on the other hand is being hounded every so nicely by sweet young thing Fern (Joan Caulfield), who feels with a little help, Tom can give up his nasty drinking habit and amount to something after all.Into this roiling melodramatic stew glides a young Indian doctor named Rama Safti (Richard Burton), a man who has already written a book which has made him an international celebrity and who has been hand picked by the Maharini to be her successor. Edwina is immediately drawn to Safti, first as a sort of exotic toy with whom she plays like a cat might with a mouse, but who soon actually captures her heartif she actually has one. This star-crossed love affair across a cultural divide may in fact remind some prescient viewers of another glamorous 1955 Fox production, one that is certainly better remembered than, namelyunfortunately falls far short of's more relatively stately depiction of this same general setup for a number of reasons. First of all, Edwina makes for an extremely unlikable main character, and the audience is basically rooting against her for the entire film, even when she shows certain traces of nobility of character (not many, mind you, but). There's also some (hopefully) unintentionally risible dialogue throughout the film (my personal favorite is when a well intentioned nursemaid offers Edwina some aspirin for her incipient malaria). But Jean Negulesco, never a director one associates with much subtlety, gives the film a positively Douglas Sirkian feel, one that is also fairly redolent of the kind of trashy big budget Ross Hunter fare that would soon become Turner's stock in trade.The big earthquake and flood scenes which cap the film's climax offer a temporary, if jolting, respite from the emotional turbulence that has filled the bulk of the film, ironically offering up a physical catastrophe in the place of one of the heart. Whiledid okay box office back in its day (though it was considered a failure due to its huge production costs), it's hard to imagine that many people left the theater feeling much of anything other than a sense of relief that they made it out of all the overblown melodrama alive.",2012-11-12 08:00:00+00:00,"['ranchipur', 'metro', 'date', 'girl', 'lana', 'tom', 'little', 'edwina', 'young', 'bluray', 'albert', 'local', '13', 'film', 'rains', 'release']",India,news article,English
2087,FL-2011-000132-UGA,"Relocate to safer areas, govt tells flood victims - Daily Monitor",https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/relocate-to-safer-areas-govt-tells-flood-victims--3400140,"By Wilson Kutamba More by this Author

Government has ordered all people living in flood-prone areas around Lake Victoria to relocate to safer areas as the country continues to receive heavy rain.

Mr Raphael Magyezi, the Minister for Local Government, asked district authorities to make arrangements and ensure that people swiftly vacate the affected landing sites on the lake shores.

“Heavy rains have already caused floods in some parts of the country and it is upon the victims with the help of district leaders to vacate flood prone areas for their safety,” Mr Magyezi said in an interview on Wednesday.

Last year, thousands of people were displaced after the rising water levels submerged a number of landing sites and islands around Lake Victoria and Lake Albert.

The victims were temporarily housed in makeshift shelters on the mainland as they waited for government to resettle them.

However, before government implemented the planned resettlement plan, many victims started returning to the islands and landing sites, claiming that the resettlement programme had delayed.

“The government’s plan to resettle the victims is underway although we have been constrained by lack of funds. However, people should not wait for floods to sweep them away. Let them relocate to safer places to save their lives,” Mr Magyezi said.

Masaka District alone has close to 20,000 flood victims, who were left homeless after water submerged Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo, and Kachanga landing sites last year.

Mr Aron Ahikiriza, a fisherman at Bukakkata Landing Site in Masaka District, said although the water levels are rising again, the lake remains their only source of livelihood.

“We can decide to sleep in rented houses far away from the landing site like we did the whole of last year but we cannot completely abandon the landing site because this where we earn a living,” he said.

Mr Rashid Babu, the manager of Mpongo Company Limited, which manages Lambu Landing Site, said government should expedite the process to permanently resettle the victims.

“Government should not be just talking, let them walk the talk because these people have been patient ever since they were promised to be resettled,” he said.

Mr Aloysius Jjuko, the chairperson of Bukakkata Sub-county, said the fishermen and their families are already scared of the rising water levels.

“We ask President Museveni to provide a permanent solution to the flood victims at landing sites. These people cannot resettle themselves unless they are helped by government,” he said.

Issue

Last year, rising water levels in various areas on Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, and Lake Albert shorelines wreaked havoc on many landing sites in the districts of Wakiso, Masaka, Mpigi, Kyotera, Kalangala, Mukono, Buikwe, Buvuma, Mayuge, Kayunga, Nakasongola, and Ntoroko displacing more than 40,000 people.

In Kasese District more than 100,000 people were displaced after major rivers in the area including Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana, and Lhubiriha burst their banks.

1462,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Are federal politicians and the P&C industry aligned on flood prevention? - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/how-do-the-federal-parties-stack-up-for-flood-mitigation-plans-1004169283/,"Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) has “been very vocal” throughout the federal election campaign on the need for a national plan to reduce flood risk, Craig Stewart, the group’s vice president of government affairs told Canadian Underwriter in a recent interview.

Here are the property and casualty industry’s five key wants from the next Canadian government, according to IBC:

Strategic retreat measures to move those at the highest risk out of harm’s way

A high-risk insurance pool to offer insurance to those who are deemed a high risk

Investments in flood mitigation measures to de-risk Canada

Investments in flood mapping to better predict risk and address it collaboratively between insurers and governments

A prohibition on future building in flood zones

IBC won’t comment during the middle of an election on which political party platform is closest to the mark regarding the industry’s wants. And so Canadian Underwriter asked the four major political parties what they planned to do to mitigate flood risk.

The Liberals pointed to their climate plan, which appears to promise many of the items IBC wants. The party’s said it wants to create a low-cost national flood insurance program through the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation for homeowners at high risk of flooding and don’t have adequate insurance protection; complete all flood maps in the country and have them available in an online database; and develop a plan to help homeowners at risk of facing repeating flooding with relocation.

The New Democratic Party of Canada told Canadian Underwriter that, if elected, it would expand funding to help communities respond to disaster and adapt infrastructure to withstand flooding and other extreme weather events by $2.5 billion.

“We will also work with the provinces, territories and local governments to ensure that the Disaster Mitigation and Adaption Fund meets the needs of communities,” an NDP spokesperson said in a email, adding that they would continue uploading flood plain maps and keep them updated “to ensure we have the information we need to prevent flooding and properly plan our communities.”

The Green Party’s platform includes items like retrofitting buildings to make them energy efficient. Under its infrastructure plan, the party wants the Canada Infrastructure Bank to invest in climate-proofing key infrastructure and make upgrades to drinking water and wastewater systems a priority in order to protect against flooding, droughts and contamination. It also includes plans to restore natural buffer zones along waterways.

“The simple answer is a Green government would invest in infrastructure and land to minimize and prevent flood damage and our renovation programs would also cover floodproofing in appropriate areas,” a spokesperson in an email.

The Conservatives did not respond to Canadian Underwriter’s request to discuss their platform or policies on flood mitigation. The party has, however, released a plan for climate change, which states that it would look at government investment in infrastructure. It would include low-cost options for enhancing or constructing wetlands to prevent floods and droughts. The party believes managing wetlands can provide protection from floods and droughts, noting that they will support the completion of the Canadian Wetland inventory.

“IBC is encouraged by the attention paid to flood so far in the election campaign. And we’re encouraging voters to take a closer look at the flood measures in party platforms and use that to inform their choice,” Stewart said.",2019-10-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['federal', 'industry', 'infrastructure', 'underwriter', 'risk', 'prevention', 'aligned', 'party', 'plan', 'wants', 'flood', 'pc', 'politicians', 'canadian', 'flooding', 'insurance']",Canada,news article,English

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has warned people to be wary about potential natural disasters as a result of the heavy downpours expected to recur over the weekend.

The BMKG has predicted there will be heavy rain from June 17 to 20 in several areas in Indonesia based on atmospheric indications, Yunus S. Swarinoto, meteorology deputy at the agency said in a press statement on Friday.

There is also potential for thunder storms and high winds during the rain, Yunus said.

""We strongly urge people to be aware of potential flooding, flash floods, landslides and fallen trees,"" he said in the statement.

Areas predicted to have a high intensity of rain include Aceh, North Sumatra, West Sumatra, Riau, Bengkulu, Bangka Belitung, South Sumatra, Lampung, Jakarta, Banten, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, East Java, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, Maluku and Papua.

The BMKG has also warned sea transportation operators to watch out for heavy rain and heavy swells in the southern part of Sumatra, Java, Bali and East Nusa Tenggara.

People can contact the BMKG on its 24-hour call center 021-6546315/18 to get the latest information on weather forecasts or log on to its official website web.meteo.bmkg.go.id.

1288,FL-2019-000022-IRN,"With Focus on Economic Relations, Iran-Iraq Ties Move Into the 'Daylight' — Bourse & Bazaar - Bourse & Bazaar",https://www.bourseandbazaar.com/articles/2019/4/1/with-focus-on-economic-relations-iran-iraq-ties-move-into-the-daylight,"Expectations were high when Iranian president Hassan Rouhani visited neighboring Iraq last month. During the trip, his first as president, Rouhani signed multiple trade deals with Iraq, where the return of peace and stability has renewed the government’s focus on economic development. The deals covered a variety of sectors including railway construction, electricity infrastructure, and engineering services.

Today, the volume of annual bilateral trade between Iran and Iraq stands at around USD 12 billion. But Rouhani has targeted ambitious growth, saying the two sides should aim to reach USD 20 billion in trade.

The deputy governor-general of Iran's southeastern Khuzestan province—close to the Iraqi border—said Rouhani's trip prepared the ground for the growth of trade in the Arvand Free Economic Zone. Agreements to complete a railway link connecting the southwestern Iranian town of Shalamcheh to the Iraqi Port of Basra and the decision to eliminate visa fees for travelers were among the most notable achievements of the trip. The tourism sector is booming as Iraqis find it increasingly appealing to visit cities in Iran’s west as well as the northeastern holy city of Mashhad, a popular destination for Iraq's Shiite pilgrims. Iranian pilgrims also travel to Iraq in huge numbers, visiting shrines in Najaf and Karbala.

Any planned growth in bilateral trade will depend on Iran and Iraq addressing a range of financial disagreements, exacerbated in part by US secondary sanctions. Since the reimposition of sanctions by the Trump administration in November, complaints have grown among Iranian stakeholders—including oil minister Bijan Zanganeh—that Badghad was effectively siding with Washington given non-payment of rising debts. Prior to Rouhani’s visit, Iran’s central bank governor, Abdolnasser Hemmati, traveled to Baghdad for technical meetings and secured commitments that Iraq would pay significant arrears related to the import of Iranian natural gas and electricity. A few weeks later, Rouhani told his Iraqi counterpart, Barham Salih that using national currencies in banking transactions would help protect bilateral trade from sanctions pressures.

Just last week, Rouhani stressed in a phone conversation with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi that an agreement to dredge the Arvand River—signed during his visit to Baghdad—was being implemented. Rouhani was speaking in the context of recent deadly floods that have left behind a trail of death and destruction in several Iranian provinces. During the phone call, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi noted that Iraqis have warmly welcomed proposals that would see a greater presence of Iranian firms in their country.

For its part, the Iraqi government has sought to reassure Iran of its commitment to expanded economic ties with Iran, despite Iraq’s continued reliance on security and economic support from the US. ""Iraq insists that the interests of our friendly and neighboring country must be met. We will do our best to reduce tensions in this regard and decrease the damage that will be done to the Iranian nation,"" declared President Salih.

Overall, Rouhani’s visit won praise across Iran’s political landscape. Hardline newspaper Kayhan, usually highly critical of the Rouhani administration, described the president’s visit as “an act of resistance” to US pressure, which served to “provide relief to the economy.” Financial newspaper Donya-e-Eqtesad, similarly highlighted “Tehran's message to Washington from within Baghdad.”

Iranian media also took pride in comparing Rouhani’s visit to the recent visit to Baghdad of US President Donald Trump. Iran’s state television focused on a series of comments Trump made following his return from Iraq, in which he complains about the secretive style of his visit. Trump sneaked into Iraq ""in the dark"" while Rouhani landed in ""broad daylight,” boasted several Iranian papers. The obvious displeasure of US officials at Iraq’s warm welcome of Rouhani also featured in reports about the trip.

Iran’s reinvigorated diplomacy towards Iraq reflects a new diplomatic and economic strategy towards its onetime foe. By placing a greater priority in ties with Iraq, Iran is seeking to both mitigate the impact of US sanctions, while also countering US influence. In some ways, this strategy is a continuation of the tug of war between the US and Iran which began in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.

For some Iraqis, this contest for influence reflects an unacceptable threat to Iraq’s sovereignty. Even the country's top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani raised the matter with Rouhani when the latter visited the holy city of Najaf. The highly revered religious leader stressed Iraq's sovereignty in his meeting with Rouhani, the first Iranian president to have secured such an audience.

Emerging from nearly two decades of conflict, first during the Iraq War and then during the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS), Iraq is now entering a post-war era in which reconstruction will be the foremost political priority. Iran, which played a role in the defeat of ISIS, sees for itself a constructive role in this new phase of Iraq’s development. It remains to be seen to what extent U.S. economic sanctions and political opposition prevent tighter bilateral ties between Iraq and Iran.

701,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Crop-destroying armyworm caterpillars spread to Uganda - Capital FM Kenya,https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2017/04/crop-destroying-armyworm-caterpillars-spread-uganda/,"0 SHARES Share Tweet

KAMPALA, Uganda, Apr 20 – A plague of crop-destroying fall armyworm caterpillars has spread to East Africa where officials confirmed their presence for the first time in Uganda on Friday.

An outbreak of the caterpillars in several southern African nations has already raised alarm with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation warning they pose “a huge threat to food security”.

Uganda’s Agriculture Minister Vincent Ssempijja said the presence of the innocuous looking but hugely destructive brown caterpillar had been confirmed in over 20 districts of the country.

“This will negatively impact on the nation’s food and nutrition security,” Ssempijja told a press conference in Kampala.

An estimated 10.9 million people already don’t have enough to eat in Uganda, according to a UN report on food insecurity released last month.

Fall armyworms are native to the Americas and were first spotted in Nigeria and Togo last year, with one theory saying that they arrived in Africa on commercial flights from South America or in plants imported from the region.

They have already caused damage to staple crops in Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Ghana while reports suggest Malawi, Mozambique and Ghana may also be affected.

The caterpillars eat maize, wheat, millet and rice key food sources in southern and eastern Africa, where many areas are already struggling with shortages after years of severe drought.

They also attack cotton, soybean, potato and tobacco fields.

Chemical pesticides can be effective, but fall armyworms have developed resistance in their native Americas.

In Uganda the caterpillars were spotted in May last year. Samples had to be sent to Australia to determine if they were the native Africa armyworm less destructive and which responds to pesticides or the fall armyworm.

“If nothing is done we could lose up to 15 percent of our maize production,” said senior agriculture minister official Okasai Opolot.

Uganda produces close to four million metric tons of maize grain annually, contributing to the livelihoods of more than 3.6 million households, according to government statistics.

Kampala has set aside one billion shillings ($280,000, 257,000 euros) for emergency response work including distribution of pesticides and educational materials for farmers.",2017-04-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'fall', 'armyworm', 'pesticides', 'cropdestroying', 'native', 'agriculture', 'food', 'maize', 'uganda', 'spread', 'caterpillars', 'million', 'capital']",Ghana,news article,English

1022,Drought Sri Lanka,The “Fracking” Revolution Comes to China – The Diplomat - the Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2013/03/the-fracking-revolution-comes-to-china/,"With some predicting China will import 79% of its oil by 2030, could domestic shale gas extraction help China meet its energy needs?

As shale gas fever sweeps through Beijing, analysts are looking at the costs and benefits of extracting what is increasingly a controversial source of energy. But for China, with its growing middle class, the immediate and long-term demand for energy has the potential to spark a revolution in shale gas before sufficient and safe technological know-how and regulations are developed.

A very vocal debate continues to rage in the U.S. and Europe as to the environmental consequences of shale gas extraction. Meanwhile, China’s National Oil Companies (NOCs) continue to purchase and buy into North American oil and gas companies with specific expertise in shale gas extraction. For better or worse, China’s shale gas revolution looks set to be thrust into the public spotlight, both at home and abroad.

Extracting shale gas is tricky. Shale, a sedimentary rock that is typically highly porous and has low permeability, traps hydrocarbons as it is formed. To remove the gas, shale formations must be stimulated, most commonly using hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking.” The technique involves pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into the shale formation, cracking the rock and allowing the gas to be released to the surface. The 1 to 3 million gallons of water that are pumped into the shale formation must then either be recycled or pumped into water disposal wells in subsurface rock formations.

In addition to these skill-intensive practices, the extraction process also demands three-dimensional seismic surveying, which evaluates potential subsurface resources, and horizontal drilling technology. Both demand expertise and experience, yet the capability of most companies outside of North America, including China’s National Oil Companies (NOCs), to safely and effectively perform such high-tech extraction is limited.

The emergence of shale gas is a game changer. Countries that have traditionally relied on hydrocarbon exports for political clout (the Persian Gulf, Russia, Venezuela) will inevitably lose some of their petro power. Europe could become less energy dependent on Russian supply by importing liquid natural gas (LNG) from North America and by exploiting the potentially significant shale gas deposits in Poland and other countries. Australia, which has significant deposits and much of the pre-existing infrastructure to begin extraction, could see its clout in the energy politics of the region increase– forcing a significant redraft of Canberra’s “Australia in the Asian Century” White Paper.

In effect, the “shale revolution” signals the end of the peak oil debate. New technology means new resources, which in turn could mean a new geopolitical map. However the mere presence of the resources doesn’t mean that their extraction in the short-term is viable, a problem China knows all too well.

China’s oil fields are drying up. The International Energy Agency’s (IAE) World Energy Outlook for 2010 predicts China will import 79% of its oil by 2030, a figure that demonstrates the pressing need for China to develop new energy sources. Enter shale gas and the “unconventionals.”

Estimates of China’s shale gas resources differ. China’s Ministry of Land and Resources estimates reserves of 886 trillion cubic feet (tcf), while the U.S. Energy Information Administration puts the country’s resources at 1,275 tcf. The upper estimates would mean China sits atop more shale gas than the U.S. and Canada combined. According to China’s 12th Five-Year Plan, by 2015 China should be extracting 6.5 billion cubic meters of shale gas per year, with a view of producing 100 billion cubic meters by 2020. China’s goal is to meet 10 percent of the country’s energy demands from shale gas the same year. To successfully meet the goal, China’s oil and gas industry needs to bridge its large knowledge deficit. Despite some progress, recent successes in domestic extraction technology have been modest.

Under the Shale Gas Development Plan for 2011-2015, shale gas has been labeled by the Ministry of Land and Resources as a separate mineral from conventional hydrocarbons. This move frees shale resources from the clutches of “the big three;” Chinese state-owned majors – China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) – allowing Beijing to redistribute exploration contracts. Importantly, the move encourages competition among state-owned majors, local enterprises and foreign companies.

China’s NOCs, while not state-run, benefit from state financing. Their capital flows during the global downturn in 2008 gave them the flexibility to expand globally. For China’s NOCs, establishing partnerships with other international oil companies allows them to diversify risks and gain technical know-how through the supply chain.

At home and abroad China is making waves. The opening of a recent tender to foreign companies demonstrates the extent to which the often go-it-alone Chinese Communist Party feels it needs to secure a rapid and successful energy boom. Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and British Petroleum are all jointly surveying the key provinces of Sichuan and Guizhou with local companies. As part of the new tender, other joint ventures are expected to follow.

Flush with state financing, China’s NOCs have in recent years begun buying up stakes in North American energy companies and their subsidiaries. Some of their recent buy-ins have been the purchase of Nexen and a stake in Devon Energy Corp, one of the founders of shale gas extraction. Such purchases allow China’s NOCs to absorb expertise. While this in itself isn’t enough to meet their energy needs, it is a step toward building capacity for China’s NOCs in shale gas exploration and extraction.

China’s NOCs have been known to employ a “market-for-resources strategy,” whereby access to China’s market is granted to a resource holder in exchange for imports of resources from that country. This now looks to be morphing into a “market-for-know-how strategy.” In the early stages of coal bed methane exploration in China, foreign groups contributed 70 percent of the funding. With already significant foreign involvement, the shale gas industry looks set to emulate this model.

However, the all-important extraction process of shale gas, hydraulic fracturing, just as its name suggests, needs water – and large amounts of it. So while shale could provide energy, it will require large volumes of water that will be costly both to consume and to recycle. Water scarcity remains a key concern for the Chinese government, while water pollution is an increasing worry for the Chinese public. One recent report noted that already “up to 40 percent of China’s rivers were seriously polluted” and “20 percent were so polluted their water quality was rated too toxic even to come into contact with.”

Experts warn that China will face growing water shortages in coming years. Water-intensive industries such as mining are competing for increasingly scarce water sources. Low rainfall in the northwest of the country, where much of the shale is believed to be, means these areas will have to rely on limited and finite groundwater. In the face of these shortages, China established a special 25 million USD fund for a cloud seeding program in 2012 to operate in “areas prone to drought and haze.” Water can be transported into China’s northwest via pipeline but that would be costly and require significant new infrastructure, such as desalination plants and pipelines that would likely need to stretch across the country for thousands of kilometers – a similar feat to the 4,200 km Xijiang to Shanghai gas pipeline.

Shale gas has approximately half the carbon content of coal. For China, the replacement of coal for gas in power generation could reduce emissions and pollution. It would kill two birds with one big stone, as criticism grows over the country’s pollution levels both in air and water. However, some warn that shale gas may also reduce investment in renewable energy sources.

In the U.S., environmental concerns dominate the debate. Public concern over water contamination and the release of harmful gases during shale gas extraction are gaining increasing media attention. This has been exacerbated by claims that research commissioned by industry-friendly lobby groups in the U.S., such as the American Petroleum Institute and the American Natural Gas Alliance, have muddied the water on the environmental impact of shale gas extraction. However, according to an IAE report, Golden Rules for a Golden Age of Gas, the environmental risks inherent in the process can be easily mitigated. The report outlines the “golden rules” required to address the environmental and social impact of developments in unconventional gas. It predicts that major risks can be decreased and safety improved if the cost of drilling and completing of a shale gas well is increased by 7 percent.

A dozen or more chemicals may be added to the water and sand pumped into a shale-gas well, including radioactive tracers that help assess the formation and relevant fractures. While these tracers are strictly monitored under guidelines handed down by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the U.S., in China the regulations may be less stringent. In addition, other radioactive material may be dislodged in the fracking process and may have to be disposed of from flowback water.

If strict regulations are not in place to seal the well from leaching, aquifers and ground water may become contaminated by run-off chemicals, methane or radioactive minerals displaced in the process. A 2011 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report suggests that fracking may have resulted in the contamination of ground water.

Recent and successful protests in China to stop the construction of a chemical plant in Ningbo demonstrate growing public concern about some government-backed developments. The October 2012 protests followed other victories to stop the construction of petrochemical plants in Xiamen and Dalian. In Dalian, some 10,000 protesters took to the streets. With a growing middle-class, increasing internet and social media access, and more public involvement and activism in key local concerns, the government and local authorities will likely have to be accommodating of public displeasure in order to maintain stability as China grows. A Tiananmen-style alternative appears unlikely as it could backfire, both at home and abroad.

If the current hype proves correct and gas prices remain strong, China’s shale gas could be just the energy boom that Beijing seeks. It could allow China to meet its ambitious growth targets. As many commentators have suggested, however, shale gas may prove less of a blessing and more of a “resource curse,” spelling environmental disaster and nationwide instability. Either way, as Sino-American partnerships are forged and shale gas extraction in China ventures into unchartered waters, one thing is certain: The world will be watching.

1769,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Indonesian Professor Warns Against Attempts To 'Make West Sumatra Implement Sharia' Law - Christianity Daily,http://www.christianitydaily.com/articles/11310/20210329/indonesian-professor-warns-against-attempts-to-make-west-sumatra-implement-sharia-law.htm,"In an event last week organized by the Ugla Mentawai Simariuriu Foundation, in collaboration with IMMJ and several alliances of Mentawai Youth/Student Organizations, respected professor Ade Armando from the University of Indonesia warns that there could be hidden motives behind the proposition to turn West Sumatra Province into the Special Region of Minangkabau.

In his webinar titled, ""Discourse of MINANGKABAU SPECIAL REGIONS, Threats or Blessings?"" Professor Armando laid his suspicion on the proposed separation and autonomy of a new province in West Sumatra. He thinks that those advocating for it are ""from the radical Islamic circles...who want to make West Sumatra like Aceh, an autonomous region that implements Sharia law,"" the International Christian Concern reported.

The professor argued that these radical Islamists are following a narrative that will subject Minangkabau ethnicity under the Sharia law according to what they believe from the Book of Allah, hence the proposed name, ""Special Region of Minangkabau"" instead of ""Special Region of West Sumatra.""

Armando's conjecture isn't groundless as seen in the enforcement of Sharia law in schools in Padang City where teachers obliged their non-Muslim students to wear the hijab. Women in regions under the Islamic law will be vulnerable to such discriminatory regulations and other future policies. He and other speakers from last week's workshop are urging people native to the Sumatra region to oppose the proposition by speaking up and by doing everything they can to stop its implementation.

Juniator Tulius, an anthropologist from Mentawai, also surmises that if given consideration, the proposed MINANGKABAU SPECIAL AREA would discount the principle of a peaceful co-existence among diverse groups. Its regional effect including the future treatment of women and religious minorities could have far-reaching impacts at a national level.

""We remain alert to all developments in the West Sumatra region. A lot of information will appear in the media that we need to monitor to what extent there is an attempt to legalize it as a MINANGKABAU SPECIAL REGION,"" he said.

Fortunately, the critical discourse analysis on the possible expansion of the Sharia Regional Regulations in West Sumatra concludes that a proposition grant will affect the quality of democracy in West Sumatra.

""For most scholars and experts in Indonesia, the presence of religious-based regional regulations is claimed to be one of the sources of fertilizing the seeds of intolerance at the provincial level. As the second most productive region to produce Sharia regional regulations in Indonesia, the position of the province of West Sumatra is like a fire in the husk which over time will create a greater potential for conflict,"" the study said.

Religious reasons aside, the threat of terrorism is also felt in the island of Sumatra. ICC reports that from March 19 to March 21, the Densus 88 Anti-terror unit in Indonesia had arrested 18 suspected terrorists in North Sumatra in a silent operation.

The unit seized several items as evidence of their propaganda including 31 charity boxes used in swindling the unsuspecting people to fund their unscrupulous activities.",2021-03-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['professor', 'minangkabau', 'warns', 'law', 'regulations', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', 'implement', 'region', 'sumatra', 'regional', 'attempts', 'sharia', 'special', 'west']",India,news article,English

Many don't have a house to go back to or have nothing left at their homes to feed their families. It is expected to take months before normalcy return to the state.

As people are struggling to survive, a politician is doing his bit to provide some relief to at least some of the flood victims.

Mrinal Saikia/ Facebook

Mrinal Saikia, the BJP MLA from Khumtai constituency has been leading a one-of-a-kind mission for the past couple of weeks.

Saikia is hitting the road with his customized vehicle which can be used as a 'mobile kitchen'. Since July 13, Saikia has been travelling to flood-affected places, where he cook hot meals for the flood victims on his mobile kitchen and often use small boats to distribute among the needy.

Mrinal Saikia/ Facebook

According to Saikia, he has already fed more than 15,000 people and has no plans to slow down. Speaking about him distributing cooked food, Saikia said he decided to do so as most of the people still had no means to cook the rice and daal at home.

Saikia who had done a similar served last year too said that he had prepared for the floods this year well in advance and had collected the relief materials.

Mrinal Saikia/ Facebook

It is not just rice and daal that Saikia has on his customized vehicle, it also has emergency medicines which is high in demand in the flood-affected regions, but are in short supply.

Another initiative that Saikia has undertaken is to distribute paddy sapling among rice farmers who lost their crop in the recent floods.

Seeing his dedicated work, more people including volunteers are joining Saikia's mission to help the needy.

In Quebec, the official numbers provided by public security officials remained largely the same Friday as they were Wednesday, with more than 7,000 homes reported flooded, 4,000 properties isolated, and some 10,000 unable to return home due to flooding across the province.

In the nation’s capital, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said he didn’t expect a second wave of flooding for Ottawa and Gatineau. It’s the second bout of major spring flooding in three years in the area, and in 2017 the worst damage was caused by a second round of floods.

Meanwhile, the Canadian Red Cross will disperse $600 in emergency funds to affected homeowners to pay for food, essential supplies, clothing, or a temporary place to stay, at a cost of between $4-million and $6-million. Mr. Goodale announced a grant to provide $2.5-million of that amount.

The town of Bracebridge, Ont., in the heart of the province’s cottage country, said water levels in the Muskoka River are receding, but are still higher than normal.

Health and safety inspection teams fanned out across flood-affected regions of New Brunswick Friday, assessing homes and businesses that are still drying out amid receding floodwaters.

In Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, northwest of Montreal, some of the 6,000 residents ordered to leave after a dike broke on Saturday returned to houses filled with mud-covered detritus and plates of food abandoned during rushed evacuations.

In all, more than 10,000 people remained out of their homes in Quebec on Wednesday, and 7,000 residences were flooded.

Water levels in the corridor along the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers between Montreal and the boundary with Ontario threatened residents all week, but appear to have stabilized for the time being.

In Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Que., about halfway between Montreal and Ottawa, residents were allowed to return home after Hydro-Quebec confirmed the structural integrity of a dam.

An overview of April’s weather helps explain how spring spawned a flooding disaster for several communities from Ottawa to Montreal.

A snowy winter with below-average temperatures meant about twice the normal average amount of snow was still on the ground in mid-April, according to Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin.

Then, temperatures began to warm, remaining above freezing day and night.

Finally, rain was falling every two or three days by mid-month. Montreal alone had 128 mm in April, while it usually gets 82 mm.

“We had ideal conditions for a catastrophe,” Mr. Cantin said.

Political response

Last Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians must talk about how and where to rebuild after floods, and he did not close the door on using federal dollars to help relocate communities facing the recurring threat of severe flooding.

“Once we secure the situation through this spring flooding season, we will have to have significant reflections and conversations on how we move forward,” he said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Quebec Premier François Legault has said the government will offer homeowners $200,000 to abandon homes that flood year after year, after capping flood relief compensation at $100,000 starting this year.

New Brunswick

Communities from Fredericton to Saint John were flooded in the second half of April, forcing nearly 1,000 people to evacuate their homes and more than 400 to stay in temporary hotel accommodations provided by the Canadian Red Cross.

Officials said about 70 per cent of the roughly 940 people seeking help from the Red Cross this year also registered for assistance a year ago.

Among 84 closed roads across the province was a stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway between Oromocto and River Glade. Everyone from community volunteers to federal officials and Canadian Armed Forces pitched in to help – even federal fisheries officers were aiding evacuation efforts in Fredericton, Quispamsis and St. George.

“Minor seasonal flooding has always been a way of life in New Brunswick’s southern riverside communities,” The Globe and Mail’s Atlantic bureau chief Jessica Leeder writes. “But when this year’s flood levels began contending with the highs seen in 2018 – a flood billed then as historically destructive – many began wondering how many more years like this they can endure.”

Political response

The province rolled out a disaster financial assistance program Friday, announcing that affected property owners could receive a maximum of $160,000 for structural repairs to private residences, and up to $500,000 for small businesses and non-profit organizations.

The program is not available for those with damaged cottages and recreational properties.

“Together, we made major efforts to plan for, prepare for and respond to the flood,” said Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart. “Residents, volunteers, first responders and the military worked to protect lives and property. Despite that work there was damage.”

Mr. Urquhart said the province was committed to coming up with a better long-term plan to deal with the impact of spring flooding.

Premier Blaine Higgs told reporters during a tour of affected areas that with two floods in as many years, it’s clear climate change is changing flooding frequency, and his new Tory government will take this into account in future planning.

Along with Quebec, Ontario welcomed the help of 2,300 Canadian Forces troops in the past week: filling sandbags, building barriers, checking on waterlogged homes and evacuating residents. That compared to 2,200 deployed outside the country.

Many roads in the Bracebridge area, in Ontario’s cottage country, were washed out by floodwaters as two nearby lakes had water levels that exceed those last seen during serious flooding in 2013.

Kashechewan First Nation has been evacuated, as its more than 2,500 members have been flown to other locations across the province and its leaders continue to call for a permanent relocation.

Political response

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he believes climate change is among the reasons Ontario homeowners are being forced to deal with flooding for the second time in three years.

The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing has activated a disaster recovery assistance program to the Ontario communities of Renfrew County, Pembrooke, Bracebridge and Huntsville.

The program applies to primary residences (though not cottages) and their basic contents, as well as to small businesses, farms and not-for-profit organizations.

The long view

Believing that climate change is the lone issue at play means that we risk missing a major part of the story – and the solution, argues Les Stanfield.

When it comes to facing the risks of large-scale disasters, Wency Leung reports, many people have a hard time envisioning – let alone preparing for – worst-case scenarios.

If floods and forest fires and other calamities can forge a political consensus on the need to combat climate change, then that’s progress, writes John Ibbitson.

There are more floods than ever before, and yet our behaviour toward them in the 21st century is just as irrational as that of our pagan ancestors, who considered them a punishment from a vengeful God, wrote Ian Brown in the aftermath of the floods Hurricane Harvey unleashed on Houston in 2017.

The discourse of flood recovery has to turn to getting those in the immediate flood plain permanently out of harm’s way, writes Glenn McGillivray, managing director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss and Reduction. He is advocating for governments to buy out landowners located on floodplains.

Inadequacies in the mapping of coastal areas are hindering Canadians’ efforts to protect themselves from flood disaster, The Globe’s Matthew McClearn learns.

Engineers and the scientific community need to move more swiftly to design infrastructure that accounts for climate change science, according to one expert.

The recent widespread flooding from heavy rainfall which hit the provinces of South and East Kalimantan have caused concern among many, with some environmentalists attributing the disaster to the expansion of oil palm plantations.

What is the actual root of the problem? Is it possible for oil palm growers to participate in environmental conservation to reduce potential flood risks? If so, how?

While acknowledging the devastating consequences of the flooding disaster on communities in the two provinces, as well as other areas across Indonesia, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) says that large-scale land use conversion is one factor that contributes to increasing severity of floods.

“This may include deforestation, destruction of floodplains, and construction of flood dams and drainage channels,” says Tiur Rumondang, RSPO Assurance Director.

Research by the World Resource Institute (WRI) Indonesia has found that the factors most commonly responsible for flooding in Indonesia are tree cover loss, excessive rainfall and topographical conditions.

A separate report by the emergency response team of the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) indicates excessive rainfall as the major cause of flooding disasters. It also adds that land use conversion in the past decade could be a contributing factor, noting a decline in primary and secondary forests, rice fields and shrub groves in 2010-2020.

“Palm oil produced in an unsustainable way can lead to the widespread destruction of tropical forests,” Tiur asserts, adding that excessive rainfall can affect oil palm production.

“Oil palm trees are capable of withstanding temporary flooding, but waterlogged conditions can damage plantations,” she says.

Tiur explains that the RSPO’s sustainability principles, which all members must adhere to in operating their oil palm plantations, can protect the environment and can also contribute to reducing flood risk.

As enshrined in the 2018 RSPO Principles and Criteria (P&C), multistakeholder non-profit emphasises the importance of “Ecosystem Preservation as a Pillar to establish Co-existence between Palm Oil and Environment”.

The preservation of ecosystems and their essential services is a core tenet of the RSPO P&C 2018 standards, says Tiur.

“These are organised into three impact areas, Prosperity, People, Planet, each with their own set of principles.

“Under Planet, Principle 7 sets out the commitment to protect, conserve and enhance ecosystems and the environment. This means our members are responsible for protecting the environment, conserving biodiversity and ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources,” she explains.

She further elaborates: “It includes criteria around preventing the degradation of soil, using topographic information to guide the planning of drainage and irrigation systems, and ensuring that land clearing does not cause deforestation. All of which are important in mitigating flood risk.”

Since the first P&C was adopted in November 2007, the standards have been reviewed every five years and the latest iteration was adopted in 2018.

Tiur says that RSPO can help to reduce flood risk by addressing the first factor: tree cover loss.

“Under the RSPO P&C 2018, all our members [certified or not] have committed to a total ban on deforestation,” she says. “This prohibits the conversion of tropical rainforests for oil palm plantations and ensures that land clearing doesn’t cause deforestation. This is why we take our responsibility to monitor members’ commitment to the P&C 2018 very seriously.”

The RSPO has worked continuously over the past 10 years to develop a set of standards that ensure the sustainable production of palm oil, she underlines.

According to Tiur, the P&C 2018 includes a total ban on deforestation and requires oil palm growers to protect and conserve High Conservation Value (HCV) areas, High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests and rare, threatened or endangered (RTE) species.

“To ensure the responsible development of new land for oil palm cultivation, we introduced the New Planting Procedure in 2009. This framework was further updated in 2015 to include a set of assessments and verification activities to be conducted by growers and certification bodies before any new oil palm development commences.

“These are designed to ensure that oil palm plantings do not negatively affect primary forests, HCV areas, HCS areas, fragile and marginal soil, or people’s land,” she says.

Strict verification process

Meanwhile, RSPO Indonesia Assurance Manager, Djaka Riksanto explains that palm oil producers members of the RSPO are certified through a strict verification process by accredited certification bodies. Further, he says that “this certification can be withdrawn at any time in case of infringement of the rules and standards”.

According to Djaka, grower members are assessed annually for continued compliance.

“To ensure the credibility of the sustainability claim at the end of the supply chain, all organisations that take legal ownership and physically handle RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil products need to be supply chain certified,” he says.

“For our smallholder members, we have designed the RSPO Independent Smallholder Standard to support [them] towards certification. This seeks to increase the inclusion of smallholders into the RSPO system through a mechanism which takes into consideration the diversity in challenges and situations faced by smallholders,” Djaka adds.

According to Tiur, the RSPO will continue to address the environmental challenges associated with unsustainable palm oil production that require urgent collective action, like flooding.

“Every stakeholder in the palm oil supply chain – from growers to investors to manufacturers to consumers – has a shared responsibility to ensure that palm oil production does not harm our environment or local communities,” she says. “In this respect, RSPO continues to strengthen its commitment to transparency and accountability.”

Djaka adds that since 2013, all RSPO grower members, certified or not, have been required to submit concession maps. However, to respect the decision by the Government of Indonesia that considers such information as Government own legal documents and not to make it public by foreign organisation such as RSPO, we exclude this information from our map platform GeoRSPO. The Government of Indonesia also stated that they are in a process to create a data protocol to allow future transparency and we are still waiting for such further actions.",2021-03-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['ensure', 'members', 'pc', 'risk', 'reduce', 'indonesia', 'flood', 'flooding', 'oil', 'rspo', 'land', 'palm', 'plantations']",India,news article,English
966,Drought Sri Lanka,Fr. Tissa Balasuriya: a loving and gentle rebel - National Catholic Reporter,https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/fr-tissa-balasuriya-loving-and-gentle-rebel,"Colombo, Sri Lanka — Oblate Fr. Tissa Balasuriya, a noted theologian, economist and human rights activist, died Jan. 17 in Sri Lanka. He was 89.



He founded the Centre for Society and Religion in Colombo in 1971 with the aim of fostering interreligious and interracial action for justice and peace. He was also instrumental in founding the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians in the mid-1970s.



The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith began a doctrinal investigation of Balasuriya because of statements he made about Mary, original sin, Christ's redemptive role, revelation, and papal authority in his book Mary and Human Liberation, published in English in 1990. He was excommunicated in January 1997, accused of propagating ideas contrary to the Catholic faith.



A year later, Balasuriya signed a ""Statement of Reconciliation"" and the excommunication was lifted.



Balasuriya was a frequent contributor to NCR. His last article, a critique of Pope Benedict XVI's third encyclical Caritas in Veritate (""Charity in Truth""), appeared in August 2009. He found it a ""valuable document, but has some missing dimensions. It does not analyze the way the modern world has been set up as an association of Christians with governments and colonial powers, especially from 1492 to 1945. The pope seems to overlook the inadequacies of the church in the course of history.""



Balasuriya has been called a radical and rebel within the Catholic church and society. He, like Jesus, never flinched from challenging the powerful -- in the government, multinational corporations or the church.



But what I remember most about Father Tissa is his love and his gentleness.



Though I had begun reading his works years before, I got to know Father Tissa personally in the 1990s. He took me to slums in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, and got me involved in conducting discussions on human rights in area schools. He invited me to a training course on organic farming in Kandy and made me part of theological discussions with leading Sri Lankan and other liberation theologians from across the world. He lived a simple life, with few personal belongings, and mostly traveled by bus and train.



In 2009, I was asked to present a paper on the Eucharist and armed conflict at a conference held in preparation for the plenary assembly of Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences. My thesis, that ""the Eucharist has to be related positively to human liberation if it is to be faithful to its origins,"" was drawn from Father Tissa's 1977 book Eucharist and Human Liberation.



Even when the Vatican, with active collaboration of local church leaders in Colombo, excommunicated him, he didn't speak angrily of those responsible. ""I feel more in communion with the real church and those oppressed"" was the sentiment I remember most in my conversations with him from that time.



As a teenager, I was a regular visitor to the Centre for Society and Religion. There I found critical material on church and society. From the center, we in the Young Christian Students Movement could borrow slides, videos, overhead projectors and other material and equipment. On one occasion, Father Tissa recommended a film on Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, who was killed because he condemned the military dictatorship in his country. I had never heard of Romero or the film, but took Father Tissa's advice and showed it. It remains one of the most challenging and inspiring films I have ever watched. I have used it many times since in presentations to various groups.



A woman activist has told me that Father Tissa was among the few churchmen in the 1980s and 1990s who welcomed her and her young child. Long before Father Tissa wrote the book Mary and Human Liberation, he had been an advocate for women's rights in society and especially within the church.



In recent years, when my work as a human rights activist in Sri Lanka put me in certain danger, Father Tissa reached out, concerned for my safety. He invited me to stay with him for protection, saying, ""I have a very short time to live, but you have more years ahead of you, so be careful."" He never failed to reply to an email or return a phone call.



Some people close to Father Tissa found it difficult to work with him, and indeed had disagreements with some of his thinking. He was, after all, only human. But I also think that his vision and commitment were so idealistic and challenging that some found it difficult to keep up with him.



Father Tissa was and will remain one of my gurus -- someone who helped me to connect my faith to realities of oppression and injustices around me -- in Sri Lanka and beyond. I am among the many fortunate people Father Tissa mentored and inspired through his writings, his conferences and workshops, and personal conversations, but most importantly, in the simple way he lived and the love he radiated.

According to Tran Phuoc Anh, acting director of the citys Foreign Department, the sustainable flood prevention project for Thu Duc City would have a total investment of more than $1bn, and would be implemented as a publicprivate project with the participation of the Dutch government.

Le Hoa Binh, deputy chair of HCMC, said he hoped the Netherlands would help create a city that was sustainable and well adapted to climate change.

Elizabeth Akkerman, the Dutch ambassador to Vietnam, said her government would help HCMC and Thu Duc City with advanced construction technologies.

Thu Duc will be based on advanced industries such as autonomous manufacturing, and will include the university precinct in Thu Duc as well as a new-build urban area and financial centre on the Thu Thiem Peninsula.

Thu Duc is the most elevated area in HCMC, but still suffers from seasonal flooding, and its residents suffer from inundation of streets and even houses every time there is heavy rain or a high tide.

In May 2019, HCMC sent a delegation to the Netherlands to study its urban development and flood management methods, and a number of memorandums of understanding were subsequently signed, including a $1bn anti-flooding project in Thu Duc City.

1481,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Drone footage shows extent of flooding in Ontario cottage country as further rain looms - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-cottage-country-rainfall-warning-environment-canada-1.5116321,"Officials are warning communities in Ontario's cottage country that more devastating flooding could be on the way Wednesday as thousands of residents are ""fighting a pretty tough battle"" to save their homes.

Environment Canada issued a rainfall warning for the Muskoka Region on Tuesday, saying localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible. The alert covers Bracebridge and Huntsville, part of which are already under water as a result of surging lakes and rivers.

Here's what the flooding in Bracebridge looks like CBC News Toronto 0:58 Bracebridge is one of several Ontario cottage country communities that have declared an emergency over the last week due to record-breaking flood conditions. 0:58

Between 20 and 35 millimetres of rain could fall by Thursday morning, and that's in addition to a marginal amount of snow and ice pellets expected due to plummeting temperatures.

The ground, already saturated following days of heavy rains, has limited ability to absorb more water, the federal agency cautioned.

Water levels along rivers and lakes in Bracebridge have already climbed beyond heights seen during 2013 — the last time the community was hit by significant flooding that submerged numerous roads and properties.

Bracebridge Mayor Graydon Smith predicts the number of houses and seasonal properties inundated by the floods will ""easily exceed"" those in 2013.

During that time, about 1,092 permanent residences and some 1,020 seasonal properties were affected. Smith could not provide specific figures for the current flooding, but did say they're waiting for aerial support to catalogue the damage.

Worst believed to be over

Flows in the Muskoka River strengthened over the weekend, threatening homes and cottages along its banks.

The rapid rise of floodwaters, however, had started to subside Monday in the north branch of the Muskoka River, authorities said. Dry weather over the last few days offered a chance for conditions to stabilize somewhat.

Lake Muskoka has risen six centimetres in the last 24 hours, but authorities say the flooding situation there has begun to subside. (Lorenda Reddekopp/CBC)

At a news conference on Tuesday, Smith called the slowing of the water a relief, saying he believes the worst of the washout is over but water levels remain extremely high.

""It's expected right now that any amount of rain will raise Lake Muskoka a marginal amount, but because outflows are matching inflows at this point ... hopefully the impacts will be marginal,"" he said on Tuesday.

The north branch of the Muskoka River flows through the downtown core before it meets the south branch and drains into Lake Muskoka.

The rapid rise of water in the south branch and lake has crested. But water upstream filtering down along the bloated river is still causing headaches for nearby residents. Homes in this area have suffered the most, Smith said.

Flood conditions are expected to linger until the end of the week, he continued.

""We are hoping that we don't see as much rain as is forecast.""

4 communities under state of emergency

Bracebridge is one of several cottage country communities that have declared an emergency over the last week due to record-breaking flood conditions. The others include Huntsville, Minden Hills and Muskoka Lakes.

A group of reservists with the Canadian Armed Forces fanned out across Bracebridge on Sunday afternoon to fill and distribute sandbags, and help authorities traverse across water-laden roads that are currently impassable to most passenger vehicles.

Currently, some 100 troops are doing flood mitigation work in the town's hardest-hit areas that sit adjacent to the Muskoka River. Another 60 military personnel are expected to arrive this afternoon.

Reservists have helped fill some 45,000 sandbags and distribute them to vulnerable residents. (Fred Thornhill/Canadian Press)

Large swaths of the shoreline in the Beaumont Drive area, where the river funnels into the lake, have begun to disappear from erosion, Smith explained.

""We probably won't have a full scope of the changes that Mother Nature has decided to make in the river until the waters recede.""

Authorities have amassed roughly 45,000 sandbags for vulnerable residents to use to barricade their properties likely to be affected by more flooding.

""There is a concern that the ground water might swell again and we're trying to get sandbag walls up in front of people's houses to protect them in the event that the water levels rise,"" Lt.-Col. Graham Walsh said on Tuesday.

Officials in the neighbouring township of Muskoka Lakes advised residents near the Moon River on Monday to evacuate their homes voluntarily.

Water levels in the Moon River have climbed 16 centimetres in the past 24 hours.

Poor watershed management to blame

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry is responsible for controlling water levels in the lakes, and Muskoka Lakes Mayor Phil Harding blames poor management and negligence for allowing spring floodwaters to become dangerous.

""If the water levels are kept higher at times, the risk and chance of flooding is great,"" he said in an interview with CBC Radio's Ontario Morning.

The Muskoka Watershed Management Plan hasn't been updated since 2006 to reflect changing watershed conditions and climate change.

There have now been four major floods throughout the Muskoka Region since 2010.

After the devastating floods in 2013, Harding said communities in the area appealed to the province to revise the Muskoka River Water Management Plan.

""We identified some significant limitations within it and part of that is some physical choke points that water cannot move through the system fast enough,"" said Harding.

The previous Liberal government was slated to update the document in 2016, but instead extended the plan by five years.

Harding says he is looking to the Progressive Conservatives to ""step up and really help"" overhaul the region's flood management system.

Province cuts funding for flood programs

Ontario Natural Resources Minister John Yakabuski outlined measures the province has taken to combat spring flooding as a result of higher water levels. This included removing logs to improve water flow and drawing down lakes in the Muskoka Region.

""Every precaution was taken by officials,"" he told Ontario Morning.

""Once all the logs are removed there's nothing you can do to increase the rate of draw down. It's whatever nature will allow. You can only push down what the system below it will accept.""

Bracebridge declared a state of emergency last week, warning residents that the current situation is more than a typical spring thaw. (Jean-Francois Morissette/CBC)

Since he took office in November, Yakabuski says he has not received any requests to review the Muskoka River Water Management Plan.

""It's wonderful to think that this could have been prevented, but Mother Nature has quite frankly thrown us a huge curve this year,"" he said. ""Right now we're doing what we can to deal with the situation at hand.""

Last week, Premier Doug Ford said climate change is among the reasons that much of the province is under water.

The Ford government recently slashed funding for Ontario flood management programs in half when it delivered its first budget.

The decision has drawn sharp criticism from several politicians and environmentalists.

Conservation Ontario, which represents the province's 36 conservation authorities, has said the impacts of the cuts will be felt immediately, particularly in smaller and more rural communities.

At Queen's Park on Monday, Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner told reporters the move is short-sighted, when the province is experiencing stronger and more frequent flood events that are fuelled by climate change.

The premier surveyed flooded areas in Ottawa last week. Ford, whose family has a cottage near Bracebridge, vowed the province will do everything it can to support communities in the Muskoka Region. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

Meanwhile, Official Opposition Leader Andrea Horwath said she fears Ontario communities will increasingly face flooding problems as a result of the cuts. She said the conservation authorities will no longer have the tools to develop or keep up with climate change.

""You can't say that you agree that climate change exists and then take away flood management planning capacity for municipalities, and take away the 50 million tree plan, and take away the things that actually help us to mitigate the climate change results,"" she said on Monday.

""It makes no sense whatsoever... We're going from bad to worse when it comes to climate change.""

The government is insisting the decision will not hamper flood management efforts because conservation authorities receive other sources of money.

Unprecedented heavy flooding in South Sudan’s Maban County has affected nearly 200,000 people, including refugees and host population.

Situated in the Upper Nile State, the affected area is home to more than 150,000 refugees from Sudan.

South Sudan is on a gradual path to recovery from six years of civil war and now faces flooding that the region has not witnessed in almost four decades.

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, working with its partners and the local authorities is rushing emergency support. People are seeking safety from the flood waters wherever they find dry land, mostly on small islands as unprecedented water levels have submerged vast areas.

The area, near Maban’s capital town of Bunj, is prone to flooding this time of year because of heavy seasonal rains. However, flooding rivers in South Sudan come from the highlands in the neighbouring Ethiopia, where rainfall is becoming more intense and irregular, is also carving its way through neighborhoods in broad, swift rivers.

The most recent precipitation data for west Ethiopia shows above average rainfall over the past 90 days, increasing markedly since late September. The data indicates that over the last 30 days, over 230 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall has fallen there, with an estimated 425 mm falling compared with the average just less than 200 mm. This is more than double the average rainfall in the past four weeks.

The affected population is in dire need of humanitarian assistance. People have fled their homes, carrying their belongings and seen gathering together on little islands of dry ground. Flood waters have submerged major roads, making access to the refugee camps difficult for humanitarians. Schools in the region also remain closed.

The floods have also impacted access to public services, including hospitals and damaged sanitation facilities– increasing health risks. We remain concerned that the flooding may increase the risks and spread of diseases. South Sudan was recently declared cholera free last year with the fears that the deadly disease could make a comeback.

Emergency shelter, food, water and sanitation remain the main needs for refugees and locals. As an immediate response, UNHCR has pre-positioned emergency shelter kits and material assistance to help more than 5,000 affected families/some 25,000 people to rebuild and repair damaged shelter, but more support is needed.

Currently, South Sudan hosts almost 300,000 refugees mainly from Sudan’s Blue Nile and South Kordofan. An additional nearly 1.5 million are internally displaced inside the country.

MABAN COUNTY, South Sudan, November 8 (UNHCR) - Aneim has just reached South Sudan's newest refugee camp, Gendrassa, after fleeing a devastating mid-October air attack on his village across the border in Sudan's Blue Nile state.

For UNHCR, the arrival of the livestock farmer and his extended family of 11 people was a further sign that floodwaters are receding and people are once again making the journey to safety in South Sudan's Upper Nile state following attacks on their villages. The refugee agency is, accordingly, taking preemptive measures to cope with a likely accelerated influx.

In the last week of October, UNHCR staff registered 72 new arrivals in Gendrassa, mostly women and children. Although small, this was the highest weekly arrival figure since the rainy season began in May and indicated that the numbers were starting to rise with the changing weather pattern. Before, the flooding was simply too deep to cross, but the most desperate are now chancing their luck as the waters start falling.

Mireille Girard, UNHCR's representative in South Sudan, said that many more refugees were likely to cross the border if fighting between the Sudanese armed forces and the Sudan People's Liberation Army-North escalated during the coming dry season, which begins in mid-November. Food shortages would also be a push factor.

She said that UNHCR had started preparing a contingency plan to meet the most pressing needs of up to 30,000 new refugee arrivals in Maban County between now and the end of the year. It covers key areas such as shelter, health care, food rations and non-food items such as plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, hygiene sets and kitchen items.

UNHCR currently works in four refugee camps in Upper Nile state's Maban County, including Gendrassa, which hosts some 14,300 refugees and is the only one that has not yet reached full capacity. It has room for another 5,000 refugees. Girard said the refugee agency was in negotiations with the local authorities to open new transit centres and camps in other counties.

The only potential new camp site under consideration in Maban County is located at a 400-hectare site and could host between 20,000 and 30,000 refugees. Other locations under consideration, all outside Maban, are Melut, Beneshowa and Longichok.

Unlike the other camps in Maban, the proposed new site sits on a base of pebbles, soil and clay, which makes it easier to instal drainage systems for washing areas and latrines. It is also in an area of shrubs, grassland and trees that can be used for construction and firewood, but this needs to be carefully managed to avoid friction with host communities and to protect natural resources and the environment.

Harmony is vital and UNHCR and other aid groups have established forums where refugees and host communities are being engaged in initiatives to avert or resolve differences over land, resources and even the livestock that refugees bring with them and which graze on community land. Locals in this very remote and undeveloped area of South Sudan have been told that they will be able to access facilities in the new camp such as schools and health centres and possibly find employment.

If given the go ahead, UNHCR experts will search for underground water sources. In addition, water will be trucked to the proposed new site from a well situated 12 kilometres away from Gendrassa.

UNHCR has, meanwhile, stepped up border monitoring activities at several entry points. In the contingency planning, new transit centres may be established near border entry points. People will stay at these sites until they can be transported on to a camp.

The refugee agency has also embarked on an exercise to clear the backlog of people waiting to be registered as refugees. This will allow UNHCR's registration and protection staff to devote their time to any major new influx in the coming months.

A key UNHCR partner, the World Food Programme, is also preparing for the future. WFP has pre-positioned food for 15,000 new arrivals in Jamam camp, which is scheduled to become a transit centre. Extra stocks of corn soya blend have been pre-positioned to meet the nutritional requirements of infants and young children with moderate to acute malnutrition.

The farmer Aneim believes UNHCR is doing the right thing, predicting that refugees will soon start streaming across the border into Maban County from their hiding places in the mountains and forests of Blue Nile state.

""They are suffering terribly. But here they will sleep the night without worrying about exploding bombs,"" he asserted. ""Even if you have lost everything - as I have - this camp has given me the opportunity and the confidence to begin my life again.""

1541,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Nile water levels continue to decline in Sudan after devastating floods: Ministry - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online,https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/383399/Egypt/Politics-/Nile-water-levels-continue-to-decline-in-Sudan-aft.aspx,"The Nile water levels in most of areas in Sudan continue to decline, but the Khartoum-Shendi sector still records its highest level, said floods committee of the Ministry of Water Resources on Friday, as Sudan had been hit by deadly floods, but water started to recede.

Sudan floods, due to heavy rains especially in neighbouring Ethiopia, caused the Nile level to rise to an unprecedented level since 1912, according to Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. Dozens of people were killed and hundreds of thousands others were displaced.

Authorities have declared a three-month emergency state and have designated the country a natural disaster zone.

Blue Nile water flow at Deim water station, which borders Ethiopia, will be around 590 million cubic metres on Saturday, the committee said, down from 595 million on Thursday, 600 million on Wednesday and 985million on September 2.

For the Nile state of Atbara, water flow will be around 155 million cubic metres, up from 125 million on Thursday, 150 million on Wednesday. The peak in Atbara River reached a peak of 450 million cubic metres, state’s news agency SUNA reported, citing Executive Director or Dams Rehabilitation, Mutasim Al-Awad as saying.

On Friday, water levels recorded 17.37 metres and is expected to remain the same on Saturday. Water levels are expected to drop in northern water stations on Saturday, to record 15.55 metres in Atbara down from 15.74 metres on Friday and 14.91 in Dongola down from 14.98.

The floods committee called on citizens and relevant authorities to remain cautious.

Sudan’s usual rain season takes place annually between June and October. Water levels in the White Nile rise from spring to May and in the Blue Nile from July to September. This year, the equatorial sources of the River Nile, prime among which is Lake Victoria, shared by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, witnessed torrential rains that contributed to the increased water level in the White Nile.

Less than two months later, Ethiopia’s Lake Tana, source of the Blue Nile, saw heavy rains, especially in August, increasing the water levels of the Blue Nile to a record 17.67 metres on 7 September.

Egypt has been on high alert due to floods in Sudan, expecting a higher-than-average annual Nile flood. The Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources have continued to remove building violations on Nile waterways to allow water networks to contain excess water, but has reassured citizens that the Aswan Dam in Upper Egypt, as well as barrages on the northern branches of the Nile River, will help contain water.

Much of that experience in recent years has focused on leveraging advances in digital technology to increase different aspects of resilience. Examples below cover shared datasets and maps in Bangladesh, drones and mobile devices in Tanzania, and digital representations of vulnerable shorelines and population centers in the Marshall Islands. Collectively, these tools increase the power of decision-makers to chart a better future in the face of increasingly challenging climatic conditions.

Mapping and assessing vulnerable areas in Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, one of the climate vulnerable countries in the world, cyclones over the Bay of Bengal have already increased in frequency and are projected to become more intense. Mapping vulnerable areas using Geographic Information System (GIS) and making datasets available across agencies is leading to better informed decision-making.

While location data and maps were held previously by individual, non-networked agencies, they are now available for cross-referencing on a platform called GeoDASH, supported by GFDRR and transferred to the Bangladesh Computer Council in December 2015. As of April 2021, over 3,700 users representing 55 public, private, and civil society organizations have shared data, making available 740 datasets from road network maps and building footprints to the location of water, gas, and utilities in a secure platform. All of these datasets are available to the public in a widely usable format.

The platform has been used by the Directorate of Primary Education of Bangladesh to assess 35,000 schools with respect to the type of infrastructure, water and sanitation facilities, access to roads, and overall capacity during natural disasters. Bangladesh’s Local Government Engineering Department used geospatial layers to produce cyclone risk maps that will guide investment plans for cyclone shelters in both urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. GeoDASH was also instrumental in the design of the first phase of the IDA and CIF-funded Coastal Embankment Improvement Project, a project focused on improving 10 vulnerable coastal polders of Bangladesh with coastal embankments, hydraulic structures and protective works. And geospatial data analysis supported by the platform informs the ongoing Urban Resilience Project that is strengthening the capacity of government agencies to respond to emergency events and reduce the vulnerability of future building constructions to disasters in the cities of Dhaka and Sylhet.",2021-04-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['countries', 'available', 'project', 'world', 'deploying', 'lowincome', 'coastal', 'used', 'change', 'bangladesh', 'datasets', 'maps', 'vulnerable', 'climate', 'platform', 'withstand', 'tools', 'digital']",Kenya,news article,English
1697,FL-2021-000021-IND,Uttarakhand glacier burst: Five reasons that triggered the tragedy - Zee News,https://zeenews.india.com/india/uttarakhand-glacier-burst-five-reasons-that-triggered-the-tragedy-2340454.html,"The rescue operations for the tragic glacier burst which killed 11 and triggered massive flooding in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda Rivers causing grave damage to houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project is still underway. Reportedly, over 203 people went missing after the tragedy.

As per the latest reports, the rescue teams have been conducting non-stop operations and have rescued 15 people from the first tunnel using heavy machinery, near Tapovan in Chamoli, whereas rescue operations for the second tunnel is still going on.

While talking to Zee News, environmentalist Anil Joshi and Anand Arya explained what could possibly be the five reasons for this tragic disaster.

Eco-sensitiveness: The authorities have been executing numerous projects one after the other without properly assessing the impact on the Himalayan range.

“Any area has an eco-sensitiveness and we are exploiting its limit. This disaster was a triggered one. I believe that the current government hasn’t been showing enough sensitivity towards nature. The environmentalists, who have been voicing their concerns to the government against such large projects, have never been taken seriously,” Anand Arya, environmentalist.

Environmental assessment: Another reason behind such tragedy is not following environmental assessment properly. Environmentalist Anil Joshi raised an important question, Till when is our country going to rely upon such large dams to fulfill the upcoming needs.

There are other means to live as well but we are not properly assessing it, he stated. We are relying upon hydropower more than any other form of energy because of its cost efficiency and reliability. But we are missing out to evaluate the risk factor involved in the construction of dams this size, he added.

Critical Thinking: Environmentalist Anil Joshi pinpointed the gravest mistake of all. He pointed out that our authorities haven't been considering all the options before making a decision on such big projects.

He went on to explain that countries like Switzerland have been making smaller dams along with the natural grid which is much safer in approach. Moreover, creating smaller dams can generate more employment in the country as well.

Change in law: The authorities changed the existing law and divided it into numerous subparts, resulting in exploitation. The new law requires an environmental assessment of only projects which are larger than 100 km.

Many have been exploiting this loophole by constructing projects which are under 99 km. One needs to understand that the impact will be as grave as the 100 km one, explained Anand Arya.

Lesson from previous mistakes: This incident was similar to the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy. Even after the 2013 tragedy took such a huge toll on people’s lives, the authorities failed to look into the steadiness of the other dams. The glacier was a result of late snowfall in February and didn’t get enough time to freeze. So one can say another reason behind the tragedy was that the dam was too close to the glacier area, explained Anil Joshi.

“You disrespected nature and it had repercussions. Ecology and economy go hand in hand. We need to understand that,” said Anil Joshi.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of those who lost their lives due to the glacial burst. Additionally, the PMO has announced Rs 50,000 to those seriously injured.

He delivered firsthand knowledge of this “powerful threat to our planet and to humanity” by recalling the aftermath of the “two extremely severe tropical cyclones” that devastated vast regions of the country earlier this year.

Cyclones Idai and Kenneth not only took 689 lives, but also destroyed “the economic and social fabric in the Central and Northern regions of our country”, he said, adding that the South continues to suffer from the effects of drought and last year’s Cyclone Dindo.

The Foreign Minister reiterated Mozambique’s gratitude to the UN for its multifaceted support and expressed solidarity with the victims of Hurricane Dorian, which devastated the Bahamas just weeks ago.

Noting that natural climate-driven disasters have become recurrent phenomena, Mr. Pacheco affirmed Mozambique’s commitment to strengthening adaptation and resilience measures under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

Other actions Mozambique has undertaken include strengthening early warning systems and mapping vulnerable areas to prevent natural disasters and mitigate their effects.

With respect to rural development, biodiversity, ecosystems and natural resources, the Foreign Minister said Mozambique created conservation areas covering approximately 25 per cent of its national territory.

“These actions are reinforced by the continued increase of the use of cleaner and renewable energy, based on natural gas, wind, solar, and hydropower, to provide ‘Energy for All’ to our citizens by 2030”, he maintained.

Complex development challenges

According to Foreign Minister Pacheco, “low income; reduced access to education, health, food, water and sanitation; and inadequate socio-economic infrastructures” are all obstacles hindering the development of Sub-Saharan Africa.

Moreover, the prevalence of actions linked to fundamentalism, violent extremism, arms proliferation “are causes of added concern”, he said.

The Foreign Minister noted that to “drive our eagerly desired sustainable development”, his country has incorporated the 2030 Agenda into its national governance programme, giving priority to agribusiness, economic and social infrastructure networks, expanded electric grid coverage and ecotourism.

Moreover, Mozambique is focusing on “protecting and respecting human rights, promoting gender equality and equity, as well as capacity development women, youth and other vulnerable social groups”, according Mr. Pacheco.

Turning to teh country's peace agenda, the Foreign Minister lauded the successes of Mozambique’s internal dialogues, but cautioned that they were “shaded by bad actors” in the North who continue to raise concerns as they “spread death and destruction of the socio-economic fabric, and create instability in areas of that region”.

“The Government has vigorously carried out our constitutional duties to protect our citizens and their property, as well as economic and social infrastructures”, said Mr. Pacheco, adding that the fiscal and monetary reforms underway “have led to an effective recovery of our macroeconomic stability”.

He concluded by reaffirming Mozambique’s trust in the UN as “a privileged platform for multilateral coordination in the search for solutions to the common challenges facing humanity”.",2019-09-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['warmings', 'mozambique', 'mozambiques', 'foreign', 'global', 'nefarious', 'cyclones', 'minister', 'natural', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'development', 'country', 'vulnerable', 'social', 'warns', 'address', 'pacheco', 'recovering']",Mozambique,news article,English

Actress/singer Rene Liu at her first interview after marriage. Jiang Dong / China Daily

Taiwan actress/singer Rene Liu jokes about her hairstyle in her latest film Love in Space, a romantic comedy to be released on Sept 9, calling the small buns ""bullshit"".

Acclaimed for her 18 albums, four books, and award-winning performances in hit films, such as Feng Xiaogang's A World without Thieves and Sylvia Chang's Siao Yu, Liu is usually portrayed as smart and elegant, but proved she is also funny, in her first interview after marrying on Aug 9.

""I had no idea being married was so exciting, because I've never been married before,"" the 41-year-old says, laughing.

Liu, who has often expressed a wish to marry, announced she had wed her Beijing businessman husband, who is two years younger, on her website. It shocked her fans, who didn't even know she had a boyfriend.

When asked how she kept the secret, she laughs again: ""Do you really think I would tell a journalist?""

Since her big screen debut in 1995, she has rarely talked about her love life, but has in the past 11 years often been referred to as a ""sheng nu"" - an unmarried lady older than 30. As a result, she would often be asked to share her feelings about other actresses getting married.

""I've been asked so often and every time what I was actually thinking was, 'What the hell is the matter with me?' Thank god I won't be asked that question now.""

She says she will continue her acting and singing career after marriage. Her new essay collection, Incomplete Me, has just hit the bookstores, too.

Her new film, Love in Space, co-produced by Fox International and the mainland's Huayi Brothers, tells the hilarious love stories of three sisters. Liu's love story takes place in a space capsule, in zero gravity. ""The other two actresses were in a romantic film, but I thought I was in a kungfu flick,"" she says.

The first day of shooting she had to fly on a wire for eight hours. ""When I stood on the ground again I told my agent, return the money because I quit,"" she jokes.

She describes filming as ""exhausting"".

As for having a baby, the question journalists are now asking, she is straightforward. ""No, I am not pregnant,"" she emphasizes. ""The best thing about my life so far is that I never know what will happen the next day. The baby thing will happen when it happens.""

By Anote Tong

Climate change poses the most significant moral challenge to the global community and an existential threat to the future of many communities worldwide.

With the projected rise in sea levels by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of up to one metre within the century, the most vulnerable coastal communities and low-lying island states — several of which are in Pacific — face the real possibility of their islands and communities being submerged well within the next hundred years.

Recent events and the experience of the most vulnerable island communities clearly indicate that climate change is already seriously affecting the low-lying island communities in the Pacific.

Cyclone Pam, which hit and seriously damaged the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu in March of 2014, also veered north on a path never previously witnessed to hit the islands of Tuvalu and the southern island of the Gilbert Island Group of Kiribati.

Kiribati is on the Equator and was previously not prone to cyclone events, being in a region regarded as free from cyclones.

This unprecedented event clearly indicates that the weather patterns in this region are being altered and suggests that sea level rise may not be the most immediate threat to the security of these highly vulnerable island countries, but rather more highly energized and more frequent storms.

Cyclone Winston, which hit Fiji early in 2016, was categorized as the most severe storm ever recorded in the southern hemisphere.

These cataclysmic events, together with ongoing and increasing severity of coastal erosion and periodic flooding, have now rendered what were once viable communities uninhabitable.

Sea water has intruded into the underwater aquifers (a source of potable water and a lifeline for these communities), causing contamination to water supplies and damage to food crops.

On the southern island of the Gilbert Island Group, some villagers have now relocated to other parts of the island and several more will have to do the same well within the next decade.

However, these atoll islands are on average no more than two meters above sea level. Therefore, the ability and the options for relocation on the islands are limited.

Against this background and against the projected increasing severity of climate change impacts, the future of these communities and their capacity to continue as viable communities on their home islands is also severely limited.

Unless significant resources are to be made available from the developed world to build capacity to withstand the increasing severity of climate change impacts, a community’s ability to adapt and to remain in its homelands would not be an option.

In an attempt to provide themselves with any measure of an option against the relentless onslaught of climate change, these most vulnerable countries have formed coalitions such as the Climate Vulnerable Forum.

The CVF is composed of countries ranging from the highly populous nation of Bangladesh to the small island nations of Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Kiribati in the Pacific, and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean.

To highlight their extreme vulnerability as atoll island nations, the latter group formed the Coalition of Atoll Island Nations on Climate Change (CANCC), to focus international attention on the reality that their future as sovereign nations is in serious jeopardy.

But in spite of the strong desire and commitment of these countries to be able to continue to remain in their homelands, their ability to adapt and build the resilience required to withstand ongoing and future climate change impacts is entirely dependent on substantial intervention by the international community.

And even then it would be most unlikely that the scale of resources needed to guarantee the security of their entire populations is likely to be forthcoming.

Relocation, no matter how undesirable, must therefore be the brutal reality of the future of atoll island nations, and part of the solution.

Kiribati has advocated that migration with dignity must be part of a climate change adaptation strategy, rather than relocation of its people as climate refugees.

But the reality of what faces member countries of the CANCC in the future also holds true for countries like Bangladesh, where a significant number of their very large population is highly vulnerable and would also need to relocate from their existing communities.

And the moral challenge for the global community, among others, is then: “Are we able to face up to a catastrophe that is of our own creation?”

2356,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Kenya's Rift Valley lakes have been this high before. But there's cause for concern - The Conversation CA,https://theconversation.com/kenyas-rift-valley-lakes-have-been-this-high-before-but-theres-cause-for-concern-147476,"Recent high water levels of Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley lakes have flooded properties and displaced communities, most notably around Lakes Baringo and Naivasha.

There are many lakes along the length of the African Rift Valley, which runs from the Red Sea in the north to Mozambique in the south. Kenyaâ??s eastern Rift Valley has a string of eight lakes.

These lakes provide diverse habitats ranging from the freshwater lakes of Naivasha and Baringo to the semi-saline Lake Turkana, the saline alkaline lakes of Magadi, Elmentaita, Nakuru and Bogoria and the transient Lake Logipi.

The alkaline lakes provide unique feeding habitats for East Africaâ??s famous lesser flamingos. The freshwater lakes support important fisheries and agriculture. Lake Turkanaâ??s unique semi-saline hydrobiology sustains indigenous fisheries, including some endemic species.

Some lakes are recognised as Wetlands of International Importance, and all are Important Bird Areas, with several being within UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites.

The lake level rises are worrying because of the destruction to homes, livelihoods, industry and infrastructure, and loss of terrestrial wildlife habitat. So far this year, the rising waters of Lake Baringo alone have displaced more than 5,000 people and destroyed schools, hospitals, hotels and roads.

And the effects on lake ecologies are a concern as flooding increases lake turbidity and dilutes the saline waters of alkaline lakes.

Having worked on East African hydrology for decades, including these lakes, I wanted to share insights on the rise in water levels.

The Rift Valley is subject to ongoing plate tectonics and crustal movement that can affect the lakes. The recent rises, though, are directly associated with above-average rainfall. The lakes have been even higher in the past, and with rainfall in the Rift Valley Basin being on a rising rainfall trend, higher lake levels can be expected in the future.

Land use changes, riparian zone encroachment, loss of wetlands, and urban growth are all contributing to more extreme flooding. This is because the proportion of rain and sediment that runs off from the catchments is increasing.

Not unprecedented

The lakesâ?? water cycles are governed by rainfall on highland catchment areas, evaporation and seepage. Water reaches the lakes through direct rainfall, rivers, groundwater flows, and in some cases hot springs from underground geothermal fields.

The eastern Rift Valley is semi-arid and its high evaporation rate concentrates salts in the lakes. The lakes are especially sensitive to changing catchment rainfall and have, in the past, ranged from near empty to much higher levels than today.

The studies Iâ??m currently doing show, as have others, that there has been above-average annual rainfall over the last decade. Kenyaâ??s October to December 2019 rains were the highest on record for decades. These were followed by above-average rains in 2020. In some areas they were 400% more than normal.

With persistent rainfall, the catchment surface layers saturate, resulting in extended flood periods. For instance the Turkwel dam, which was built on the Turkwel river in the northern Rift Valley Basin, recently reached its highest level on record.

And in May this year, Lake Naivasha reached its highest level since 1932. The lakeâ??s expansion has flooded developments, such as surrounding flower farms.

Yet, like the other lakes, Lake Naivashaâ??s waters have historically been higher. The lake is 1.4 vertical metres short of its official riparian boundary. In 1917, the lake was 2.4 metres higher. In earlier centuries, the lake was at least 13 metres higher.

Lakes Nakuru, Bogoria and Baringo have also risen to their highest levels in decades, inundating roads and building infrastructure, yet they also are not as high as they were in the early part of the last century. Lake Turkanaâ??s current level was also reached in the 1970s and early 1900s, and in 1896 it was 14.6 metres higher.

Regional lake water levels were higher still during the Holocene, up to 10,000 years before the present, during a wetter period. For instance, Lake Turkana was 100 metres higher and Lakes Bogoria and Baringo had risen high enough to merge into one lake. Present-day Nakuru and Naivasha townships would have been under water.

While this shows that the levels arenâ??t unprecedented, today all of Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley lakes face modern challenges arising from growing infrastructure development pressures.

Increasing pressure

The water cycles of Rift Valley lakes are changing as water is taken out for use and because the catchments and land surrounding the lakes are being degraded. For instance, forests are being converted into agricultural land, there is increasing urbanisation and people are encroaching onto riparian and wetland zones.

These catchment changes reduce rainfall recharging of underground aquifers, and cause more sediment â?? such as soil â?? to run off into rivers. This sediment reaches and accumulates in lakes and reservoirs. This can clog natural underground freshwater outlets, in which case lake salinity and levels will rise. The deposited sediments also build the lake beds and displace lake water levels upwards. I have measured up to 30 metres of sediment accumulated within Turkwel damâ??s reservoir since 1991.

Changes caused by people are different for different lakes.

Lake Nakuruâ??s ecology has long been affected by catchment change. For instance, the forest cover of its catchment area is reported to have declined from 70% to 15% over the past 50 years, leading to greater runoff into rivers and thence to the lake. On top of that, the growth of Nakuru town requires more water supply which will be imported. Unless otherwise channelled, this extra water will end up in the lake, raising water levels, and if not properly treated, will worsen pollution.

Meanwhile, Lake Naivasha declined in recent years to critically low levels. Growing developments â?? such as Naivasha town and a new Industrial City â?? need water, which puts more pressure on the already critically stressed lake water resource. In addition, the lake suffers from heavy pollution loads.

The flow of water into Lake Turkana is being regulated by dam and irrigation developments, potentially affecting the lake ecology and fisheries.

Excessive river inflows into the lakes result from increasing catchment rainfall coupled with the effects of land use changes. Dilution of saline waters affects the production of cyanobacteria, the food sources of lesser flamingos. Increased turbidity reduces light penetration into water, and affects photosynthesis, an engine of the aquatic food chain.

Future concerns

While tectonic plate changes are beyond humansâ?? control, biodiversity-friendly land use and commitment to existing legislation and national vegetation cover goals can limit catastrophic damage to lake ecological systems, people and property.

In the context of increasing rainfall trends, it is vital that official demarcation of riparian and wetland zones takes full account of the very well-documented extreme high lake level precedents and extent of flooding of the last century and before.",2020-10-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['theres', 'lakes', 'lake', 'rift', 'rainfall', 'cause', 'high', 'kenyas', 'metres', 'catchment', 'valley', 'water', 'levels', 'higher', 'concern']",Kenya,news article,English

Not since 2014 has Egypt seen this amount of fake news items than it did in 2020, thanks to the coronavirus. Rumours about the pandemic made up 51.8 percent of the false news circulated in Egypt throughout the year, read a report released on Monday by the cabinet’s media centre.

And not that warnings of legal action succeeded in putting the brakes on the generation of rumours. Egypt’s general prosecution warned in late March against spreading fake news and rumours about the coronavirus, saying the act is punishable by jail sentences and fines of up to EGP 20,000.

The finance sector was the most hit by rumors in January 2020, and the health sector won the lion’s share throughout the following six months as the pandemic broke out in Egypt in mid-February.

According to the cabinet's report, the health sector was the most hit by rumours in 2020 with 24.1 percent, followed by the education and finance sectors.

Rumors hit many other fields, including supply, agriculture, housing, tourism and antiquities, social solidarity, fuel and electricity, and administrative reform, the report read.

The report detailed the most serious rumours generated in 2020, dividing them into “most serious,” “strangest,” “repetitive” and “rumours aiming to distort achievements.”

- Vaccines administered orally to children, including the polio vaccine, cause sterility.

- Alexandria dwellers are obliged to sign a ratification to stay in their houses that might fall down.

- School libraries turned into classrooms so that social distancing is maintained.

- Citizens will be excluded from the government subsidy programme if they lose the password of their subsidy card.

- Citizens will bear the cost of disinfecting mosques.

Repetitive rumours

- An EGP 150 fine will be imposed for the issuance of burial permits.

- A number of Egyptian antiquities were sold to foreign parties.

- The Suez Canal saw major losses as a result of the coronavirus crisis.

- Shipments of bad flour were used to produce subsidised bread.

The barangay was visited Tuesday by a disaster preparedness caravan of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to help prepare the community to handle any disaster.

The barangay is frequently inundated by floods from the runoff of the Laguna de Bay which overflow during heavy rains from the nearby East Kabulusan Creek as the water heads to Manila Bay.

Cupang is also vulnerable to dangerous ground shaking during an earthquake caused by the movement of the West Valley Fault close to the barangay.

Members of about 200 families gathered at the barangay gymnasium for lectures from DILG officials on how they can become self-reliant and avoid dependence on the government during emergencies.

Officials showed residents ways to turn ordinary buckets into emergency containers for ready-to-eat food, medicine, clothes, three gallons of water, a radio, a flashlight, and hygiene kits. They said these could be easily carried during an emergency evacuation.

Some families admitted that they still have much to learn to be prepared for emergencies. They used to think it was enough to seek shelter at evacuations centers during floods.

Rift Valley, Kenya â?? It was seven years ago when Job Chebon, owner of a tourist lodge on the edge of Lake Baringo, first noticed the waters near his property rise dangerously.

â??The water would come and then recede. For years, it would come a little bit further to dry land, to our homes, then go back,â? he said earlier in August, standing on a sandbag leading to the flooded reception lobby of his Soi Safari Lodge â?? at least, what remains of it.

â??In 2020, it has come with a vengeance.â?

The rising waters of Lake Baringo in the Great Rift Valley have dealt a heavy blow to tourism, a key sector in this part of Kenya.

Chebon said he had lost thousands of dollars in accommodation fees and damage to his property, while several other hotels in the region have also been either totally or partially submerged.

Elizabeth Meyerhoff, a social scientist, who along her husband Murray Roberts, has been studying the lake since 2013, said the water level has been rising at about 2.5cm (0.98 inches) a day.

â??In the last seven years, [it] has raised to about 9-12 metres (30-39 feet).â?

The couple, who live next door to Chebonâ??s lodge, have also been running a programme aimed at rehabilitating semi-arid environments by producing dry land seed which they have already distributed to more than 900 farmers.

Almost all the land where the grass, mostly meant for grazing was planted, is underwater. The coupleâ??s stores, offices and a dispensary have had a similar fate.

â??The water comes from the rivers, but because of deforestation itâ??s bringing down huge amount of flash flooding with sediments which fill the bottom of the lake,â? said Meyerhoff, after a tour on a boat â?? a mode of transport that is the new norm in these parts of Baringo.

Climate change and unusually heavy rains this year have also contributed to the problem.

The rising waters have displaced more than 5,000 people in 2020, according to government officials, submerging homes, schools, roads, hospitals, farmland â?? and even entire islands.

â??This island was whole, we could move around,â? said Nongaseuria Lenaisiaku, an elderly lady who has had to relocate to higher ground twice after Kokwa Island was split into three parts.

â??Now the water has separated us from our relatives. I donâ??t even have a boat take me to other parts of the village.â?

Nearby, in Rugus, another fishing village of mud-thatched huts, Singh Lenapunya was seated on his raft â?? scaling fish he had just caught. He acknowledged that the rising waters have brought along plenty of fish â?? but also crocodile and hippos. A herdsman was recently killed by a crocodile.

Lake Bogoria rising

However, it is not just Lake Baringo and its dependents that are in trouble.

Further to the south, Lake Bogoria â?? a World Heritage site which at times hosts up to 1.2 million flamingoes â?? has also been rising. Just a few years ago, Baringo and Bogoria â?? freshwater and alkaline lakes, respectively â?? were 20km (12 miles) apart, but local officials say that distance has now been cut to 13km (eight miles).

Located on an eponymous national reserve, Lake Bogoria is a significant tourist attraction, whose hundreds of bird species and beautiful landscape, as well as geysers and hot springs, draw visitors from many parts of the world.

According to James Kimaru, the game reserveâ??s senior warden, the lake has expanded from 34 square kilometres in 2017 to 43 square kilometres in 2020.

â??Almost 80 percent of the hot springs are under water, especially the main ones which were shooting almost three metres up,â? said Kimaru. â??They used to be our main tourist attraction but now the number of visitors has reduced. The main road, the gate to our reserve and our offices are under water â?? we have to move for a second time. The hospital, hotels and homes adjacent to the reserve are also submerged.â?

Meanwhile, there are growing concerns about the swamps between the lakes. Both Meyerhoff and Kimaru said if the alkaline water from Bogoria reached the swamps which link to Baringoâ??s freshwater â?? it would be an ecological disaster.

With both lakes having no known channels that allow the flow of excess water, some scientists have suggested building a barrier between them. Others have recommended constructing a canal for water to flow out of Lake Baringo, which is rising faster. They say the water can be channelled through a natural course outlet further north.

It is still unclear, however, what the effect of such a move would be on Kenyan farmers and pastoralists downstream, as well as the lake itself.

Government officials told Al Jazeera they are examining these suggestions, while also carrying out a study to find out whether there are other reasons why the lakes are rising so fast to determine safe solutions to protect them and the millions of people whose lives are at stake.

743,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Ghana: Govt Shuts Down Ghana Manganese Company ... for Non-Payment of Taxes - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201908070230.html,"The Ghana Manganese Company Limited will from today stop operating following an order by government to cease operations due to non-payment of taxes as well as price and production manipulation between 2010 and 2017.

Among other things, the shutdown was also as a result of the company's failure to comply but rather circumvent the local content policy at the expense of local contractors which are owed millions of Cedis.

Addressing a press conference in Accra yesterday following an audit of the company which commenced in January this year, Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Kwaku Asomah-Cheremeh, said, the ministry was working with the Minerals Commission to institute measures to retrieve the taxes.

""GMCL has not shown strong commitment to value addition in particular. There are also defaults by the company in the payment of annual minerals rights fees in excess of US$4 million. These and several infractions give me no option as the sector minister than to close down the operations of GMCL.""

""The company is therefore instructed to stop all mining exploration and export of minerals effective August 6, 2019. The Ministry together with the Minerals Commission and other relevant stakeholders will immediately commence discussions with Ghana Manganese to resolve this and other outstanding issues in the course of the shutdown,"" he stated.

Explaining further, the minister noted that, based on fair pricing model and verifiable data, government has been short-changed by the company in relation to payment of royalty taxes, and corporate taxes, among others.

He said the company further manipulated sales between 2014 and 2015 in order to stockpile ore prior to adjusting the price downwards by US$0.65 for every dry metric ton unit contrary to section 13 of the mining lease agreement governing the company's operation.

Mr Asomah-Cheremeh said the audit further revealed that the Ghana Manganese Company Limited failed to invest in its mining assets despite a letter by its mother company indicating that it would add that the lack of investment has resulted in major infrastructural deficits with road and railways facing continuous deterioration due to the company's operations.

In January this year, the Ghana Manganese Company Limited was directed to halt its mining operations to enable the government undertake a thorough technical and financial audit of the company's operations.

The audit was to make transparent the operations of the manganese mining company and to determine its operational challenges and capabilities.",2019-08-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['shuts', 'govt', 'mining', 'company', 'companys', 'audit', 'nonpayment', 'minerals', 'manganese', 'minister', 'operations', 'taxes', 'ghana']",Ghana,news article,English

According to ratings agency Crisil, the predictions of a good and widespread monsoon as has been made by the Indian Meteorological Department augers well for the rural farming sector and therefore, for makers of farm equipment like tractors. ""Despite a 37% on-year decline in April and May combined, tractor volume will likely be barely 1% below last fiscal’s level, in sharp contrast to a double-digit decline expected for the rest of the automobile industry,"" it says.

Crisil further adds that this, combined with lower raw material costs and strong balance sheets, indicate stable credit outlook for tractor makers this fiscal.

The onset of monsoon across India has been swift this year. The entire country was covered by Friday, June 26 - 12 days ahead of normal pattern. This HT report notes that the last time the advance of the monsoon was this early was in 2013, when it covered the entire country by June 16.

For varying reasons, timely and widespread monsoon comes as great news for the Indian economy amid recent months of lockdown-related blues. The blues in the overall automotive sector, however, are likely to prevail. Several auto makers have highlighted that while demand in rural sector may recover quicker, cities remain a source of concern. Earlier this month, Crisil had also predicted sales' volume in the Indian passenger vehicles' segment - including exports, will likely fall by between 22% and 25% in fiscal 2021.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief and disaster preparedness, told Xinhua by telephone that torrential rains which started last month, marking the first major rainfall season in the country, have displaced people, destroyed homes, farms, washed away roads and other infrastructure.

He said most of the affected areas include the mountainous and hilly areas in eastern and western Uganda, low lying and plain areas in eastern region.

“This problem is across the whole country. Now there are thousands of people who are displaced. The officers in my office are compiling the figures (numbers of people) and extent of damage for each district across Uganda,” said Ecweru.

“We are going to sit down and see how to handle the magnitude of the problem. We shall see how to dispatch some support to the affected persons,” he said.

The Office of the Prime Minister has been running alert messages, warning that the country will face floods, landslides, strong winds and lightning as the first rain season peaks.

“We have been running alert messages on televisions and radios. These alerts started running about five months ago. We have been telling and warning the country of heavy rains and its dangerous effects,” said Ecweru.

He said landslides have hit the hilly western district of Kabale.

Ecweru said people living in mountainous areas, flood prone areas as well as wetlands should immediately vacate to safe places as heavy rains continue.

At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western district of Rubanda on Saturday, according to police.

According to the weather department, several parts of the country especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects.

About six million people were affected by floods in 2020, from Rwanda to South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania and beyond. Flooding can lead to disease outbreaks, such as cholera, and damage livelihoods, crops and the environment.

1313,FL-2019-000084-IND,Monsoon brings danger and opportunity for Assam's rhinos - Save the Rhino International,https://www.savetherhino.org/asia/india/monsoon-brings-danger-and-opportunity-for-assams-greater-one-horned-rhinos/,"Summer may conjure up thoughts of beaches, BBQs, ice cream and fun in the sun (when it does shine in the UK!). However, in Assam, in northeast India, summer brings entirely different conditions: the monsoon.

What is the monsoon?

In the Indian sub-continent, summer starts with baking hot weather. The sun beats down on the land, heating it up quickly. The air above heats up and rises, creating a deep area of low pressure. This drags in cool air, laden with moisture, from the Indian Ocean like a vacuum. Monsoon winds are followed by biblical downpours, and the vacuum effect is so strong that the rains start in the southwest of India and spread across to the northeast of the country, more than 1,500 miles away.

Here, the monsoon reaches Assam. With the Himalayas rising to the north, the monsoon slows down as the mountains force it upwards, meaning that Assam and the rest of the northeast receive the most rain.

Kaziranga National Park, home to the largest population of Greater one-horned rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) in the world, sits on the southern banks of the mighty Brahmaputra River, which runs through Assam. In mid-July, a month after the first rains fell in Assam this year, the river burst its banks, inundating land on either side of its vast width. At the flood’s peak, as much as 95% of Kaziranga was underwater (up to a depth of 4.5 m), causing massive disturbance to the wildlife that calls the park home.

How does the monsoon impact Kaziranga?

By 1 August 2019, 91 people lost their lives and more than 3 million were displaced or otherwise affected by the flooding in Assam alone. Additionally, 220 large animals have died in Kaziranga as a result of the floods, including:

• 146 hog deer

• 13 sambar deer

• 20 wild boars

• 1 elephant

• 21 Greater one-horned rhinos (including 16 calves)

Whilst the flood sounds disastrous for people and wildlife alike, this annual phenomenon plays an important role in maintaining the balance of the local ecosystem. Firstly, when the river floods, rich alluvial soil is deposited on the grasslands surrounding the river. This adds vital nutrients to the land and, once the floodwaters have receded, will allow the grasses to flourish. Fresh growth benefits the Park’s large populations of herbivores, like rhinos and deer, by providing a renewed, plentiful food source. In turn, animals higher up the food chain, such as tigers, benefit too.

The flood also prevents the grasslands from becoming woodland. Without the floods, the grasslands would, over time, naturally convert to woods. This would be disastrous for the rhinos and many other species relying on this important grassland habitat.

Monsoon waters also tackle a newer threat facing the park. In recent years, the Park has had to deal with the spread of the invasive water hyacinth. This plant (originally from South America) outcompetes native flora, including the natural food plants of rhinos and other species, and clogs waterways, threatening the ecology of the Park. During the monsoon, the floods wash away the water hyacinth, giving native plants a chance to recolonise Kaziranga.

Another interesting effect of the floods is on animal populations as a whole. The animals that have died during the monsoon tend to be the weakest; those that are old, young, ill or injured. The floods are a mediator of natural selection: the strongest, fittest animals tend to survive. These animals can then continue to breed and produce the next generation, passing on the genes that made them so successful, meaning that future generations will be better adapted to cope with the floods.

Focusing on rhinos, although it is always incredibly sad to hear of rhinos dying, the number lost represents less than 1% of Kaziranga’s total population of Greater one-horned rhinos (yet this is more than the number of Assam’s total rhinos lost to poaching in a year (in 2017, only nine rhinos were killed by poachers in Assam State). However, this loss is unlikely to have a large negative impact on the population or its future growth, and Kaziranga will retain its status as the home of the largest population of Greater one-horned rhinos in the world.

However, whilst the floods are a natural, annual occurrence in Assam, their impacts on rhinos and wildlife can be exacerbated by human development. As roads, shops, restaurants and hotels have been built around Kaziranga, this has impacted the movement of wildlife, blocking their passage to higher land, where they would naturally retreat during floods. To try and redress the balance, conservationists in the Park have constructed artificial highlands to act as refuges for animals fleeing the rising waters. Some of the Park’s rhinos have been seen using these highlands, showing their importance as an alternative to natural refuge areas.

In some hopeful news, 72 animals have been rescued from the floodwaters, including five rhinos. They have received expert care, and many have already been released, giving them a second chance to thrive in the Park.

The rainy season will continue until October, but for now, the floodwaters have started to recede in Kaziranga National Park, taking the pressure off both the wildlife and people that call the area home.",2019-08-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['opportunity', 'wildlife', 'brings', 'kaziranga', 'floods', 'assam', 'animals', 'population', 'rhinos', 'river', 'assams', 'monsoon', 'danger', 'park']",India,news article,English

Regional seed manufacturer, Seed Co Limited’s expansion initiatives in Africa are expected to bear fruit this 2019/20 farming season on the back of increased varieties and capacity, good weather and a generally firm demand across the region.

This comes as Seed Co is consolidating its market dominance across the continent for grain and vegetable seeds.

In Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Mozambique and Ghana as well as parts of East and West Africa, the group anticipates increased sales as some countries are recovering from drought experienced in the prior year, while others have increased production after suffering product shortages.

The group is also anticipating to cash in on increasing Government support programmes across the region as well as an anticipated good rainfall.

Bad weather conditions have had a knock on effect on agriculture-related companies while inflationary pressures have also narrowed disposable incomes. However, governments from across the region have several input programmes for their countries and the seed-making firm is angling itself to capitalise on such.

In Zimbabwe, Government is targeting 210 000 hectares of maize for the 2019/20 farming season as well as 30 000 hectares of soya bean under the Presidential Input Programme.

Government is also looking at an additional 640 000 hectares of maize and small grains under support for the vulnerable groups.

Group chief executive officer Morgan Nzwere said they were anticipating to benefit from such programmes as well as firming demand across the region.

“What we will get from Government programmes is debatable, but we will try and get a significant share of that. There is also a drive to cut on imports and this should see an increase in planting,” Mr Nzwere told shareholders at the group’s annual general meeting in Harare yesterday.

“The Government input programme in Zambia is continuing with input distribution starting on September 1, and we expect to get a decent share of the business,” he said.

In Malawi, its subsidy programme is continuing although government has decided to cut the targeted beneficiaries to 900 000 families from one million in the prior season.

Mr Nzwere acknowledged that the operating environment was increasingly becoming unpredictable, especially in Zimbabwe due to inflationary pressures. However, the company has in place strategies to stay relevant both as a business and to its market.

“In Zimbabwe, whilst as a business we are doing everything within our control to prepare for the main selling season, the operating environment is increasingly becoming unpredictable,” he said.

Apart from Government, prospects are generally good for the seed producer on the back of favourable weather conditions across the region as well as increased production capacity in some regional markets.

Said Mr Nzwere: “From the regional operations, we anticipate rebound performance with adequate product and better rainfall forecasts, unlike last year when our markets were badly affected by drought. We expect continued market share growth in East Africa.”

Kenya is expected to recover this season after it suffered product shortages as well as depressed demand last year due to drought and other supply chain related constraints. Seed Co has since increased production capacity in Kenya, and has adequate stocks to meet local demand during the season.

In Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Kenya, vegetable seed business units are expected to start contributing to the bottom line following their full roll-out last financial year.

The group is also upbeat about Mozambique, Angola and the Tanzania where the seed producer has increased production to meet demand after suffering product shortages.

Other market areas are also being explored within the different countries as the firm consolidates its market share.

Business development work is continuing in Franco-phone Africa with demonstration plots of several varieties established this year in Ghana, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Benin, Cote d’lvoire, Cameroon and Congo Brazzaville.",2019-08-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['programmes', 'demand', 'anticipates', 'region', 'seed', 'product', 'market', 'production', 'firm', 'increased', 'season', 'nzwere', 'group']",Ghana,news article,English

â?¢ The June to September 2020 seasonal rains over the northern and western sector of the region were above average across much of the region. Devastating floods occurred at the peak of the rainfall season, affecting over 2.5 million people and causing significant crop damage in riverine areas in Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia,

Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya.

â?¢ Crop losses were significant in several riverine areas, including along the Awash River in Ethiopia, the While and Blue Nile Rivers in South Sudan and Sudan, and the Juba and Shabelle Rivers in Somalia.

Outside of flood-affected areas, the seasonal rains were generally beneficial for crop and livestock production, water availability, and hydro-power generation across East Africa. The water-levels in major lakes, rivers, and dams are among the highest on record, especially in the Lake Victoria basin, major Rift Valley lakes, and White and Blue Nile Rivers.

â?¢ Desert locust swarms continue to form, and breeding is underway in Ethiopia, north-central Somalia, Yemen, and eastern Sudan. The situation in Ethiopia is of high concern, where government and other sources report significant damage to meher crops in Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia regions.

â?¢ Rangeland resources and livestock production conditions are exceptionally above average across most pastoral and agropastoral regions of East Africa due to two consecutive rainfall seasons of above average rainfall performance since late 2019.

By Joseph Erunke

THE Executive Director, Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE, Dr. Ganiyu Agbaje, Tuesday, said Nigeria has improved on its possession of requisite equipments to better forecast flood, thereby mitigating the effects.

To this end, he expressed optimism that the negative socioeconomic impacts of flooding in the country would henceforth be mitigated through effective and accurate forecast.

Agbaje, speaking at the opening ceremony of Online Regional Training on Flood Monitoring and Forecasting Modelling, in Abuja, insisted that with the latest technology in the country, it will henceforth be easier to predict flood and locate the people who are really affected, a development he noted, would make the country make informed decision to reduce the disaster associated with the flood.

But he tasked experts on accuracy in their forecast using satellite technology, saying such was necessary in order to monitor flood as well as identify its hotspot areas with a view to making a quick damage assessment.

He spoke as Nigeria joined other West African nations to adopt satellite technology in better predicting environmental patterns to help mitigate flood.

He explained that the training was held to equip participants with skills and requisite tools to enable them to identify flood-hotspot areas in order to make a quick flood damage assessment, identify flood monitoring and forecast model as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling.

In sustaining the successes of the project, he advised governments to further embrace technology for creative solutions and consider stronger laws to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse which is a major cause of flooding in Africa.

Hear him:Human beings are somehow meant to be unruly. So, the society needs to be guided by law, else I can go to your house and just mess it up. If there are no laws to say you cannot dump refuse here then everywhere will be messy. We need to abide by the regulations and rules.

Also, it has been said that the whole of Netherlands is on a flood lane but they use engineering and other means to ensure that they stay afloat most of the time. We have millions of dollars lost every year to flooding in Africa, forcing ECOWAS to make a policy on disaster risk reduction but more has to be done to ensure that the impact is lower in Nigeria and other countries.

According to him, the training was not to teach participants how to predict but to show them how to use additional satellite data to do their prediction better and support other methods.

He said that the technology has been on for a while around the world, adding that African leaders in collaboration with the EU initiated the training to help Africa better monitor the environment and mitigate disasters.

Agbaje said that with the data, rainfall, rivers and the environment will be better monitored, adding that in the case of Nigeria, more information on the activities of River Niger will be known using the technology.

We need to support our rural communities on how best use flood when it occurs because at times if it coming far away from this country, you can harness the water overflowing for many other things in agriculture. In raining season, you can channel it for irrigation.

We are feeling the economic impact of this disaster. We are looking at riverine flooding. You know our people settle along the rivers. And they have their livelihoods there; they are farmers and cant come to towns, he added.

The three-day training, which holds simultaneously in four other West African countries, was backed by the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) under its Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and Africa (GMES & Africa) initiative.

It was conducted by the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education, CSSTE.

Also speaking at the event, the GMES & Africa Programme Coordinator at the African Union Commission, Dr. Tidiane Ouattara, who joined via video conferencing, expressed joy that the activities of the CSSTE consortium was able to continue despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Emphasising the need for the constant training of young people and experts on the African continent, he described the training as a major achievement that would help Africa to build infrastructure and reduce the economic damage of flooding.

Participants at the workshop were drawn from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment.

Agricultural production in many parts of Africa is affected by natural climate variability and is likely to be significantly compromised by climate change through the higher incidence of drought, erratic rainfall and damaging high temperatures. The current system for responding to natural disasters is often not timely or equitable enough, with much of the cost being borne by farmers. When international assistance is available it is often too late.

The African Risk Capacity (ARC) is a continental sovereign risk pool and early response mechanism designed to execute pre‐approved contingency. ARC’s mission is to help African Union Member States to protect the food security of their vulnerable populations. As an insurance risk pool, ARC’s objective is to capitalize on the natural diversification of weather risk across Africa, allowing countries to manage their risk as a group in a financially efficient manner in order to respond to probable but uncertain risks.

In order to participate in ARC, countries must undertake several processes, including:",2019-07-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['order', 'africa', 'countries', 'access', 'arc', 'risk', 'african', 'pool', 'capacity', 'programme', 'focus', 'climate', 'arcs', 'natural', 'ghana']",Ghana,news article,English

Abege joins the Ghanaian top-flight side on a deal expected to run until July 2022

Asante Kotoko have announced the signing of George Abege from Kenyan Premier League (KPL) side Kariobangi Sharks.

The Ghanaian side announced the arrival of the Ugandan international on a deal which runs until 2022, saying his addition would be vital for their Caf Champions League campaign.

Abege signed the contract to join Asante Kotoko after Sunday's friendly match between Sharks and Everton in Nairobi.

""George Abege's International Transfer Certificate (ITC) has reached the Porcupines, and the player is expected to join his colleagues this week,"" the club announced.

""The Porcupines noticed [George] Abege in the Confederation Cup preliminary round tie against Kariobangi Sharks, and find his qualities of relevance as the side aims for domestic and continental glories next season.

""Abege has great aerial abilities and ball control coupled with predatory skills that, on a good day, can make him every defender's nightmare on a good day.""

Abege joined Kariobangi Sharks in June 2018 from Sony Sugar and scored three goals in the 2018/19 KPL season.

The 25-year-old was involved in much more than the game's decisive moment at the Hawthorns, turning in an all-round masterclass in the 1-0 win

His 12th goal of the season did not part lips in wonderment nor spark mass extolment on social media like his previous one, but Roberto Firmino’s header at West Bromwich Albion was as emphatic as his 25-yard stunner away to Stoke.

West Brom 0-1 Liverpool

It strengthened Liverpool’s push for a Champions League place and furthered their credentials in conquering these sort of unpleasant encounters - the kind that have too often proved to be their undoing in 2016-17.

On Easter Sunday, the Reds refused to allow that to be the case again and finally overcame a Tony Pulis team on their travels in the league.

As per Jurgen Klopp’s judgement of their run-in after the Merseyside derby and the season-ending knee injury to Sadio Mane, his charges had to forget about rolling over teams and roll up their sleeves in the battle to consolidate their top-four ambitions.

The Hawthorns was always going to provide an examination of just how well Liverpool could deal with menace and they succeeded in not just getting stuck in, but seeing an uneasy match out.

Could Liverpool sign Oxlade-Chamberlain?

""It is one of the most difficult places to come because in no game can you feel comfortable,"" Klopp said.

""Somebody asked me which result would have kept me a little bit calmer in the last few minutes and I said only 4-0 after 86 minutes! Maybe then I would have felt OK, but now it’s done.

""It was very, very important because showing this concentration level until the end didn’t work each week in the last few months – but today, it was really good and I am happy about this.""

Firmino was at the heart of their attacking verve and defensive diligence. No player created more chances than the 25-year-old and none topped him for ball recoveries. He led the way in take-ons and won 64% of his duels.

The forward's decisiveness did not just materialise in the opposition's box, but Liverpool's too as his vital touch prevented Nacer Chadli from converting for the Baggies.

Klopp has described his focal point as “unbelievable” on several occasions, not simply due to his obvious excellence on the ball but his tirelessness out of possession.

The 1-0 victory offered the perfect snapshot of how intelligently Firmino applies his attributes for Liverpool.

The result provided the visitors with their first clean sheet since the 2-0 victory over Tottenham on February 11 and, given there had been so much focus on West Brom’s lethalness in the air and from set-pieces, it made the manner of the decisive goal all the more enjoyable for the Reds.

James Milner’s free-kick from the left was flicked on by Lucas and Firmino, who’d already been in the thick of the game's best moments, broke free at the far post to head Liverpool in front.

Simon Mignolet once again turned in a steely performance between the sticks to ensure it stayed that way, denying Matt Phillips with his legs in the final 10 minutes.

""He made an important save and in the end, it doesn’t look that spectacular, but he was really present around the set-pieces,"" Klopp noted.

""I think three, four, five fists away, which was really good, I have to say. He was really lively, front-footed, all that stuff. Very important again.""

Emre Can, meanwhile, continued his assertiveness in the centre of the park. The midfielder has contributed massively to his club's seven-game unbeaten run, helping to negate the absence of Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana.

""I really thought that the boys were in a really difficult game in not the easiest situation, but they did really well,"" Klopp offered.

""You can always do better, but we learned in the game and I liked it a lot that the second half looked better tuned than the first.

""We knew what to do, but in the first half it looked a little bit static in a few moments and in the second half it looked much better. I am really happy about the performance.""

(REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya)

At a Glance At least 100 are dead and 1,800 are homeless in eastern Kenya after severe rain and thunderstorms caused flooding and landslides over the last few days.

The Kenya Red Cross is requesting additional shelters be opened, to avoid overcrowding, which could lead to a spread of the coronavirus.

At least 100 are dead and 1,800 are homeless in eastern Kenya after severe rain and thunderstorms caused flooding and landslides over the last few days.

Eugene Wamalwa, cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Devolution, said on April 30 that 116 people had died in the country due to the flooding across 29 counties.

â??Some houses were covered by soil, while others are uninhabitable because water is seeping from underground"" Kenyenya Deputy County Commissioner David Mbevi told Kenya's Daily Nation. ""Trees and crops in farms have also been destroyed.""

Locals are struggling. ""It's been flooding for three days now,"" Vincent Ochieng, one of the residents affected by the floods, told Al Jazeera. ""I think the government is not even aware, but now we are telling them. We are asking them if there are any plans to assist us, only two boats are here for evacuating people.""

After weeks of heavy rains and thunderstorms, the River Nzoia burst its banks, according to the Kenya Red Cross, destroying crucial infrastructure and leaving scores of families homeless.

The deadly situation is being exacerbated by the buildup of waters whose levels continue to rise by the day, thanks to the flooding river and continued rains. Local news reported that the bodies of a two-year-old girl and a boy who died are yet to be retrieved.

Advertisement Kenya has two rainy seasons: one from October to December and the other is March to May. This is part of East Africa considers its ""Long Rains."" The rainy season is the worst between April and June. During this period, moist winds coming off the Indian Ocean swing around and drop heavy rain on Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia.

Because of east Africaâ??s topography with its mountains, the heavy rain is forced upwards, which increases the risk of severe thunderstorms, flash flooding and landslides. Of all the countries threatened by these weather patterns, Kenya is particularly susceptible to landslides. These landslides are particularly deadly, especially where people have practiced deforestation.

Of this bout of deadly rain, Kenyenya Deputy County Commissioner David Mbevi confirmed 31 families have been affected, though locals claim the number could be over 50.

The Kenya Red Crossâ?? secretary-general, Asha Mohammed, said much more needed to be done for the people affected.

""We will be doing mobile outreaches with the county department of health to provide medicines and treat minor illnesses,"" she said.

The Kenya Red Cross approached the local government, asking them to open rescue centers, given concerns that COVID-19 could spread due to overcrowding in limited existing centers.

At the end of April, western Kenya saw severe flooding which left several presumed dead and dozens missing after heavy rainfall and landslides.",2020-05-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['heavy', 'river', 'cross', 'landslides', 'flooding', 'thunderstorms', 'homeless', 'deadly', 'kenya', 'severe', 'leaves', '1800', 'kills', 'rain', '100', 'red']",Kenya,news article,English
2029,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The invasion of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

623,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lankan Accused of Leading Attacks Preached Slaughter. Many Dismissed Him. - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/world/asia/sri-lanka-attacks-mastermind.html,"Whether Mr. Zaharan found the Islamic State or the Islamic State found him, they seemed inextricably drawn to each other. In other places, like Indonesia and the Philippines, the Islamic State has been adept at taking Islamic radicals with local grievances and enlisting them in the global slipstream of terror.

By 2017, Mr. Zaharan and his followers were targeting a Sufi sect in Kattankudy, accusing its members of being infidels, even though Sufis are fellow Muslims who practice a mystical form of the faith. After the Sufis in Kattankudy handed out packets of rice to the poor, an action that Mr. Zaharan regarded as trying to buy hungry converts, he grabbed a sword and charged the crowd.

The police said they tried to arrest Mr. Zaharan and one of his brothers, but they escaped.

About 10 of his followers were detained, however, including his father and other relatives. Surprisingly for a small group from a distant part of Sri Lanka, the detained members of National Thowheeth Jama’ath managed to get a high-profile lawyer from Colombo to represent them.

H.M. Ameer, a member of the Sufi community, said that he and other Sufis had repeatedly contacted the police to warn about Mr. Zaharan’s extremism. They sent a thick file to Colombo. But there was little result, Mr. Ameer said. His assessment echoed complaints from recent days that Sri Lankan authorities failed to act on repeated warnings from overseas intelligence agencies about Mr. Zaharan planning a catastrophic attack.

On Thursday, Sufis in Kattankudy received a warning from the Sri Lankan criminal investigation department that their holy places might be targeted on Friday by militants associated with Mr. Zaharan who are still on the run.

Looking out on soldiers guarding the Badhriyyah Jumah Mosque where he and other Sufis worship, Mr. Ameer shook his head.

“We warned them that this man was vehemently spreading Wahhabism and that he was calling for jihad,” he said. “It was out in the open, clear as day. Nothing was done.”",2019-04-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['slaughter', 'places', 'islamic', 'state', 'lankan', 'dismissed', 'ameer', 'sufis', 'attacks', 'sri', 'sufi', 'mr', 'accused', 'zaharan', 'leading', 'preached', 'kattankudy']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

The video was posted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) that showed myriad turtle hatchlings whose scientific name is Podocnemis expansa. According to WCS, the turtle babies were emerging from a sandy beach in a protected area along the Purus River, which is a tributary of the Amazon River in Brazil.

The video has garnered over 20.5 k views on Twitter as netizens express their awe. One of the users commented, “A tsunami we all would like to see…,” while others congratulated the WCS conservationists for this awesome scene.

TURTLE TSUNAMI! @TheWCS releases incredible footage of mass hatching of locally endangered turtle: https://t.co/apenzRSzxd pic.twitter.com/KhA1aQsNYc— WCS Newsroom: #EarthStrong (@WCSNewsroom) December 14, 2020

The mass coming out of these turtles took place in the Reserva Biológica do Abufari (Abufari Biological Reserve) where animal conservationists from WCS Brazil have been monitoring adult females. The conservationists have been keeping a track of adult female turtles and their nests before, during, and after the birth of the hatchlings. The study is being conducted to improve the management and protection of this endangered species, which has been impacted by trafficking of their meat and eggs.

According to the WCS Brazil press release, the conservationists say the emergence occurred over several days during which period, around 71,000 hatchlings emerged in a day alone, while another 21,000 and few emerged days later.

WCS Brazil quoted Camila Ferrara, their Aquatic Turtle Specialist, who said that for the endangered giant South America river turtle, birth is an explosion of life as the video suggests quite clearly.

However, Camila also pointed out that it is one of their most fragile times as well. The mass birth is a way of increasing survival and the synchronization of birth allows these species to travel together to the river to start their new life.

The Giant South American river turtle is the largest freshwater turtle in Latin America. It can grow up to three and a half feet that is almost 1.07 meters and they can weigh upto 200 pounds that is 90 kilograms. These species of turtles play a crucial ecological role in nature as they disperse seeds that eventually help regenerate vegetation along river corridors around the Amazon basin.

WCS Brazil leads the project of conservation of these turtles in collaboration with ICMBIO and are sponsored by Fundação o Boticário.

The bakeries are intended to help ease the county’s ongoing bread shortage, which is due in part to severe flooding that began in July.

Egyptian technicians accompanying the bread production lines will train Sudanese teams to efficiently use the equipment according to operating standards.

The Egyptian and Sudanese teams will install the bakeries in Sudan’s most affected areas.

In September, Egypt sent multiple planes loaded with large quantities of food and medical supplies to Sudan, as well as a team of 20 physicians, nurses, and epidemic control specialists, to help the Sudanese people facing the disaster.

Sudan’s devastating floods began when continuous heavy rainfall caused the Nile River to reach its highest level in over a century.

The Sudanese government declared a nationwide state of emergency over the flooding, and quickly formed a crisis response committee to help mitigate its impact.

The country’s flood crisis has left 102 people dead, dozens injured, and over 100,000 homes destroyed.

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

KASESE - Following the outbreak of floods and landslides that ravaged several areas of mountainous Kasese district, residents continue to express worry over the next course of education after several schools were washed away.

Allan Kambale a resident of Namuhuga ward in Bulembia said schools such as Bulembia primary school, Kilembe and Royal ranges secondary schools, were greatly affected by the floods, whereas others cannot be accessed after several roads and bridges were damaged.

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

""Even if the school lock-down is lifted soon, pupils will have nowhere to study from unless an alternative area is gazetted for resettlement,"" Isemamba reasoned.

Similar concerns were raised by Rehema Aryema who decried the inevitable pressure on surviving school-premises, saying, learners are bound to meet a big challenge on how to resume studies when the lock-down is lifted.

In May this year, Kasese was hit by disastrous floods. The floods started on May 7 and peaked on the morning of May 10. Another disaster followed on May 21, in areas of Mpondwe-Bwera, where flash floods and landslides further destroyed bridges and infrastructure, leading to the death of more than 10 people.

The current flooding started with river Nyamwamba bursting its banks in areas of Kasese municipality sweeping away Kyanjuki-Katiri bridge and Kilembe mines hospital infrastructure. Simultaneous floods also occurred along rivers of Lhubiriha in Bukonzo west with impacts in the sub-counties of Kitholhu, Karambi and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha town council while river Nyamugasani in Bukonzo East had impacts in the Sub-counties of Kyondo, Kyarumba and Kisinga.

River Mubuku floods, on the other hand, had impacts on the communities of Maliba, Bugoye and Karusandara. Equally affected, were town councils of Ibanda-Kyanya, Kisinga and Mubuku.

Health services still a challenge

Asinet Kabugho recounts the incident of flooding which left several communities cut-off from each other. Some pregnant mothers remained stuck up in the hilly areas and couldn't access medical services.

""The situation was only mitigated by a certain group of volunteers who transported affected people in ambulances,"" Kabugho recollects.

After the nearest Kilembe mines hospital premises were damaged by floods, medical services were shifted to premises of St. Micheal Kindergarten and at Catholic social centre (Karitus hall) in Kasese town.

Dr Edward Wefula the hospital superintendent calls for an urgent alternative water source, mortuary, incinerator, placenta pit and more toilets, saying, the new premises were not designed for a hospital.

However, Sr. Teopista Basemera the Kilembe hospital senior administrator, expressed hope of having more structures with a 200-bed capacity.

Malteser International a worldwide humanitarian relief agency, through the prime minister's office and the ministry of health, committed relief and recovery aid worth sh868m for the period of 3months since May 12.

According to Laura Beutler the technical coordinator for emergency medical services under Malteser, as of May 13, over 39,000 people had been affected by the floods.

""We have made more than 1,317 transferals out of which, 171 babies were successfully delivered from complicated pregnancies,"" noted Laura, adding that, eight of the born babies, were delivered from within ambulances.

She hence expressed a need to build capacity in pre-hospital care, where a formidable team of residents and health workers can be trained to administer first aid before or while transferring a patient to the hospital.

For over 3months of rescue and providing relief support, Malteser trained and passed out 23 Kasese residents in providing emergency medical services among which include, first aid and ambulance operations.

""We are striving to establish an Emergency Medical Services project in Kasese so that people can respond by themselves and activate support in an immediate and structured way,"" noted Laura.

She, however, expressed fear over the possible outbreak of diseases especially the COVID-19. She said the preventive measures are largely missing at all settlement camps.

The population of the people in camp is high, the implementation of the COVID-19 SOPs is hard. Social distancing and hand washing are hard to implement.",2020-08-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['worried', 'health', 'medical', 'areas', 'kilembe', 'victims', 'services', 'kasese', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'premises', 'school', 'hospital', 'education']",Uganda,news article,English

2408,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Heavy rains and floods leave dozens dead in southeastern Brazil - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/27/americas/rains-floods-minas-gerais-brazil-intl/index.html,"(CNN) At least 44 people have been killed after heavy rains hit southeastern Brazil, the country's Civil Defense force said Monday.

Around 13,000 people have been affected by the floods in the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, with thousands forced out of their homes. A number of people remain missing, according to the defense force.

Authorities in Minas Gerais declared a state of emergency in 47 cities on Sunday. By Monday, the number of cities in a state of emergency had risen to more than 100, Brazil's state-run news agency Agencia Brasil said.

While in India on Monday, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro announced that members of the Armed Forces have been mobilized to the area to help address the emergency.

1207,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Why Egypt Is at the Forefront of Hepatitis C Treatment - The Atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/why-egypt-is-at-the-forefront-of-hepatitis-c-treatment/561305/,"With affordable drugs secured, the country set out to distribute them at a scale never before attempted. In 2014, they debuted an online portal for those with the disease to register for treatment; within three days, 200,000 people had signed up. Over the next three years, more than 1.6 million Egyptians received hepatitis C treatment, according to data from the World Bank. That is more than all the patients treated during that time in the United States and Europe combined.

But that first flood of Egyptians seeking a cure were largely those already diagnosed with hepatitis C, and over time the challenge has shifted from making the drugs available to identifying additional people who need them. “The people going to those treatment centers tend to dry up,” explains Ward. “Obviously if you’re not testing, you’re not diagnosing, and you don't have anyone to treat.”

So in 2017, the Ministry of Health initiated a nationwide screening program. More than 260 teams of community-health workers are proceeding village by village. By late 2017, they’d screened 1,200 communities. Still, treatment has slowed from a high-point in 2016. According to the CDA Foundation, which compiles epidemiological data on viral hepatitis, the number of Egyptians treated in 2017 fell by roughly 30 percent compared to 2016, despite an estimated 4 million people still infected in the country.

With the promise of free drugs from the government for those diagnosed, civil-society organizations from factories to churches to mosques have gotten involved in screening, too. The prevalence of hepatitis C is around twice as high in the poorest quintile of the population compared to the wealthiest, but J. Stephen Morrison, the senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the epidemic cuts across society in a way that has benefited the elimination efforts. “[Hepatitis C] may carry a stigma but there are few families in Egypt who haven’t had some loved one who has struggled with this.”

Last year, in the upscale neighborhood of Katameya Heights in New Cairo, a chapter of the Rotary Club arranged a hepatitis C screening for the neighborhood residents and their household staff. One of the organizers was Mohamed Ziwar, who had recently retired from a leadership role at the drug company Bayer. He says the club contracted nurses from a local lab that does genetic analysis to spend three days in the neighborhood, where they screened about 1,000 people, and then arranged treatment for the 30 who tested positive. “After we finished this, we got other requests from relatives of these people, that they would love to go through the investigation,” Ziwar said.

Ziwar estimated that the club ended up spending about $5,000. It could have been much higher but since it was a charitable effort, the lab did the blood analysis nearly at cost. But screening the whole group was significantly more expensive than the price of the drugs needed to treat the 30 infected residents. This is proving to be true at the national level as well. While the diagnostics are inexpensive, as many as 20 people must be screened to identify one new person who is infected, and it adds up. To ensure all the residents of a given community get tested, screening teams must sometimes return multiple times.",2018-05-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['residents', 'screening', 'egypt', 'hepatitis', 'treatment', 'forefront', 'egyptians', 'screened', 'drugs', 'c', 'neighborhood', 'infected']",Egypt,news article,English

719,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,"In Ghana, a Bumper Crop of Opinions on Genetically Modified Cowpea - Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting",https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/ghana-bumper-crop-opinions-genetically-modified-cowpea,"UNDER THE noonday sun, Alimatu Alidu uses a stone to grind tomato, red pepper, and small crayfish into a red paste. Drops of sweat collect on her forehead, just below her black headscarf. She adds the paste along with other ingredients into a cooking pot balanced upon a make-shift stove, consisting of two uneven rocks with a small fire burning between them. Once her mixture is sufficiently heated, she adds the final element: boiled cowpea beans. Known as poor people’s meat, these faded yellow legumes with a big black dot along the curve are ubiquitous throughout West Africa, including here in Ghana.

The legume is a favorite among farmers and laborers, who consume it before work and don’t feel hungry until sundown.

Other days, Alidu prepares cowpea fritters, or koose, whipping ground cowpea and water into a batter, adding spices, then frying individually-rolled balls to be served for breakfast. She can make five different dishes from cowpea beans, which grow inside green pods up to 12 inches long.

Soon the spicy dish known as red-red is fully cooked and ready for Alidu’s 16-person family, which includes herself, her husband, their six children, and her husband’s second wife and their seven children. Together, they live in thatch huts that surround this open-air kitchen in the northern village of Zinindo.

Cowpea is a staple in Ghana and other parts of West Africa, where it is believed to have first been domesticated. The legume is a favorite among farmers and laborers, who consume it in the morning before leaving for work and don’t feel hungry until sundown. At her doctor’s request, Alidu increased her own consumption when she was pregnant, and she used the ground seeds to wean her children. Cowpea is a mainstay of school lunches in Ghana. And because the crop can be harvested within two months of sowing, it fills the “hunger gap” for poor families between May and August when other crops, such as maize, are still young in the field. And cowpea tolerates droughts, which are increasing across sub-Saharan Africa. Every woman in Zinindo keeps some cowpea in her home, says Alidu.

But cowpea has been under attack for years. A winged pest, Maruca vitrata, bores into the pods and nibbles away at the seeds, destroying anywhere between 20 and 80 percent of West Africa’s cowpea crops every year. In response, scientists have genetically modified cowpea plant lines to resist the pest, and advocates for the technology — which involves altering an organism’s DNA in ways that aren’t possible through traditional breeding — believe that genetically modified (GM) cowpea can help feed the fast-growing population on a warming planet. It can also help reduce the use of pesticides, they say, freeing up land for other uses, providing enough surplus for regional market opportunities, and giving farmers an additional choice about what to grow.

Ghana plans to release GM cowpea sometime this year or next, which would make it the third sub-Saharan African country after South Africa and Nigeria to approve local production and sale of GM food.

What worries some critics is that all of Africa’s genetic modification projects are closely tied to Western organizations. Licenses for the patented genes that African scientists use to modify cowpea crops, for example, were provided royalty-free by biotech companies such as Monsanto (since acquired by Bayer) — inviting questions about whether their goals are purely humanitarian. Further, social scientists warn that GM seeds are being pushed by international donors without fully taking into account the agriculture practices of poor farmers and the specific crop characteristics that they most want and need. While some African scientists are working tirelessly to reassure laypeople that GM foods are safe, it’s clear that safety concerns, however unfounded, are not the only challenge standing in the way of GM cowpea in Ghana.

Here in this rural village, Alidu and other poor farmers have not been following these controversies. But they say they are open to new approaches that would minimize pests, allowing them to grow enough cowpea to feed their families with a surplus to sell.

THE ROOTS of GM cowpea date back to the 1990s, when the Rockefeller Foundation, a New-York based philanthropy, entered into a series of conversations with companies that own many of the genes used to modify food, including Monsanto, DuPont, and Syngenta. Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation believed that biotechnology could help poor countries grow more food. But they understood the companies were unlikely to invest in genetically modifying so-called orphan crops such as cowpea, cooking banana, and cassava, which aren’t traded internationally and are often grown and eaten by farmers without the financial means to purchase expensive GM seeds.

“More scientists are coming forward to change public perception,” says Joseph Opoku Gakpo, an Accra-based journalist.

Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation proposed that the companies donate the genes to research institutes in developing countries. Researchers at those institutes would then use the genes to develop seeds for orphan crops that could resist pests, tolerate drought and excess salt, and enhance nutrition. A humanitarian organization would be created specifically to facilitate a partnership between the companies, philanthropic and governmental organizations, and the local scientists.

The companies initially rejected the proposal, but ultimately accepted the plan after internal discussions about how the partnership could restore their public image. Across the globe, the anti-GM movement had accused the biotech industry of monopolizing the world’s seed supply. Amid this and other criticisms, the companies agreed to an alliance.



Richard Ampadu-Ameyaw, Ghana’s coordinator for the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa, believes that training journalists and farming leaders about the science of GM food is the best way to dispel myths around it. Image by Ankur Paliwal. Ghana, 2019.

But they had conditions. The biotech companies wanted Asia and Latin America “off the table” because business was thriving in these regions. The companies also wanted strict licensing contracts that specified where, when, and to whom they would make the genes available royalty-free. These historical details were published in a paper by University of Minnesota sociologist Rachel Schurman, who had interviewed employees of the Rockefeller Foundation, biotech companies, and scientists in Africa.

The Rockefeller Foundation agreed to these terms and soon found an additional partner — the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which at that time was also trying to bridge partnerships between U.S. universities, biotech companies, and research institutions in developing countries to increase the global acceptance of biotech products. USAID representatives say that their agency promotes biotechnology when conventional breeding is too slow or ineffective to improve a given crop.

Over time, other big donors such as UK Aid, and corporations such as PepsiCo, joined the coalition. These groups reached out to African scientists, many of whom believe that biotechnology can solve some of African agriculture’s problems. In 2004, the African Agricultural Technology Foundation was launched. This Nairobi-based nonprofit now coordinates many of the GM research projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Two years later, it formed the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa (OFAB), an advocacy arm tasked with changing the public’s negative perception of GM products. Today, with financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, OFAB organizes meetings between scientists, farmers, and the media.

In Ghana, supporters of GM cowpea welcome Western support and believe the international partnerships serve the interests of local farmers. Anti-GM groups, however, don’t trust the companies or their technology. “There is no free lunch,” says Edwin Kweku Andoh Baffour, a spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, the most active anti-GM group in the country.

For now, OFAB appears to be making inroads. A number of Ghanian journalists said that after attending its workshops, they felt better equipped to address misconceptions. For example, doctored images of animal-shaped fruits — supposedly created by inserting animal genes into fruit seeds — had been making the rounds on social media.

“More scientists are coming forward to change public perception,” says Joseph Opoku Gakpo, an Accra-based journalist who has attended GM workshops.

ONE DAY in January, Alidu joins a small group in a prayer led by an old man under a grass-thatched shed near her house. After the prayer is finished, the old man introduces Mohammed Adams Nashiru, head of a farmers’ group in the region. Ghanian scientists have improved cowpea to fight off one of its pests, explains Nashiru. This could benefit local farmers, some of whom see half their cowpea destroyed by field pests in a given year. With this new cowpea, farmers will be able to grow more using less insecticide.

“These [GM] technologies are being privileged at the expense of other potential interventions,” says Matthew Schnurr.

Alidu is skeptical. For one, she and some of Zinindo’s farmers already intercrop cowpea, which lessens pest infestation. Further, though the farmers’ group leader assures the group that the seeds will be available soon, he is one of many government officials, traders, and researchers who have visited the village with promises to improve farmers’ lives. According to Alidu, none of them have ever returned.



Former anti-GM activist Mohammed Adams Nashiru says he had a change of heart after he heard scientists speak about the science of GM food and learned that Americans have been eating GM food for decades without any harm. Image by Ankur Paliwal. Ghana, 2019.

In stark contrast to his work today, roughly three years ago, Nashiru was leading marches in northern Ghana against GM crops. He says he had a change of heart in 2014 at an OFAB workshop where Walter Sandow Alhassan — former head of Ghana’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research — told an audience of farmers and journalists that GM food has been rigorously tested and is safe to eat. People in the United States, he noted, have been eating genetically modified food for many years. “He said that nothing happened to them,” says Nashiru. “There is no need to worry.”

Two years later, a report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that there is “no substantiated evidence” that GM crops are less safe than non-GM crops.

Although scientists and the OFAB are working to get that message out — with some scientists even asking their pastors to let them speak about GM food after Sunday prayers — changing public perception “is extremely challenging,” says Vivian Oduro, a plant scientist with the Biotechnology and Nuclear Agriculture Research Institute in Accra.

In Ghana, the debate around GM food is highly polarized, as it is elsewhere in the world, even in the U.S., where resistance has paralleled a growing demand for organic foods and clear labeling of genetically modified products. “This is a very connected movement,” says Mark Lynas, a former anti-GM activist turned science writer. “I often see European and U.S. themes quickly picked up by anti-GM activists in Africa.” But Lynas also notes that as people are exposed to a wider variety of facts and opinions — beyond the simple anti-GM narrative — their own views tend to become less entrenched. Many now say they don’t know enough about the technology to be for or against it.

Oduro remembers a debate organized by a government ministry in Accra last year, where the audience was asked to vote on the introduction of GM foods. After Oduro explained the science of genetic modification, a different speaker quoted a controversial 2012 study by French scientist Gilles-Éric Séralini. The study showed Séralini’s lab rats developed cancer after eating GM corn. (The paper was retracted the following year after a review found that “the conclusions described in the article were unreliable.”) The speaker also announced that waakye, a popular cowpea delicacy slow-cooked with rice, would be made using that same technology.

That made Oduro furious. In her next turn to speak, she appealed to the audience as a fellow Ghanaian and as the daughter of a farmer. She and her family eat cowpea, she said. Why would she promote something she believed to be harmful?

In fact, experiments show that GM cowpea is not just safe, it also yields about .85 tons more per acre than conventional varieties. And although the GM seeds will be about 50 percent more expensive than conventional seeds according to one estimate, they will require just two rounds of pesticides, rather than the current five to six. That will cut overall production costs by 5 to 10 percent.

But, says Oduro, once someone has stirred up fear, it is difficult to convince people not to be afraid. That day, the audience voted against genetically modified crops.

A couple days later, the aggregated online news site GhanaWeb posted an article about Oduro’s public statements. In the comments section, somebody called Oduro a “dirty bitch.” Someone else called her a “foolish woman.” Alhassan has even been the target of online death threats. In 2015, an Accra-based newspaper ran an article that quoted him saying genetically modified food is safe. “Shoot alhassan on the throat. IDIOT!” wrote one commenter after the article was posted on GhanaWeb. “Prof. Walter Sandow Alhassan must die now,” wrote another.

Baffour, the spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, says that he doesn’t believe studies such as the ones analyzed in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report. He maintains that other studies show GM crops are not safe because they have “unintended risks” though when questioned didn’t explain what those risks might be. And when asked for examples, he was not able to provide any that were published in peer-reviewed journals.

According to Baffour, organic food is “natural” and “obviously the future of the world.” Organic food, however, is expensive to grow because it requires more labor and costly herbal insecticides, which farmers like Alidu cannot afford. This is why biotech scientists say it’s best to offer choices and let farmers decide which seeds best meet their needs.

Anti-GM marches have occurred across Ghana, with many of them centered in Accra. But Nashiru characterizes the marches as a “show for media.” When he used to help organize them, he says he would call village farmers, hand them placards they couldn’t read, and pay them for their efforts. The farmers didn’t even know what they were marching for.

Interviews with a wide range of Ghanaians revealed some reservations about genetically modified foods. Wouldn’t there be something wrong, they wondered, with a crop that even insects won’t eat? Some maintained that the foods looked “too clean,” though few had actually seen these foods.

Richard Ampadu-Ameyaw, Ghana coordinator for OFAB, thinks it is best to train leaders like Nashiru whose community ties and farming background lend him credibility in the eyes of local community members. Yet there are notable differences between Nashiru’s life and the lives of the poor farmers. For one, he has travelled internationally. He also owns 250 acres of land, much more than a farmer like Alidu, who owns just five acres.

For his part, Nashiru says he cares deeply about the seeds poor farmers ultimately use. “My grandfather told me that monuments are not built after rich people,” he says. They are built to commemorate individuals who improve the lives of the whole community. “This is the type I want.”

ON A HOT morning, Alidu opens one of the plastic bags in which she stores her cowpea beans to discover tiny brown weevils — a type of beetle — scurrying around inside. They have bored neat holes into the seeds. Before cooking, Alidu will have to put the cowpea in a pot and cover it with water so that the weevils float to the surface, where they can be seen and removed. She cannot sell this cowpea in the market, even if there is surplus at home.

Farmers in Zinindo are as troubled by weevil attacks on stored cowpea as they are by pests in the field. Yet the African Agricultural Technology Foundation does not yet have a project to address this problem.

Biotech scientists say it’s best to offer choices and let farmers decide which seeds best meet their needs.

“These [GM] technologies are being privileged at the expense of other potential interventions,” says Matthew Schnurr, a professor at Dalhousie University in Canada. Schnurr has been researching GM orphan crop projects in Africa for over a decade. He says it doesn’t make sense to introduce the crops without solving other problems, such as storage, in the agricultural supply chain.

GM cowpea’s main donor, USAID, does work to solve supply-chain issues for maize, rice, and soybean in Ghana. But it does not yet have a clear plan for how to reduce post-harvest losses for cowpea.

Some people, including Charles Kwowe Nyaaba of the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana, question whether GM cowpea is even necessary, given that Ghana already grows enough cowpea to feed its population. He wants the government and international aid organizations to use their money to build storage facilities, subsidize seeds and farm equipment, and create more demand for cowpea. Otherwise, overproduction could lead to price declines in local markets and the crop could rot in the field.

In fact, cowpea is one of the few food crops in Ghana not currently being processed for use in other products, says Irene Egyir, an agricultural economist at the University of Ghana. Sorghum, for example, is bought by breweries to make beer. If cowpea were similarly industrialized, says Egyir, this would increase demand and likely help cowpea farmers earn more money.

Distribution is also a problem. About 90 percent of Ghana’s cowpea is grown in the north, and while there’s unmet demand for cowpea farther south, bad roads and lack of storage, among other factors, have deterred traders, says Nyaaba.

In response to these criticisms, USAID and biotech scientists have argued that that there is no reason to pit one problem against the other. African Agricultural Technology Foundation officials have said they will work on reducing post-harvest losses in coming years.

Still, some social scientists doubt GM orphan crops will benefit poor farmers, even if the supply chain is improved. They say there is a gulf between these research projects and the specific needs of small farmers. Schnurr’s research on cooking banana, a staple food in Uganda, provides a case in point.

Traditional cooking banana is low in vitamin A, and almost half of children in sub-Saharan Africa are vitamin-A deficient. This makes them prone to diseases and blindness. So scientists are genetically modifying a banana to increase Vitamin A levels. But this particular variety will require farmers to apply more fertilizer and maintain specific sowing space. This could prove a barrier to poor farmers, who can’t afford additional fertilizer and have limited land. For these reasons, some poor farmers in Uganda may continue to plant their preferred traditional cooking banana varieties, which are not amenable to genetic modification. Schnurr says scientists should have first spoken to farmers to assess how many of them would grow genetically modified cooking banana.

“The donors and scientists probably have good intentions, and they want to help,” says Klara Fischer, an associate professor of rural development at the Swedish University of Agriculture Sciences. “But they are not doing enough groundwork with an open mindset.”

Almost all of Africa’s genetic modification projects are closely tied to Western organizations.

Fischer’s research in South Africa indicates that its GM maize, which resists a common pest that bores into the stalk of the plant, poses a challenge to poor farmers in particular because non-subsidized seeds are expensive and the crops require regular watering as well as synthetic fertilizers. While large-scale farmers can pay for fertilizer and have access to running water, poor farmers depend on rains, which sometimes come late. “The problem was that they wanted the small holder farmers to have the most modern maize,” says Fischer. “But the most modern maize was suited to a completely different kind of agriculture system.”

Still, Songotra — the cowpea variety that has been genetically modified — is already grown in about 20 percent of the cultivated area of Ghana’s Northern Region, and it is one of the varieties preferred by subsistence farmers. According to Mumuni Abudulai, principal investigator for the Bt cowpea project in Ghana, GM cowpea would not require poor farmers to do anything additional except maintain refuge — a practice in which non-GM crops are planted around GM crops making it more difficult for pests to develop resistance to the genes in GM crops. Whether the farmers will adequately maintain this practice, however, is not yet clear.

Both Schnurr and Brian Dowd-Uribe, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco who is researching a GM cowpea project in Burkina Faso, are concerned that orphan crop projects are likely to perpetuate the old agriculture development pattern which benefits rich farmers first and to a greater extent than the poor ones. Rich farmers are mostly literate, understand technology, and can afford risks. Sometimes poor farmers follow their lead after seeing the technology work. But “the goal of these projects is focused on small farmers,” says Schnurr. He believes the projects should be course-corrected to benefit them first instead of asking them to play catch up.

In other parts of the world, there is some evidence that genetically modified crops can help small farmers. A recent study from Bangladesh found that farmers who grew GM eggplant earned six times more per acre than those who grew conventional eggplant. In India, where GM food crops are not yet permitted, some farmers have started growing GM eggplant illegally because they believe it is less costly to grow.

Schnurr’s research has ruffled the feathers of some agriculture scientists in Africa. In an email shared with Undark, a Kenyan scientist cautioned his colleagues against meeting Schnurr, whom he feared could be peddling anti-GM propaganda.



Vivian Oduro, a biotech scientist in Ghana, says it is time that scientists speak louder than the anti-GM lobby if they want to change public perception. Image by Ankur Paliwal. Ghana, 2019.

The debate around genetically modified food in Africa is so polarized, says Schnurr, that there is little room for questioning on either side.

According to recent estimates, if GM cowpea is released next year, it will take five to 10 years for it to reach the projected maximum adoption rate of about 70 percent of farmers because of the negative perception surrounding GM foods. And yet, before Nashiru’s visit to Zinindo, many of the local farmers had never even heard of genetic modification. Some soon forgot the term, though they remembered that there is a technology that enables their cowpea to resist pests in the field. That, they said, is a good thing.

But because none of Zinindo’s farmers had actually grown GM cowpea, it was difficult for them to say anything more. Any concerns with the new technology had not yet reached them.

In some ways, this would appear to represent a small but important victory for proponents of Ghana’s GM cowpea, who have struggled to be heard above the voices of anti-GM activists. But whether the seeds will truly benefit small farmers like Alidu and her family — that remains an open question.",2019-08-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['crop', 'seeds', 'crops', 'bumper', 'scientists', 'farmers', 'food', 'opinions', 'modified', 'genetically', 'poor', 'gm', 'cowpea', 'ghana']",Ghana,news article,English
1372,FL-2019-000084-IND,South Asia monsoon leaves thousands in need - The New Humanitarian,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2019/07/15/south-asia-monsoon-india-bangladesh-nepal-floods-thousands-need,"BANGKOK

Monsoon floods and landslides sweeping through large swathes of South Asia have killed dozens of people and left hundreds of thousands displaced, stranded, or in need of basic aid with more heavy rains expected in the coming days.

Aid organisations are warning of growing humanitarian needs in parts of the region. Tirtha Prasad Saikia, joint director for the North-East Affected Area Development Society, or NEADS, a local NGO in India’s northeastern state of Assam, said his organisation’s assessment teams are seeing widespread damage to shelters, crops, and livestock, along with an urgent need for basics like food, drinking water, and sanitation.

“People are facing a serious crisis,” he told The New Humanitarian. “Government infrastructure like hospitals and schools are under water. It will take many days or many months to get it back to normal.”

In Assam the rains caused the Brahmaputra River to burst its banks, flooding more than 3,000 villages as of Sunday. State authorities say the floods have killed at least four people, and affected a total of 2.6 million. Disaster management officials have set up dozens of relief camps and distribution centres.

Floodwaters are also seeping downstream into Bangladesh, which is an enormous delta for the Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers. The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society said there is “massive” flooding in northern and northeastern Bangladesh.

And hilly southern districts like Chattogram and Cox’s Bazar – together home to nearly one million Rohingya refugees – are threatened by flash floods and landslides. At least 270,000 people in Bangladesh are already impacted and many communities have been “marooned” by the rising waters, humanitarian groups say.

A Red Crescent report tracking the humanitarian response in Bangladesh stated: “The current flood situation is likely to worsen in the coming days, as all major rivers in the affected districts are flowing above the danger mark with a rising trend.”

In Nepal, at least 65 people are dead and dozens more are missing, officials reported. More than 10,000 households have been displaced as heavy rainfall drenched parts of the country beginning Friday.

Elsewhere in India, at least 15 people are dead in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states, according to the Euopean Union’s humanitarian arm, ECHO. Both states straddle Nepal’s southern border.

Cross-border impacts

Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and parts of China and northern India are linked in a massive interconnected river basin, which sees excess water in higher-altitude regions flow downstream through heavily populated low-lying areas.

assamfloods-3.jpeg NEADS People wade through floodwaters in Assam’s Jorhat District.

Intense rains are common during this part of South Asia’s monsoon season, which typically lasts from June through October. During the 2017 monsoon, weeks of flooding affected 40 million and killed 1,200 people in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. Researchers say climate change made extreme rains in some parts of the region twice as likely in 2017.

This year’s floods haven’t reached 2017’s emergency levels. But there are pockets of concern in specific areas. In the Rohingya camps of southern Bangladesh, floods and landslides have displaced more than 5,000 people from their tent homes and affected roughly 5 percent of the settlements. UN agencies say it’s the most severe weather the camps have seen since more than 700,000 Rohingya were driven out of Myanmar beginning in August 2017.

“Many new villages that had not experienced floods for the last 30 years, they are now experiencing floods.”

In Assam, the intensity of this year’s floods is the worst in decades, said NEADS’ Saikia. Monsoon floods have become noticeably more damaging over the last five to eight years, he said – an outcome he blames on deforestation and mining in uphill areas, a failure to repair eroding riverbanks, and the changing climate.

“The character of floods is changing. The rivers are causing more damage to the people,” he said. “Many new villages that had not experienced floods for the last 30 years, they are now experiencing floods.”

828,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Ten Fish Landing Sites to Be Constructed Soon - Vice President Bawumia - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907080387.html,"Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia has given firm indication that government will soon build ten fish landing sites along the coastal areas of Ghana for the benefit of fishing communities.

The Vice President of the Republic, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia made the announcement on Saturday, 6th July, when he joined the people of Elmina to celebrate the 2019 Edina Bakatue festival to mark the beginning of a fishing season.

Celebrated under the theme, ""Buy made in Ghana goods; use goods made in Ghana and promote jobs for the youth"", Dr. Bawumia lauded the paramount chief of Elmina, Nana Kodwo Conduah VI, and the chiefs and people of Elmina, saying that the theme for this year's celebration was timely because it is line with President Akufo-Addo's vision of building a Ghana Beyond Aid, where we harness internal resources for the development of our country.

Addressing the durbar, Vice President Bawumia said the government's inclusive development agenda is designed to improve the quality of life of all Ghanaians regardless of geographical, religious or ethnic affiliations.

Currently at Elmina, sod has been cut for work to start on the Elmina Heritage Bay project. The first phase of this project is currently ongoing with enhanced durbar grounds and a reverential garden under construction.

Touching on the fish landing sites Dr. Bawunia stated that ""as part of the broader government agenda to provide fish landing sites along the coastal communities, funding for ten such fish landing sites has been secured and works shall begin soon. The ten sites where the landing sites and related facilities will be constructed include: Teshie in the Greater Accra Region, Axim and Dixcove in the Western Region, Elmina, Winneba, Mumford, Senya-Bereku, Fetteh-Gomoah and Moree in the Central Region and Keta in the Volta Region.""

""Measures to protect the coastline from the erosive effects of the sea has led to government constructing sea defense walls along the coast"".

""The Navy and Marine Police are also being assisted to beef up patrols to ensure that perpetrators of illegal fishing are dealt with, Vice President Bawumia indicated"", he added.

Dr. Bawumia urged Edinaman to take advantage of the numerous social interventions introduced by the Akufo-Addo government.

""I urge the people of Elmina to take advantage of the interventions provided under the Planting for Food and Jobs, Rearing for Food and jobs and Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) programmes:

""To my gallant farmers, in our effort to produce more let us not forget about the future generations. We must do everything possible to protect and preserve our environment for their use"" he said.

""Chainsaw operations remain a serious threat to the environment. The uncontrolled use of pesticides and weedicides is also a serious threat to the environment and our health. I urge our Agriculture officers to intensify the education on use of the chemicals."" Vice President Bawumia added.

The Vice President was grateful to the people for the cooperation from all stakeholders and assured them of government's continous effort to have such collaboration in many other fields in a mutually beneficial manner.

On behalf of his people, Nana Kodwo Conduah VI, Omanhen of Edina Traditional Area, praised the government for the Elmina Heritage Bay Tourism Project and called for all to unite to accelerate development in Elmina.

He also commended President Akufo-Addo for the numerous social interventions introduced in the past two and a half years.",2019-07-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['vice', 'president', 'landing', 'sites', 'fish', 'development', 'soon', 'constructed', 'bawumia', 'dr', 'ghana', 'elmina']",Ghana,news article,English
1546,FL-2020-000038-EGY,"Parliament demands time frame for drip irrigation transformation, irrigation minister farmland production increased, water consumption reduced - Egypttoday",https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/96818/Parliament-demands-time-frame-for-drip-irrigation-transformation-irrigation-minister,"CAIRO – 25 January 2021: The House of Representatives demanded direct subsidies for farmers to transform from flood to drip irrigation while the minister of water resources was listing his work on Monday.

Nine ministries cooperate with the Water Resources Ministry to implement the national plan for water at a cost of L.E. 900 billion, a figure that may double in time, Minister Mohamed Abdel Aaty told the parliament.

Complaints about the lack of water in 2020 were the fewest in 20 years, Abdel Aaty said, adding that the production of a feddan increased from 25% to 30% with a 70%-reduction in water consumption as part of the national drip irrigation project.

Modern irrigation systems have been applied over 4 million feddans, and in areas where such systems will not be used a smart irrigation system has been applied instead, according to the minister.

Some 5,000 sensors manufactured by Military Production factories will be installed in farmlands and will notify farmers on their phones about the time to water crops according to the need of the soil, Abdel Aaty said.

The lack of irrigation water can be alleviated by importing certain crops such as wheat, he said, highlighting that Egypt is one of the most efficient countries in terms of water consumption and recycling.

He continued to say that an integrated plan was set in 2021 to counter the effects of global warming, and protection projects were implemented at a cost of 10 million since 2016. Buildings worth more than L.E. 100 billion have been saved from floods in northern Delta, thanks to early response mechanism, the minister said, adding that 280,000 meters in infringements have been cleared from the bays of the Nile.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and global warming are amongst the most urgent issues before the ministry and concerted efforts by the entire government have to be exerted to face them, Abdel Aaty said, noting that his ministry tackles the technical part of the GERD issue and the Foreign Ministry tackles the political and legal parts.

He asked the parliament to approve a draft law from the ministry on new irrigation systems and water resources, while MPs asked him to lift farmer debts and for a time frame for smart irrigation and depolluting waterways.",2021-01-25 08:00:00+00:00,"['parliament', 'increased', 'frame', 'farmland', 'water', 'transformation', 'tackles', 'abdel', 'production', 'reduced', 'irrigation', 'ministry', 'resources', 'aaty', 'systems', 'minister', 'warming']",Egypt,news article,English
1509,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt expects above-average Nile flood amid GERD crisis - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online,https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/379086/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-expects-aboveaverage-Nile-flood-amid-GERD-cr.aspx,"The Egyptian irrigation ministry expects the Nile flood to be higher than average this year due to rain adding to the Blue Nile’s flow, but noted it is still too early to confirm the extent of the flooding.

The comments came during a meeting of the committee for regulating the flow of the Nile, headed by Irrigation Minister Mohamed Abdel Aty.

As Egypt last year witnessed the strongest flooding in 50 years, according to an earlier statement by the ministry, without reported harm, it is likely that the expected increase in this year’s flood will be good news.

The news comes as Egypt is embroiled in a long-standing dispute with Ethiopia over the massive dam it is building on the Blue Nile, which Cairo worries could cut its water supply.

Addis Ababa completed the first filling of the dam’s reservoir, which has a capacity of 74 billion cubic metres, earlier this summer, retaining 4.9 billion cubic metres of water.

In addition, flooding in Sudan in recent weeks has killed dozens of people and destroyed more than 35,000 houses.

The average level of the Blue Nile has reached 17.43 metres, the highest since the country started measuring in 1912, Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas said last week.

The Nile flood takes place in August, September and October, caused by heavy rain in the Ethiopian highlands.

The rate of rainfall is growing, the Egyptian ministry said in its Monday statement, adding that a final confirmation of the extent of the floods can only be given in September and October.

The ministry referenced floods in Khartoum and the increased water level, saying it coordinates and exchanges information with the Sudanese irrigation ministry and carries out joint water level measurements.

Abdel Aty ordered officials to continue removing illegal structures on waterways, especially those on the Nile, as such encroachments limit the capability of the water networks to contain excess water in the times of emergency and flooding.

GERD filling

Ethiopia started filling the reservoir of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in July despite the lack of a legal binding agreement with the downstream countries Sudan and Egypt.

Egypt and Sudan hope to secure a legal agreement with Ethiopia to secure their water shares during periods of drought.

Abdel Aty also warned in July warned that Sudan would be totally destroyed if the mega-dam collapses.

Egyptian irrigation ministry spokesman Mohamed El-Sebaie expects the first filling of the reservoir not to harm Egypt this year, thanks to water reserves at Lake Nasser.

The filling “will not affect [Egypt] this year… because we have taken [water] from the reserves of Lake Nasser that had been saved over the past years,"" El-Sebaie said.

He said plans adopted by Egypt to reduce water consumption have helped increase reserves in Lake Nasser, which can be used in case of drought.

1325,FL-2019-000084-IND,UNITED SIKHS HOST MEDICAL CAMP & CLOTHING DRIVE FOR FLOOD - GlobeNewswire,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/06/1898074/0/en/UNITED-SIKHS-HOST-MEDICAL-CAMP-CLOTHING-DRIVE-FOR-FLOOD-SURVIVORS.html,"ASSAM, INDIA, Aug. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the death toll mounts to 91 this monsoon season, UNITED SIKHS continue to offer humanitarian relief for flood survivors, including a free medical camp. In coordination with the Army’s Sikh Regiment, UNITED SIKHS volunteers are providing free physician check-ups and medicine.



""The steady rain, receding waters and contaminated wells and drinking sources present the perfect storm for potential outbreaks,"" said Dr. Bhupender Kaur, UNITED SIKHS Volunteer. ""It is important to provide both preventative care and medicine to the flood survivors to help combat the spread of deadly diseases. We look forward to working with the Sikh Regiment to offer medical care free of charge to those in need.""



""Humanitarian work is crucial to save lives and must be carried out to all survivors in need, regardless of race, religion and ethnicity,"" said UNITED SIKHS CEO Jagdeep Singh. ""Service to all without discrimination is the ultimate manifestation of spiritual teachings and this is required today more than ever in the world.""



The medical camp joins UNITED SIKHS efforts already taking place on the ground, as the non-profit has been serving daily nutritious vegetarian meals, including rice, dal and vegetables, and providing shelter at their humanitarian relief camp at Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha. To date, volunteers have served fresh daily meals to more than 2,000 flood survivors every day since the disaster struck.



""It has been an honor to serve these communities in their time of need and demonstrate the impact of seva (selfless service),"" said Mohinderjit Singh, UNITED SIKHS Director. ""Through our commitment to uplift humanity in times of disaster, we are blessed to be able to work for the community and Gurdwara leadership to provide free medical care, food, shelter and clothing. This humanitarian crisis must be addressed on all fronts to help survivors in their long-term recovery.""



In addition to medical services and daily Langar (community meal service), UNITED SIKHS volunteers have launched a clothing drive, providing enough garments for 300 families. As personal belongings along with entire homes have been swept away with receding waters, the need for non-food relief items also remains paramount, including apparel, tarpaulin, bed sheets, blankets, mosquito nets, ropes and sleeping mats.



According to a bulletin released by the Assam State Disaster Management authority (ASDMA), 12.24 lakh people are affected by floods. The highest number of victims is in Barpeta (8.19 lakh), Morigaon (2.01 lakh) and Goalpara (over 1 lakh) districts. A total of 1,113 villages have been hit by floods.



Local drinking water sources, including open wells and hand pumps, have been contaminated and are unusable. Government officials reported that more than 1.7 million people in Assam have lost their homes. Nearly 2 million people have been displaced in nearby Bihar.



Assam has been facing dire floods since around July 10, when heavy monsoon rainfall caused the Brahmaputra River and many of its tributaries to flood, as reported by The Weather Channel. The rising waters inundated thousands of villages and displaced lakhs of people. More than 200 animals are reported dead at Kaziranga National Park.



On Monday, the Central Water Commission said the Brahmaputra River was flowing above the danger level at Neamatighat in Jorhat and Dhubri. The Dhansiri River was also above the danger mark at Numaligarh, the Jia Bharali in Sonitpur, and the Kushiyara at Karimganj.



As moderate rain and thundershowers is forecast over Assam and other parts of the northeast for the coming days, UNITED SIKHS is urging for public support and making a call for donations to aid humanitarian relief efforts. All contributions go directly to the organization’s Sikh Aid program.



""We can only do this life-saving work through the generous contributions of our supporters,"" said Gurvinder Singh, UNITED SIKHS Global Sikh Aid Director. ""We are grateful for all donations, however large or small. Flood survivors have lost everything -- every little bit goes extremely far in uplifting them on their road to recovery in the wake of such a large-scale disaster.""



For the latest updates on the ground situation, please follow UNITED SIKHS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. All relief efforts are made possible due to the generous contributions of our donors and supporters. To donate, please visit: https://unitedsikhs.org/donate-in-india/.

695,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,What Pick n Pay's results tell us about retail in sub-Saharan Africa - How we made it in Africa,https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/pick-n-pays-results-tell-us-retail-sub-saharan-africa/58320/,"South African supermarket chain Pick n Pay this week released its financial results for the year ending 26 February 2017. Headline earnings per share rose 18%, while turnover growth of 7% reflects the tough consumer environment in South Africa, Pick n Pay’s largest market. Outside South Africa, the retailer has stores in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe .

How we made it in Africa’s Justin Probyn looks at what Pick n Pay’s results and associated commentary tell us about the state of retail in sub-Saharan Africa.

1. Online retail gaining traction

Online retail in South Africa seems to be gaining traction. Pick n Pay’s e-commerce turnover in the Western Cape province grew 30% year-on-year, driven by the success of a dedicated online picking warehouse situated close to Cape Town. As a result of the performance of this warehouse, the group opened a second one outside Johannesburg at the end of 2016.

Despite low profit margins in online retail, the group still views it as a growth engine. “Customers definitely like it, and you definitely have to be in it,” said CEO Richard Brasher. “You can’t ignore the future, so you better be involved in it.”

2. Strained consumers seek value

South African customers across all socio-economic groups are seeking lower prices and better value for their money. The South African economy grew by only 0.3% last year, and the rand came under significant pressure. Consumers had less money for more expensive products.

Last month Pick n Pay announced a R500m (US$38m) investment to lower prices, starting with reductions across 1,300 grocery lines, with a particular focus on fresh meat, fruit and vegetables.

“Customers are more price sensitive and are shopping more frequently for smaller baskets,” said the group’s CFO Bakar Jakoet.

3. Shoppers want convenience

The group currently has 111 Pick n Pay Express stores – double what it had two years ago. The rapid growth of these outlets, in tandem with the rising number of smaller-format Pick n Pay Local stores, suggests consumers want to shop smaller trolley sizes, more frequently and from convenient locations.

The group believes the future of convenience shopping is not only selling snacks, but also fresh foods and produce in small stores that are close to where people live.

4. Nigeria remains on the radar

Nigeria has proved to be a difficult market for some South African retailers. In 2013 Woolworths said it would close its stores in the country, blaming high rental costs, duties and supply chain challenges. Last year fashion chain Truworths also pulled out due to difficult regulations and problems getting money out of the country. Nigeria has been hard hit by the fall in the oil price, with the economy contracting by an estimated 1.75% in 2016. But despite these difficulties, Pick n Pay still sees opportunities in the west African country, with its first Nigerian store expected to open over the next two years.

5. Money to be made in Zimbabwe, despite tough economy

Pick n Pay’s associate in Zimbabwe, TM Supermarkets (TM), delivered strong performance, despite a tough macroeconomic environment, characterised by liquidity constraints, rising unemployment and falling consumer confidence. Its share of TM’s earnings grew 74.7% to R80.2m (about $6.1m), representing growth in local currency terms of 71.8%. TM has 56 stores in Zimbabwe, 16 of which trade under the Pick n Pay banner.

“We use Zimbabwe as a testament to the fact that whatever the headwinds, you can improve a business for customers,” Brasher said.

6. Zambia holds long-term opportunities

In Zambia economic performance was impacted by drought and related water and power outages, as well as a low copper price. This in turn dampened retail activity. However, notwithstanding current economic headwinds the country faces, the group remains positive of its long-term opportunity. Pick n Pay opened six new stores this year as part of its ongoing investment in Zambia, bringing the total up to 17 stores in-country as of February 2017.",2017-04-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'stores', 'pick', 'group', 'pay', 'african', 'tell', 'pays', 'south', 'zambia', 'zimbabwe', 'subsaharan', 'n', 'results', 'retail']",Ghana,news article,English
69,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"Fracking's impact on wildlife remains unknown, study finds - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/13/frackings-impact-on-wildlife-remains-unknown-study-finds,"A decade into North America’s fracking boom, the impact on wildlife and the environment remains largely unknown, according to a new study.

“We’re conducting a giant experiment without even collecting the important data on the water, air, land or wildlife impacts,” said Sara Souther, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin, one of the co-authors of the peer-reviewed research examining the environmental impacts of shale gas development in the US and Canada.

Although the technique of hydraulic fracturing shale has been used for at least 20 years, there is “surprisingly little research” on impacts, found the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.

“We do know chemical contamination of ground and surface water is happening all the time but no one knows what the impacts are because the data isn’t being collected,” Souther said.

Spills, accidents, leaks from well casings and the dumping of toxic wastewater into streams are regular occurrences but no one knows the extent, she said. Often the data is not being compiled, while some US states do not even ask the the industry to report “minor” spills or accidents. In nearly all cases it is up to companies to “self-report”.



The industry has long claimed there is no proof of water contamination. Souther accepted this until she learned that baseline studies had not been done before an area was fracked.



Water contamination tops a long list of environmental impacts including air and noise pollution and habitat fragmentation – but in all cases there is little information, making it impossible to get a big picture of these multiple stressors on wildlife and the environment, she said.



“It’s crazy. How can we know what the real risks are without any basic information?”



The fracking industry also enjoys an exemption from the US Safe Drinking Water Act. That means the US Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate the injection of chemicals into shale gas wells. Two-thirds of the 150 wells researchers investigated used at least one undisclosed chemical - some used 20 or more.

Fracking sites operate with lots of noise, lights, flaring of gas and heavy vehicle traffic operating 24/7. The very few studies on wildlife impacts show that rare species like the sage grouse are being driven from their nest areas. Large parts of the Marcellus shale gas region is in the poor but heavily forested regions of Appalachia.



“These are the most biodiverse temperate forests in the world,” said Souther.

Fracking has exploded in the US since 2007. Hundreds of thousands of wells have now been fracked, which involves the deep underground injection of millions of litres of water and chemicals. Nine out 10 of the 11,000 to 12,000 new gas and oil wells drilled every year now use the technique.



Shale gas accounted for 39% of all natural gas produced last year in the United States and about 15% in Canada.



While gas wells are next door to schools and homes, and in the middle of farm fields, most are in remote areas.



“Forests or grasslands that were once continuous are now islands fragmented by a dense web of roads, pipelines and well pads. At what point does the canvas fall apart?” said co-author Viorel Popescu, an ecologist at Canada’s Simon Fraser University.



The UK and any other country should conduct careful scientific studies on impacts with some pilot projects before plunging into full-scale shale gas development, she said.

“Bottom line: Shale gas has not been proven safe for freshwater or the environment.”

According to the CBC, Saint-Marie regularly experiences high rainfall in the spring, but this year’s downpour surpassed normal levels, resulting in flood damage that cut electricity and stranded residents in the area.

With flood waters now receded, Bimbo Canada, Vachon’s owner, said more than 75 bakery employees and other Canadian associates are assessing damage and working to get the Saint-Marie facility up and running to resume pastry and cake production. Operations are scheduled to recommence in eight weeks if employee safety and quality assurance measures can be met.

“We deeply appreciate everyone who has supported us through this challenging time — our dedicated associates, our management team at the bakery, our customers, our loyal consumers, numerous public safety municipal, provincial and federal partners, and the Sainte-Marie community,” said Marie-Ève Royer, vice-president, national sales, Bimbo Canada. “We are committed to the community and appreciate the skills of our Sainte-Marie associates. We are a proud contributor to the local and regional economies and intend to remain so in the years to come.”

Over the next few days, Bimbo Canada will meet with Vachon employees to update them on the plant’s status and answer any questions they may have. In addition, the company said it is working with union representatives and the Canadian government to support personnel.

Bimbo Canada has partnered with the Red Cross to raise funds for those affected by the flooding and will be matching donations.

1408,FL-2019-000179-CAN,'It's like that friend who betrayed you': Emotional toll of flooding is felt long after waters recede - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/the-national-after-the-flood-new-brunswick-1.5170873,"If you didn't live through one of the catastrophic floods that hit Canada this spring, you might think they're over.

Once the water recedes, it easy to assume that people's lives return to normal. After all, when the rivers and lakes go back down, the story disappears from the news and the public's attention turns elsewhere.

But what happens to the people still living in the flood zone?

Many Canadians experienced some of the worst flooding in recorded history this spring — one of the hardest-hit areas in New Brunswick, where more than 5,500 homes flooded or were threatened, was still recovering from a 2018 inundation. The National sent reporter Nick Purdon and producer Leonardo Palleja to to find out what happens after the flood.

Dawn Burke

""Every time the waves hit, the house shook.""

Dawn Burke remembers how the water of Grand Lake rose so high that it reached the ceiling of the main floor inside her house.

""It wasn't worth risking our lives to be in there, so that's when we left,"" she says.

(CBC)

Climate change is a critical issue for our readers, viewers and listeners. Recent polling suggests that it is a leading concern in this election year. In Our Backyard is an ambitious and comprehensive CBC News project about how climate change is affecting our lives. You'll see and hear it wherever CBC News is: online, on television, on the radio and on CBC Kids News, because Canada's youth care deeply about this issue.

That spring day in 2018, her house battered and completely surrounded by water, Burke, 52, and her husband didn't believe there was anything they could do to save it.

So instead they went to help a neighbour.

When they finally returned to the house, Burke says she opened the front door and water poured out.

Grand Lake flooding CBC News 0:22 Dawn Burke's video of waves pounding through a doorway and into her house on New Brunswick's Grand Lake during spring flooding in 2018. 0:22

""That was very dramatic,"" she says. ""But I didn't cry for it. I didn't cry once for it,"" even though it was the home where she had raised her six children.

""I think for me it was more important to show my kids that material possessions come and go, and that's not what is going to define what we are,"" Burke says. ""There was a lesson there for us all to learn.""

Dawn Burke stands where her house once was on the shores of Grand Lake in New Brunswick. 'Even today when you look at how far away the lake is, it's hard to believe that the flood actually happened,' she says. (Nick Purdon/CBC)

Burke says it would have cost more to fix her house than it was worth.

In the end, the province paid Burke a percentage of its value and the family walked away.

Now they've started again.

""My husband is 64 — we never thought at our age we'd be trying to come up with a downpayment,"" she says.

""But what's the choice?"" she adds.

This spring the family managed to buy a house — far outside the flood zone.

Burke admits she'll miss the lake she loves, but she won't risk being flooded again.

""How high do you build?"" Burke asks. ""How bad are the floods going to get? So that was a struggle for us.""

Sarah Kirstead

Childhood for Sarah Kirstead was all about the cottage her grandfather built almost 50 years ago.

""We played hide and seek, we picked berries, and had campfires all the time,"" she says. ""The cottage was home. I think what it was to me as a child was freedom.""

Sarah Kirstead grew up on the shores of Grand Lake. She learned to walk at her grandparents' cottage and had some of the most memorable moments of her childhood there. (Sarah Kirstead)

Then the flood of 2018 destroyed it.

Kirstead, 22, who is now a professional photographer, has used her camera to make sense of her loss.

""I remember standing in what was their kitchen — the whole front of the cottage was open to the water, the walls were completely gone,"" she says.

""I thought, 'I lost an era of my life.'""

Kirstead was devastated when her grandparents' cottage was destroyed by the 2018 floods. 'I guess it's such a stark reality that nothing is permanent. I think that's what hit me about it,' she says. (Sarah Kirstead)

Kirstead is worried about her grandparents, too, because she knows how much they loved the cottage.

""There was a little bedroom — that was grammy's room,"" Kirstead remembers. ""She used to have a window right onto the lake and she would always listen for the waves in there.""

Kirstead says her grandmother was usually at the window of the cottage looking out at the lake when Sarah came to visit.

""In a way it's gone, but it's still here too,"" Kirstead says.

""That's one thing my grandmother said when we were processing the aftermath. She was like, 'You know, the view is still there. At least the view is still there.'""

Kirstead recalls some of her childhood memories as she sits near the site where her grandparents' cottage used to be. (Nick Purdon/CBC)

Kirstead's family decided not to rebuild the cottage. With catastrophic floods two years in a row, they say the water levels are too unpredictable.

Instead, Kirstead's grandparents have parked a trailer near the spot — but higher up and closer to the road.

Kirstead says the flooding has taught her a lot about which things in life really last.

""You want to feel secure and permanent, but I don't necessarily need the cottage to physically be there to understand what it meant to me growing up.

""That's still there,"" she says.

Lisa Sanderson

""I haven't actually been down to the beach since the flood,"" Lisa Sanderson admits as she stares out at the St. John River.

On this day the river is perfectly calm.

""I just…"" she tries to explain, but pauses.

""It's a little too real to see the water.""

Sanderson stands on the shore of the St. John River, which has threatened to flood her home twice in two years. (Nick Purdon/CBC)

Sanderson has been through a lot over the past couple of years.

She and her partner checked the historical flood data before they bought the property in 2012 — water had never come close to the house.

They thought they were safe.

Then in 2018 it took 2,500 sandbags, a dozen people and days of pumping water out of her house to save it.

A flood like that wasn't supposed to happen more than once in her lifetime — but then the water rose again this spring.

One of the things she has learned about floods, Sanderson says, is that they don't get easier the more they happen.

They get harder.

""This year the helplessness was worse. The anxiety was worse, because you know what to expect,"" she says. ""You know how hard it is to see the water coming. It's a feeling of doom and dread. It feels like it is attacking your life.""

It took a wall of thousands of sandbags and a team of people working around the clock to save Sanderson's home from the floodwaters. (Lisa Sanderson)

Sanderson says she has decided to seek counselling to help her with the stress of the floods.

""It's really hard. You picture your life here,"" she says. ""It looks like just a little piece of land to someone, but to us it perks us up when we come home — every single day. But at the same time, we can't go through what we went through the last couple of years.""

Sanderson, a high school music teacher in St. John, isn't sure what to do. She and her partner have discussed building a flood wall, and they've looked into moving, too — but how do you sell a house that floods?

""Who is going to want to build here? Who is going to want to live here?

""It was never a concern before,"" Sanderson adds. ""Things are changing. The world is changing.""

To stay or go? CBC News 0:39 When Lisa Sanderson bought her home on New Brunswick's Saint John River in 2012, historical data showed that floodwaters had never been recorded near the building. But the house has now been threatened by flooding twice in the past two years, and she's struggling with what to do next. 0:39

Standing on the beach as the sun begins to set, Sanderson admits her perspective on the St. John River has changed too.

""When we first came down here this was one of the selling points — standing here and looking at this river,"" she says.

And now?

""It's like that friend who betrayed you who you still hang out with — you're just careful.""

In his speech before Congress on Thursday, President Obama is expected to mention one state program that he says is working to create jobs in this bad economy.

It's called Georgia Work$, and it's a voluntary program that pays people who are receiving unemployment benefits a small stipend while they receive up to eight weeks of on-the-job training at a participating company, in the hope that they get hired. The companies, in essence, get free labor, while employees get a chance at a more permanent job.

About 25 percent of participants do get hired immediately after the program, and within 90 days 60 percent had found jobs.

The National Employment Law Center is concerned that the program is a misuse of unemployment funds and exploits workers. But more than 30 states are now considering starting programs similar to Georgia Work$.

240,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Where Is All the Coal? - Slate Magazine,https://slate.com/technology/2012/11/coal-reserves-in-the-united-states-geology-explains-why-we-have-so-much-coal.html,"When you think of the vast expanse of wet prairies in Florida’s Everglades, the peat-filled wetlands of Georgia’s Okefenokee Swamp, or the Amazon River Delta, coal isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. But these landscapes are modern-day examples of the enormous, ancient inland seas and dense tropical swamps that turned into today’s coal beds. Much of the world’s coal dates back to the Carboniferous Period, some 318 million years ago, and contains plant matter and fossils from before the era of the dinosaurs.

Coal is America’s mighty rock. Because coal burns at a slow rate for a long time, it’s more efficient as an energy source than other fossil fuels. And the United States is naturally well-endowed with coal resources—25 percent of the world’s coal reserves are within our borders. Coal has been the leading electricity source worldwide, and over the past 10 years it has supplied one-half of the increase in global energy demand, growing even faster than renewables. And now it’s one of the most fiercely disputed fuels.

There is a dark side to coal. It produces more carbon dioxide when burned than other fossil fuels do and adds disproportionately to global climate change. Ecological costs are abundant, too, and range from mountain-top removal mining to air pollution to coal ash spills.

Advertisement

Coal exports from the United States this year are expected to reach 125 million tons, breaking the previous record of 113 million tons set in 1981. And according to the World Energy Council, the world’s coal use is expected to rise 60 percent by 2030, with developing countries responsible for 97 percent of this increase.

To understand the conflicts surrounding coal, it helps to step back and review how we came to have this contested resource. The two main ingredients in the recipe for coal are peat and time. Decayed plant matter and sediment accumulated in large basins in the Earth’s crust to form peat. Over millions of years, layers of mushy peat accumulated in geologic basins and were buried by sediment that accumulated little by little, from stormwater runoff or the wind, for instance. Over time, the basin of sediment sank below the Earth’s surface.

Depending on tectonic forces, such as the stability of the earth’s crust in the area or an uplift in mountain ranges, the peat deposits ended up deep underground or closer to the surface. As the buried sediment compacted under pressure, water was squeezed from the peat, natural heat from the earth’s core baked it, and coal formed, a process called coalification.

Peter Warwick of the U.S. Geological Survey says coalificaiton is like the cartoon image of Superman squeezing a chunk of coal to make a diamond. “It’s the same concept. You need to compact and squeeze this peat to form coal,” he said; coal is just “concentrated carbon.”

The United States had three major coal-forming periods: the Pennsylvanian (318-299 million years ago), which formed the Appalachian coal beds; the Cretaceous (145-65 million years ago), which formed coal in Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico; and the early Tertiary (65-35 million years ago), which led to major coal deposits in Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and Texas.

During these three periods, what is now dry land contained large inland seas and lakes. On the edges of these bodies of water were warm, swampy coastal plains that filled in with decaying plants. We don’t have those vast regions today, but places like the warm, wet coastlines of Indonesia and the Okefenokee are now accumulating peat, Warwick says.

During the geologic past, sea level was much higher at times than sea level today. The United States spans part of a continent that was flooded during the major coal-forming times, which led to the formation of broad coastal plains where peat could accumulate, Warwick says. “Add a warm climate and all this contributed to our coal endowment,” added Warwick. It’s a lucky past. Other continents may not have had all these conditions at the time, so peat and coal preservation many not have been as great.

Appalachia and the Illinois Basin have some of the oldest, largest coal deposits. Coal in these areas is found in seams a few hundred feet beneath the earth’s surface, and is mined underground from tunnels or in open pit mines, because it’s mostly deep. This coal east of the Mississippi is primarily a dense, high grade of coal, called bituminous, that contains up to 85 percent carbon. Pennsylvania’s northeast coal fields contain small deposits of the hardest, oldest grade of coal on earth, called anthracite, which is up to 98 percent carbon.

Advertisement

Western coal is younger and a different kind of coal altogether. It’s a much softer version, called sub-bituminous coal, that contains less than 45 percent carbon. Nearly one-half of the coal reserves in the United States are sub-bituminous, and most of it is located in thick beds near the surfaces. While sub-bituminous coal has a lower energy content than bituminous coal, it is mined cheaply in large quantities, making it a low-cost energy source. The Power River Basin in Wyoming, a surface mine, produced 40 percent of all coal mined in the United States in 2011. This coal releases less sulfur dioxide when burned, but power plants need to burn 50 percent more of it to match the higher energy content of Eastern coal.

In 2011, the United States had 259 billion tons of known recoverable coal reserves, more than any other country. But the United States is using less coal itself, so the industry is shrinking even as exports are up. While election campaign rhetoric focused on coal mine job losses in Central Appalachia, a variety of factors play a role in what’s happening to coal. The long, slow decline doesn’t have much to do with whatever economic incentives or regulations are batted about in political speeches. Near-record cheap natural gas has slowed coal use in some regions. In the next four years, 175 small, aging, less-efficient coal generators (accounting for 8.5 percent of total U.S. coal-fired capacity) are expected to close. The plants are located mostly in the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio River Valley regions.

In China and India, coal plants are being built left and right. In Europe, and especially Germany, which is retiring its nuclear power plant fleet, coal is experiencing a renaissance because it’s a cheaper replacement than natural gas.

The coal we burn today was millions of years in the making. We continue to extract and burn vast amounts of it. Given current trends, we’ll run out of it in 225 years or so. In human terms, we have a few generations to figure this out. In geologic time, it’s almost gone.",2012-11-13 08:00:00+00:00,"['geology', 'explains', 'peat', 'sediment', 'states', 'plants', 'million', 'warwick', 'united', 'energy', 'coal', 'earths', 'reserves']",India,news article,English

In remarks to Egypt Today, Mahmoud Nafei, chairman of the relevant sewerage company, said 300,000 drains have been cleaned, making up 98 percent of drains across the governorate.

Heavy rains in the northern governorate and also Cairo caused floods, obstructed traffic and inundated cars several times during rainy seasons over the past years.

In March this year, several people died as heavy rains hit the capital.

The preparations in Alexandria come two weeks after Upper Egypt and the Red Sea coast have been struck with floods after heavy rain, prompting the police traffic department to close off several highways in the area.

The western Sohag-Qena road, Sheikh-Fadl-Ras Ghareb road, Qift-Quseir road, Safaga-Sohag road, Luxor-Nag Hammadi road, Luxor-Wadi Gedid road, Ghareb-Minya were closed.

In western Luxor, rain falling down from Ruzaiqat mountain caused floods. The city council dispatched equipment to change the course of the torrent into flood drainage systems so it does not reach homes in this mountainous area.

1938,FL-2020-000207-NGA,The new 'jollof wars' and why Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria for its first Africa base - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/14/the-new-jollof-wars-and-why-twitter-chose-ghana-over-nigeria-for-its-first-africa-base/,"National-World

Twitters announcement Monday that it will set up its first Africa base in Ghana, West Africa, has generated fierce debate among Nigerian users of the social media app, and reignited the never-ending rivalry between the two countries, known colloquially as the jollof wars.

Many Nigerians believe that Twitters decision is a snub to the continents largest economy, which is seeing rapid growth and investment in its tech scene.

According to NOI polls, 39.6 million Nigerians have a Twitter account, which is more than the entire 32 million population of Ghana.

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey capped a whirlwind tour of Africa in 2019 by pledging to move to the continent for several months in 2020.

Now it seems that his business will make that move first.

In a statement announcing the decision, Twitter described Ghana as a champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet.

The social media giant also cited Ghanas hosting of the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) as another reason for moving there, saying it aligns with its ambition to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa.

Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said the choice of Ghana as headquarters for Twitters Africa operations is EXCELLENT news, and described it as a beautiful partnership between Ghana and Twitter and which is critical for the devt of Ghanas hugely important tech sector.

No ease of doing business

Some Nigerians blamed an inconducive business environment for Twitter choosing Ghana over Nigeria.

Under @MBuhari our ease of doing business is so bad that its easier for terrorists to get phone lines than law-abiding residents. You can land at Ghanas Kotoka Airport and get a SIM card at the airport. But a camel has to pass through the eye of a needle to get one in Nigeria, said Reno Omokri via Twitter, a former presidential aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan.

Omokri was referring to the suspension of new phone lines registration because of a federal government policy to link all active SIM cards in the country to a national identity number (NIN) for security reasons.

The exercise is time consuming and the deadline has been extended multiple times, leaving new arrivals unable to obtain a local number, until at least May.

Another Twitter user, lawyer Moe Odele wrote: One of our clients wanted to open shop in Nigeria for their West Africa office. Once we sent them a breakdown of the regulatory requirements for their industry (also tech), they hit us with we will get back to you. We havent heard back since then.

Another commenter, Onye Ajuju, said Twitters decision was justified and that Nigerians had a bloated sense of entitlement.

Its unbelievable seeing Nigerians throwing a tantrum because Twitter went to Ghana. The lack of awareness of how bad things are in the country, the bloated sense of entitlement, the unhinged expectations that everyone should accept Nigerias dysfunctionits incredible! she said.

In 2019, Ghana ranked 13 places higher than Nigeria in the World Banks ease of doing business index.

Google,Microsoft and Huawei are among international tech giants that have expanded their operations in Ghana, targeting software developers and young creatives on the continent.

In 2018, Facebook opened its first community hub space in Africa in Nigerias commercial city, Lagos, while announcing plans last year to open an operational office also in Lagos, but for tech investors such as Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, there are lessons to be learned if Nigeria will continue to attract much-needed foreign investment.

We have to think carefully about the reasons why Twitter chose Ghana  not necessarily in the context of whether we want to bring Twitter to Nigeria or not, but in the context of what it will take for us to remain a competitive destination for investors, Aboyeji told CNN on Tuesday.

We need to start thinking very carefully about enhancing democracy and the rule of law, freedom of speech, and most importantly, our role in enabling the Africa Free Trade Agreement. Its not enough for us to just be a big market We have next door to us, a very competitive neighbor, whos doing all the right things to make itself the hub of West Africa, he added.

A more productive market

Another Nigerian tech entrepreneur and investor Bosun Tijani, told CNN that Twitter simply chose a more productive market to run its Africa operations.

While Nigeria has a huge market that Twitter would love to target, the business environment here is quite demanding Its strenuousthe cost of running a business here is high. But with the AfCFTA single market agreement which Africa is signed up to, a company like Twitter can choose to set up shop in a small market like Ghana  that gives the best opportunity for it to operate  and still serve the Nigerian market, said Tijani, who heads a tech innovation lab, CcHUB.

From tourism to tech, Ghana has been actively courting investors from the diaspora and in particular African-Americans, some of whom were given citizenship and encouraged to return to their roots.

Ghana also ranked as the 43rd most peaceful country in the world, in the 2020 Global Peace Index, placing 104 spots ahead of Nigeria  which grapples with Boko Haram insurgency and periodic outbreaks of violence.",2021-04-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['tech', 'market', 'twitter', 'chose', 'nigerians', 'doing', 'west', 'jollof', 'ghana', 'wars', 'nigeria', 'base', 'business', 'africa']",Nigeria,news article,English

The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will provide Thua Thien-Hue Province with 50 water purifiers and 250 plastic sheets immediately, Nguyen Hoang Hiep, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said at a meeting Monday, Voice of Vietnam reported.

This was part of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's commitment to provide immediate disaster relief for Vietnam to cope with the recent flooding in the central region.

PM Suga wrapped up a three-day official visit to Vietnam Tuesday.

The first batch of JICAs aid arrived at the Da Nang Airport on Monday.

The intergovernmental ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Center) has donated 1,000 shelter repair kits and 1,300 kitchen sets to Vietnam to address the immediate needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by the flooding.

The United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam have pledged or mobilized $100,000 each towards helping central Vietnam deal with the historic flooding.

Last Saturday, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also provided $100,000 to the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) for addressing the needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, the sixth storm tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 that made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered several days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines",2020-10-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['united', 'vietnam', 'needs', 'organizations', 'aid', 'flood', 'international', 'development', 'flooding', 'central', 'tropical', 'pledge', 'vulnerable', 'storm', 'provide', 'victims']",Vietnam,news article,English
1463,FL-2019-000179-CAN,What U.S. flooding could mean for Canada's Prairie farmers - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/flooding-crops-farmers-1.5143828,"Flooding across the U.S. agricultural belt continues to thwart the planting of key crops in that country — something that could help some Canadian farmers fetch better commodity prices.

New data this week revealed several states are well behind schedule for planting thanks to weeks of rain, with more wet weather in the forecast for some regions.

Some of the greatest concern is over corn and soybeans.

As the week began, only 49 per cent of corn crops in 18 key states had been planted when more typically it might be 80 per cent. Less than a fifth of soybeans had been planted when it might normally be closer to half, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.

While it's still too early to tell if the poor conditions will persist or exactly how crop yields will be affected, one analyst says the impact of the flooding is already rippling into the market.

""In the last couple of weeks, we sort of have a market that's ... almost maybe woken up to some of the weather threats here that were building,"" said Jonathon Driedger, a senior market analyst with FarmLink in Winnipeg.

Corn and soybeans are key to the American farm sector.

Corn is widely used in grocery products, animal feed and fuel. Soybeans are a leading agricultural export in the U.S., worth $22 billion US in 2017.

Though the outlook for both crops could improve in the coming weeks if weather improves, the poor conditions in the U.S. have traders considering what the supply picture might look like later in the year.

For example, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that the July contract for U.S. corn recently climbed by 13 per cent in just seven sessions.

""The U.S. corn crop is so integral to the world markets that, you know, they get a sniffle and we all get pneumonia,"" said Barry Prentice, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Manitoba.

Canada exports only a fraction of the corn and soybeans that its southern neighbour does, though they're still important crops for a number of Canadian farmers.

More broadly, as Driedger explains, farmers on the Prairies could benefit from what he calls the ""spillover"" effect.

While poor weather has had an adverse effect in parts of Ontario, Driedger said that, generally, seeding progress in Western Canada has not been far outside what farmers might expect at this time of year.

""Corn is so influential on pricing, soybeans are influential on pricing, that as those prices rise for those crops, it sort of helps elevate other crops as well,"" Driedger said.

For example, the price of barley could also climb with corn as it is a direct substitute into livestock feed, he said.

""That's sort of the domino effects that I think traders are trying to assess and process right now, because at this stage of the game, in terms of the production side, we're still playing a game of 'what if,'"" Driedger said.

Where there may be a more direct impact for Canadian farmers is on wheat, he added. There are concerns about the impact heavy rain has had on the U.S. winter wheat crop and the planting of spring wheat, he said.

'The U.S. corn crop is so integral to the world markets that, you know, they get a sniffle and we all get pneumonia,' said Barry Prentice, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Manitoba. (Lyzaville Sale/CBC News)

He said wheat prices have been improving in Western Canada over the last couple of weeks.

Derek Brewin, head of the department of agricultural economics at the University of Manitoba, said wheat prices also move up and down with corn because some grades of wheat compete with corn as livestock feed.

""And then there's the higher quality wheat,"" Brewin added. ""If there is a shortage of that, the difference between the high quality and the low quality gets wider. They get really good prices.""

Some believe canola prices could get a small lift if soybean prices rise.

Canadian canola farmers are already feeling pressure because of China's boycott of the crop. If soybean prices improve, it could also drag canola prices up ""a little bit,"" Driedger said.

However, Prentice thinks poor U.S. weather could ultimately be a drag on canola prices. He said if American farmers switch from planting corn to soybeans, which take less time grow, that could affect oilseed prices.

""If the Americans grow more soybeans, that means that we're likely to see lower prices for canola,"" Prentice said.

It will take weeks — or even months — for the situation to unfold as farmers, traders and analysts get a clearer picture of the impact on the number of acres planted and the health of those crops, Driedger said.

""Maybe we wake up six weeks from now and all the weather cleared, the crop got in a little bit late but conditions were excellent, and so maybe that so-called scare isn't so much of a scare,"" he said.

""Or, you know, things [could] get progressively worse.""",2019-05-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['canadas', 'weeks', 'mean', 'farmers', 'corn', 'crop', 'prairie', 'driedger', 'weather', 'prices', 'soybeans', 'crops', 'wheat', 'flooding']",Canada,news article,English
1363,FL-2019-000084-IND,"In flood-hit Assam, boat clinics bring respite to many - Hindustan Times",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-flood-hit-assam-boat-clinics-bring-respite-to-many/story-zVlvhdB0rKz9IiTeqewovO.html,"For Rahima Khatun, whose one-year-old child has diarrhoea, and Jamila, who could not get medicines for her chronic body ache and fever, boat clinics have become the only mode of medical help during floods in Assam.

At Goroimari, the char (riverine island) close to the Orang National Park in Morigaon district, they eagerly waited for the boat clinic with two doctors to arrive on Monday morning.

“There was chest-deep water for a few days and I could not go to the market to fetch medicines,” Jamila, who gave only her first name, said.

As the boat anchored in Goroimari, a crowd of mostly women and children waited anxiously as the local ASHA worker helped unload the medical supplies.

Within minutes, the clinic was ready as desks were laid and occupied by two doctors, a laboratory technician among other staff and tarpaulin sheets pulled out to cover from the drizzle. The crowd then moved to a tractor, where OPD slips were issued to them and a flyer in Assamese about steps to prevent diarrhoea.

The boat clinic is the most reliable health facility, which visits once every month, for more than 900 residents of Goroimari and more than 17,000 others in 29 more riverine islands in Morigaon district.

“We used to cater to around 30,000 people but many of the riverine islands have disappeared in the river in the last few years forcing people to move to the mainland,” said Shyamjit Pashi, the district programme officer of the boat clinic facility.

The clinics are needed more during floods, when diarrhoea, trench foot and fever among other ailments are common.

“It was on June 11, when this boat clinic came here that I got my last supply of medicines. I don’t have the money to go to town and during floods it was impossible,” said Jamila.

As on Monday, the death toll due to the floods increased to 69 as two more people died even as more than three million continued to be marooned in 18 districts of Assam, down from 30 of the 33 districts a week ago.

“We have done 10 camps and treated over 800 people since July 12 when the flood situation became severe,” young medical officer Digjam Sarma, who is one of the two doctors on the boat clinic, said as he attended to the long queue of patients at Goroimari.

On the next desk, the pharmacist handed them medicines as per their prescriptions.

Mukhtar Hussain, 37, a farmer, said he visited a pharmacy in the nearest town Moirabari, a one-and-a-half-hours away in a boat, as all of his seven family members including him fell ill with fever and other ailments in the floods. He spent Rs 2,000 on medicines yet the family continued to suffer. He came to the boat clinic hoping for relief.

“We give them free medicine and checkup unlike the private pharmacy,” said Ashraful Islam, the second doctor.

Islam rued that the long queue of people will mean his inability to give enough time to each patient. He explained that during floods, the boat clinics suspend their normal immunisation and awareness programme to look after those affected. In Goroimari, however, the immunisation drive was conducted.

Ashok Rao, programme manager of the boat clinic programme started by C-NES before the National Health Mission pitched in to support it, explained how the work for these clinics has increased during this season with the government using them for relief.

“In some districts, the government is using our boats to even organise veterinary camps,” Rao said.

He also said the government has also augmented the manpower with more doctors and support staff to attend to maximum patients.

The programme runs 15 boat clinics in 13 districts of Assam catering to more than 3,00,000 people inhabiting the riverine islands.",2019-07-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['boat', 'bring', 'medicines', 'clinic', 'goroimari', 'floodhit', 'doctors', 'districts', 'assam', 'floods', 'riverine', 'clinics', 'programme', 'respite']",India,news article,English
1196,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Earthquakes and Sea-Level Rise Are a Deadly Combination - The Atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/earthquakes-and-sea-level-rise-are-deadly-combination/592945/,"Then, in 1933, a Royal Air Force plane rattled over a bay where the Nile meets the Mediterranean. Glancing out of the cockpit, the pilot saw shapes where there should not have been shapes—the murky contours of huge stones and toppled statues, stranded four miles from the shore. It would take another 66 years for the city to be found.

Thonis-Heracleion was a victim of soil liquefaction, which is more or less what it sounds like. What seems to be solid ground in an instant melts into a roiling sea of dirt, which behaves almost as if it were water. The city carried every major risk factor for this type of disaster. It was built on loosely packed soil which was heavily saturated—the by-product of both a high water table and recent flooding. On top of that soil, incredibly heavy structures had been built. And it was in a seismically active area, abutting the long Hellenic arc, a subduction zone where the Mediterranean joins the Aegean. Today, few places are as ripe for catastrophe—but many carry risk factors for disaster.

Soil liquefaction is a horrifying phenomenon. Videos of its occurrence look like found-footage documentaries of the Second Coming: Buildings seem to simply slip away, the earth gives out, and the once-steady structures slide into the morass. But the science behind this phenomenon is straightforward. It tends to occur in loosely packed soils—silty areas near rivers, infilled harbors and reclaimed land, marshy regions—that are highly saturated, often due to poor drainage conditions. Then add weight: buildings, roads, anything large and heavy that an engineer (or anyone else, for that matter) would not want to have move suddenly.

Most of the time, nothing will happen. The saturated land will bear the weight, the soil will hold steady, and life will go on. But when pressure is exerted abruptly on the soil, combined with the weight from heavy structures atop it, the ground will stop behaving like a solid material and begin behaving like a liquid. The most common instigator for that sort of pressure is a seismic event—an earthquake.

Read: When an earthquake hits next door

Quakes cause the exact sort of back-and-forth motion required to raise the water pressure within the ground, which causes the weight of the buildings and roads above to be borne instead by the water—and water cannot support large buildings. That causes collapse, essentially instantaneously.

“People aren’t prepared like they should be,” says Dan Ander, the vice president of Washington Surveying and Rating Bureau, an insurance-ratings agency. “I don’t know if people understand liquefaction. They understand earthquake damage—I don’t know if they understand how that damage happens.”

The risk factors that lead to liquefaction could be compounded further, as climate change induces sea-level rise. Because liquefaction vulnerability increases when soil becomes more saturated, rising seas will naturally cause greater vulnerability in at-risk areas and have the potential to endanger previously safe points further inland. Thonis-Heracleion experienced flooding before its liquefaction event, possibly caused in part by relatively minor changes in the Mediterranean, which has seen its sea level rise incrementally since the last Ice Age. “If you raise the water level, you raise the pressure in the water all the way down the profile,” says Peter Campbell, an underwater archaeologist. “You consequently reduce the contact stress between the particles [so] you have less margin if any excess pressure is generated by the earthquake.”",2019-06-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['rise', 'sealevel', 'quake', 'earthquake', 'water', 'hints', 'cities', 'city', 'citys', 'soil', 'vulnerable', 'built', 'liquefaction', 'thonisheracleion', 'demise', 'hidden', 'ancient', 'risk']",Egypt,news article,English

787,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Morocco tourism gains momentum - How we made it in Africa,https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/morocco-tourism-gains-momentum/63575/,"The crème de la crème of Hollywood was in Marrakech, Morocco, for the wedding of British movie star Idris Elba in April this year. Elba tied the knot with his Canadian model girlfriend, former Miss Vancouver Sabrina Dhowre, at the Ksar Char-Bagh hotel, an exquisite Alhambra-style hotel.

Kenyan-Mexican Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o, American actress Jessica Alba, soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and others have all embraced the glamour of the rose-coloured city of Marrakech and its plethora of tourist attractions, including the vibrant Jemaa el-Fnaa square and the picturesque Majorelle Garden.

Morocco draws tourists from the far corners of the world. They may be seen strolling along the Corniche in Casablanca – an oceanfront boardwalk lined with restaurants, nightclubs, theatres and hotels—or dining at one of the small cafés in the quiet city of Azemmour – a short day trip or overnight jaunt from the big city.

Adil El Fakir, director of the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT), says that over 12 million tourists visited Morocco in 2018, of whom 2.4 million headed for Marrakech.

Morocco’s tourist attractions include the spectacular beaches of Essaouira, an Atlantic coastal town included on the World Heritage List of UNESCO since 2001, and the country’s mountains, particularly the Atlas and the Rif.

“Tourism is a terrific land-use tool, and our territory, from Tangier to Lagouira, is rich in its activities, its landscape, its heritage, its culture and its gastronomy,” declares Mohamed Benamour, a former president of the Morocco Tourism Federation.

A cultural crossroad

The country is also a cultural hub, reflecting the diversity of its inhabitants’ national origins: sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and the Middle East. This crossroads attracts fashion designers, artists, filmmakers and other cultural tourists. In 2017, for example, a museum on the international luxury fashion house Yves Saint Laurent opened in Morocco.

“Marrakech taught me colour. Before Marrakech, everything was black,” Saint Laurent once noted.

Over 50 Hollywood motion pictures have been shot in the country, including Alfred Hitchcock’s The Man Who Knew Too Much; Lawrence of Arabia, directed by David Lean; Orson Welles’ Othello; Jesus of Nazareth, directed by the late Franco Zeffirelli; and the latest James Bond movie, Spectre.

The country is also becoming a major hub for international conferences due to its proximity to Europe, Middle East, the Americas and the rest of Africa. The country recently hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which brought about 20,000 participants to Marrakech.

Last year, the Global Forum for Migration and Development and the conference on the adoption of the Global Compact for Migration were held in Marrakech and attracted representatives from most UN member states and non-governmental organisations.

In March the city hosted the Conference of African Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development on “fiscal policy, trade and the private sector in the digital era: a strategy for Africa”, which was organised by the UN Economic Commission for Africa.

This year, UNESCO’s first International Forum on Artificial Intelligence in Africa and the Africa Youth Leadership Summit, among other events, will take place in Marrakech. These international conferences shine a spotlight on the country while contributing to the economy.

Tourism revenues account for 11% of total GDP, according to the tourism ministry. Industries in the sector, such as air and land transport, food service and hospitality, generate significant employment opportunities for young people. Morocco was the most visited country in Africa in 2016, with 10.3 million tourist arrivals.

Despite the potentials in the tourism sector, climate change effects threaten to put a dampener. In 2015, for example, Morocco’s economic growth nosedived to 1.5% due to drought, according to the World Bank. To address the situation, the country is constructing the world’s largest desalination plant, which turns seawater into drinking water, in Agadir, near the Atlantic coast.

It has also set ambitious goals that focus on, among others, generating 52% of its electricity needs from renewables by 2030 and improving coastal zone management.

Regulatory reforms introduced in 2010 are bringing Morocco closer to its goal of making the country one of the world’s 20 leading tourist destinations by 2020. Its 10-year plan, dubbed Vision 2020, is aimed at creating eight new tourist destinations and 470,000 new jobs while doubling tourist receipts.

That goal is within reach, it seems. The country has set its sights on a good slice of the 1.4 billion global tourists traveling abroad annually, many of whom are Chinese. Following Moroccan king Mohammed VI’s visit to Beijing in 2016, the number of Chinese arrivals in Morocco skyrocketed to 180,000 in 2018, up from 42,000 in 2016. By 2020 Morocco hopes to reach the 500,000 mark, according to the Moroccan National Tourist Office, a wing of ONMT.

Investing in tourism

Massive investments in new infrastructure, such as new airport terminals, roads and railways, and the relaxed visa requirements for citizens of some countries, such as China, are two factors in Morocco’s success.

Thanks to the new airport terminal in Casablanca that was opened earlier in 2019, the airport can now handle up to 14 million passengers a year, up from 7 million. Another newly built terminal in the Rabat-Salé Airport can now handle 4 million passengers a year, up from 1.5 million.

Investments in airport infrastructure have had a domino impact on the broader economy. For example, the Rabat airport expansion is transforming the neighbouring city of Kenitra into a fast-growing industrial hub, attracting international companies such as Groupe PSA, the French company that manufactures Peugeot and Citroën.

“[The economic growth of] Kenitra has exceeded our expectations,” says Moulay Hafid Elalamy, minister of industry, investment, trade and the digital economy.

With improving infrastructure, safety and security, Morocco is on its way to becoming a premier destination for an increasing number of tourists.
