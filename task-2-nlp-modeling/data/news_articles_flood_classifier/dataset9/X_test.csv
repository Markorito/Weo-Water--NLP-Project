Five trucks carrying humanitarian aid supplied by the Red Crescent headed to Iran through the Gürbulak border crossing yesterday. At least 45 people were killed this week in flash floods in northern and southern Iran after the heaviest rains recorded in Iran in at least a decade. Another 265 people were injured. Iranian officials said on Saturday it faced an emergency in a southwestern province threatened by flooding and worked to evacuate dozens of villages as forecasters predicted more heavy rains. Some 56 villages lying near the Dez and Karkheh rivers in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan may have to be evacuated as officials released water from two major dams along the rivers due to forecasts for more rain, Provincial Governor Gholamreza Shariati told state television.





Buildings, houses flooded in Iran's Golestan region, March 27, 2019. Floods killed at least 45 people in the country last week.

The Turkish Red Crescent cooperated with the Iranian Red Crescent to deliver aid to those displaced by the floods. The aid includes 320 tents, 500 beds, 100 hygiene kits, 1,625 blankets, 360 sets of kitchen utensils and 60 heaters. Anıl Kocabal, who heads the Red Crescent delegation to Iran tasked with aid delivery, told Anadolu Agency (AA) that they also launched a donation campaign to help the people of Iran affected by the disaster. ""Our first delivery will be an accommodation kit (tents) to 320 families. We cooperate with the Iranian Red Crescent so that we can reach out to everyone affected by the disaster,"" Kocabal said.

Western and southwestern parts of Iran are expected to bear the brunt of the storms in the days ahead. Police renewed calls for people to avoid unnecessary journeys even though Iran is celebrating the Nevruz New Year holiday, a time when many families travel. Iran has implemented measures to prevent rain and flooding affecting its main crude oil export terminal on Kharg Island in the Gulf, the head of the Iranian Oil Terminals Company told the semi-official news agency Mehr on Saturday.

In Colombia, TİKA delivered stationary sets to students and humanitarian aid to locals in Istmina, a town hit by floods in February and earlier this month. Istmina is located in Colombia's Choco Department where the San Juan River overflowing its banks during floods led to inundation of settlements around it. More than 7,000 people lost their homes in the disaster. There have been calls for aid to the region, especially for a population living in poverty. TİKA officials delivered stationary sets including books and notebooks to 140 students at Andres Bello primary school and agricultural equipment to people of Primavera where farmers suffered losses in floods. Two years ago, TİKA was behind another humanitarian project for victims of floods that hit southern Colombia and sent 200 aid packages to the southern city of Mocoa.

TİKA, the country's leading development aid institution, boasts a decade of increased outreach to Latin America, with 172 projects spanning Venezuela to rural Colombia. The agency left its mark in Latin American countries with a string of projects from schools to training women for employment. It serves as one of the key players in Turkey's efforts to boost its ties with regional countries, offering both instant humanitarian aid and projects focusing on development in the long run, ranging from education, health and agriculture to infrastructure.",2019-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,"['crescent', 'floodhit', 'turkish', 'floods', 'charities', 'red', 'aid', 'colombia', 'iranian', 'iran', 'humanitarian', 'ti̇ka', 'extend', 'agency']",Iran,news article,English
1045,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil: Churches open their doors to thousands displaced by floods - Vatican News,https://www.vaticannews.va/en/world/news/2021-02/floods-brazil-acre-amazon-torrential-rain-damage.html,"Churches open their doors in Brazil's western Amazon region after days of flooding cause the displacement of thousands of families.

By Vatican News staff writer

Thousands of families have been left homeless in the western Amazon after torrential rains caused severe flooding across the Brazilian state of Acre. At an already critical time due to the Covid-19 pandemic, those most hard-hit are the poor who live on the banks of rivers. This is the case for the community of Sena Madureira, a town near the Iaco River. Located about 145 km from the capital Rio Branco, Sena is the third most populous municipality in Acre, after Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul.

Solidarity of the Church

In Sena Madureira, the flood has affected 17 thousand people. Of these, 4 thousand are already housed in public reception facilities such as sports fields and schools. The Catholic Church has joined in the solidarity mobilisation and is welcoming families. Fr Moisés de Oliveira Coelho of the Order of the Servants of Mary, and parish priest of Nossa Senhora da Conceição Parish, spoke to Vatican News and explained ""we have some chapels that are being used as temporary shelters, such as the Nossa Senhora Aparecida Chapel, the São Sebastião Chapel and the Santa Cruz Chapel. Other chapels are also occupied by the goods that families in need of help have managed to recover.

The Church is also working to collect donations for those who have lost everything. Fr Moisés explained that this is why the Ação Bom Samaritano (""Action of the Good Samaritan"") has been launched: a solidarity campaign promoted in collaboration with the local government. He said that the parish collects food, shoes, clothing, personal hygiene and cleaning products: ""We receive donations from our faithful, from people of goodwill and we prepare food parcels and then distribute them to shelters.""

Looking ahead

The solidarity of the local Church does not stop at the current emergency, but also looks to the aftermath, to when people will have to return home. For this reason Fr Moisés said that they are putting donation money aside: ""We have opened an account so that, after the floods are over, we will be able to help families buy cleaning products, personal hygiene items and basic necessities. These are still small gestures compared to the magnitude of what is happening, but they are sufficient and necessary and will increase as donations grow. So, we depend on donations to be able to do these good deeds and that is why we always count on the help and collaboration of everyone at this time.""

The crisis in Acre

The flooding of regional rivers in the State of Acre also created problems in the capital Rio Branco, in Cruzeiro do Sul and in the municipalities of Tarauacá, Feijó, Santa Rosa do Purus and Rodrigues Alves. To deal with the emergency, all public agencies are on high alert and are providing relief to the population at risk. State authorities have created 23 temporary shelters for displaced people and last weekend they distributed more than 500 food parcels to the population. In all, about 120,000 people are affected. More than 32 thousand families have been devastated by these extreme weather events. The health situation in Acre is also particularly critical due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the dengue epidemic and malaria. Both infections and hospitalisations are increasing, putting hospitals under great pressure.",2021-02-25 08:00:00+00:00,"['thousand', 'solidarity', 'families', 'acre', 'moisés', 'brazil', 'floods', 'donations', 'state', 'rio', 'churches', 'open', 'parish', 'displaced', 'doors', 'thousands', 'sena']",Brazil,news article,English

On wheat farms in the U.S. and Russia, it’s a drought that’s ruining harvests. The soybean fields of Brazil are bone dry too, touched by little more than the occasional shower. In Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, the problem is the exact opposite. Torrential downpours are causing flooding in rice fields and stands of oil palm trees.

The sudden emergence of these supply strains is a big blow to a global economy that has been struggling to regain its footing after the shock of the Covid-19 lockdowns. As prices soar on everything from sugar to cooking oil, millions of working-class families that had already been forced to scale back food purchases in the pandemic are being thrust deeper into financial distress.

What’s more, these increases threaten to push up broader inflation indexes in some countries and could make it harder for central bankers to keep providing monetary stimulus to shore up growth.

The Bloomberg Agriculture Spot Index, a gauge of nine crop prices, has risen 28% since late April to its highest level in more than four years. Wheat earlier this week was the most expensive since 2014.

“The fundamentals have changed dramatically since May,” said Don Roose, president of brokerage U.S. Commodities in Iowa. “The weather is bubbling to the top, and we have demand chugging in a bull market.”

The fallout from the pandemic means that the United Nations was already warning of a worst-case scenario in which about a tenth of the world’s population would go hungry this year. Things could become more dire if grocery costs keep rising and even more people can’t afford to eat.

“It’s looking very bleak,” said David Beasley, executive director at the World Food Programme, the hunger-fighting group that won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. Declining currencies in food-importing nations, the threat of more economic shutdowns and struggles for farmers to expand production could all compound the problem, he said.

“You start adding all these things together and you begin to almost run around like, ‘The sky is falling, the sky is falling,’ but it ain’t chicken little,” Beasley said.

Mangled supply chains and a flood of buying already sent food prices higher in many countries earlier this year as Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted global trade. But even then, there was an ample cushion of grain stockpiles and Northern Hemisphere harvests were expected to be bountiful. Then came the dry weather.

Climate scientists have long warned that an increase in unpredictable and extreme weather patterns would be a growing threat to crop production and food security. Now, we are experiencing what it means to be living in a climate-disrupted world as wildfires blaze across the U.S. West, hurricane season grows more ferocious and forecasters say that 2020 could be the world’s hottest year on record.

Antonio Carlos Simoneti, a fourth-generation orange grower in Brazil, is seeing the change firsthand. With drought and heat plaguing his lands in Sao Paulo state, the world’s top region for orange juice production, the river that usually snakes across his property has vanished. That’s the first time that’s happened since his family acquired the farm 36 years ago. Oranges on his 500-hectare (1,236-acre) grove are drying up inside and becoming crystallized, as the trees suck all the water from the fruit to try to survive the parched conditions.

After making some sales earlier in the season, “I don’t have more fruits to sell,” said Simoneti, who expects his harvest to drop about 50% this year because of the weather. “What remains on the trees are dried, without water inside.”

Shopping Spree

It’s not just the weather sparking higher crop prices.

Agricultural commodity buyers from Cairo to Islamabad have been on a shopping spree as nations try to protect themselves from more disruptions to supply chains, like those seen earlier this year when lockdowns left food stranded at ports, sparked trucking delays and created logjams at warehouses.

A weaker real is boosting prices even further in agriculture superpower Brazil, where soybeans are up 81% and corn 56% this year, also raising costs for chicken and pork production. As an emergency measure, local government has temporarily removed import tariffs for soybeans, corn, rice and wheat to control food inflation.

Jordan has built up record wheat reserves while Egypt, the world’s top buyer of the grain, took the unusual step of tapping international markets during its local harvest and has boosted purchases by more than 50% since April. Taiwan said it will increase strategic food stockpiles and China has been buying to feed its growing hog herd.

The last protracted runup in food prices back in 2011 helped contribute to uprisings in the Arab Spring. That said, prices have a long way to climb before reaching those levels. Also, a bumper crop in Australia may help to fill the supply gap.

That growth in demand helps to explain why prices are moving higher despite a still-hefty inventory cushion. Global reserves of wheat, for example, are forecast to reach a record this year. Those supplies could eventually help to bring food inflation back in check if concerns over weather problems start to die down.

That would be welcome relief for people like Doan Cam Chi, a Ho Chi Minh City working mom. She estimated she’s spent about 30% more on food bills this year for her 5-member family. She’s seen pork prices decrease this month, but things like rice, cereals and fruits are still up from last year.

“I just can’t trim food expenses as my kids are in their growing years,” she said.

Meanwhile, at a market in the city, 50-year-old produce seller Le Thi Giang was just an hour away from closing on a recent morning, but her stall was still full of unsold spinach, pineapples, pumpkins, green beans and carrots. Ongoing torrential rains and flooding in key growing areas mean that prices for fruit and vegetables are fetching as much as double what they were pre-pandemic. At these higher costs, many people can’t afford to buy what they need for a healthy diet, she said.

“I have to call and invite people into my stall, something I had never done before,” said Giang, who has been selling at the market for two decades.

The recovery in prices after years in the doldrums has been welcome news for farmers in the U.S., who have relied more on government aid to balance the loss of income due to tariffs and trade wars.

“To see demand be so strong right now for a lot of commodities is a welcome sign,” Kevin Ross, an Iowa farmer and chairman of the National Corn Growers Association, who grows corn and soybeans in southwest Iowa, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “Right now exports are just on fire.”

487,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Brazil 3-1 Peru: Brazil win Copa America after Gabriel Jesus red - Sky Sports,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/32506/11758608/brazil-3-1-peru-brazil-win-copa-america-after-gabriel-jesus-red,"Brazil survived Gabriel Jesus' second-half red card to end their 12-year wait for a trophy with a 3-1 victory over Peru in the Copa America final.

Jesus was the first-half hero in the Maracana, setting up Everton's opener on 15 minutes before restoring Brazil's lead on the stroke of half-time after Paolo Guerrero drew Peru level from the penalty spot.

But the Manchester City striker soon turned to the villain of the piece as his clumsy second bookable offence handed Peru the initiative with 20 minutes to play.

Five years on from their World Cup semi-final humiliation on home soil another upset looked on the cards, but substitute Richarlison's late penalty sealed an ninth Copa America for Brazil - their first since 2007 - which banished the demons of that 7-1 defeat to Germany in the process.

Tite's men took the lead on the quarter-hour when Jesus created space for himself down the right before crossing for striker Everton to volley home.

Brazil assumed control as Peru's efforts to respond yielded little and Philippe Coutinho fired just wide after latching on to a Roberto Firmino cross.

Peru were back in it a minute before the break when, after defender Thiago Silva was adjudged to have handled inside the box as he slid into a challenge, Guerrero sent Alisson the wrong way from the spot.

However, Brazil restored their lead in stoppage time when Jesus swept home Firmino's cross to bring an end to an eventful first half.

Coutinho and Firmino both went close as the hosts attempted to kill the game off immediately after the restart, but Jesus' evening took a turn for the worse with 20 minutes remaining when he was sent off for a second bookable offence following a challenge on Carlos Zambrano.

Peru sensed an opportunity but two masterful substitutions from Tite - bringing on Richarlison and Eder Militao - ensured Brazil maintained a level of control.

434,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,10 African 'tech for good' startups to watch in 2017 - Ventures Africa,https://venturesafrica.com/10-african-tech-for-good-startups-to-watch-in-2017/,"Innovators across Africa are harnessing digital technology to develop new ways of tackling social and economic challenges. From the rise of Silicon Savannah to the launch of M-PESA, the continent has a burgeoning tech sector that is driving a social tech movement that puts people before profits. These inspirational projects are making a positive difference to people’s lives in their own communities and creating social change at a national level.

For the last four years, Nominet Trust has identified and celebrated 100 different socially-motivated startups from across the globe. In our 2016 NT100, we feature some extraordinary examples of how pioneers from across Africa are using tech for good to promote education equality, economic empowerment and access to medical care.

Education equality

1. OneUni

In Kenya, a lack of physical space at universities and the prohibitive costs of attending can be barriers to often capable students pursuing degree programmes. Daystar University in Nairobi and California startup, OneUni, partnered up to tackle this and make university education accessible to more Kenyans. Together they created Africa’s first smartphone degree programme, Daystar Mobile, where all course materials are made available through an app. They now have plans to expand the model to other African countries to reach thousands of more students, aiming to make university education more accessible across the continent.

2. Tunapanda Institute

Another venture bolstering education in Kenya is Tunapanda Institute. Approximately one-third of Kenyan children do not enrol into a high school because of financial constraints, so brothers Jay and Mick Larson created a free, open source online training programme to help bridge this digital divide. Tunapanda Institute currently delivers three-month intensive learning courses in technology, design and business, giving students access to vital skills that can act as an alternative to traditional high school diplomas. At the institute’s HQ in Nairobi, specific workshops are also held to provide girls with skills in the STEM subjects, helping address the gender gap in these fields. To date, 100 people have graduated from the programme, of whom 85 percent are in meaningful employment as a result.

3. Well Told Story

After the disputed elections in Kenya in 2007, over 800 people were killed, leaving a generation of youths feeling disenfranchised. To help get to the heart of what young Kenyan’s wanted to talk about, Rob Burnet established Well Told Story, a research consultancy which is famous for creating Shujaaz, meaning ‘heroes’ in Sheng. Shujaaz is a free, international Emmy-winning comic book that now has a monthly circulation of 500,000 and a readership that Burnet estimates to be five million Kenyans aged between 10 and 25. The content is lovingly crafted by young people based in Well Told Story’s Nairobi office and offers readers tips on everything from planting maize to contraception, information about upcoming elections and careers.

Enhancing daily living

4. Lumkani

In Cape Town, communities living in deprived areas are threatened by the devastation caused by house fires which can sweep through the neighbourhood. Lumkani, which means ‘beware’ in Xhosa, was created by a group of students horrified by the danger faced by less advantaged citizens in their city, to help save lives in the event of these fires. Lumkani transmits a signal to devices within a 20-metre radius so that neighbours are aware of potential danger and can mobilise help or evacuate. Since launching in 2014, Lumkani has been installed in 7,000 homes in Cape Town, and co-founders Francois Petousis and Samuel Ginsburg say that the device has already prevented the spread of what could have been five major fires.

5. Digital Matatus

Although 70 percent of Nairobi’s population rely on the matatus – 20,000 private vans which transport people around the capital – there’s very little information available on how to navigate this seemingly chaotic system. In 2011, researchers at MIT, Columbia University and the University of Nairobi, together with design agency Upshot, began a collaborative mapping project to make sense of the matatus system to support those travelling on it. By recruiting Kenyan students to ride the matatus and log journeys using mobile and GPS, by 2015 Digital Matatus had recorded almost 3,000 stops on more than 130 routes. Since its release, the city of Nairobi has adopted the map as the capital’s official transit guide and more than 5,000 people have downloaded it online.

Economic empowerment

6. Illuminum Greenhouse

Childhood friends Brian Bett and Taita Ng’etich, whose families are farmers, set out to explore better solutions to farming after their young tomato crop was destroyed by flooding. They developed a system using low-cost materials and advanced sensor technologies to monitor their crops to prevent this happening again. When neighbours started asking them to build their own greenhouses, they founded a new business: Illuminum Greenhouses. Each greenhouse is fitted with sensors that monitor temperature, humidity and soil moisture, alerting farmers to change the settings via text messages. To date, more than 750 Kenyan farmers are using Illuminum’s technology and the pair aspires to scale the innovation so it can be deployed all over Africa and Latin America.

7. SAPARM

Around 200 million pastoralists in Africa seek pasture for their herds using a combination of word of mouth, scouts and knowledge of local terrains – but this has become increasingly challenging due to climate change and drought. To modernise pastoralists’ search for land, Chris Bessenecker from Project Concern International (PCI) developed project SAPARM (Satellite-Assisted Pastoral Resource Management) in partnership with USAID and the World Food Programme. Through SAPARM, PCI can share maps featuring satellite images of vegetation cover with pastoral clan leaders every 10 days. Since SAPARM’s launch in 2013, over 80 percent of participating pastoralists use the maps, and more than half have said that it’s their most important source of information.

8. Giraffe

In 2016, South Africa’s unemployment rate hit a 12-year high. Shafin Anwarsha believed the main challenge was a lack of access for jobseekers who often live in segregated townships with poor transport and limited internet access, so he developed a recruitment app called Giraffe. Giraffe aims to reduce unemployment by providing a free resource which helps employers hire medium-skilled workers faster and more easily. Since its launch in early 2015, Giraffe has attracted over 150,000 jobseekers, invited over 30,000 of them for interviews, and helped hundreds of businesses recruit workers faster and cheaper than ever before.

Access to medical care

9. Vula

While volunteering in Swaziland, Dr William Mapham would often drive eight hours to diagnose patients, who would then have to endure the same journey to receive treatment. This inspired Dr Mapham to create Vula — a name derived from the siSwati phrase for ‘open your eyes’. The app enables health workers to capture basic patient and eye health information using a smartphone camera and securely share it with a specialist thousands of miles away to gain an expert opinion. Dr Mapham and his team are currently focused on increasing the app’s reach in Swaziland, before extending it to Zambia.

10. Project Khuluma

According to UNAIDS, 15 percent of women and 5 percent of men aged 15–25 in South Africa are infected with HIV. While medical treatment has been improving, little has been done to support patients’ mental health. Project Khuluma was set up by international NGO, SHM Foundation, to help teenagers facing HIV by providing around-the-clock support through a smartphone. Project Khuluma uses mobile group chats to create a safe environment for young people to discuss anything from their HIV medication to sex, relationships and social issues. The young people have the option to remain anonymous and each group is supervised by a trained facilitator, who can identify teenagers showing signs of depression, mental illness, or resistance to their antiretroviral treatments.

All these inspiring ventures, and others Nominet Trust profiles in our NT100, demonstrate how digital technology can bring ideas to life and make a huge difference to people’s lives, whether it’s accessing education, improving healthcare provision or connecting jobseekers with employers. We hope that these projects will inspire more entrepreneurs in Africa to apply their technical skills to the social challenges facing their own communities.",2017-04-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['watch', 'africa', 'social', 'education', 'help', 'startups', 'using', 'project', 'african', 'nairobi', 'young', 'university', 'good', 'tech', '2017', 'students']",Ghana,news article,English
746,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Is climate change causing the recent floods along the St. John River? - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/future-floods-new-brunswick-climate-change-1.5134035,"As water levels rose along the St. John River this spring, many New Brunswickers had two reactions.

First, they prepared urgently for the flood.

Then they asked themselves whether this was evidence of climate change — whether two major floods in two years proves that human activity has altered the forces of nature.

""Things have certainly changed,"" Elaine Price of Mill Cove said as she watched the water rise toward her home last month.

In Chipman, Rhonda Saulnier was asking the same question.

""It's unbelievable,"" she said.

""So now that it's happened two years in a row, like everybody I'm afraid it's the new norm. I'm praying it's not.""

Water levels peaked in Fredericton on April 23 at 8.36 metres, compared with a peak of 8.31 metres last year. In Saint John, the peak was 5.53 metres compared with 5.76 metres last year.

For the second straight year, homes were evacuated. For the second straight year, the Trans-Canada Highway was closed downriver from Fredericton.

Even officials who oversee flood response seemed taken aback.

Is flooding along the St. John River the new norm? CBC News 1:27 For two years in a row, floodwater reached historic levels along the lower St. John River system. 1:27

""When this event happened last year, we were under the impression this was a historical event, and two years in a row, the historical event happened,"" said Ahmed Dassouki, the director of operations at the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure.

""It's a new day, and two years in a row is telling us we can't just do the same thing,"" Premier Blaine Higgs told reporters.

Yes, this is climate change — probably

Is this climate change?

The answer isn't straightforward, but the consensus is: yes, probably, likely.

""You can't attribute one event to climate change,"" said Barrie Bonsal, a senior research scientist with Environment Canada, who co-authored a major report on climate change released last month.

""But as we warm the atmosphere, and we see associated impacts, we are increasing the probability of certain types of events that are associated with warming.""

But if climate change was a factor in the back-to-back floods, so was luck.

""Climate change is a larger trend that says that these kinds of things will happen more often,"" said Jasmin Boisvert, a provincial hydrologist. ""With two floods of this magnitude, there has to be an element of bad luck, for lack of a better word.""

Bonsal said with warming temperatures, it's likely there'll be less snow pack at the end of most winters.

But when there happens to be a lot of snow pack, as there was this year, the trends caused by climate change — those warmer temperatures and increases in extreme rain — make flooding more likely.

Human activity causing warming

The report Bonsal co-authored, Canada's Changing Climate Report, says temperatures in Canada warmed by 1.7 C between 1948 and 2016 and will continue to get warmer.

More than half of that trend is ""likely"" due to human activity, the report adds, and that trend ""has increased the likelihood of some types of extreme events.""

Scientists have been forecasting the impact of warmer temperatures for decades, but until recently their projections felt abstract and theoretical, and not very local.

Now it's real. Recent weather events, Bonsal said, are ""eerily consistent"" with those previous projections.

'Entirely attributable'

Those whose businesses depends on knowing what is coming agree.

""What we have seen is entirely consistent with what global modelling has predicted,"" said Craig Stewart, a vice-president with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, which has seen flood and wildfire payouts soar in the last decade.

""They have predicted that we would see increased annual precipitation and incidents of extreme rainfall in eastern Canada, and more droughts and wildfires in western Canada, and that is exactly what we are seeing play out,"" Stewart said.

""So in our minds, we attribute current events to climate change. The trends we are seeing are entirely attributable to climate change.""

More rain, bigger floods

What happens next? It gets worse.

""We'll see more flooding like this,"" Boisvert said. ""That is the general trend.""

In worst-case scenarios, precipitation in Atlantic Canada is expected to increase five per cent by 2050 and 12 per cent by the end of the century.

Among the federal report's other forecasts:

Across Canada, extreme-precipitation events that happen once every 20 years will occur every 10 years between 2031 and 2050 if carbon dioxide emissions continue to grow.

By the end of the century, extreme events that happen once in 50 years will happen every 10 years. ""The more extreme the event, the more frequency will change,"" the report says.

In New Brunswick, there will be an ""increase in flood and drought frequencies"" in Saint John, Nashwaak, Canaan, Kennebecasis, Restigouche and Miramichi watersheds.

The federal report cites a study by University of Moncton professor Nassir El-Jabi, who teaches hydrological engineering.

The rate and magnitude of climate change under high versus low emission scenarios project two very different futures for Canada. - Environment and Climate Change Canada

El-Jabi estimates ""low-return"" floods in the province — frequent minor floods — will see water levels increase 30 to 55 per cent.

""High-return"" floods like the ones seen in 2018 and 2019 will grow more slowly, but could still be 21 per cent bigger by the year 2100.

Some caveats

There are caveats to all of this.

""These changes take effect slowly, over time, and the nature of weather is that it is very variable,"" Boisvert said.

""You might get extreme years in some years and not in other years.""

A river system is dynamic, so other factors — such as forestry and agricultural run-off, or construction that affects drainage — can play a role.

Rather than link specific events to climate change, scientists are focusing on a new field called ""event attribution.""

It looks at how the probability or intensity of a single extreme weather event changed because of greenhouse gas emissions.

For example, they concluded that in the major 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alta., climate change led to ""the increased likelihood of extreme wildfire risk and the length of fire seasons.""

The 100-year-flood

The two consecutive St. John River floods in 2018 and 2019 have been called, often with astonishment, two ""100-year-floods"" — as if climate change has thrown all our statistical models out of whack.

That's because this is not a well-understood concept.

A ""100-year-flood"" is simply a flood that has a one in 100 chance of happening in any given year, based on historical data. But they can happen more often.

""A one per cent chance last year is still one per cent this year,"" said climate researcher Louise Comeau in a recent tweet.

A moving target

Bonsal said the phrase has ""always bothered me a little bit. 'One in a hundred years' gives a perception that we're good for another 100 years, but really it can happen any year.""

The 100-year flood is also a moving target.

El-Jabi said that what constitutes such a flood is constantly evolving. Once data from 2018 and 2019 are added, the definition of a 100-year flood will shift.

A flood with only a one-in-100 chance of happening will be a bigger flood. Meanwhile, a flood as big as this year's ""may be a one-in-50 flood, or a one-in-10 flood,"" Bonsal said.

Costly consequences

These trends are already proving costly. Last year's flooding cost the New Brunswick government $74 million and counting.

Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said recently that Ottawa spent more on disaster relief in the last six years than it did in the 40 years before that.

Flood claims paid out by insurance companies in New Brunswick grew from $59 million in 1996 to $144.3 million in 2015, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

To put that 2015 figure in context, it's larger than the average annual flood payout for all of Canada — between 1990 and the early 2000s.

""That gives you an idea of how quickly this has escalated, and why insurers have been saying climate change is a real and present danger,"" Stewart said.

It's not too late

Another startling element of the recent federal report is that while climate change would be difficult to reverse, it's not too late to avoid worst-case scenarios.

""The rate and magnitude of climate change under high versus low emission scenarios project two very different futures for Canada,"" the federal report says.

For example, precipitation in Atlantic Canada will increase by 12 per cent by the year 2100 under the ""high-emission scenario,"" a model that Bosnal calls ""business as usual"" — continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions.

But in a low-emission scenario in which Canada and the rest of the world agree to emissions reductions called for in the Paris agreement, precipitation will be only 4.7 per cent higher.

""Future warming is unavoidable,"" Bonsal said. ""We will have to be prepared for that warming. We will have to adapt to certain events and impacts associate with that warming.

""But as we go farther into the future, we do have some choices. If we can mitigate greenhouse gas scenarios, we can certainly reduce the impacts.""

Better prepared

With this year's floods, the talk has turned to how to prepare for more frequent events.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada now aims to make data from its private climate forecasting available to the public.

""We've been having increasing conversations about how to get the data that these models provide into the hands of the public,"" Stewart said.

One idea is a searchable federal ""flood portal"" that would provide ""a window into risk for homeowners.""

Whether there's a third straight big flood in 2020 or not, Stewart said, ""we as a society need to figure out a way to adapt, to lower our risk and to move people out of harm's way when necessary.""

Bonsal said Canadians should take a closer look at the report he worked on.

""We shouldn't be surprised in the future,"" he said. ""These events that we have not seen in the past can certainly come in the future. So we should certainly be prepared for surprises.""",2019-05-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['recent', 'change', 'causing', 'report', 'river', 'floods', 'canada', 'climate', 'st', 'john', 'flood', 'events', 'extreme']",Canada,news article,English

The Black Stars quest to end their 37-year title drought was quashed following a 5-4 penalty loss against the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia in the Round of 16 stage at the ongoing AFCON in Egypt.

In the wake of the defeat, Mubarak Wakaso, who was arguably Ghana’s best player at the tournament, was videoed sobbing as he received his his Man of the Match accolade.

However, Boye says it was not only the Deportivo Alaves midfielder who was deeply touched by the defeat.

The FC Metz guardsman revealed that every member of the team shed tears after realizing how they have disappointed the nation.

""Everybody was crying. Everybody cried like we are all disappointed but we have to raise our heads and make Ghanaians happy next time,” Boye said as quoted by Saddick Adams.

Ghana were seeking to end their 37-year wait for continental success, having won their last title in 1982.

Kwesi Appiah's side came close to ending their drought at the last six tournaments, having reached the semi-finals, and even going as far as the final in 2010 and 2015.

It is however unclear if Appiah will remain in the dugout for the next AFCON which will be hosted by Cameroon in 2021, as there are several calls from football advocates to axe him from the post following the team’s failure to clinch this year’s trophy.

786,FL-2020-000164-IND,Millions at risk in Bangladesh as monsoon floods add to coronavirus worries - Reuters India,https://www.reuters.com/article/bangladesh-floods-idINKBN242606,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh have been marooned and thousands of hectares of farmland submerged, officials said on Wednesday, as floods triggered by monsoon rains ravage the country already grappling with the coronavirus.

Officials said the flooding in Bangladesh was made worse by heavy rains in the neighbouring Indian state of Assam. Millions have been forced to flee their homes in Assam after the Brahmaputra river that flows from Tibet into India and then into Bangladesh burst its banks in Assam over the weekend here, inundating more than 2,000 villages.

“Rainfalls and runoff from northern India have caused some of the rivers across Bangladesh to rise over 70 cm (30 inches) above dangerous levels,” said Jyoti Prasad Ghosh, an official at the Bangladesh Water Development Board. “The floods could worsen further in the coming days if rains continue in Assam.”

One disaster management official in Bangladesh who declined to be named said the crisis was expected to worsen in the coming days and more than 200,000 people marooned are at risk.

“The disaster is worsening by the hour, with several hundred thousands already severely affected by the floods, worsening the COVID pandemic and crisis in the country,” said Antony Balmain, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Bangladesh had 149,258 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Wednesday, with 1,888 deaths.

The floods threaten about 4.1 million people, Balmain said. “Around 16,500 people most at risk are being assisted immediately with evacuation, and while thousands more will be helped in the coming days.”

The double whammy is pushing many to the brink.

In Bangladesh’s northern district of Jamalpur, farmer Mohammad Manik had been earning a living selling vegetables. He said he had to stop that due to the coronavirus lockdown.

“Now all my vegetables are under the floodwater.” Manik told Reuters. “I don’t know how to survive anymore.

Heavy downpours have flooded parts of Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro, including the neighbourhoods of Botafogo and Jardim Botanico.

The month of April delivers 95mm of rain on average, but in nine hours on Monday night, 246mm of rain fell.

This report came from Copacabana Fort, south of Botafogo and on the peninsula separating the famous beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema. This was the first report of rain this month and, if confirmed, it will mark the highest 24-hour rain total ever recorded in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

The former capital of Brazil can expect rain every month of the year but the “rainy season” lasts from December to March.

As the sun goes north to bring summer to the northern hemisphere, the heaviest rain follows it. The heaviest rain is typically north of Rio. Civil defence officials say heavy rains in northeastern Brazil have killed at least three people and displaced 3,600.

In the state of Piaui, the capital of Teresina, received 77mm of rain in a single night, flooding a neighbourhood and killing three people.

In neighbouring Ceara state, meteorologists have recorded 162.3mm of rain in the city of Granja so far this month. That has caused the Coreau River to flood.

470,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,How digital technologies can help Africa's smallholder farmers - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/how-digital-technologies-can-help-africa-s-smallholder-farmers,"Abdul-Rahim Abdulai PHD Student, @Feeding9Blilion Research Lab, Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics/Arrell Food Institute, University of Guelph

Digitisation could change the game for agriculture in Africa. That’s a key message in a report recently released by an international institution that enhances smallholder farming in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.

The Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) focuses on poverty reduction through modernising smallholder farming by fostering innovation and knowledge sharing.

Digitisation refers to everything from delivering farming advice via text messaging to interactive voice response. It also includes smart phone applications that link farmers to multimedia advisory content, farm inputs, and buyers. And it covers the use of drones and satellite systems to inform farmer activities, such as crops and times to plant; and types and amounts of inputs to use.

Other global organisations have echoed this message. These range from NGOs like Solidaridad Network – a civil society organisation that accelerates sustainable and inclusive development – to the World Bank. These organisations believe that digital technologies can create employment for young people in the agricultural sector, promote economic activity, and enhance food security.

For the past two decades, digitisation has steadily transformed African farming. In Ghana, for instance, online platforms such as Esoko, Farmerline, and Trotro Tractor have provided farmers with accessible services. These have included voice messages and SMS extension advice. This helps farmers obtain information about how to access markets and extension services.

Elsewhere on the continent, international organisations help provide precision advice to farmers. An example is the CTA’s ‘Transforming Africa’s agriculture: Eyes in the sky, smart techs on the ground"" project that supports the use of drones for agriculture.

The continent’s digital agriculture industry is growing. The number of farmers subscribed to digital services has grown by between 40% and 45% per year in the last three years.

Annual revenues from digitally supported farming are estimated at about $140 million. Services are provided by a small but growing number of providers — some of which are estimated to generate €90 of revenue per farmer annually, partly through service charges. This trend looks set to continue.

But the success of digitisation in agriculture shouldn’t just be evaluated by its economic value. Its benefits must be enjoyed by smallholder farmers and rural populations. Smallholder farmers, most of whom have access to less than two acres of land, produce more than 80% of the food in sub-Saharan Africa.

African smallholder farmers will ultimately determine the continent’s digital farming story. Only through collaborations with them, and among sectors, will the digital transformation become a success in Africa.

Challenges of smallholder farming

Smallholder farmers face daunting political, economic, social, cultural, and institutional barriers. They have limited access to information, markets, capital, land tenure, and even basic inputs like fertilisers and seeds.

Government policies, and the influx of foreign land grabbers in many African countries, only worsen the situation. Ethiopia, Ghana, and South Sudan are among the hot beds for foreign land deals.

Added to these are environmental issues like soil erosion and a changing climate. In recent years, droughts, rising temperatures, and El-Niño events left nearly thirteen million people from Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia needing humanitarian assistance.

This makes traditional farming hard for smallholders across the continent, and can undermine their capacity to fully benefit from the digital revolution.

Also, connectivity tends to be limited in rural areas. And, even if farmers can connect, they may not have enough money to access the services.

These concerns limit the production and profits of farmers and undermine rural development. This is where digitisation comes in. It has potential to increase access to information and resources to provide solutions.

Elsewhere, digital technologies are already showing promise for rural farmers. The Chinese government partners with private actors like Alibaba to digitise agriculture. From web-portals to Mobile Internet Based Services, rural farmers benefit from access extension advice and capital. This leads to increased productivity and incomes.

Inclusion in digitisation

There have been positive strides in ensuring smallholders become involved in digital agriculture. An estimated 33 million people – about 13% of all sub-Saharan African smallholders and pastoralists – are already registered for services such as weather updates and market linkages.

Ethiopia’s “80-28” hotline - a farmer advisory service - has about 4 million users, the highest on the continent. Beyond being a free service, its success is partly due to the delivery of services in local languages. Aligning services to local circumstances encourages farmers to subscribe willingly.

Kenya leads the way in digitisation in Africa. Collaborations between agriculture and telecommunication has been instrumental in their success so far.

What’s missing

These examples show what is necessary to help smallholders become connected to digital services.

One additional strategy is to blur the boundaries between different sectors. Digitisation is not just an agricultural issue, or a technological one. It involves many parts of the economy. Hence, digitisation must be situated within a broader development and poverty reduction agenda. For instance, education is critical to farmers’ ability to use and benefit from digital technologies.

It is also crucial to place smallholders front and centre when designing policies and specific digital products meant to help them. In this way, digital transformation will reflect the users’ needs.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photo GettyBELLINZONA, Switzerland—Allegations of rape, killing, and cannibalism made the man an outlaw who victims say roared like a lion before striking his prey, and yet the chances were that he would outrun justice.A quarter-century after his alleged crimes, Alieu Kosiah is now in a European detention facility awaiting a decision on his fate, facing up to 20 years in prison.Kosiah fled recriminations at home and was living a new life in a picturesque region of Switzerland, one of the world’s wealthiest nations, when officials finally apprehended him.He is accused of multiple murders and serial rapes back in Liberia, West Africa. The trial came to life thanks to seven plaintiffs, six of whom traveled to Europe to face the man they say once terrorized them. The seventh victim, who The Daily Beast is calling Teta, alleges she was kidnapped and raped by Kosiah, who she says removed a rifle slung across his shoulder and pulled a knife from his belt before he repeatedly violated her.The Terrifying Tale of the Killer Cannibal Who Walked FreeTeta, who gave birth to a premature baby during the trial, provided evidence via videolink from Monrovia, as the child was too fragile to travel. The court asked Teta how she felt towards Kosiah all these years later. She feared him, she said, and buried her head in her hands. “He’s a killer and rapist,” she said. The judge asked if she was waiting for an apology. “I can’t accept his apologies,” she replied. On a subsequent call, when asked how she found the courage to testify despite her trepidation, she told The Daily Beast, “I want justice. He should be judged; he should be tried.”Even once he was arrested—after some two decades of living peacefully in Europe—the prospect of this trial seemed remote. Evidence in such a case is hard to pull together when crime scenes have been destroyed, and witnesses are long since dead. But Swiss prosecutors eventually indicted Kosiah after five years of criminal investigations.According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, the case is monumental because it represents many firsts in the fight toward accountability for crimes committed in Liberia’s back-to-back civil wars from 1989-2003. “It’s the first war crimes trial for sexual violence [in Liberia], for child soldiers, the first time a Liberian will be convicted or acquitted for war crimes, and the first time there will be a judgment for war crimes in front of the Swiss Federal Criminal Court,” Alain Werner, a Swiss lawyer representing several victims in the case, told The Daily Beast. The court is expected to issue a verdict next month.One of the witnesses, a tall man in his fifties wearing a striped polo shirt and jeans, said he watched as a close friend’s chest was sliced open before his heart was removed and served to rebels, including Kosiah, on a metal plate.This man, whose name is withheld to protect him from reprisal when he returns home to Lofa County in northern Liberia, told the Daily Beast that it was breath-taking to face Kosiah again in the flesh. “When you see him, it’s all you can do not to…” he said, as his voice trailed off. “You can’t imagine the brutality.”It was 1994, early in the rainy season, and the then 15-year-old Teta was tending to her family’s rice crops when the fighters arrived in her remote village in Lofa County. The war was raging, and members of the ULIMO faction had come to overtake the area from Charles Taylor’s group. The fighters took some of the men, including Teta’s father and brother, to the town center, where they tied their arms behind their back until their elbows touched. They ordered the women to cook for them and gathered all the rice and oil in the village; Teta fetched water and cleaned the dishes. The rebels, Teta observed, responded to a superior named “General Kosiah.” The General, who was 19, commanded the civilians to form a convoy to transport goods and ammunition, likely toward the Guinean border.Teta thought only of her survival, and when she saw an opportunity, she fled into the bush. She later made her way to the town center, where she’d last seen her father and brother, only to find them slaughtered. For several days, she hid in the bush without food. When the hunger had sucked the life out of her, she ventured to a nearby village to replenish herself. She noticed a group of rebels smoking and chatting in front of a house. A small boy, whose gun dragged behind his body, approached. “Come,” she recalled him saying. “If you don’t come, I will kill you. It’s the General that’s calling you.”Teta says she followed the boy to the General, the same one she’d seen days earlier in her village, named Kosiah. He wore military clothing, his eyes were bulbous, and his skin was darker than hers, Teta noticed. “You will be my wife,” she recalled him saying. Teta says she was ordered into a nearby house and locked in the bedroom. That night, she says, he returned and took off his boots, clothes, and weapons. Teta claims he then took her body for himself, raping her every few hours. His body splayed on top of hers, and when she cried, she says he threatened to kill her. The following day, when the door was left unlocked, Teta escaped. She was naked, had no shoes, and while she’d never menstruated before, she was bleeding. Kosiah denies the charges.Liberia Rethinks Its Past in Wake of Charles Taylor War-Crimes VerdictSexual violence during Liberia’s back-to-back civil wars was endemic. The true scale is still unknown. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimated that over 70 percent of sexual-based violations were perpetrated against women and girls, who were used as “bush wives” and domestic servants, among other abuses. Still, more than fifteen years since the conflicts concluded and took the lives of an estimated 250,000 people, civil war-era sexual violations carry a deep stigma, shrouded in a culture of shame.“The impunity for war crimes, in general, had an impact on ongoing impunity for crimes of sexual violence in Liberia,” said Emmanuelle Marchand, the head of the legal unit at Civitas Maxima, a Swiss-based organization that investigates war crimes in Liberia. “Liberia is still a country where violence against women is integrated,” Marchand told The Daily Beast.In 2009, Liberia’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission released a report recommending establishing a special war crimes tribunal. Still, Liberia has yet to hold a single perpetrator responsible for atrocities committed during its two civil wars. Some well-known warlords have taken up high-level government positions, and others have resettled in third countries, building families and businesses. The few cases involving war crimes have occurred in third country courts, in the U.S. and Europe, where perpetrators were found living.Kosiah, a former ULIMO commander who Teta said raped her, is now at the center of the first war crimes trial for atrocities committed during Liberia’s first civil war.In February, six Liberian men traveled thousands of miles by plane from Monrovia to Geneva and then by train to a tranquil town in the Swiss alps called Bellinzona, an Italian-speaking region near Italy's border. They stayed in a modest hotel in the historic town center, where rice was hard to come by, but pizza was in abundance. Some had never seen the snow and found the cold biting. Each was there as a complainant to testify before a panel of three Swiss judges at the Federal Criminal Court about their allegations against Kosiah. The seventh complainant and only woman, Teta, whose name has been changed for her safety, appeared by video stream from the U.S. embassy in Monrovia. She had given birth just days before. The fact the complainants had made it this far was a feat in itself.In 2013, Alain Werner, the Swiss lawyer who runs Civitas Maxima, an organization investigating crimes on behalf of Liberian victims to prosecute perpetrators in national courts, received a tip: a former ULIMO commander was living near Lake Geneva. Werner had never heard of Kosiah, but given the ULIMO’s extensively documented crimes committed in Lofa County between 1993 and 1995, he was confident there would be a case. Werner called their sister organization in Monrovia, the Global Justice and Research Project, whose investigators started digging.The American Warlord Guilty of Torture“It could have been that we got the name [Kosiah], we did the investigation on the ground, and nobody heard about it. In this case, that didn’t happen,” Werner said. “We got the name. We did an investigation. Crimes came back,” he told The Daily Beast. In the summer of 2014, Werner and partner lawyers filed a criminal complaint against Kosiah on behalf of seven Liberian victims. Swiss authorities arrested Kosiah in November that year, and he has been in pre-trial detention since.Much of the material evidence was damaged or destroyed following the first civil war, and key witnesses were killed or since died. Some witnesses feared retribution and refused to participate in the trial. Then, a global pandemic prevented willing victims and witnesses from traveling. When, finally, the logistics were in place, the Swiss courtroom held the hearing at reduced capacity. The complainants, their four lawyers, and two Swiss prosecutors sat at a distance with masks. Kosiah, who is now 46, sat slumped at the front of the room, wearing a white-collared shirt and casual jacket. His lawyer, Dimitri Gianoli, accompanied him.On the first day of hearings, a man, Mr. S, who grew up in Zorzor, in Lofa county, took the stand. He had a soft, round face and wore a collared shirt under a padded jacket. “Kosiah ordered a girl to be carried to his house,” he said. “If he called, you had no option but to follow. You could not refuse him,” the man, who would have been 15 at the time, told the court. For Werner, the strength of the case lies in victims corroborating patterns of crimes across Lofa County. “Kosiah randomly took a woman to rape her, and the woman managed to escape, in a completely different town [from Teta], miles away,” Werner said.At some point, Kosiah abruptly stood up and erupted in shouting. “It’s been six years,” he said, referring to his time in detention. “He lied,” as he pointed to Mr. S., who began trembling. Mr. S. took a break in the courtroom hallway, convening with other plaintiffs. “He’s very rude,” one man said of Kosiah, who had been shuffling through stacks of paper, elbowing his lawyer and whispering into his ear as the plaintiffs testified.Others who took the stand said they were certain Kosiah was the same person who committed the alleged crimes more than two decades earlier—they recognized his bulging eyes, his dark skin, and his anger. One was a former child soldier who, at the age of 12, said Kosiah had recruited him as his personal bodyguard; another said he saw Kosiah order his brother’s execution; and another said Kosiah and his men desecrated the corpse of a civilian and ate his heart.Between 1993 and 1995, Kosiah was a commander with the ULIMO-K as it took control of much of Lofa county, which became the site of gruesome and debased attacks against civilians.As the conflict ravaged Liberia in the early ’90s, the NPFL had targeted members of the Krahn and Mandingo ethnic groups, whom they saw as sympathizing with Samuel Doe’s government. According to news reports, Kosiah, then a teenager, had escaped to neighboring Sierra Leone when his family members were viciously murdered. There, Kosiah joined ULIMO-K, a Mandingo-based faction that took up arms against Taylor’s group, and rose through its ranks to become a commander.According to Swiss prosecutors, during this period, Kosiah violated the laws of war by committing rape, recruiting and using child soldiers, ordering pillages and forced transports, murdering civilians, and committing acts of cannibalism.When, in 1997, Taylor was elected president and the first war concluded, Kosiah fled to Switzerland, where he applied for asylum, claiming to be Guinean. His application was denied, but he later obtained permanent residence through his wife, who lived in the beautiful, mountainous canton of Vaud. The trial was made possible by a 2011 Swiss law that allows the prosecution of non-nationals who committed serious international crimes on foreign soil, also known as the principle of universal jurisdiction. The case is the first war crimes trial to occur outside of a military court in Switzerland; it is also the first, anywhere in the world, to adjudicate rape as a war crime in Liberia, setting a meaningful precedent. (The trials against Mohammed Jabbateh and Chuckie Taylor, the son of Charles, in the U.S., addressed rape during the war in the context of charges for immigration fraud and torture, respectively.)Kosiah claims he is not guilty of any such crimes, as he was not present in Lofa County during the relevant period. He also says that witnesses and victims of these crimes are conspiring against him and lying. Kosiah’s lawyer did not respond to requests for an interview.Teta’s lawyer, Zeina Wakim, flew to Monrovia from Geneva to accompany her on the day she took the stand from the embassy in the second week of hearings. The Swiss ambassador traveled from Abidjan, in Côte d'Ivoire, to ensure the process went smoothly; embassy officials were present, as were Swiss federal police. Teta, whose face is striking, wore a bright orange blouse and long braids. She described to the court, in thick Liberian English, that she had never been educated but that she recognized Kosiah. “It’s him who’s looking at the camera. I know him too good,” she said.After she escaped the house where she said Kosiah raped her, Teta crawled into the bush, following a road toward Guinea. She bled for three days and slept under tree roots to shield herself from the rain. She planted seeds along the way, telling people that if her mother came looking, she could find her in Guinea. Teta made it across the border and cooked for a local family who, in exchange, allowed her to sleep on their kitchen floor. Her mother, by some miracle, got word. She, too, ventured into Guinea, traveling from village to village, searching for Teta. A year or so later, they reunited. More than a decade passed, and when they heard a woman, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, became president in Liberia, they went home.Teta told me she still suffers physical pain and “feels bad” when she puts her mind back to the war. Today, Teta takes care of her mother, who is elderly, and her children, who taught her English. She is happiest when she’s outside farming rice, pepper, and cassava. On Sundays, she rests and attends church. The event that most occupies her time these days is caring for her baby girl, so tiny that Wakim thought they might lose her during the court procedure.

An eight-member official delegation from Islamabad will interact with Indian officials at the 116th Permanent Indus Commission meet during March 23-24 in the first face-to-face formal meeting since the intensification of political tension following Indias decision to change the special status of J&K and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Pakistan is likely to bring up its concerns related to the two hydroelectric plants over two tributaries of the Chenab river. Indian officials are prepared to allay all worries by supplying all necessary information, the source said.

At the last meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission meeting in 2018, Pakistan had reportedly raised objections to some design aspects of the 1,000 MW Pakul Dul and 48 MW Lower Kalnai plants, including the height of the reservoir, and water storage and releases that are yet to be sorted out.

As per the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, the eastern rivers of Beas, Sutlej and Ravi are under Indias control, while Pakistan controls the western rivers of Indus, Chenab and Jhelum.

India and Pakistan are also likely to discuss the two new run-of-river hydroelectric plants  Durbuk Shyok (19 MW) and Nimu-Chilling (24 MW)  in Ladakh.

The two sides may also talk about flood data arrangements with the view of the forthcoming flood season, the source added.

The Indus Commission meet, which is supposed to be held annually, got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The political tension caused by the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories was also a likely reason for delay.",2021-03-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['officials', 'plants', 'meet', 'pakistan', 'meeting', 'watersharing', 'mw', 'indus', 'hydroelectric', 'discuss', 'likely', 'commission', 'flood', 'india', 'project', 'exchange']",Pakistan,news article,English
615,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,2019: Natural disasters claim more than 1200 lives across East and Southern Africa - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2019-natural-disasters-claim-more-1200-lives-across-east-and-southern-africa,"The climate crisis contributes to at least 33 million people in the region – or 10% of the population across ten countries – being at emergency levels of food insecurity or worse[1]. Over 16 million are believed to be children [2].

New analysis from Save the Children shows over 1200 people lost their lives as the result of cyclones, floods and landslides in Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Malawi[3].

Southern Africa is warming at twice the global rate [4] and many countries have been buffeted by multiple shocks, including Mozambique experiencing two strong cyclones in the same season for the first time in recorded history.

As world leaders meet this week at the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 25), Save the Children calls on them to commit to greater action to reduce the impact of the climate crisis on children, in East and Southern Africa and globally, who will be living with the impact of their decisions.

2019 will be remembered as the year the climate crisis devastated parts of east and southern Africa, with floods, landslides, drought and cyclones leaving at least 33 million people at emergency levels of food insecurity or worse, according to new analysis by Save the Children.

A recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows increasing evidence that climate change is contributing to higher temperatures in the region, and that these temperatures are exacerbating the impacts of drought and flooding[5]. These climate shocks decimate livelihoods, leaving households desperate for food and putting children at risk of acute malnutrition - a life threatening condition requiring urgent treatment. Children also bear close to 90 per cent of the burden of disease attributable to climate change, such as malaria and dengue fever[6].

Repeated erratic and extreme weather events in east and southern Africa has meant that in 2019:

At least 1,200 people lost their lives as the result of cyclones, floods and landslides in Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Malawi[7]. This figure does not include the thousands of lives lost to drought, and Save the Children fears that soaring hunger levels over the past 12 months will have contributed to further loss of life as well as malnutrition, particularly amongst infants.

Ten countries across East and Southern Africa - Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya – are experiencing ongoing weather-induced crises, with an average of 10% of people living in these countries currently experiencing serious hunger [8]. With high populations of children – a total of 162 million under 18 year-olds across the ten countries - Save the Children estimates these figures include over 16 million children now at crisis or emergency levels of hunger [9].

Massive movements of people have created additional risks of children being exploited, separated from their families, or dropping out of school. By June 2019[10], over 1 million people across seven of the ten countries had been newly displaced by climate-related shocks[11]. Over half of these displacements were the result of Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi in March 2019, and was followed six weeks later by Cyclone Kenneth, which was the first time in Mozambique’s recorded history of two strong tropical cyclones in the same season. The storms were also the strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent[12].

By June 2019, the number of people forced to flee their homes as a result of climate shocks in the region was already the same as for the whole of 2018[13], and does not count more recent displacements from floods which have struck Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan over the past three months. These disasters have currently displaced at least an additional 1.1 million people[14], compared to 1021600 at the end of 2018. Based on the current trajectory, this figure could double by the end of 2019.

Save the Children is urging the international community to take greater steps to tackle the climate crisis and its impact on children around the world, which is vital for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the 2030 Agenda Pledge to Leave No One Behind and ultimately the rights of all children as outlined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. As part of this, the international community needs to work with governments in east and southern Africa and across the globe to support the development and implementation of national action plans on climate change.

Amran is a 13 year old girl whose home was flooded when the banks of the Shabelle River broke in Beledweyne, Somalia. Amran is now living in a tent with her parents and three siblings. Amran said:

_ “I was very horrified when I heard the water is coming and will be reaching our house. I did not know what would happen to me and my family. We were all very scared.”_

Save the Children’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa, Ian Vale, said:

“The findings of this analysis are grim, and show that the climate crisis is further entrenching inequality, poverty and displacement across East and Southern Africa. The climate crisis is happening here, it’s killing people, it’s forcing them from their homes, and it’s ruining children’s chance of a future.

“With these overlapping, unrelenting emergencies, the humanitarian system is also being stretched to breaking point. Repeated cycles of food insecurity from climate-related shocks is resulting in significant funding shortfalls and unmet humanitarian needs. We are reaching a crisis point in this region.

“As world leaders come together for COP25, we call on them to take strong decisions to reduce the impact of climate change and ensure the lives and futures of our children is protected. We call on donors to increase and sustain funding for humanitarian assistance across East and Southern Africa, with initiatives linked to existing measures to increase children's protection, access to health and education, and livelihood support. And most importantly, children need to be actively involved in international, national and local efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change.”

Save the Children is the global leader in protecting children in emergencies and natural disasters, working with communities to set up evacuation routes, pre-position emergency supplies, fight against the effects of drought, and access clean water.

971,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Uganda Floods Death Toll Rises as Rains Continue - VOA News,https://www.voanews.com/africa/uganda-floods-death-toll-rises-rains-continue-0,"KAMPALA - Ugandan authorities say the death toll from a week of floods and mudslides has risen to 36 people and left thousands stranded after heavy rains swept across a mountainous region.

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.



Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.



The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.



“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.



Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.



“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.



Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.



Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.



Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.



The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.",2019-12-09 08:00:00+00:00,"['continue', 'heavy', 'ugandas', 'say', 'week', 'waterborne', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'death', 'toll', 'unusually', 'left', 'rises']",Uganda,news article,English
721,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Why Canada’s political system makes it difficult to fight floods - The Conversation CA,https://theconversation.com/why-canadas-political-system-makes-it-difficult-to-fight-floods-118511,"Floods are some of the most damaging weather-related events in Canada, occurring so frequently that they’re the most commonly experienced natural hazard. In recent years, Canadians have witnessed a number of floods of historic proportions, largely in Eastern Canada.

Scant attention is paid to how history has shaped our approach to flood management in Canada. More specifically, little consideration is given to how our system of government handles hazard management, and how the current situation can be improved through the application of what’s known as “international relations theory.”

What’s in a theory?

Addressing events such as floods, wildfires, tsunamis and rising sea levels causes what’s known as “collective action problems” in international relations theory, which focuses on international governance. These events require co-ordination between multiple entities, usually sovereign governments, and this can prove difficult.

Tackling these hazards is hard because it requires a variety of states, each with their own interests and goals, to come together to address a common issue, provide a common good or achieve a collective objective.

These problems also suffer from what international relations theory identifies as the free-rider problem: Some states can reap the benefits of the collective actions of others while not fully committing to paying the associated costs themselves. Effectively, they get a free ride. For example, U.S. President Donald Trump claims that Canada and other American allies are free-riding on their NATO defence spending obligations.

There have been a variety of attempts to solve the problems associated with the need to take collective action, including the establishment of specialized international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as regulatory regimes like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Canadian floods & fires

The recurring effects of flooding in Eastern Canada and wildfires in Western Canada are examples of collective action problems within the boundaries of Canada.

Canadian history can give us better perspective on why co-ordinating flood management, in particular, has proven so difficult in Canada and what can be done about it.

The administrative makeup of Canada ensures that roles, responsibilities and accountability for a host of issues — like emergency management, building codes, land-use planning and the administration of renewable resources — are spread among three levels of government and other entities, including private firms.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn

The British North America Act and, later, the 1982 Constitution Act, assigned the management of forests and water to the provinces and territories.

This ensures that an often confusing host of local, provincial or territorial and federal ministries, departments and agencies have authority over how the hazards of wildfires and floods are managed.

In the case of forest management, there are 13 provincial and territorial ministries and one federal body that oversee Canada’s forests.

The situation is far more convoluted for flood management, as a greater number of ministries, agencies, departments, authorities, councils and other entities shoulder responsibility.

A flood of authorities

In Ontario alone, this includes 36 conservation authorities, the provincial Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 444 municipalities, the federal government — for waterways like the Trent-Severn, Rideau Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway, as well as Indigenous communities — and other owners of private flood management infrastructure.

Across the rest of the country, there is a similar mix of provincial ministries, federal, provincial and municipal agencies and departments, basin and watershed planning and advisory councils and private flood management infrastructure owners. All of them have varying levels of conflicting responsibilities and authority.

In most jurisdictions, there is no single entity in charge of flood risk. Within larger entities, there are separate departments that deal with various aspects of flood risk, from flood mapping, hydrology, flood modelling and flood defence to conservation and disaster assistance.

Flood management in Canada, in fact, is rife with the co-ordination problems highlighted in international relations theory and seen globally when it comes to combating other impacts of climate change and extreme weather events.

‘Patchwork quilt’

There are three major issues that highlight collective action problems in the governance of flood risk in Canada:

1) The patchwork of entities responsible for governing floods have a hard time communicating and co-ordinating among themselves.

2) The winding-down of the federal Flood Damage Reduction Program, Canada’s de facto coordinating body for flood governance, created a two-decade gap of communication between the provinces and the federal government. The program was significant because it set standards and facilitated cost-sharing. It was a co-ordinating body, setting minimum national standards for flood plain mapping and disaster assistance.

The federal government attempted to remedy the communication and co-ordination problems by earmarking $200 million in the 2014 budget for the creation of the National Disaster Mitigation Program.

It successfully set out flood mapping guidelines, but funding to the program ceases in 2020 and there’s been no announcement of a renewal.

3) Canadian flood risk governance suffers from the aforementioned free-rider problem. Municipalities control what gets built and where, enjoying the permit fees and property tax revenue from those decisions, but do not directly fund disaster assistance when catastrophe strikes. Instead, the provincial and federal governments do.

Private developers also exercise power over these decisions. But again, they don’t directly pay the costs for disaster assistance when their developments are flooded.

In fact, there are few incentives for decision-makers to pay the costs associated with making different choices when it comes to development and flood risk.

What to do?

So are there any solutions contained within international relations theory when it comes to the flood management dilemma?

Read more: Wicked problems and how to solve them

International relations theory informs us that collective action is difficult when dealing with situations where multiple actors at various levels of authority are involved.

It also suggests that the creation of dedicated institutions to assist with co-ordination can help and is precisely what is needed for flood risk governance in Canada.

The provinces and territories should establish a directorate or centre that would serve as a central hub for flood management and oversight in their respective jurisdictions.

The federal government should make the National Disaster Mitigation Program permanent and continue to restore flood-related communication, co-ordination, standard setting and cost sharing with the provinces, territories and other stakeholders. The program should create a holistic, risk management-based national flood management program.

We should not delay further action on the co-ordination of flood management strategies in Canada, especially given the recurring deluge of impacts on individuals and communities across the country.

917,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Floods And Food Shortages Threaten To Push Nigeria Into A Food Crisis - The Organization for World Peace,https://theowp.org/reports/floods-and-food-shortages-threaten-to-push-nigeria-into-a-food-crisis/,"Nigeria is currently dealing with twin crises, record-breaking flooding, and a food shortage. According to Reuters, this is threatening to push Africas most populous country into a devastating food crisis. In 2020, Nigeria has dealt with destructive floods that have killed at least 40 and have displaced over 15,000 people. Recently, in September of 2020, intense flooding caused by heavy rainfall in northern Nigeria destroyed thousands of homes and wide areas of crops. As reported by Reuters, the flooding in northern Nigeria has destroyed 90% of the 2 million tons of rice that was expected to be harvested this Autumn. This loss is equivalent to 20% of the rice that Nigeria harvested last year.

Destruction of rice paddies is not the only food-related casualty of these floods. A shortage of maize has made it extremely difficult for chicken farmers to feed their flocks due to the price of chicken feed more than doubling. For Nigeria, rice is the staple grain, and chicken is a core protein. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many movement restrictions and financing difficulties that complicated the spring planting of many crops including maize. The combination of crop-destroying floods and an already existent maize shortage makes it look as if Nigeria is on the brink of a damaging food crisis. Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, told Reuters that there is a real fear of having food shortages. The effect on the food system is going to be colossal.

Another effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is on fertilizer. After the viruss outbreak caused a shutdown of Nigerias sole urea plant for two weeks, many farmers opted to skip using fertilizer on their crops, which has limited their crop yields.

Through all of this, the Nigerian government is still doing everything it can to promote domestic food production and local Nigerian farmers, but that may not be enough to sustain a country of nearly 200 million people through a looming food crisis. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that not one cent of the countrys central bank dollars would go towards food or fertilizer imports in an attempt to encourage local farmers and producers over imports. In August 2020, Nigeria took about 4,000 tons of millet and sorghum from the regional economic blocs strategic stocks (ECOWAS), released 30,000 tons of its own maize, and gave four companies special permission to import maize into the country, according to Reuters. The Nigerian Economic Summit Group has also called for a complete overhaul of agricultural policy.

In an interview with Reuters, Nigerias Agriculture Minister Muhammad Sabo Nanono said that there is no question about it that there is an imminent problem with food insecurity, not only in Nigeria, but also in nations all over the world. He is absolutely correct in that statement. According to a report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) called the Ecological Threat Register (ETR), food security is a major symptom of the ongoing climate crisis that is projected to worsen over the next several decades. By the ETRs estimates, the global demand for food will increase by 50% by 2050. Approximately two billion people already experience moderate to severe food insecurity currently, and that number is expected to increase to 3.5 billion people by the year 2050. 822 million people currently experience undernutrition globally, leaving them at an extremely high risk of starvation. Additionally, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of food insecurity, at 52% of the population, and 18 of the 20 most food-insecure countries globally are located in the region.

What is happening in Nigeria should sound an alarm for the rest of the world. If the world continues on this trajectory, the climate crisis will only escalate in the coming years and decades. With that will come an increase in natural disasters, with flooding being the most common natural disaster to occur since 1990, according to the ETR. Flooding not only threatens peoples lives and property, but it also threatens the survival and harvestability of important crops, as seen with the current situation in Nigeria. Floods are also not the only natural disasters that will worsen with climate change, but wildfires and storm events like hurricanes will become more frequent and more damaging as well. All of these have the potential to threaten the food security of nations all over the globe. The ETR reports that 22% of countries will face catastrophic food insecurity by the year 2050, which would result in substantial displacement of people or substantial increase in undernourishment. That statistic shows that a food crisis like this will not be an event unique to Nigeria but could potentially threaten many other countries across the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst in worsening food security for countries around the globe. The United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) has warned that the number of people facing food insecurity could potentially double by the end of the pandemic. According to the Pullitzer Center, global shutdowns and border closures to curb the virus have caused tightened credit access to farmers, limited access to inputs for farmers, limited food transport services and food imports. Constraints like these have led to surges in food prices and limited many populations access to nutritious food. The effects of this can be seen in what is happening in Nigeria, and it has worsened food shortages that the country was already experiencing pre-pandemic.

The other countries of the world who have the means should take this opportunity to send humanitarian aid to Nigeria during this time in order to offset or prevent the looming food crisis. It would also be in the interest of the U.N. and other peacekeeping or human rights focused international organizations to aid Nigeria in any way that is possible so that the situation does not worsen into a debilitating crisis that could threaten millions of lives. The situation in Nigeria is of utmost urgency, so it is important that the international community acts with haste.

Furthermore, in order to take action towards preventing devastating food crises and worsening natural disasters in the future, the most important steps that nations can take is implementing aggressive climate change policies that curb emissions and aim to use cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy. This is especially true for countries who are the worlds biggest emitters and polluters, including but not limited to the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Combatting climate change will require an immense collective effort and continued inaction will only lead to more human suffering in places like Nigeria where people are already seeing the harsh effects of the climate crisis.

The impending food crisis in Nigeria is demonstrative of many issues that the world is facing. Swift action should be taken not only to aid Nigeria in combatting a destructive food crisis, but in the long run, all nations of the world should be putting progressive climate policies into effect. Growing food insecurity is a major symptom of a worsening climate, and the action should be taken now to ensure global food insecurity does not reach frightening levels in the future.",2020-09-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'climate', 'world', 'food', 'threaten', 'floods', 'push', 'crisis', 'nations', 'nigeria', 'insecurity', 'maize', 'countries', 'shortages']",Nigeria,news article,English

- Starlink is a company under SpaceX, a space transportations services company, and its offering broadband

- The company will be competing with network providers like MTN Nigeria, Airtel Nigeria, Globacom and 9mobile

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

ISRO scientists have given the green signal to the engineering model, while the flight model is being assembled in Banglore, IIT-K Registrar Sanjeev Kashalkar said.

Over 62 students and faculty members of the institute worked hard to built ‘Jugnu’ weighing 3 kg, he said.

On being asked about the delay in the project, he said it took some time for the faculty members and students as it was an indigenously built satellite.

“Jugnu is likely to be launched by the end of next month if everything goes according to our plans,” he said.

Even though Rs. 2 crore was sanctioned for developing the satellite, the cost was brought down to a lesser amount as the institute came up with indigenous technique, he said.

The ISRO and IIT-K had signed a MoU to develop the micro satellite in 2008.

The satellite which will be in the space for about a year will be launched with the help of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), he said.

The data received from ‘Jugnu’ will be studied with the help of a tracking system installed at IIT-K and the received pictures and information from it will be used for research purpose.

The satellite will help in gathering information regarding flood, drought and disaster management, he said, adding its control room and ground station both will be at IIT-K.",2011-08-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['students', 'saidthe', 'satellite', 'jugnu', 'institute', 'plans', 'iitk', 'launch', 'received', 'help', 'built', 'nano', 'launched']",China,news article,English
773,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Fueled by the Nile - nasa.gov - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146932/fueled-by-the-nile,"In the 1950s, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser set out to alleviate the cyclic flooding and drought periods in the Nile River region, build the agricultural economy and food supplies, and provide hydroelectric power to towns. Nasser’s government then designed a large dam to tame the mighty Nile River. The Aswan High Dam took a decade to build. The rockfill dam used around 44 million cubic meters (57 million cubic yards) of Earth and rock for its construction—a mass sixteen times greater than Great Pyramid of Giza. It offered better control of the flood cycles and more water storage than its predecessor, the Aswan Low Dam, to the north.

The new 111-meter (360-foot) tall dam created one of the largest man-made lakes in the world. Named for the Egyptian President, Lake Nasser stretches 480 kilometers (300 miles) long and 16 kilometers (10 miles) wide. Storing more than 100 cubic kilometers (24 cubic miles) of water, the lake took approximately six years to fill.

The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 acquired the data for this natural-color image of Lake Nasser (the Sudanese call their portion Lake Nubia). This composite scene was compiled from cloud-free images from 2013 to 2020. Located in a hot, dry climate with sporadic rain events, the lake loses a lot of water through evaporation and consequently shrinks seasonally in surface area. Water levels are typically highest in November during the flood season and lowest in July during the dry season.

Lake Nasser plays an important role in Egypt’s economy. Approximately one quarter of the nation’s population works in agriculture, which depends heavily on irrigation. With a reliable source of water from Lake Nasser, farmers have been able to plant more crops and to do so multiple times per year with the aid of fertilizers. After the reservoir was filled, the country was able to increase its arable land by 30 percent in the first few years, particularly to the west of the lake. Lake Nasser has also created a fishing industry and is a popular tourist attraction due to its crocodiles.

Researchers, however, are worried about the lake’s future. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which will be Africa’s largest dam for hydroelectric power, is expected to greatly reduce water levels in Lake Nasser and the amount of power generated at Aswan High Dam. Research shows the project, which was 70 percent complete in October 2019, could lead to an irrigation deficit for Egypt in dry years and a decline in fisheries. One study found the lake shrunk 14 percent in surface area from 2015 to 2016, which may have been due to the new dam and the partial filling of its reservoir.

Multiple and consecutive shocks, including drought, cyclones, floods and insecurity, have left an estimated 2.5 million people* -almost 10 per cent of the country’s population- in need of life-saving and resilience-building assistance in Mozambique

Poor performance of the January-March 2019 rainy season in southern provinces (Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane) caused substantial agricultural losses, with lingering effects expected to last until the next main harvest in 2020. Then, for the first time in recorded history, two strong tropical cyclones hit the country during the same season in 2019, leaving a trail of death, damage and destruction whose impacts will be felt well into 2020. Cyclone Idai made landfall in March 2019 near Beira City in Sofala Province, bringing strong winds and torrential rains to Sofala, Zambezia, Tete and Manica provinces. Six weeks later, Cyclone Kenneth struck the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula. Combined, the two cyclones killed at least 648 people (45 deaths due to Cyclone Kenneth and at least 603 due to Cyclone Idai); injured nearly 1,700 people; damaged or destroyed more than 277,700 homes; and fully or partially destroyed more than 4,200 classrooms. In Cabo Delgado, it is estimated that approximately 60,000 people have been affected and/ or displaced by insecurity since October 2017, including over 200 attacks on villages by armed groups and clashes between security forces and armed groups. For people in villages previously impacted by violence, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth’s landfall represented a crisis on top of a crisis.

More than 1.6 million people are severely food insecure, and this number is expected to increase to 2 million people during the lean season (October 2019-March 2020), according to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis and the Food Security and Nutrition Assessment conducted by the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN) in June 2019. Entrenched gender inequalities in Mozambique render women and children more food insecure and susceptible to malnutrition than men. In areas impacted by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, over 80 per cent of the population is dependent on farming/agriculture as primary source of income, and 76 per cent of households headed by women are reliant on subsistence farming. These smallholders have sustained significant crop loss, damaged land, and lost access to savings groups and most have inadequate seed supplies to prepare for the September/ November planting season. Farming families who had already been affected by drought lost all or large portions of their seed stores and the cyclones wiped out the lower-than-usual harvests. Following Cyclone Idai’s landfall, more than 715,000 hectares of staple crops were destroyed together with plant nurseries and irrigation systems, while Cyclone Kenneth affected nearly 55,500 hectares, uprooted over 100,000 cashew and coconut trees, and caused loss of livelihoods, including fishing and aquaculture. Farmers in Manica and Sofala – the two provinces hardest-hit by Cyclone Idai and the subsequent catastrophic flooding - produce approximately 25 per cent of the national cereal output. In Cabo Delgado, violence-related displacement has distanced people from their livelihoods and farming in rural areas may be impacted in the months ahead as communities fear going to the fields in case of attack by armed groups. In the central zone, there are indications that part of the agricultural losses may be offset by the production of the second season, prospects of reconstruction and good agricultural production of the next 2019/2020 campaign. Yet, drought-affected areas in the south of the country are struggling to recover and will likely face an early onset to the lean season. Humanitarian assistance provided in the hardest-hit areas has prevented a more severe deterioration. However, people facing severe food insecurity require urgent assistance through integrated interventions -food assistance, agriculture, livestock and fishery inputs, rehabilitation of infrastructures– to mitigate the lack of food and restore their livelihoods and assets ahead of, and during, the next lean season.

Malnutrition is expected to rise during the 2019/2020 lean season and, for the first time since 2001, cases of pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency) have been reported in Mozambique.

To date over 250 cases have been confirmed and the Ministry of Health is preparing for up to 3600 cases in the coming months. An estimated 67,500 children require treatment for malnutrition, including 6,500 for Severe Acute Malnutrition and 61,000 for Moderate Acute Malnutrition, according to the SETSAN nutrition survey which covered 31 districts as well as nutrition data in Cabo Delgado collected prior to Tropical Cyclone Kenneth. In districts affected by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, figures do not yet reflect the impact of the cyclones on acute malnutrition, as surveys were carried out before or immediately after the cyclones. Two districts in Cabo Delgado - Ibo and Mecufi – are facing a Serious nutrition situation (Phase 3 of the IPC Acute Malnutrition classification) from July to September and this is expected to increase to four districts – Nicoadala and Maganja da Costa (Zambezia), Balama (Cabo Delgado) and Doa (Tete) – from October 2019 to February 2020.

The cyclones significantly exacerbated pre-existing protection risks, including child protection concerns, sexual and gender-based violence, loss of personal documentation, and issues related to land and property rights. Before the cyclones, families affected by drought in Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala were adopting negative crisis strategies and emergency strategies, including selling productive assets and animals, and taking children out of school to perform household chores, including fetching water. After the cyclones in March and April of 2019, many families lost everything –their homes, their livelihoods and productive family members– and this has heightened the risks of adopting negative coping strategies, including pushing women and children into child labour, child trafficking, child early forced marriage and survival sex, to survive in the months ahead.

Concurrently, the cyclones drastically weakened the response capacities of the social welfare and justice sectors, causing large numbers of pre-existing and emergency-related protection cases to go unaddressed. In areas affected by Cyclone Kenneth (Cabo Delgado and Nampula) it is estimated that approximately 60,000 people have been affected and/ or displaced by insecurity, including over 200 attacks or raids on villages since October 2017 by unidentified armed groups and clashes between security forces and armed groups.

Furthermore, displaced populations, particularly women, often do not have clear tenure arrangements and limited access to land ownership, which aggravates their insecurity and vulnerability to exploitation. Legal support to secure tenure, especially for women, will be critical to set the most basic preconditions for recovery.

Three months after the cyclones hit, and just four months before the next rainy season, more than half a million people (100,000 households) are reportedly still living in destroyed or structurally damaged homes or makeshift shelters.

Another 60,000 people (over 12,000 households) remain in resettlement sites and an estimated 60,000 people have been affected and/or displaced by insecurity in Cabo Delgado.

Many of the shelters that people are residing in are unsafe, inadequately prepared, and lack access to fundamental basic goods and services –such as water and sanitation, shelter and non-food items (NFIs), health, education and protection services and safe spaces– which are their guaranteed minimum rights laid out in international human rights law and inter-agency guidance. Already before the cyclones, quality of housing both in rural and in urban areas was largely poor, mostly due to families’ lack of financial capacity to invest in quality materials, lack of knowledge of safe construction techniques (in urban areas) and traditional building techniques not being adapted to the increased impact of the climate related hazards. The high level of damage caused by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth was exacerbated by this prevailing poor quality of the existing housing stock. At the same time, pre-existing high poverty rates, compounded by high levels of food insecurity, have meant that many families have been unable to rebuild their homes to a minimum level of resilience. Reportedly, vulnerable families have been selling received shelter materials to buy food. At the same time, the precarious living conditions faced by people in destroyed or damaged shelters and resettlement sites have heightened exposure to protection risks, especially for women and children. In some sites, children must walk 3 to 7 kilometres to reach primary schools, while secondary schools are further than 7 kilometres away. Meanwhile, lighting in many sites is scant, numbers of latrines are insufficient, and women and adolescent girls are forced to walk long distances to access water and firewood – all contributing to increased cases of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (GBV).

People’s access to health was severely affected by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, with at least 94 health centres damaged, according to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment of May 2019. Equipment, furniture, essential medicines and medical supplies were also destroyed, and staff working in the health sector were themselves impacted by the disasters. People impacted by drought, cyclones/floods and insecurity remain exposed to disease outbreaks (cholera, malaria, dengue etc.), while there is limited access to essential health care services at resettlement sites. While emergency health assistance has helped contain outbreaks and provide life-saving care, challenges related to re-establishment of health services and ongoing provision of medical equipment and medicines remain. Hospitals and clinics in areas experiencing severe water crisis may not able to maintain basic services due to shortages of water, leading to potential closure of inpatient/ admission facilities, inability to conduct institutional childbirth deliveries and impact on those with chronic diseases like HIV/AIDS. In Beira City, which was among those hardest-hit by Cyclone Idai, one in six adults live with HIV, and access to anti-retroviral drugs was compromised by the cyclone. Of the total population affected by Cyclone Idai and Kenneth, UNFPA estimated that there were 149,000 are pregnant women, 17,572 women at risk of life-threatening, pregnancy-related emergencies. With a pre-cyclone maternal death of 452 deaths per 100,000 live birth maternal mortality continues to be a challenge in Mozambique. Destruction of birthing health facilities, equipment, medicines and loss of health records predisposes women and girls of child bearing age to limited access to SRHR services including antenatal care, family planning services and skilled attendance at birth, and could lead to an increase in preventable maternal and neonatal deaths and unplanned pregnancies.

The consecutive crises have negatively impacted education for both boys and girls. Some 1,300 schools and more than 4,200 classrooms were damaged or destroyed. Many school buildings still do not have roofs, some school toilets and water supply are dysfunctional or lacking, and damaged asbestos sheets in school compounds posing health hazards to children and teachers. There are still 50 resettlement sites in 4 provinces, with some 30,000 children 1 to 17 years.

About 90 per cent of them have access to a functional school but 24 per cent have to walk for more than one hour to get to school and only 14 per cent have a school in less than 15 minutes’ walking distance. In the resettlement sites, children learn in Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS); with no desks or benches for teachers or pupils and poor ventilation due to overcrowding and hot tarpaulin tents. Authorities continue to request support for the reconstruction and repair of classrooms and tents and to set-up new temporary classrooms. The quality of teaching and learning are also affected as many teachers and students remain traumatised, exhibiting symptoms of fear, nervousness and distress, resulting in lack of concentration. Female teachers, in particular, have concerns due to damage to their homes and for the safety of their children while at school. Psychosocial support and development of psychosocial support skills is therefore critical for teachers, parents and communities to enable them to assist school children. Contact time between teachers and pupils has reduced as the cyclones caused a loss of days of classes ranging from one to two weeks.

Schools in resettlement sites run shifts to accommodate more children. In some cases, pupils in higher primary or secondary levels do not study because there are no corresponding levels of education offered in their camps. There is apprehension that there may be an increase in school dropouts and early marriages as negative coping strategies for vulnerable families who have lost their livelihoods. There are already reports that boys are absconding from school to earn money for their families and of girls being forced to stay home when funds are limited, as families prioritise boys’ education.

Teachers need teaching materials and children need essential educational materials.

Reduced access to safe water and sub optimal sanitation and hygiene practices could increase the risks of water borne ad vector diseases. Safe water supply coverage in Mozambique stood at 49 per cent prior to the two cyclones, with a large disparity between urban coverage (80 per cent) and rural coverage (35 per cent) even prior to the climate events. Sanitation coverage across the country was 21 per cent, with only 11 per cent coverage in rural areas, and 40 per cent of people still practicing open defecation. Increased use of unprotected water sources increases the risk of outbreaks of cholera, typhoid, eye infections and intestinal parasites, and jeopardizes menstrual hygiene.",2019-09-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'plan', '20182020', 'affected', 'health', 'cent', 'kenneth', '2018', 'women', 'cyclone', 'cyclones', '2020', 'revised', 'humanitarian', '2019', 'children', 'response', 'school', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English

Description of the disaster

The lower Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam) experienced prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020 until early December 2020. This was due to the combination of numerous weather systems  the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka as well as tropical depression INVEST 94W. The three wind systems made landfall in Vietnam but brought along heavy rain to the rest of the lower Mekong region. Tropical storm Linfa made landfall on 11 October 2020, tropical storm Nangka made landfall on 14 October 2020 whilst tropical depression INVEST 94W made landfall on 16 October 2020.

The rainfall brought by the wind systems resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in southern Lao PDR. As of 20 October 2020, nine districts in three provinces of Salawan, Savannaket and Sekong were affected by the floods. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Based on an initial assessment on 20 October 2020, conducted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) with participation of Lao Red Cross, it was highlighted that 163 villages in the three provinces, with an estimated 15,305 households (97,514 people) were affected. Savannaket was the worst affected province with more than 10,000 households from 137 villages were reportedly affected in the province and two people had lost their lives. In Sekong province, around 3,000 people were affected, and two people had lost their lives. Salawan province reported more than 600 people affected with five deaths.

772,FL-2020-000038-EGY,China reports 141 dead or missing in flooding since June - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/china-reports-141-dead-or-missing-in-flooding-since-june/,"BEIJING (AP) — The Yangtze River region has seen its second highest rainfall in more than a half-century so far this year as deadly flooding strikes much of China.

Around 28,000 homes have been damaged and 141 people have died or are missing in the floods since last month.

Virtually all of mainland China has been affected, excluding vast far western areas such as Tibet and Xinjiang, according to Vice Minister of Emergency Management Zheng Guoguang.

The Yangtze, Asia’s longest river, and parts of its watershed have seen the second highest rainfall since 1961 over the past six months, Zheng told reporters.

Damage has been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, adding to pressure on an economy deeply impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, including virus-related shutdowns and the loss of overseas markets.

Hubei province, through which the Yangtze flows and famed for its numerous lakes and rivers, is under particular threat. The province’s capital Wuhan was the epicenter of China’s virus outbreak, which appears to have largely been contained.

The floodwaters have inundated towns across southern and central China and prompted emergency workers to shore-up embankments and dig channels to release overflow. Flood surges on 433 rivers have exceeded the warning level and 33 of them hit record highs, Zheng said. Apart from the Yangtze, other major rivers systems and lakes have been rising, including the Yellow River in the North, the Zhujiang in the south and Taihu, China’s largest freshwater lake just west of Shanghai.

Flooding in some areas last week forced the rescheduling of portions of the crucial four-day national college entrance exams that had already been delayed for a month because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Key tourist destinations in China’s south have sustained flood damage that is compounding financial stress caused by the massive drop-off in numbers of visitors.

Streets and homes were flooded with sewage water in Karachi on Tuesday, where the citys outdated drainage and waste systems were overwhelmed by another spell of heavy rain.

Of the total rain-related casualties, 31 deaths were reported in southern Sindh province, while 23 people died in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the agency.

It said 15 deaths were reported in south-western Baluchistan province and eight in Punjab province. Thirteen more people died elsewhere in the north of the country, including three in the Pakistan-administered sector of Kashmir.

Troops, rescuers and volunteers from the radical Islamist group Tehreek-e-Labbaik were seen evacuating people from inundated residential neighborhoods in Karachi as some families waded through waist-high water. Hundreds of people were forced to take shelter in the houses of relatives in the countrys largest city.

According to the disaster agency, troops using boats evacuated 300 people from rain-hit district of Dadu in Sindh province, while 1,245 people were evacuated from Karachis rain-hit areas, where residents said they were still waiting for help.

Scores of vehicles were seen submerged in water in Karachi.

The rains are expected to continue this week in Karachi, where the prime minister, Imran Khan, earlier this month sent troops to help local authorities in pumping out rainwater from inundated residential areas.

Monsoon rains are lashing Pakistan at a time when authorities are trying to contain the spread of the coronovirus, which caused more than 6,200 deaths since February when the country reported its first case. Pakistan reported nine more Covid-19 deaths Tuesday, one of the lowest numbers of daily fatalities since March.

Brazil had a trying start to 2020, namely 100 cities across three states who were under a state of emergency due to extreme rainfall.

According to Brazil’s meteorological agency, INMET, Brazil's extreme rainfall is caused by the location of the country, in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). SACZ describes an area that has monsoonal characteristics, which causes Brazil's summer thunderstorms.

Though the amount of rain that fell on Brazil between Dec. 25 and Jan. 26 was double the historical average.

Between Jan. 23 - 24, the city of Belo Horizonte saw 171 mm of rain. This amount obliterated the standing record set 110 years before.

In the state of Minas Gerais, more than 15,000 people were evacuated from their homes. In the state of Espirito Santo, 10,000 people were evacuated, and in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, 6,000 were evacuated.

Those who were evacuated stayed at makeshift shelters in churches, schools and fire stations.

In Minas Gerais, Brazil's second-most populous state, about 40 municipalities were badly hit.

The aggressive rainfall and flooding led to landslides.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sent in the Brazilian Armed Forces to provide aid in the affected regions.

The floods and landslides killed 70 people.

905,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Rainy season: Fears over impending flood in the land - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/rainy-season-fears-over-impending-flood-in-the-land/,"In fact, the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, who released the prediction, warned: the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.

Jolted by the report, many residents told The Guardian that they fear for the worst, noting that they had not recovered from the devastating effects of last years flood.

A resident in Bello Street in Ilasamaja area of the state, Tomiwa Sulaimon, said while she would love to move to another area before the rains start, it was not financially possible for her at this time.

She recalled: Last year when it was raining almost everyday, our street and house got flooded every other day. This street is a bit low and erosion has eaten a good part of the road and despite our little efforts to keep the flood at bay, the water always finds a way to get in. The worst part is that those refuse disposal trucks hardly come around, claiming that we owe them for several months but if they hardly come around, how do they expect to get paid? They come around only once in a blue moon and in the meantime, we have to find a way to help ourselves. I want to plead with the government to tell them to improve on their services so that people are not forced to dump refuse indiscriminately.

A shop owner, who identified herself as Blessing Ogbe, lamented that residents in the area were responsible for the constant flooding in the area whenever it rains.

Ogbe said: The landlords and agents are very greedy. Once they see one small space, they will construct shops on it, most times blocking the water channels in the process. At Taiwo Junction and Transformer bus stop, that place is a major water channel but go and see for yourself. They have built a row of shops there now, blocking the gutter. So, anytime rain falls, the water has nowhere to go.

The residents themselves are always so eager to throw refuse into the gutter when it is raining or by the roadside, some of which also end up in the gutter. The roads are bad and gutters are very narrow; so the water has nowhere to go as such. This has been a recurring problem for many years now and we have been making private efforts but we need the government to step in for us now.

An estate agent whose office is located along Okota road, Yusuf Isa, expressed fears that his office might not survive another rainy season, lamenting that floodwater finds its way into the office with the smallest rainfall.

He said: No matter how shortly it rains, this side of Okota road leading to Jakande Gate always gets flooded. We have carried out several interventions by ourselves and would appreciate if the government can step in now. We tried to channel the flood through Akiti to connect it to the canal at Oke-Afa but there is a limit to what we can do on our own. Because of this, Okota and Akiti are usually flooded but what can we do?

Many residents in Oke-Afa, Okota, Ibeju Lekki and Ikorodu areas of the state, who spoke with The Guardian, also recounted similar tales of woe. Lagosians who reside along flood plains of major rivers and drainage channels such as Owode, Iwaya, Makoko, Badia, Ijora, Isaalu, Pota and Shibiri, among others, could not be reached. But Bello had advised them to always be on the alert and ready to move to higher grounds when the need arises, adding that they would be duly notified at the appropriate time.

He stated that the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) of the ministry had been consistently de-silting and working on various linkages to the secondary and primary channels to enable them discharge efficiently and act as retention basins.

Bello also disclosed that the government was maintaining the long-established synergy with Ogun-Oshun River Basin Authority, which had ensured control and monitoring of the steady and systemic release of water from Oyan Dam to prevent flooding the downstream reaches.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, an engineer, also stated that the state government would dredge about 221 collector drains and 32 primary channels measuring about 72 km spread across the 20 local councils of the state to checkmate flooding.

He reiterated that EFAG would continue to de-silt various tertiary channels and manholes measuring about 100 kilometres across the state.

While restating the present administrations resolve to find a lasting solution to flooding in the state, he called on residents to desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on the rights of way of canals, adding that it was regrettable that several of the canals recently cleaned up were being littered with refuse.

Lagos might appear on top of the situation. But the problem of flooding at the peak of the rainy season is not limited to the state alone; it is a national problem. Since 2012 when floods killed 363 people and displaced over 2.1 million others from their homes between early July and November 5, no year has passed without the natural disaster claiming lives and property worth billions of naira in the country. From Lagos to Delta, Anambra, Imo, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Osun, Taraba and Kebbi states, among others, flood wreaks havoc on homes and farms yearly with adverse effects on the economy of the country and health of citizens.

The most recent report on the natural disaster, which was released by the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Muhammadu Muhammed, in early December 2020, stated that, the devastating impact of the 2020 flooding killed 68 people, affected 35 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 320 local councils and over 129,000 people.

Now, the question is: With another rainy season at hand and with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) predicting that the country is expected to have rainfall amounts from 400mm in the North to over 3000mm in the South, what are communities and the state governments doing to avert a reoccurrence? The Guardian spoke with relevant stakeholders in Akwa Ibom, Osun, Imo, Delta and Cross River states on the issue. The stories are as follows:

Solution To Your Flood Problem Underway, AIbom Govt Re-assures Apprehensive Residents

From Inemesit Akpan-Nsoh, Uyo

AS the rains begin to set in, residents of flood prone areas in Akwa Ibom State have sent a Save Our Souls (SOS) message to the state government to come to their aid so as to avert the perennial flooding they have been experiencing year in year out.

In Uyo, the state capital, residents in areas like Abak Road, Atiku Abubakar, IBB Avenue, Esuene Street, Ukana Offot/adjourning streets, Atan, Use and Effiat Offot communities have appealed to the government to replicate the magic it used to control flooding and erosion along Oron road by Nsikak Eduok and Edet Akpan Avenue in their areas.

x

The residents noted that controlling the flood in their areas would enable them to access their homes, have their properties secured and ensure that they would no longer live in fear whenever rain is about to fall.

Mr. Okon Etim of Ukana Offot street told The Guardian that the flooding on his street had for several years rendered many persons homeless.

According to him, the government had always given affected residents relief materials when their household properties were destroyed, with a pledge to find a permanent solution to the menace.

He, however, lamented that successive governments had tried to remedy the situation to no avail. Offot said the situation appears to have worsened as houses along Calabar, Port Harcourt and Esuene streets and parts of the Federal Housing Estate are no-go-area once the rains set in.

Other residents, including Mrs. Nkoyo Akpan and Augustine Effiong, among others, also called on the government to come to their aid, adding that they could not afford the money to relocate or construct another apartment at the moment.

Findings by The Guardian, which the residents acknowledged, indicated that structures in the areas were built on the right of way, thereby blocking free flow of floodwater.



Responding to the cries of residents, the state Commissioner for Environment and Petroleum Resources, Mr. Charles Udoh, said government was aware of the problem, noting that it has, in conjunction with the World Bank, awarded the contract that would address it to China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) at an estimated cost of N12 billion.

Udoh stated that the 7.2-kilomtre flood control project covers 17 communities in three local councils; namely Uyo, Nsit Ibom and Ibesikpo Asutan.

His words: The reality is that the government cannot go everywhere to de-silt gutters. So, while the government is doing the common areas, the government is calling on residents and citizens to also embark on de-silting of gutters. Flooding sometimes comes from bad habits like dumping refuse into gutters. We are also calling on our people to desist from dumping refuse into gutters. The waste management agency of the state is embarking on massive de-silting of drains all over the state.



This is in addition to the three major flagship projects of the ministry that talks about water collection and harvesting, erosion control project, one in Etim Umana, one in Anua and then the IBB erosion control. IBB will not be completed this rainy season, but this is the last rainy season that everybody affected on the IBB corridor will face flooding. Once that is done, the entire Atiku Abubakar, Abak road axis, Mechanic village, State Secretariat, Atan, Effiat and Use Offot communities will be evacuated.

We will also evacuate water from Area C Police Command. All the water will be taken to the outfall drain and also taking water at some point of Ring Road Two. But we cannot complete the entire process within this rainy season. The IBB project is 8.4 kilometres, the biggest flood control project ongoing in Nigeria now.



We Dont Want To Abandon Our Homes Again, Osun Residents Cry Out

From Timothy Agbor, Osogbo

Some residents in flood-prone areas in Osun State have cried out to the state government to assist them in mitigating the problem this year.

Speaking with The Guardian, residents in flood-prone areas like Rasco, Gbonmi and Gbodofon appealed to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to save them from losing their houses to flood this year.

A landlord at Gbonmi, Mr. Suraju Kamaruden, said many house owners and residents in the community always relocate to safe areas when the rainy season is at its peak, adding: We dont want to abandon our houses again. That is why we are begging our government to come to our aid and help us.

x

A trader at Rasco area in Osogbo, Mr. Jude Okpara, said traders in the area face difficult times during rainy season as flood always submerges their shops.

We dont have any other place to go. If not, we would have left this area. Although the government expanded the waterways about three years ago, the water still overflows its boundaries and submerges our shops. We are tired, he lamented.

Chairman of Olorunwa Sawmill in Oke-Baale community, Osogbo, Mr. Sunday Ajewole, said there was an urgent need for government to construct a bigger drainage channel that would accommodate much floodwater when the rain is at its peak.

He said: For the past seven years, we have been battling with flood. Every time we are in the rainy season, we always lose our planks to flood. Our government would always clear and expand the waterways every year but we are still battling flood. Most times when government fails to do something and we are approaching rainy season, we hire some labourers to help us clear the waterways. Sometimes we contribute between N80,000 to N100,000 and give to the dredgers. Still, we are not safe.

We have discovered that the problem is that we have only one ring that forms the bridge of the waterways. And the ring is very small. The water that gushes from Ona-Baba-Ona area and Arogunmosa community would divert at our area and the ring doesnt have the capacity to make it flow, as it should. It usually bounces back to where we stay, sweep our goods away and even sack residents out of their homes.

This year, to lessen the severity of the flood, the government has cleared the waterways for us but once it rains heavily, there will be flood. Until the bridge is re-constructed and a bigger ring is fixed, we may not be out of this flood problem. We dont have the financial strength to construct a bigger bridge and thats why we are appealing to government to come to our aid.

We have lost millions of naira worth of goods and property to flood in this area. We are afraid that if nothing is done again this year, property or even lives may be lost to flood because we have started seeing signs that it will rain heavily this year.

To prevent a reoccurrence of flood in the state this year, the Osun State Waste Management Agency said it has been sensitising members of the public on the need to desist from dumping refuse on floodwater channels.

T

he General Manager of the agency, Mr. Fatai Oyewole, told The Guardian in Osogbo that efforts were ongoing to rid major gutters of refuse.

We have been mobilising people not to dump refuse on waterways and major gutters, he said. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment has disclosed that it opened up some streams across the state during the dry season for easy flow of water. This, according to the coordinator of the ministrys Department of Flood Control, Samorudeen Odesanmi, an engineer, was part of the state governments efforts at preventing another incident of flooding in the state.

This government is proactive. Before the advent of this rainy season, we optimised the opportunity of the dry season to open up series of streams across the state for easy flow of water. If at all we are going to do anything on flood control, it would be minimal.

We have already marked off some areas we want to work on this year and they are waiting for governors approval. Much had been done before now and we are on top of the situation, he said.

Imo Commences De-silting Of Drainages, Vows To Demolish Houses Built On Waterways

From Charles Ogugbuaja, Owerri

AS this years rainy season gradually sets in, residents in Imo State and the state government have commenced preparations to mitigate the likely effect of flooding.

x

The flood-prone local councils in the state are the riverine areas of Oguta, Ohaji/Egbema and Orsu, among others. The locals in these communities began to experience massive flooding since 2012, which has resulted in loss of lives and destruction of their property. The flood, which occurs at the peak of every rainy season, had forced many residents to abandon their homes and relocate to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), where both the state and national emergency management agencies lent them helping hands.

A resident in Oguta, Jude Igwe, who called for quick intervention by the government, told The Guardian that he would not want a repeat of his past experiences this year, likewise other members of his family. He said: Since 2012, almost on a yearly basis, we living in riverine areas have been witnessing flooding. It is not something to behold. Now that the rains are setting in, we appeal to the state government to prepare and assist us in time. Some of us are poor. We shall be relocated to camps as usual. So, we are calling for early preparation in case such occurs.

Also, an indigene of Orsu, who identified himself simply as Okechukwu, recounted how his family lost valuable property in previous years and called for help.

I am not ready to allow flood engulf us again. We are preparing ahead of time. But government and good spirited individuals should please come to our assistance ahead of time. We also want government to build gutters that will channel water to the rivers, he said.

A community leader in Ohaji, Saturday Ochia, however, urged residents to desist from blocking waterways with refuse. He said: We want our people to adhere to the simple environment-friendly rule of clearing the waterways. We do not want to witness flooding this year in our community. We are educating our people.

Speaking with The Guardian, the Commissioner for Environment, Dr. Ikechukwu Njoku, said the state government was not leaving anything to chances, adding that it has commenced public enlightenment on appropriate waste disposal and clearing of drainages by holding town hall meetings with the monarchs, local government officials, community leaders and residents. He also disclosed that the ministry has commenced de-silting of drainages in Owerri, the state capital.

According to Njoku, the government has marked structures built on waterways for demolition, stressing that they were constructed in contravention of the states master plan.

He also gave assurance that the government has put a robust plan in place to ensure flood-free environment in the state capital and other communities, stressing that the Governor, Hope Uzodimma, would ensure the construction of standard drainage systems in the state.

Delta Is Already Prepared To Tackle Flooding, Commissioner Says

From Monday Osayande, Asaba

DELTA State government has declared that it was fully prepared to mitigate the impact of flood in coastal areas of the state this year.

The Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Christ Onogba, made the declaration in an interview with The Guardian in Asaba. Onogba noted that the state did not have to wait for NIMET or other agencies prediction on the effect of flood before putting things right.

Firstly, we keep on saying to everyone that we are in the era of climate change, so those communities living in the coastal line should find alternative homes before the rains set in, he noted.

According to the commissioner, it was necessary for flood victims to have alternative abode because government was no longer ready to build camps for those that might be displaced by flood due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We cannot set up camps as it used to be, but that doesnt mean we are sleeping. In fact, we have done a lot. We are resetting the drains, and very shortly, we will open one of the channels that is flowing into the River Niger, and good enough, the road side drain in Asaba is clean and working fine.

The government is prepared and we will never be taken unaware in the issue of flood. And because we understand that because of climate change, flooding is something that must happen, we will not wait for any prediction before we start making our preparations, he emphasised.

A resident in Ndokwa East council, Mr. Emma Agboma, lamented that several homes had collapsed in the area in the past as a result of flooding.

I think now that we are approaching rainy season, government should exercise its power early so that we are not taken unaware. They should be alert so that they can relocate some of us to upland. Many are willing to leave their houses but it is not easy to relocate from where you are used to over the years.

Government should do as much as possible to mitigate our suffering in riverine areas  Burutu, Bomadi and Patani. So, government should do the needful by building camps early enough for us to relocate, he said.

For Dave Ogochukwu, while government should try to evacuate people in flood-prone areas to avoid loss of lives, residents should also not dispose refuse indiscriminately, thereby blocking waterways.

The property that has been lost since 2012 till date is enormous and it is not good for the growth of the society. In recent times, several farmlands have been overrun by flood putting farmers in a difficult situation.

x

Over the years, government has made efforts to relocate people from the flood-prone areas but some people have been adamant. However, government should continue to sensitise the people on the need to relocate before the flooding begins, Ogochukwu added.

We Have Been Crying Out To Government For Help

From Agosi Todo, Calabar

LAST year during the peak of the rainy season, many communities in Cross River State experienced heavy flooding that destroyed farms and homes. Over 300 residents in the state were left homeless and properties worth millions of naira destroyed due to heavy rainfalls.

The rains destroyed farmlands specifically in Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Biase and Boki local councils of the state.

Some of the residents at Ikot Eka Edem in Calabar Municipal local council identified building of houses on waterways as the cause of flooding in the area.

A resident, Mr. Gab Otei, said he was apprehensive ahead of this years rainy season, lamenting that he lost his valuables to flood last year.

Otei said: Last year, the heavy rains wreaked havoc in the whole of this street. I lost my valuables because I was trying to save my little children from being taken away by the flooding.

I cannot leave this place because this is my fathers house and I stay here with my family. For years now, we have been crying to government at all levels to come to our aid and open the canals for free flow of water, but no response.

A resident in Kakwagom community in Boki local council, Mr. Augustine Ita, said: Last year, most of the yam and cassava farms were basically destroyed. We lost everything and you know that hunger was the effect of it. What those of us who farm in the riverine areas are trying to do now is to either cultivate earlier or make your mounds to be bigger than what it used to be, because if the mounds are very big, and the crop are up there, if the flood comes, it starts from the bottom of the mound. If God is on our side, we will still have something to hold on to. It depends on the strength of your mounds and how heavy the flood will be.

x

Speaking with The Guardian on measures the state government was taking to safeguard lives and properties against flood this year, the Director General of Cross River State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr. Princewill Ayim, disclosed that last year, over 510 persons were displaced by flood across the state.

Ayim stated that although the state had not received the yearly prediction from concerned government agencies on what to expect this year, the agency has started sensitisation campaign in communities in Calabar South, Calabar Municipality, Boki, Biase, Odukpani and Etung local councils that are prone to flood.

He lamented that people living in flood-prone areas refuse to relocate to safe areas because they insist on remaining in their ancestral homes.

Ayim explained: The way we do it every year is that we get informed from the national bodies. They tell us when there will be heavy flood and what to expect. For now we have not gotten any prediction but we cannot keep on waiting. We need to be proactive by engaging ourselves in activities that can mitigate heavy flood.

We have our local emergency committees spread across all the 18 local councils. They interface with the locals to inform them more about flooding and how to prepare for it. And at the same time, we are also collaborating with the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC). Luckily, we are among the states that installed emergency outfit; so if you are in distress and do not have airtime in your phone, you can dial the 122 free toll number through which help can come to you. That is in place already.

Apart from that, we use the media houses to educate the public to clear their drainage channels and to cut the entire weeds on the waterways. If you go to Calabar South for example, you see some stagnant water that if you dont look very well you wont know there is an artificial pool there.",2021-04-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['rainy', 'residents', 'water', 'world', 'flooding', 'waterways', 'flood', 'impending', 'season', 'area', 'guardian', 'nigeria', 'land', 'state', 'areas', 'fears']",Nigeria,news article,English
538,DR-2011-000121-CHN,All you need is some salt and chilli powder - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/all-you-need-is-some-salt-and-chilli-powder/article2411321.ece,"The humble guava is a powerhouse of affordable nutrition

The delightful season of guavas is here. The tropical fruit, a powerhouse of nutrition within the reach of the common man, is available at every street side here now. You can have it raw, ripe, plain or with a dash of chilli powder and salt. The more industrious can cook it and can it into jams and jellies.

Though available throughout the year, guavas usually flood the market between July and October. In Karnataka, the most widely cultivated varieties are the Allahabad Safeda and Lucknow 49, also known as Sardar.

The varieties

The Horticulture Department said the Allahabad variety of the fruit is large and round, with skin smooth and yellowish white. Sardar is primrose yellow and is sweet and tasty. Local varieties such as pink-pulped Navalur are, unfortunately, almost extinct.

Bangalore gets the fruit from Hoskote, Yelahanka, Doddaballapur, Devanahalli, Magadi, Nelamangala, and surroundings of Bangalore Rural and Kolar districts.

The fruit is at present seen as commercially unviable as, unlike, say coconut or mango, there is no organised market. So farmers grow it in small land holdings of less than an acre.

The price depends on the size of the fruit, and, yes, location. While right now it sells for Rs. 60 to 70 a kg in K.R. Market, it comes at a steep Rs. 100 a kg in tony neighbourhoods and prime shopping areas such as M.G. Road and Commercial Street.

“I sort the foods according to their size and sell them at Rs. 10, Rs. 5 and Rs 3 each,” says Hanumanthappa, who has positioned himself with a bicycle in front of the Vidhana Soudha. On an average, he takes home Rs. 300 a day.

According to the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, guava is grown in almost all the districts of the State in an estimated 4,240 hectares, though Kolar district alone produces over 30 per cent of the annual 23,000-tonne harvest.

The plant starts bearing within three or four years. On an average, a 10-year-old plant may yield about 1,000 to 1,500 fruits a year.

Being very hardy, the guava can withstand drought conditions, and gives an assured crop even with very little care. Its cost of production is low as it needs very little fertiliser, irrigation and plant protection. It is also grown as a backyard fruit.

Nutritional security

It is an ideal fruit for the nutritional security. A storehouse of vitamin C, the entire fruit, including rind, flesh and seeds, should be eaten for maximum health benefits.

Rafeeq Ahmed of Vijayanagar says he sources the fruit directly from farmers who come to the Housing Board in the wee hours to sell their harvest. “I buy three bags for Rs. 450 and earn a net profit of Rs. 250 a day. There is a lot of demand for it as other fruits like apple, pomegranate and orange are very expensive.”",2011-08-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['chilli', 'guava', 'powerhouse', 'salt', 'rs', 'size', 'need', 'varieties', 'little', 'sell', 'powder', 'market', 'plant', 'fruit']",China,news article,English

The flow alarmed Turkish officials and led their prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to vent at the five permanent members of the Security Council for what he called their failure to respond decisively to the crisis after nearly 20 months.

The United Nations reported that 11,000 Syrians fled to neighboring countries Friday, the vast majority clambering for safety over the Turkish border, in one of the largest single-day torrents of refugees since the Syria conflict began. It came as mayhem and deprivations were worsening inside the country, its president more determined than ever to stay and his fractious enemies still politically paralyzed.

''The world cannot be left to what the five permanent members have to say,'' Erdogan told a conference in Indonesia. ''If we leave it to the five permanent members, humanity will continue to bleed.''

Panos Moumtzis, the UN refugee agency official coordinating the response, told reporters in Geneva, where the agency is based, that the latest surge included 1,000 Syrians who reached Lebanon and 1,000 who reached Jordan, bringing the number of registered refugees to more than 408,000 in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. Agency officials said a few weeks ago that they anticipated more than 700,000 Syrian refugees to be living in these countries by year's end, straining their resources just as the cold Middle East winter intensifies.

The agency's figures do not include Syrians who have fled without registering, a number believed to be in the tens of thousands in Jordan alone.

Turkish officials said more than half the Syrians who fled into Turkey on Friday had been seeking to escape combat between insurgents and loyalist forces near Ras al-Ain, a northeast border town where fighting has raged for days.

The arrivals through the Turkish border crossing of Reyhanli in Hatay province included 26 Syrian Army defectors, with two generals and 11 colonels among them, the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency of Turkey reported.

The increased exodus coincided with new signs of defiance by Syria's president, Bashar Assad, in an interview with Russia Today, a government-run news service in Russia, a steady defender of Assad. In portions of the interview that were first released Thursday, Assad said that he intended to remain in Syria and warned that any foreign invasion would be a costly catastrophe.

In the complete version released Friday, Assad denied that Syria was consumed in a civil war and insisted that his forces could ''finish everything'' within weeks if foreign suppliers stopped sending weapons to the insurgents, whom he universally categorizes as terrorists.

Assad also denied that Syrian forces had shelled targets in Turkey and accused Erdogan — a former friend and now one of Assad's biggest critics — of coveting Syrian territory.

""He personally thinks that he is the new sultan of the Ottomans and he can control the region as it was during the Ottoman Empire under a new umbrella,'' Assad said.

The surge in refugees came as agencies of the United Nations and other groups met donor governments in Geneva to report on the crisis and seek greater financial support for the emergency fund for Syrian refugees, which has only received one-third of its intended goal of $488 million.

''There is more violence, more humanitarian suffering, more displacement and more losses,'' said Radhouane Nouicer, the refugee agency's coordinator based in Damascus.

The United Nations has also estimated that more than 2.5 million people inside Syria need humanitarian assistance, including 1.2 million displaced by the conflict.

John Ging, the director of operations for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that 4 million Syrians may need help in the country by early next year.

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has identified 10 local government areas in Cross River State that fall under the probable flood risk areas in view of the Annual Flood Outlook for 2021.

The agency also identified two local government areas in the state that falls under the highly probable risk areas for 2021.

The Director-General of NEMA, Muhammadu Muhammed, said this in Ikom Local Government Area while distributing relief materials to victims of windstorm in the area.

Mr Muhammed, who was represented by Godwin Tepikor, the zonal coordinator of NEMA, South-south, urged the state government to immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities to mitigate the impact.

He mentioned the 10 local government areas to include Yakurr, Calabar Municipal, Akpabuyo, Obubra, Bakassi, Ogoja, Biase, Etung, Odukpani and Ikom.

He said the two local government areas in the state that fall under highly probable risks areas were Calabar South and Abi.

The state should immediately commence their preparedness, mitigation and response activities so as to mitigate the impact of the predicted flood on the vulnerable local government areas, he said.

The agency distributed relief materials to over 1,000 households affected by windstorm in four communities in Ikom local government area of Cross River.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the distribution followed the windstorm disaster that occurred on May, last year, in Ogomogom, Akorofono, Nkarasi and Abinti communities, all in Ikom Local Government Area.

The director general said the items were approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, following the recommendation from the agency as humanitarian assistance to the affected persons.

The items distributed were bags of rice, beans and garri, tomato paste, kegs of palm oil, wrappers, blankets, bundles of roofing sheets, cement, bags of nails, zinc and ceiling boards.

He urged the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the items.

In his remark, the Director General, Cross River State Emergency Management Agency, Princewill Ayim, thanked NEMA for its intervention.

The Chairman of Ikom Local Government Area, Kingsley Egumi, thanked President Buhari and NEMA for the timely response to the concerns of their people, pledging that the items would be judiciously utilised.

Mfam Akong, who responded on behalf of the beneficiaries, thanked NEMA for its assistance.

The Director-General of FEMA, Idriss Abbas, made the call in a statement on Sunday.

He said most of the deaths recorded in the past from flood in the FCT were as a result of non-compliance to instructions and early warnings.

Mr Abbas, therefore, emphasised the need for residents to adhere to instructions and early warnings from relevant authorities.

He added that attitudinal change was the key to reducing disasters to the barest minimum in the FCT.

He disclosed that the Search and Rescue team of the agency recently discovered the body of one Garba Joseph, 43-year-old from Akoka-Edo of Edo State, after two days search from a flooded river around TradeMoore Estate, Lugbe, in Abuja

Narrating the incident, an eye witness account (one of FEMAs volunteer/vanguard Kenneth Chima) who captured the incident on video explained that they were four men that tried walking through the water.

And I kept warning them to go back, three of them went back but only this man insisted on crossing, unfortunately the water overpowered him and washed him away, he said.

He decried the increasing rate of flood in the FCT due to residents apathy towards the governments directives and early warnings.

This is also despite FEMAs consistent sensitisations based on The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) predictions of torrential rainfall and dangers of flooding.

He said NIHSAs most recent predictions warned of torrential rainfall and flooding from August, adding that FEMA had carried out aggressive sensitisation to educate residents on ways to prevent the impending flood.

He said FEMA was conducting sensitisation programmes in five different indigenous languages in the FCT using different media channels.

We recently organized a meeting with our Volunteers, Vangards and Divers from all the area Councils within the FCT to educate them on how they can sensitise their people on how to prevent disasters to minimize loss of lives and properties.

We also embarked on community to community flood sensitisation campaigns in the FCT and mounted billboards at all the flood prone points warning off and cautioning residents from these danger areas.

The DG, who reiterated the agencys commitment to reducing disasters to a barest minimum in the FCT, called on residents to complement the efforts of the FCT Administration by doing the needful.

He also advised residents not to underestimate the strength of water when it was flooded.

What we are experiencing now is flash flood, the water builds up speedily and comes unnoticed hence very dangerous, he said.

He called on community and religious leaders to take responsibility of sensitising their subjects, especially those who are living close to flood prone areas to move to higher grounds to avoid being washed away by flood.

He said that relevant authorities have been on their toes evacuating refuse around the FCT, distilling drainages and expanding narrow water channels to enable free flow of water for a safer FCT.

The Government of Nigeria has declared a state of emergency in the four worst-affected states of Kogi, Niger, Anambra and Delta. The Nigerian Red Cross Society is conducting rapid assessments in coordination with the countrys National Emergency Management Agency.

As well as the risk of further deaths and injuries, and damage to livelihoods and infrastructure, the Nigerian Red Cross is warning of a steep rise in the number of diarrhoea cases in Kogi, Niger, Anambra and Delta.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has launched an emergency appeal on behalf of the Nigerian Red Cross, seeking 5,425,000 Swiss francs to support 300,000 of the most vulnerable people for nine months.

947,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistan floods: 1.4 million children at risk of homelessness and disease - Pakistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/pakistan-floods-14-million-children-risk-homelessness-and-disease,"As many as 1.4 million children[i] face homelessness and disease following some of the worst ever floods in Pakistan, warns Save the Children.

In scenes reminiscent of the devastating floods that swept parts of the country in 2010, children are living outdoors, schools have been destroyed or damaged and agricultural crops have been lost. In many rural districts, people have only five days worth of food stock left.

There are concerns for the spread of COVID-19 and water-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, as a large-scale humanitarian operation gathers pace across Sindh province in Pakistans south-east.

Khuram Gondal, Save the Childrens Country Director in Pakistan, said:

During the current monsoon, Sindh province has experienced some of the heaviest rainfall for nearly 90 years and more heavy rains are expected.

More than 4 million people have been impacted by the monsoon floods and thats equivalent to the population of a city the size of Rome.

Make no mistake, this is an under-reported humanitarian catastrophe deserving of more attention, which would stretch the resources of the most powerful and richest nations on the planet.

One of the major impacts of the floods is on crops and livestock. Hundreds of thousands of acres of farmlands have been damaged, leading to fears for the supply of food.

We are hearing that in many flood-affected communities only about three per cent of households have received food assistance, with food stocks running out in five to nine days time, depending on whether people live in rural or urban areas, warned Mr Gondal.

There are worries for the disruption of childrens education, too.

A thorough assessment of the full flood damage to schools is urgently required, but in one district of Sindh our teams found damage to scores of schools, with some destroyed completely.

As a result, we expect long-term disruption to the education of boys and girls. We are also concerned that the damage to schools may aggravate the high school drop-out ratio of children, especially girls.

Partially damaged schools are not safe or ready to accommodate students returning after several months of learning gaps due to COVID-19, therefore an urgent rehabilitation and reconstruction approach is needed, said Mr Gondal.

The intense rains and floods that have battered Pakistans Sindh province raise the alarm for climate change, warns Save the Children.

We know that extreme and erratic weather events pose a growing threat to childrens ability to thrive. Its therefore never been more important for climate vulnerable communities to be supported to cope with and adapt to climate change, as well as build their resilience to hazards like floods, added Mr Gondal.

There are fears that todays floods could eclipse the floods from a decade ago, especially if the monsoon rains continue as predicted. But during the 2010 floods in Pakistan, international media attention led to a huge humanitarian relief effort.

The Pakistani authorities are working very hard to support their people, but they need urgent support from the international community, said Mr Gondal.

In response to the floods, Save the Children has mobilised humanitarian aid workers and supplies to:

Provide 400 households with emergency tents

Provide 700 of the most vulnerable households with emergency food rations

Pump water out of main roads to ensure access to school buildings and basic health units

761,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egyptian minister urges removing building violations on Nile waterways as higher flood expected - Egypttoday,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/92032/Egyptian-minister-urges-removing-building-violations-on-Nile-waterways-as,"CAIRO – 17 September 2020: Minister of Water Resources Mohamed Abdel Aaty urged officials to continue efforts to remove building violations on waterways, especially those of the Nile River, as the ministry expects a higher-than-average floods this year.

In a meeting officials, Abdel Aaty also urged removing illegal structures on the Nile’s northern branches of Damietta and Rashid, which he says obstruct the water network’s capability to contain excess water in the times of emergency and during annual Nile floods.

Earlier this month, Egyptian committee concerned with following up on the flow of the Nile River have reviewed procedures to monitor and assess the extent of the Nile flood this year.

The meeting, which was headed by Abdel Aaty, came as part of a series of meetings of the committee to follow up on the situation of rain on the Blue Nile and ways to deal with the flowing water.

The flood of Nile River this year will likely be higher than the average according to the committee affiliated with the Water Resources Ministry last month.

The initial indicators were based on the incoming water flow during August; however, it is still too early to make a final judgment on the type and size of this year’s flood, pending the months of September and October; the Committee said.

According to an official statement issued by the ministry, the committee reviewed the position of the Nile flood, and the measures taken by the Nile Water Affairs Sector and the Ministry's Planning Sector Forecasting Center, including monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the flood situation, and the quantities of water expected to arrive until the end of the current water year 2021-2022.

The statement pointed to the unprecedented high rates of rainfall in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and the high level of water in the waterway, explaining that coordination is taking place Egypt and Sudan in a framework of mutual cooperation, exchanging of data and information, and joint measurements in some measurement stations.",2020-09-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'expected', 'removing', 'higher', 'egyptian', 'water', 'abdel', 'waterways', 'committee', 'nile', 'ministry', 'minister', 'aaty', 'violations', 'statement', 'urges', 'urged', 'river']",Egypt,news article,English

8/4/2014 Update:Toledo City Government Declares Water Safe

Residents of Toledo can safely use their tap water for drinking, according to a government release lifting the “Do Not Drink” advisory.

“Effective immediately, customers of the City of Toledo Public Water system may now safely drink tap water. Consistent test results have shown Microcystin no longer exceeds the recommended drinking water warning of 1 microgram per liter standard set by the World Health Organization in testing done by the City of Toledo, the Ohio EPA and the US EPA,” the release says.

Residents who used no water for any purpose over the weekend were advised to flush their household lines. Residents who used water for toilets, showering, and other non-consumptive uses were not required to flush their lines. The city also asked all residents to conserve water “to help our water treatment plant as it returns to full operation.”

The City of Toledo has issued a “Do Not Drink” advisory for residents served by Toledo Water after chemical tests confirmed the presence of unsafe levels of the algal toxin Microcystin in the drinking water plant’s finished water. The advisory, spanning three counties in Ohio and one in Michigan, leaves more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without drinking water.

“Do not drink the water,” Melanie Amato, public information officer for the Ohio Department of Health,” told Circle of Blue. “You can shower in it, bathe in it, but do not try to ingest it. That means no washing dishes; you can brush your teeth with it as long as you don’t swallow any water, but we recommend using bottled water for that as well.”

“Do not drink the water.” –Melani Amato

Ohio Department of Health

The Toledo advisory was posted at 2:00 Saturday morning. Ohio governor John Kasich soon announced a state of emergency to mobilize more resources for the city.

Other emergency measures also became apparent across northwest Ohio:

Stores sold out of bottled water, sending residents into neighboring cities and Michigan to find supplies.

Local restaurants, universities and public libraries closed.

Several nearby municipalities that have not been affected by the toxin are offering water to Toledo residents free of charge.

The National Guard is charged with delivering 300 cases of bottled water from Akron, Ohio, as well as Meals Ready to Eat (MRE’s) for distribution to homeless shelters and other vulnerable populations who are unable to cook with their water.

Humanitarian organizations like the American Red Cross are responding, manning water distribution centers and providing water delivery assistance to homebound residents.

“[The bloom] is surrounding where the Toledo water intake pipes are.” –Justin Chaffin

Stone Laboratory

Microcystin is a toxin produced by blooms of freshwater algae, which are a vast and growing problem in Lake Erie—Toledo’s drinking water source. Microcystin can cause nausea, vomiting, and liver damage if ingested, and it has been known to kill dogs and livestock that drink contaminated water. Skin contact with the toxin can also cause irritation and rashes, though levels in treated water are not high enough at this time to warrant a complete ban on water use, Amato said.

Microcystin appears to be a growing public health problem in the western portions of Lake Erie. Almost a year ago, in September 2013, Carroll Township near Toledo detected dangerous levels of Microcystin in its water supply, shut down its water treatment plant, and simultaneously alerted the community’s 2,000 residents not to drink the water.

Toledo is the first major city in the Great Lakes region to fall victim to Microcystin contamination, despite testing and treatment for the toxin. The city allocated $US 4 million for water treatment chemicals last year—double what it spent in 2010. The spending increase is largely due to concerns about algal toxins. City water managers were especially worried after the Carroll Township crisis, which was alleviated by the township’s ability to connect to an outside water supply while it flushed the toxin from its own system. It is unclear if Toledo has similar options available. The city’s Facebook page states:

“It is understandable that there is a huge degree of public concern, but we would advise everyone to remain calm, an alternative water supply and a distribution system will be announced as quickly as possible.”

Algal Bloom Small, But Concentrated

The culprit behind Toledo’s drinking water problems is a toxic algal bloom in Lake Erie’s Maumee Bay. The bloom is not very large compared to past blooms, and Microcystin levels, though high, are not out of the range of those previously seen on the lake.

Toledo’s Water Treatment Process In an interview with Circle of Blue last October, David Leffler, commissioner of water plant operations for Toledo Public Utilites, described the city’s water treatment process: “Initially our intake sits three miles out into the lake, and we add potassium permanganate at the intake crib,” he said. “It takes about three hours to get to shore, so it’s got 3 hours of mixing time. The water tumbles through the pipe and gets into our low service system out in Jerusalem Township where a series of pumps picks the water up and puts it under pressure into two pipes to send it to the treatment plant. Now the treatment plant is 9 miles away. Once you pick it up at low service, we add activated carbon, so now it’s got permanganate and activated carbon in it. The permanganate does a couple things. It treats for taste and odor—that’s why we do it—but it also breaks down the algae and the toxin. To [travel] that 9 miles can take anywhere between three-and-a-half to nine hours to get to the plant, so a lot of that is absorbed onto the carbon.” “Then it gets into the treatment plant and once it’s into the treatment plant, we add limes for softening, we add alum to create a flock to gather up the fine particles and make them into large particles that drop out and the water gets clear so you get rid of all the suspended solids. Then it goes through a whole series of filters—sand filters and things to purify it—then we add chlorine at the end. From there it goes into two 35 million gallon storage tanks, and from that point is where we pick it up with our high service pumps and put it out into the system. “We test all along that route to see where we’re at, what we need to do, what we need to adjust, and it’s really not just a matter of throwing a bunch of chemicals at it. I have a staff of extremely talented, highly trained certified chemists that are constantly doing bench tests, jar tests, with the various concentrations [of chemicals] that we’re using to see what it does to the actual water, because we bring in samples of that water all along the process and they can visually see, ok if we go to this many parts per million it will do this, so they are constantly doing magic to it. They’re good. They do over 4,000 tests a month on the water.”

“The bloom right now isn’t big in terms of spatial coverage, but it is pretty dense in Maumee bay and that area of western Lake Erie,” Justin Chaffin, a senior researcher at The Ohio State University’s Stone Laboratory in Put-in-Bay, Ohio, told Circle of Blue. “It is pretty much surrounding where the Toledo water intake pipes are.”

The bloom in that area is very concentrated and thick, he added.

“I’m not sure what levels they were seeing coming in through their pipes, but we were out there sampling on Wednesday and we got Microcystin levels around 10 to 20 parts per billion.”

The acceptable level of Microcystin in drinking water is 1 part per billion, according to the World Health Organization. Typically, the city of Toledo is able to chemically treat their drinking water to bring Microcystin levels below that threshold, even if the intakes receive high levels of the toxin. Chaffin said that there was likely a mixing event—such as a storm or strong wind—that forced the toxic algae, which normally floats on top of the water, down to the bottom where the intakes are located.

The city is now hurrying to test water samples drawn from throughout the treatment and distribution system to track the Microcystin concentrations. Testing a batch of samples takes approximately three to four hours once the test is started, according to Chaffin.

“They are running water samples from hospitals, really from all over Toledo,” he said. “Everyone that does Microcystin sampling in the Toledo area is either sending their [test] kits to the Oregon [Ohio] treatment plant or the city of Toledo’s treatment plant. They are just swamped with samples and they were running out of kits.”

Toledo is also sending water samples to labs in Cincinnati to undergo a more complete analysis. There are approximately 80 different kinds of Microcystin-producing cyanobacteria, Chaffin said. Although all are toxic, their level of toxicity varies. The more extensive tests will help to determine a more accurate level of the toxin in the water.

Algal Blooms a Growing Problem

“Until we reduce phosphorus and address harmful algal blooms, I’m afraid it’s going to come on the ratepayers’ backs.” –Adam Rissien

Ohio Environmental Council

Commonplace in Lake Erie in the 1960s, toxic algal blooms disappeared from the lake following international, national and state efforts to reduce the phosphorus pollution that drives them. The federal Clean Water Act of 1972 was especially important for reducing phosphorus from city sewage plants and other “point” sources that discharged pollutants from a pipe. The CWA, however, did little to address phosphorus runoff from farms and lawns, known as “nonpoint” sources. Researchers have shown that a rise in phosphorus levels—particularly a form of the nutrient that is readily available to promote algae growth—has coincided with renewed blooms in Lake Erie, and international agencies have called for a reduction in phosphorus to alleviate problematic blooms in Lake Erie and elsewhere in the Great Lakes. The largest bloom ever recorded on the lake occurred in 2011. Scientists and environmental groups say addressing agriculture is particularly important for reducing the blooms.

“I have every confidence in the water treatment plant to figure out how to make the drinking water safe,” Adam Rissien, director of agricultural and water policy at the Ohio Environmental Council, told Circle of Blue.“Unfortunately, the options available to them are costly and that means a rate increase—there’s no way around it. Until we reduce phosphorus and address harmful algal blooms, I’m afraid it’s going to come on the ratepayers’ backs. And that’s not fair.”

NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is facing one of its worst floods crises in years after rainwater displaced thousands of people across the country.

The rains have been pounding the East African nation for the last two months.

Up to 32 of the 47 counties have been affected by floods but the worst are among those in arid regions, which normally receive little rainfall.

They include counties in the dry North namely Mandera, and Garissa and at the Coast like Tana River and Kilifi and in Eastern Machakos and Kitui.

Up to 300,000 people have been affected by floods, according to the Kenya Red Cross, and they are in dire need of food, water, clothing and shelter.

The humanitarian agency has also noted that over 70,000 animals have been washed away, hundreds of acres of crops destroyed and thousands of homes marooned by floods.

Tens of schools have further been destroyed by floods, affecting learning in several regions across the country.

A number of schools are hosting flood victims as hundreds of learners fail to report back for the second term which started last week Wednesday.

Other infrastructure destroyed include roads and bridges, with the government noting it would require up to 600 million U.S. dollars to repair the network.

Julius Korir, Infrastructure Principal Secretary, said 110 million dollars will be used on repair of rural roads while 400 million dollars will be used on fixing urban roads.

Kenya Red Cross puts the number of deaths at least 112 and the society has appealed for 5 million dollars in the short-term to support families affected by floods.

In the capital Nairobi, the worst affected are residents in the tens of slum districts across the city, who have been displaced mainly due to poor drainage.

However, the National Disaster Management Authority and Meteorological Department on Monday warned of floods in several city estates in the coming days due to expected heavy rains.

They include Langata, Syokimau, South B and South C, areas populated by the middle-class.

The Meteorological Department had predicted near-normal rainfall in most parts of the country between the March-May long rain seasons.

However, the rains have surpassed the intensity predicted by the weatherman, pointing to their unpredictability.

Analysts have blamed the current crisis to the effects of climate change, as the weather alternates from one extreme to another.

""Kenya is battling two extreme weather conditions in a span of four months. Before the heavy rains, the country was gripped by dry weather that saw people and animals in arid areas starve to death. Now the same people who were starving are dying of floods. It is unexplainable,"" said Henry Wandera, an economics lecturer in Nairobi.

He attributed the predicament to the effects of climate change, whose vagaries are raging due to forest destruction, among other man-made causes.

""It is going to mid-May when the rains are supposed to have subsided in intensity but they are getting stronger to the worry of citizens,"" he said.

Besides floods and dry conditions, pests and diseases are other effects of climate change the country is grappling with.

Kenya is currently battling Fall armyworms that have ravaged acres upon acres of the maize crop for the second season threatening the staple.

But the worst it seems it is yet to come for the East African nation as more rains have been predicted.

""Heavy rainfall of more than 50mm in 24 hours is expected offshore and in all counties along the Coastal strip. On Wednesday, moderate rainfall of more than 30mm in 24 hours is expected in the South Coast region,"" Peter Ambenje, acting Director of Kenya Meteorological Department, said in a statement Monday.",2018-05-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['crisis', 'climate', 'million', 'kenya', 'south', 'flood', 'faces', 'country', 'change', 'weather', 'grapples', 'worst', 'rains', 'rainfall', 'affected', 'dollars', 'meteorological', 'floods', 'xinhua']",Kenya,news article,English

The announcement by the interior ministry on Thursday followed a meeting between Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi about the status of the Dadaab and Kakuma camps. Most of the 433,765 refugees and asylum seekers living at the settlements are from Somalia and South Sudan.

“A joint team comprising officials from the Kenyan government and the (UN Refugee) agency will therefore be formed to finalise and implement a road map on the next steps towards a humane management of refugees in both camps,” a joint statement said.

Kenya has formally communicated to @Refugees its decision to close Dadaab & Kakuma camps by 30 June 2022. Among the precursory activities in GoK's roadmap is repatriation of refugees to countries of origin & socioeconomic integration of some of them through Work/Residence Permits pic.twitter.com/KuUSrjkLkE — Ministry of Interior (@InteriorKE) April 29, 2021

Earlier this month, UNHCR presented Kenya with what it said were “sustainable rights-based measures” for finding solutions for the refugees’ longstanding displacement.

This followed a two-week ultimatum given by Kenya’s interior minister for the agency to come up with a road map to close the decades-old camps.

A push by Kenya’s government to shut down the camps sooner was blocked after the country’s High Court issued a temporary 30-day order following a legal challenge filed by former presidential aspirant Peter Gichira that sought to block the closure.

UNHCR’s “sustainable and rights-based measures” to find a solution for the displacement of the refugees include voluntary return for refugees in safety and dignity, departures to third countries under various arrangements and alternative stay options in Kenya for certain refugees from East African Community, or EAC, countries.

“We are serious about completing the repatriation program which we started in 2016, in full view of our international obligations and our domestic responsibility. We therefore reiterate our earlier position to close both Dadaab and Kakuma camps by 30th of June, 2022,” Interior Minister Fred Matiang’i said, according to the statement.

“I believe that the government and people of Kenya will continue to show their generous hospitality towards refugees as they have done for nearly three decades, while we carry on discussions on a strategy to find the most durable, appropriate and rights-based solutions for refugees and asylum-seekers residing in the refugee camps in Dadaab and Kakuma,” Grandi said.

Refugees from East African countries will be given the option of being issued a work permit for free so that they can integrate into Kenyan communities or return to their country of origin, Matiang’i said.

Kenya has said the Dadaab refugee camp near the Somalia border is a source of insecurity. Some officials have argued that it has been used as a recruiting ground for the armed group al-Shabab and a base for launching violent attacks inside Kenya, but officials have not provided conclusive proof.

Kenya has been saying for years that it would like to close Daadab, near Kenya’s eastern border with Somalia and which hosts nearly 200,000 mostly Somali refugees.

A Kenyan court in 2017 blocked the closure of the Dadaab camp, saying it was not safe for refugees to return to Somalia.

The Kenyan government’s latest demand is seen as retaliation against Somalia for insisting on pursuing a case at the International Court of Justice over a disputed maritime border between the two countries. Kenya wants the case settled out of court.

Kakuma, home to more than 190,000 refugees, is located in Kenya’s northwest. Dadaab is in eastern Kenya, close to the Somali border, but many Somalis have moved between the two camps.

Dadaab was established 30 years ago and was once the world’s largest refugee camp, which, at its peak, hosted more than half a million people fleeing violence and drought in Somalia.

Speaking to Al Jazeera earlier this month, residents in both camps had urged the Kenyan government to abandon its plans.

“It’s very terrifying because we do not know the next step, like where are we going to go from here,” David Omot, an Ethiopian who has lived in both Kakuma and Dadaab since 2005, said of the closure order. “Where will we go? Back home we still have some insecurity, there are still some problems that people are facing, especially the youths.”

Austin Baboya, a South Sudanese 26-year-old based in Kakuma, said he has not known any other home than a refugee camp.

“I don’t know if the [Kenyan] government have sat down and considered the lives of people living in the camp or they just wake up and make those decisions,” Baboya said, calling on UNHCR and international donors to help find a solution.

“Before the camp was open very many people lost lives. Very many people fled their home countries … They have found a place to call home and I don’t think many of them are willing to go back.”",2021-04-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['kenya', 'refugee', 'kenyas', 'refugees', 'kakuma', 'camps', 'dadaab', 'countries', 'close', 'kenyan']",Somalia,news article,English
1036,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Kenya Flash Update #1: Floods | 30 October 2019 - Kenya - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-flash-update-1-floods-30-october-2019,"HIGHLIGHTS

â?¢ Heavy rainfall since early October has affected more than 100,000 people, displaced thousands and caused at least 29 deaths in Kenya.

â?¢ The rains have driven flash floods, mudslides and landslides in various counties, with Wajir county amongst the hardest-hit.

â?¢ Floods have damaged infrastructure, including roads and bridges, and access to food, education and healthcare has been hampered.

â?¢ The heavy rains follow a period of prolonged drought which saw the number of severely food insecure people in Kenya rise to 3.1 million.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Heavy rainfall in many regions of Kenya since the start of the short rains season in early October has led to riverine and flash floods, rock falls, mudslides and landslides. More than 101,000 people have been affected, mainly in the north-eastern, central, and coastal regions, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). The KRCS has confirmed that at least 14,000 people have been displaced who were living in low-lying areas where rivers have burst their banks. At least 29 flood-related deaths have been registered, according to media reports quoting the Government, and the death toll and number of people displaced is expected to rise in the days ahead as further information is received and verified from affected areas.

Destruction and damage of key infrastructure -including roads, bridges, schools and health facilitiesâ?? has been reported in multiple locations. At least 983 acres of farmland have reportedly been destroyed and 21,710 livestock washed away, according to the KRCS, severely impacting livelihoods, including in areas already facing challenges due to drought. At least 52 schools are inaccessible in Mandera and Wajir counties and some 14 health facilities cannot be reached in Mandera, Wajir and Marsabit. Many parts of Mombasa County have reported power outages caused by fallen electricity pylons or water-soaked transformers. Two bridges, including one linking Diani and Lungalunga at Kinondoni and the main bridge linking Tanzania and Kenya at Mihogoni trading centre, have been badly damaged. In Lodwar town and surrounding areas in Turkana County, nine out of 12 water boreholes were destroyed, impacting about 70,000 people.

In Wajir county, which has been particularly hard-hit, at least 43,000 people have been affected by flooding and at least 10 schools have been either closed due to inundation or are inaccessible for learners and teachers, according to the Kenya Initial Rapid Assessment (KIRA) conducted on 12 and 13 October. This will have an impact on students sitting their final primary and secondary level exams, which began last week. Roads linking various towns and settlements in the county are impassable, hampering the supply of essential food commodities and drugs for health facilities. There are reports of shortages of food and the price of available food has started to increase. Immediate priority needs in the area include the creation of diversion streams on Buna-Beramu Laga to reduce flooding into the town, emergency food assistance and non-food items to areas accessible by road and airlifting to inaccessible areas. Evacuation of low-lying households to safer ground and provision of water treatment chemicals are also urgent.

The rains -driven by the strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)- are expected to continue in the days and weeks ahead, with most parts of the country likely to experience above average rainfall until early December 2019, according to the Kenyan Meteorological Department.

The heavy rains and floods follow a prolonged period of drought in Kenya. Two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall and high land surface temperatures in many areas led to poor crop and livestock production and rapid deterioration of rangeland resources, according to the latest Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) report. Prior to the floods, a projected 3.1 million people were projected to face IPC Phases 3 (crisis) and 4 (emergency) in October. Although the rains may bring reprieve in some locations, in others there is a risk that they will damage cropping for the next season.",2019-10-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['2019', 'rainfall', 'update', 'food', 'wajir', 'county', 'areas', '30', 'flash', 'according', 'kenya', 'including', 'rains', 'floods']",Kenya,news article,English
177,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Analysis: 'Wilful ignorance': Flood-hit Australia urged to rethink climate adaptation - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-floods-climate-adaptation-a-idUSKBN2BI00D,"(Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Australia, now battling its worst floods in more than half a century, has failed to adapt fast enough to the growing threats it faces from the impacts of climate change, with its people now suffering the effects of “wilful ignorance”, analysts warned.

Heavy rains hit several parts of the country this week, sweeping away houses, roads and livestock and cutting off entire towns in the east. Dangerous flash floods killed two people and more than 40,000 people were forced to flee their homes.

“They call Australia ‘disaster alley’ because we’ve got a bit of everything,” said Karl Mallon, CEO of Sydney-based Climate Valuation, which advises homeowners and buyers on climate and extreme weather risks.

As global warming accelerates, it is bringing fiercer storms, floods and heatwaves, more severe droughts and a growing risk of bushfires to Australia.

“It’s a shame on us that we haven’t tackled this already... We’ve got every incentive and the money to do it, it’s just that we’re not looking at it,” Mallon told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Despite knowing about climate change since the 1980s, Australia continues to build homes in floodplains, he noted.

The problem is often rooted in “wilful ignorance”, he said, citing government reliance on land taxes, builders and developers putting profits before safety from climate threats, and homeowners seeking to minimise insurance payments.

Property buyers are given little information on flood risks, either by local government or banks and insurers, Mallon said.

“Sometimes the first time they find out is when they get hit - and they say ‘I didn’t know I was in a flood zone’,” he added.

Richie Merzian, climate and energy programme director at think-tank The Australia Institute, said so far the approach to adapting to climate change impacts has been disjointed between federal, state and council levels, curbing resilience.

“The federal government seems allergic to any mention of climate change which hampers smart policy responses,” he said.

‘SELF-COMBUSTING MANURE’

Last year’s bushfires - which Prime Minister Scott Morrison dubbed Australia’s “black summer” - killed more than 30 people, destroyed wildlife and razed over 24 million hectares (59 million acres).

When the crisis hit, Morrison’s deputy was reported to have partly blamed “self-combusting piles of manure”.

Meanwhile, the health of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the world’s most extensive and spectacular coral reef ecosystem, is in a critical state and deteriorating as climate change heats up the waters where it lies, conservation groups say.

“The first thing is to acknowledge that climate impacts will get worse and that ‘one-in-100-years’ type events will become more common, and we need to plan for that reality,” said Cam Walker, campaigns coordinator at Friends of the Earth Australia.

To deal with the risks, a region-based approach to adaptation should be crafted that allows for joined-up responses between different levels of government and communities, he said.

Mallon said government, mortgage lenders and insurers needed to offer homeowners incentives to upgrade and better protect their properties, ensuring roofs are stronger against storms and flood barriers built around high-risk buildings.

At a municipal level, increased drainage, better sea walls and modern fire-fighting equipment would help, he added.

To reduce damage from bushfires, he advised at-risk property owners to clear guttering of flammable materials, install sprinklers and shutters that keep out embers, and use fire-retardant paint.

NATIONAL ADAPTATION PLAN

Australia has sophisticated weather monitoring systems and has been able to issue flood warnings and evacuate those in harm’s way, potentially saving thousands of lives, said Merzian at The Australia Institute.

But despite the country’s vulnerability to climate impacts, the government has been slow to conduct a national climate assessment or prepare a National Adaptation Plan, he said.

In January, Australia’s environment minister committed to produce a new climate resilience and adaptation strategy this year, which it is due to publish before the COP26 U.N. climate talks in November.

As part of the initiative, Canberra said it would invest an initial A$12.9 million ($9.8 million) to prepare for disasters.

Protecting and restoring wetlands, mangroves and forests would help shield communities from floods and storms, while more trees in cities would also ease the effects of heat, green groups say.

Changing crops and tilling practices, and introducing livestock breeds that can tolerate drier conditions, are other options to combat droughts, said Will Steffen, a climate scientist at the Australian National University.

But conservative governments have been reluctant to change well-established practices in the agriculture and construction sectors, he said, adding that climate change has become “a partisan political issue”.

BAND-AIDS ON BULLET-HOLES

Environmentalists say Australia is its own worst enemy due to its continued reliance on coal-fired power, which makes it one of the world’s largest carbon-emitters per capita.

Green groups have long lobbied the government to ditch fossil fuels and set a goal to become carbon-neutral by 2050 - so far with little success.

“The government’s failure to significantly cut emissions puts Australia and the Pacific region at risk of more fires, floods and cyclones,” said Martin Zavan, campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific.

“When it comes to adaptation, you can’t put a band-aid on a bullet-hole and expect it to get better,” he added.

Friends of the Earth’s Walker noted that Australia had produced 240 reports on natural disasters since 1920, but citizens were still suffering the consequences.

“Adaptation without (emissions) mitigation means surrender on the issue of climate change,” he said.

456,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Vancomycin relieves mycophenolate mofetil–induced gastrointestinal toxicity by eliminating gut bacterial β-glucuronidase activity - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaax2358.full,"Abstract Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is commonly prescribed and has proven advantages over other immunosuppressive drugs. However, frequent gastrointestinal side effects through an unknown mechanism limit its use. We have found that consumption of MMF alters the composition of the gut microbiota, selecting for bacteria expressing the enzyme β-glucuronidase (GUS) and leading to an up-regulation of GUS activity in the gut of mice and symptomatic humans. In the mouse, vancomycin eliminated GUS-expressing bacteria and prevented MMF-induced weight loss and colonic inflammation. Our work provides a mechanism for the toxicity associated with MMF and a future direction for the development of therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION Suppression of the immune system is essential after transplantation and is commonly used for the treatment of multiple autoimmune diseases. One of the most widely used immunosuppressive drugs is mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (1). MMF has important advantages over other drugs (2), but, while effective in enhancing survival, frequent gastrointestinal (GI) side effects can lead to dose reduction or discontinuation, actions linked to increased risk of rejection and patient death after solid organ transplantation (3–5). The xenobiotic metabolism of MMF within humans has been well characterized (fig. S1) (6). MMF is hydrolyzed to active mycophenolic acid (MPA) and then inactivated by hepatic uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase enzymes to create glucuronidated MPA (MPAG) and a small amount of acyl-MPAG (AcMPAG). Enteric-coated MMF and intravenous MMF are also rapidly converted to MPA and subsequently glucuronidated in the liver. MPAG and AcMPAG are excreted primarily in the urine, but ~10% is transported by the ATP (adenosine triphosphate)–binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2) protein into the GI tract where bacteria expressing the enzyme β-glucuronidase (GUS) remove the glucuronic acid (GA) moiety to produce free MPA and GA (7). The resulting GA is available as a carbon source for bacterial metabolism, and the MPA undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. The gut microbiota, referring to all the microorganisms in this niche, and its associated metagenome (microbiome) influence diverse aspects of human physiology, and changes in its composition affect human health (8). The mechanism(s) contributing to MMF-related GI toxicity have yet to be fully characterized, but we have shown that hematochezia and colonic inflammation in a pediatric heart transplant patient taking MMF was associated with a shift in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and that mice consuming MMF develop weight loss, colonic inflammation, and changes in their gut microbiota (9, 10). In our patient, toxicity resolved only after the discontinuation of MMF, but in our mouse model, MMF-induced GI toxicity was reversed or prevented by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and was absent in germ-free animals. These observations suggest that MMF toxicity requires an intact gut microbiota. In the current study, we sought to further investigate the role of gut bacteria in MMF-induced GI toxicity using our mouse model. We hypothesized that MMF toxicity would be associated with alterations in the composition and function of the microbiome. We identified the ability of a single antibiotic, vancomycin, to both prevent and reverse the pathophysiological effects induced by MMF consumption, and we characterized the impact of vancomycin on the gut microbiome. We then explored the activity of gut bacterial GUS enzymes in the presence of MMF and vancomycin and examined the impact of vancomycin on MPAG catabolism. Our data suggest that the introduction of MMF alters the composition of the gut microbiota by selecting for GUS-expressing bacteria. Increased GUS expression and activity lead to increased concentrations of MPA in the colon, which is associated with colonic inflammation and weight loss. Human data suggest that increased stool GUS activity can be associated with MMF-related toxicity. Vancomycin eliminated the GUS-expressing bacteria and prevented MMF-induced weight loss and colonic inflammation without reducing therapeutic levels of MPA in the blood. This work demonstrates a mechanism for MMF-induced GI toxicity and suggests a potential clinical intervention. The interaction between MPA and the gut microbiome provides further insight into the substantial problem of drug intolerance and adverse drug reactions driven by microbial metabolism and may also represent a paradigm for how the metabolism of xenobiotics can create local GI pathology.

RESULTS Vancomycin is sufficient to prevent and reverse MMF-induced weight loss Using an established mouse model of MMF exposure, we found that vancomycin alone, when administered concurrently with MMF, prevented the weight loss caused by MMF treatment (fig. S2). The weight of vancomycin-treated animals did not differ significantly from that of control, untreated animals after 8 days of MMF exposure (103.2 ± 0.68% versus 98.84 ± 0.82%, P = 0.41). Vancomycin was also able to reverse MMF-induced weight loss even with continued exposure to MMF. As seen previously, MMF caused significant weight loss with animals weighing 75.02 ± 1.5% of their initial weight after 8 days, but in the subsequent 8 days after the introduction of vancomycin, animal weights improved significantly with recovery back to 93.82 ± 1.2% of their initial weight (Fig. 1A). Although animals exposed to MMF and vancomycin were still significantly smaller than control, untreated animals (105.7 ± 1.5%, P = 0.003), they were significantly heavier than animals that continued to be exposed to MMF (69.26 ± 0.93%, P = 0.014). Consistent with the improvement in body weight, vancomycin also improved colon length and restored weight of the cecum, liver, and spleen. However, hematocrit remained significantly reduced (fig. S3). Whole colonic tissue homogenates were used to assess changes in the cytokine and chemokine profile of treated mice. Mice consuming both MMF and vancomycin demonstrated significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the levels of KC (keratinocyte chemoattractant, CXCL1), G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), IL-6 (interleukin-6), MIP-2 (macrophage inflammatory protein 2), LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), TNFα (tumor necrosis factor–α), and M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and significant increases (P < 0.05) in IL-2, RANTES, MIG, and IP-10 (Fig. 1B and fig. S4). In addition to vancomycin, the effects of individual neomycin, ampicillin, and metronidazole were tested for their ability to reverse MMF-induced weight loss (fig. S2). Metronidazole treatment actually exacerbated the MMF-induced weight loss, and ampicillin and neomycin were less reproducibly effective than vancomycin in preventing MMF-induced weight loss. Fig. 1 Effect of vancomycin on mouse body weight and colonic inflammation. (A) Vancomycin was sufficient to reverse MMF-induced weight loss even in the continued presence of MMF. Data represent two separate experiments with four to nine animals for each group and are expressed as means and SD for each time point. (B) Vancomycin induced significant changes (*P < 0.1) in multiple colonic cytokines and chemokines. Each column represents an individual animal. Vancomycin abolishes GUS-producing gut bacteria Using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing, we found vancomycin to have broad effects on the composition of the gut microbiota. After 2 days of vancomycin treatment (day 10), the gut microbiome of mice treated with both MMF and vancomycin was significantly (P < 0.05) distinct from the MMF-only group with regard to β-diversity as measured using a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plot of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and continued to separate from the MMF group over time (fig. S5). After treatment with vancomycin, the α-diversity of the gut microbiome decreased significantly as measured by observed species (277 versus 549, P = 2.8 × 10−4), the Shannon diversity index (1.42 versus 3.83, P < 1.0 × 10−7), and the Simpson’s diversity index (0.59 versus 0.92, P = 8.0 × 10−4) after only 2 days of antibiotic exposure. The Shannon and Simpson’s diversity indices both continued to be significantly lower in the MMF- and vancomycin-treated group for the following 6 days (fig. S5). At the class level, dominant bacteria included Clostridia, Bacteroidia, and Bacilli during the initial 8 days of MMF treatment (Fig. 2A and fig. S6A). Continued MMF exposure led to an expansion of Gammaproteobacteria, Erysipelotrichia, and, to a lesser extent, Deltaproteobacteria. After the addition of vancomycin on day 8, the Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Erysipelotrichia taxa were severely diminished, while Bacilli and Gammaproteobacteria flourished. By day 16, after 8 days of combined vancomycin and MMF exposure, the bacterial community was composed almost entirely of class Bacilli, with only a small proportion of Gammaproteobacteria remaining as the next predominant class. The classes Bacilli and Betaproteobacteria were significantly increased (P < 0.05) after the addition of vancomycin (fig. S6A). Considering the differentially depleted classes (Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Erysipelotrichia present in the MMF-treated animals but eliminated by vancomycin), the genera that were both significantly differentially affected by vancomycin and in relatively high abundance in animals after 8 days of MMF treatment were Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136, Roseburia, and Turicibacter (fig. S6B). We generated species-level resolution for Bacteroides including Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Bacteroides nordii, all of which were detectable in the presence of MMF but rapidly eliminated by vancomycin (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2 Vancomycin-induced changes in the gut microbiome. Amplicon sequencing of DNA extracted from mouse fecal pellets was used to determine bacterial composition. (A) Stacked bar plots showing relative abundance of bacterial classes in the presence of MMF with and without vancomycin. Vancomycin decreased overall diversity with a gradual predominance of Bacilli. (B) Bacteroides spp. were abundant in the presence of MMF but were rapidly eliminated by the introduction of vancomycin on day 8. GUS-predicted gene expression and measured enzyme activity are increased by MMF and abolished by vancomycin We examined the proportional abundance of the bacterial GUS gene using PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities using Reconstruction of Unobserved States). We found the predicted proportional abundance of GUS enzyme orthologs [Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology K01195, KEGG Enzyme EC 3.2.1.31] to be comparable between groups before commencing MMF treatment. After 4 days of MMF treatment, the MMF-only group had a significant increase in the predicted proportional abundance of K01195 (P = 0.006), but after 8 days, the abundance in the MMF-only group had decreased slightly (Fig. 3A). Functionally, the activity of GUS enzymes, assessed in fecal pellets of untreated and MMF-treated mice, followed the same pattern, with the treated mice exhibiting a significant increase in enzyme activity after 4 days of exposure (Fig. 3B). During the initial 8 days of MMF-only treatment, prior to the initiation of vancomycin, there were no differences between the two groups with regard to gene expression (P = 0.33) (Fig. 3C). The introduction of vancomycin after 8 days of MMF treatment reduced the predicted proportional abundance of K01195 after only 2 days (day 10). After 8 days of vancomycin treatment (day 16), the abundance of K01195 was reduced to nearly undetectable levels, in comparison to preantibiotic levels (P = 1.2 × 10−7), despite continuation of the MMF exposure. Concordant with reduced gene expression, GUS activity in fecal pellets was abolished by treatment with vancomycin (Fig. 3D). Fig. 3 MMF–up-regulated GUS expression and activity are prevented by vancomycin. PICRUSt and an enzyme activity assay were used to assess gene expression and GUS activity in mouse fecal pellets. (A) The proportional abundance of KEGG ortholog K01195 increased significantly (*P = 0.006) in the presence of MMF after 4 days. (B) GUS activity in fecal pellets collected from mice consuming MMF also increased significantly (P = 0.03) after 4 days. (C) The introduction of vancomycin on day 8 rapidly eliminated the expression of K01195. (D) Vancomycin, introduced after day 8, abolished GUS activity in fecal pellets (*P < 0.01). All data are plotted as means and SDs with data points for individual samples represented. Ex vivo imaging of intestinal GUS activity The effect of MMF and vancomycin on intestinal GUS activity in the intact animal was assessed using the fluorescent substrate fluorescein di-β-d-glucuronide (FDGlcU). Mice gavaged with FDGlcU and exposed to MMF demonstrated an up-regulation of GUS activity in the proximal colon after 8 days of treatment but not in the cecum as compared with controls. Vancomycin significantly reduced GUS activity in both the cecum (day 4, P = 0.05; day 8, P = 0.008) and proximal colon (day 8, P = 0.03) and also caused a qualitative enlargement of the cecum (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Intestinal GUS activity is decreased by vancomycin. Mice were treated with MMF or MMF and vancomycin for 8 days, and then GUS activity was imaged using the fluorescent substrate FDGlcU. (A) Ex vivo imaging of the GI tract from control mice. (B) Ex vivo imaging of the mouse GI tract after animals consumed MMF for 8 days. (C) Ex vivo imaging of the GI tract of mice exposed to MMF and vancomycin for 8 days. (D) Quantification of GUS activity in the cecum did not demonstrate a significant increase after 4 or 8 days of MMF exposure, but activity decreased significantly after 4 and 8 days of vancomycin treatment. (E) Quantification of GUS activity in the proximal colon did not demonstrate a significant increase with MMF, but activity decreased significantly after 8 days of vancomycin treatment compared with animals receiving MMF only. *P < 0.05. Vancomycin limits MPAG catabolism The catabolism of MPAG/AcMPAG (undifferentiated in our fecal assay) to MPA and GA was found to be significantly reduced by the addition of vancomycin in MMF-treated mice, as measured in fecal pellets using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. 5A). During the MMF-only exposure (days 0 to 8), we observed relatively high-average concentrations of MPA in both groups (35.2 ± 4.13 and 33.73 ± 4.50 μM) and relatively low-average concentrations of MPAG (1.85 ± 0.48 and 1.53 ± 0.47 μM). After the addition of vancomycin on day 8, there was a significant increase in the average concentration of MPAG (16.01 ± 0.92 μM, P = 0.01) and a nearly eightfold decrease in the average MPA concentration (4.27 ± 0.73 μM, P < 1 × 10−7). There were no significant changes in average GA concentration in either group over the treatment period. Notably, in serum, there were no significant differences between treatment groups for either MPAG, MPA, or GA on day 16 (Fig. 5B). AcMPAG was not detectable in either group by our assay. Fig. 5 Changes in MMF metabolites. The concentrations of MMF metabolites were measured in mouse fecal pellets and serum. (A to C) Comparison of MPA, MPAG, and GA levels in mice exposed to MMF only for up to 16 days and mice initially exposed to MMF only for 8 days and then with the addition of vancomycin for 8 days. Vancomycin treatment resulted in significant increases in MPAG and significant decreases in MPA levels (P < 0.05). (D to F) In serum from mice consuming MMF, levels of MPA, MPAG, and GA were not affected after 8 days of treatment with vancomycin. AcMPAG was not detected in the serum. Data are means ± SEM. The mean concentration of each metabolite before (days 0 to 8) and after (days 10 to 16) the introduction of vancomycin was compared independently in each treatment group using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with *P < 0.0005. Intrarectal administration of MPA promotes weight loss and inflammation To elucidate the identity of the toxic metabolite, we directly administered MPA and GA into the mouse distal colon. There was a concentration-dependent effect of MPA, which caused significant weight loss (P = 0.002) in treated animals and appeared to promote inflammation as indicated by a trend toward increased activity of colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (fig. S7). GUS activity in human stool correlates with MMF exposure Human fecal GUS activity measured in stool samples obtained from adult and pediatric heart transplant recipients was variable but correlated with MMF exposure (Fig. 6). Patient 1, with the highest level of GUS activity, experienced significant neutropenia that was attributed to MMF. Patient 3 is the patient from our case report who had developed hematochezia and lymphonodular hyperplasia related to MMF. Patients 10 and 11 were pediatric patients whose MMF had been discontinued following the recent diagnosis of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Fig. 6 GUS activity in human stool. Samples were collected from 11 adult and pediatric heart transplant recipients and 2 healthy, nontransplant controls. The highest level of GUS activity seen in patient 1 correlated with lymphopenia requiring a dose reduction in her MMF. Patient 3 had developed hematochezia and colonic lymphonodular hyperplasia while taking MMF. Patients 10 and 11 had been taken off MMF before sample collection.

DISCUSSION The use of MMF as an immunosuppressant is frequently limited by GI side effects. Attempts to relieve toxicity by modifying drug delivery, either through use of an enteric coating or intravenous administration, have not been successful (11, 12). The metabolism of MMF and MPA has been well described, but the mechanism of toxicity has remained elusive. Previously, we have demonstrated the requirement for an intact gut microbiome for MMF to cause GI toxicity in the mouse (10). Here, we now demonstrate the ability of a single antibiotic, vancomycin, to both prevent and reverse MMF-induced GI toxicity through the reduction of GUS expression, activity, and GUS-producing bacteria, and, consequently, decreasing catabolism of the MMF metabolite MPAG to free MPA. In our mouse model, reduced fecal concentrations of MPA were associated with reduced GI toxicity. Complete eradication of the gut microbiome with a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics was able to prevent and reverse MMF-induced GI toxicity (10). From those four antibiotics, it appears that only vancomycin is necessary and sufficient for the prevention and reversal of MMF-induced weight loss. Vancomycin is used clinically primarily for its ability to treat infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and colitis caused by Clostridium difficile. Its impact in reversing MMF toxicity was unexpected. Neomycin and ampicillin have broader activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, and metronidazole targets obligate anaerobes and specific protozoans. Vancomycin was also used to reverse MMF-induced colonic inflammation as demonstrated by improvements in cecum, liver, and spleen weights and colon length. Colonic tissue homogenates also showed changes in multiple cytokines and chemokines consistent with a reduction in the proinflammatory state induced by MMF exposure. This inflammatory stimulus was previously postulated to be a pathogenic bacterium (i.e., Escherichia/Shigella) that expanded due to MMF-induced dysregulation of the microbiome (10, 13). However, our present data suggest that the factor initiating the inflammatory response may be free MPA, released after bacterial GUS metabolism in the lumen, which interacts with the epithelium in the distal GI tract. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we determined which bacteria thrived during MMF exposure, presumably due to their consumption of free GA as a nutrient source (7, 14), and were eliminated by the addition of vancomycin. After 8 days of MMF-only treatment, there was a consistent abundance of the bacterial classes Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, Bacilli, Gammaproteobacteria, Erysipelotrichia, and Alphaproteobacteria. After initiating vancomycin treatment, the classes Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Erysipelotrichia were severely depleted, allowing for expansion of the classes Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli. Given the reportedly narrow spectrum of activity of vancomycin primarily against Gram-positive organisms, this response was surprising. However, a similar response was also observed in humans treated with oral vancomycin (15, 16). In the study by Isaac et al. (15), the authors found that humans consuming vancomycin for 21 days demonstrated a loss of gut microbe diversity and alterations in most bacterial taxa, including reductions in the Bacteroidetes (which includes the class Bacteroidia) and Firmicutes phyla. This study and our data suggest that vancomycin has broad effects on the gut microbiome, including Gram-negative organisms, or, more specifically, is affecting the gut microbe ecosystem and removing key (as yet unidentified) microbes, causing the collapse of important populations such as the Bacteroidia. The potential pathogenic bacteria Escherichia/Shigella (which cannot be distinguished based on 16S rRNA sequencing) of class Gammaproteobacteria, previously thought to be a primary cause of inflammation following MMF-induced dysbiosis of the microbiota (10, 13), expanded during vancomycin treatment, while inflammation and toxicity improved. The gut bacteria Bacteroides spp. and Roseburia spp., both enriched in the presence of MMF and eliminated by vancomycin, encode for GUS enzymes and have demonstrated GUS activity in vitro (17, 18). B. fragilis, B. uniformis, B. caccae, and B. vulgatus all increased in abundance during MMF treatment, and these bacterial species were eliminated by vancomycin, suggesting the capacity for bacterial GUS activity was reduced. This hypothesis was supported by our PICRUSt analysis and in vivo imaging of GUS activity. PICRUSt predicts the functional content of a metagenome from 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data (19). Functional orthologs are annotated in the KEGG Orthology database (20). In bacterial DNA extracted from mouse fecal pellets, PICRUSt predicted an increase in the abundance of GUS orthologs in response to MMF after 4 days. This suggests a rapid increase in bacterial metabolism in response to the introduction of MMF, but this increase does not appear to be sustained. This increase in predicted gene expression was supported by our in vitro assay for GUS activity, which showed a similar, transient increase in activity. In humans, levels of GUS activity were quite variable but did correlate with MMF-related side effects for two of the patients with the highest level of GUS activity and with the lowest levels seen in patients who had been recently taken off MMF as part of a reduction in their immunosuppression related to the diagnosis of malignancy. Levels of stool GUS activity in humans on MMF may therefore represent a potential biomarker to assess for drug-related toxicity, although this remains to be tested in a larger cohort. Assessment of bacterial GUS activity in vivo based on activation of a fluorescent substrate after GUS hydrolysis (21) demonstrated an increase in overall bacterial GUS activity in the proximal colon, but not the cecum, of MMF-treated mice as compared with controls that was abolished by treatment with vancomycin. In fecal pellets, relatively higher levels of MPA and lower levels of MPAG were measured during MMF treatment. The introduction of vancomycin induced a sharp increase in MPAG concentration, in tandem with a drastic reduction in the concentration of MPA, demonstrating that vancomycin does alter bacterial metabolism of MPAG in the colon. Reduced colonic concentrations of MPA in our model coincided with reduced GI and systemic toxicity, suggesting that MPA is the major contributor to MMF-induced GI inflammation and toxicity. The serum concentration of MPA was not significantly reduced in the vancomycin-treated animals. However, our assay did not specifically distinguish between MPAG and AcMPAG. In our previous work, MMF resulted in a modest increase in hepatic gene expression of the MPAG transporter Abcc2, but levels did not decrease with antibiotic exposure (10). Multiple human clinical reports have indirectly implicated GUS involvement in MMF metabolism (22, 23), and recent work by others further supports our hypothesis that MPA is responsible for the GI toxicity experienced by patients. MPA depleted the intracellular guanosine pool in human intestinal LS180 cells, potentially leading to reduced membrane integrity (24). Qasim et al. demonstrated that MPA directly modulated intestinal epithelial tight junctions in Caco-2 cell monolayers by up-regulating myosin light-chain kinase, leading to increased phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain and increased tight junction permeability (25, 26). This may occur via MPA-stimulated activation of the midkine-dependent PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathway (27). Our previous work supports these observations of MPA-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction as we found that MMF exposure led to an increase in serum lipopolysaccharide, an indirect measure of intestinal epithelial barrier function (10, 28). Together, these data suggest that MPA may trigger local and systemic toxicity by disrupting GI epithelial barrier function, potentially allowing toxic metabolites to cross into the tissue and circulation. In summary, our data suggest that bacterial GUS metabolism of MPAG to free MPA in the colonic lumen is responsible for the GI toxicity associated with MMF use. The GUS pathway responsible for MMF metabolism affects multiple other commonly prescribed drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, irinotecan, and cannabinoids (29). The ability of vancomycin to reduce toxicity suggests a possible therapeutic approach to treat or prevent MMF-induced GI toxicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals All animal procedures were approved by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee (protocol AC14-0068) and were in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care policies. Female C57BL/6 mice aged 7 to 10 weeks (Charles River) were used in all experiments. Mice were housed in sterilized, filter-top cages under specific pathogen–free conditions, separated by treatment group, and fed control chow (Teklad Global 16% protein rodent diet TD.00217) for a minimum of 1 week before commencing any experiment. MMF-containing chow was administered ad libitum at a concentration of 0.563% (w/w) (30). Vancomycin (500 mg/liter) was administered in the drinking water ad libitum. Consumption of both chow and water was monitored daily. Sample collection and assays Mice were individually placed in clean, ethanol-sterilized cages, and immediately upon defecation, each fecal pellet was placed in a sterile collection tube, snap frozen, and stored at −80°C. Whole blood was collected from anesthetized animals by cardiac puncture. Serum was isolated by centrifugation at 1500g × 15 min and stored at −80°C. Liver, spleen, and intestine were collected immediately after euthanasia. Each tissue was weighed, and colon length was measured before being placed in microcentrifuge tubes, snap frozen, and then stored at −80°C. Hematocrit was determined using a microhematocrit capillary tube reader. Whole colonic tissue was homogenized in cell lysis buffer, and protein concentration was determined using the Precision Red Protein Assay (Cytoskeleton). Samples were sent to Eve Technologies for analysis using their 32-multiplex Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Array. Bacterial community analysis Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from mouse fecal pellets (31), and concentration was determined using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). Variable regions 3 and 4 of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using barcoded primers (32) before sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq in the Nicole Perkins Microbial Communities Core Laboratory at the University of Calgary. Primers and poor-quality reads were removed using Cutadapt v1.16 and then processed using DADA2 v1.6.0 (33). Taxonomy was assigned using the Silva Taxonomy Training Set v128 and the Silva Species Assignment Set v128 (34). Visual and statistical analyses of amplicon sequencing data were performed using the R packages Phyloseq (35) and Vegan v2.5-2 with support from dplyr 0.7.5 and ggplot2 v3.0.0. Reads of nonbacterial origin and samples with insufficient depth (<10,000 reads) were removed. Observed species, Shannon diversity index, and Simpson’s index were determined. Multiple indices were used to ensure that a potential bias did not arise from unequal numbers of reads between samples. β-Diversity was assessed using an NMDS plot of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. The R package DESeq2 v1.18.1 and microbiomeSeq v0.1 were used to calculate significantly differentially abundant taxa in the vancomycin-treated group over time. Prior to further analysis and visualization of taxa-specific differences between samples or treatment groups, reads in each sample were normalized to relative abundance. For input into PICRUSt v1.1.3, reads were reprocessed into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (36). Read quality was assessed using FastQC v0.11.5, and paired-end reads were merged and filtered using PEAR v0.9.10. Chimeric sequences were removed using VSEARCH v1.11. Sequences were clustered into OTUs using a closed reference OTU picking pipeline using QIIME v1.91 (37) and mapped to the Greengenes Database v13_8. Within PICRUSt, the OTU table was 16S rRNA copy number normalized, and then functional predictions of KEGG orthologs were predicted using PICRUSt’s Hidden State Prediction algorithm. Ex vivo imaging of GUS activity We performed ex vivo tissue imaging of intestinal bacterial GUS activity through quantification of fluorescence following hydrolysis of FDGlcU (Sigma-Aldrich) to fluorescein. Three hours prior to imaging, each animal was gavaged with FDGlcU (7.3 μmol/kg). Immediately before imaging, mice were euthanized, and abdominal organs were excised and imaged using an In Vivo Xtreme 4MP imaging platform (Bruker). Reflectance imaging (2-s exposure time) was followed by fluorescence imaging (5-s exposure time, 470-nm excitation and 535-nm emission filters) and x-ray imaging (10-s exposure time). Pixel binning was kept constant at 4 × 4. Images were acquired and analyzed using the Bruker molecular imaging software MI SE v7.1.3.20550. GUS activity was quantified by measuring the mean fluorescence after background subtraction in a given region of interest, which was kept constant over the time period of imaging. Metabolite extraction and MS Fecal metabolites were extracted from fecal pellets (50 mg) using 500 μl of 4°C 50% methanol followed by homogenization with ceramic beads using a Bead Ruptor 4 (Omni). Insoluble debris was separated by centrifugation at 10,000g × 15 min at 4°C, and 300 μl was collected. The remaining material was reextracted in an additional 300 μl of 4°C 50% methanol following the same procedure, and supernatants from the two-stage extraction were combined. Metabolites present in whole blood were extracted by diluting samples 1:20 (v/v) in 4°C 50% methanol. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,600g × 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was harvested. All metabolite extracts were stored at −80°C until quantitative analyses could be completed. All MS analyses were conducted at the Calgary Metabolomics Research Facility (CMRF). Metabolites in the extracts were quantified using UHPLC MS. Fecal metabolites were separated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (Syncronis HILIC column, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and serum metabolites were separated using reversed-phase chromatography (Accucore Vanquish C18+, Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS analyses were conducted using a Q-Exactive HF Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in negative ion full-scan mode. Metabolites were assigned by high-resolution MS and coelution of the metabolite with a commercial metabolite standard (MPA and GA from Thermo Fisher Scientific, and MPAG and AcMPAG from Toronto Research Chemicals). Metabolite concentrations were measured by fitting peak intensities of extracted ion chromatograms to calibration reference curves prepared using standards. Data were analyzed using the MAVEN software package (38). Enzymatic assay for GUS activity Fecal pellets were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 M, pH 7.0) using a Bead Ruptor 4 (Omni) and then sonicated using a Branson 3510 Water Bath Ultrasonicator. Activity of extracted bacterial GUS was measured by hydrolysis of phenolphthalein glucuronide (Sigma-Aldrich) to free phenolphthalein and quantified by spectrophotometry (39). GUS activity was calculated as mg of free phenolphthalein liberated/mg protein/hour of incubation. Intrarectal administration of MPA and GA Injections were performed daily for 8 days using a 1-ml syringe and a polyethylene catheter (PE-50). With the mouse immobilized, the catheter was inserted 3 to 4 cm intrarectally, and 200 μl of either vehicle (50% dimethyl sulfoxide), GA (17.5 mM), or MPA (1.75 or 17.5 mM) was slowly injected by hand. After removal of the catheter, the rectum was held closed for a minimum of 2 min. Body weight of each animal was recorded daily. After 8 days, animals were sacrificed. Colonic tissue was homogenized in hexadecyltrimethylammonium buffer using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica). O-dianisidine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cell lysate, and its oxidation was measured by absorbance at 450 nm using a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader. MPO activity (U/mg tissue) was calculated from absorbance based on a standard curve. Statistical analysis All statistical analysis was conducted using R and Prism 7 (GraphPad). Data are expressed as means ± SD. For each set of data, normality was determined using the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test. For data with two treatment groups, each experimental group mean was compared pairwise against the control group mean using either Welch’s t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test with a correction for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Means of parametric data with >2 treatment variables compared at a single time point were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. Significant ANOVA results were followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference post hoc test. Means of nonparametric data with >2 treatment variables compared at a single time were analyzed using pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum tests with P value correction for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. To compare means of two treatment groups over time, a two-way ANOVA was used, followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference post hoc test. If the two-way ANOVA residuals were nonparametric, the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, followed by Dunn’s Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison post hoc test, was used. Intergroup significance in β-diversity was computed using the Adonis test applied pairwise, using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for P value correction. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant, except for the assessment of colonic tissue cytokines and chemokines, the pairwise group comparisons of observed species for α-diversity, and β-diversity comparisons between MMF- and vancomycin-treated animals, where a value P < 0.1 was considered significant.

741,FL-2019-000179-CAN,These are the health and safety risks during and after a flood - Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5207436/health-safety-risks-flood/,"Communities in many parts of Canada are bracing for or already experiencing floods.

And while people surround their homes with sandbags, there are some important health hazards to keep an eye out for, in order to stay safe.

Here are some of the biggest health risks during — and after — a flood.

During the flood

As the water rises, some of the biggest risks are related to injury, according to Dr. Vera Etches, Ottawa’s medical officer of health.

“One of the major risks of flooding is actually drowning and injury due to electrocution when water and electricity come into contact,” she said. “So if you have a generator or hydro on when your property is flooded, that’s dangerous.”

Story continues below advertisement

Never assume any area of your property affected by flooding is safe, the Electrical Safety Authority said in a press release. If you have to leave your home during a flood, they recommend switching the main breaker to the “OFF” position. If you suspect water has risen above electrical outlets, baseboard heaters, your furnace or near your electrical panel, they say to stay out of your property as electricity can move through water or wet flooring and give you a serious shock.

High waters can also conceal hazards beneath the surface, like open manhole covers or other things, and people are also at risk of drowning during a flood.

“Absolutely avoid areas that are flooded,” Etches said.

“That may mean leaving your home sometimes. That’s very difficult to do, but it’s not safe [to remain] and your safety has to be the top priority.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""That may mean leaving your home sometimes. That's very difficult to do, but it's not safe [to remain] and your safety has to be the top priority.""

The other major hazard is the water itself. Flood water is not very clean, which brings a risk of infection, she said.

“Flood waters themselves can carry bacteria or viruses, and when some of these rural areas have wells and septic systems, when the ground gets flooded, the drinking water can be contaminated with bacteria and viruses. So we certainly want to make sure that people aren’t drinking that water or that they boil it before they drink it.”

The most common flood-related illnesses are gastrointestinal infections, according to the Government of Manitoba. This is usually caused by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food, and results in symptoms like stomach aches, vomiting and diarrhea.

Sherry Beadle, manager of health protection with Ottawa Public Health, said that if your drinking water comes from a well and the water has risen over the top of the well, it’s potentially contaminated.

“Our recommendation then is to use an alternate drinking water source until such time that the flood waters recede and their well can be disinfected and testing can be done to ensure that there’s no bacteria,” Beadle said.

Cuts or sores on your skin can also be infected by dirty flood water, so you should wash with soap and water and apply an antibiotic ointment if your cuts touch flood water, the Manitoba government says.

If you’re sandbagging or helping with flood relief, you should wear protective clothing like gloves, boots and overalls, and wash your hands with soap and water after coming into contact with flood water or handling objects contaminated with the water. If you accidentally get flood water in your eyes or mouth, you should rinse with clean water.

You should also be prepared to evacuate, Beadle said, and keep a 72-hour supply of clean food and water just in case.

After the flood

Once the waters recede, they leave behind a lot of wet stuff. Some of it can be dried out and salvaged, and some can’t.

The City of Calgary recommends that you think about tossing out soft things like bedding, clothing, upholstered furniture and carpets, on its flood information website.

You should always throw away food, cosmetics, medication, rugs, mattresses and pillows, it says.

The Electrical Safety Authority recommends you get a licensed contractor to inspect your home’s electrical system if your house got flooded, and not plug in any appliances that have been touched by water until they have been checked by an expert.

It’s important to then clean and disinfect your home room by room, then dry everything out as quickly as possible by opening doors and windows and using fans and dehumidifiers. Beadle warns, though, that running equipment like gas-operated generators and water pumps indoors can cause a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

You want to get the drying done quickly, to prevent the growth of mould. Mould can appear as a discolouration on walls and ceilings, but can also grow on almost any organic material, like wood, paper and fabric, according to the Government of Manitoba. It also has a musty or earthy smell.

Mould can appear on damp materials in just 48 hours, the province says.

It can cause stuffy noses, irritated eyes, wheezing or skin irritation. More seriously, it can exacerbate asthma symptoms or cause difficulty breathing, or even lung infections. People with allergies, asthma and other breathing conditions or immune system deficiencies, as well as pregnant women, children, and the elderly, are most likely to be affected, the government said.

Finally, after a flood, mental health can be a concern. “When people work really hard to protect their homes, the long hours and the stress of it can give rise to the need for mental health supports,” Etches said. People might also be displaced from their homes or face other issues, and it can take weeks to recover, she said.

She wants people to know that it’s OK to reach out for support if you feel too stressed, she said. The City of Ottawa has a website listing various mental health resources for the Ottawa area and beyond. Ottawa Public Health also has a website addressing common flood-related concerns.

CAIRO – 28 May 2018: During the Middle Kingdom era, King Senusret III established castles and fortresses to protect Egypt from the south, such as the Buhen fortress that sunk in the Nile as a result of a flood.Buhen was a massive fortress located on the west bank of the Nile in Lower Nubia (northern Sudan). The walls of the fortress were made of brick and stone walls, approximately 5 meters (16 ft) thick and about 10 meters (33 ft) high, covering an area of about 13,000 square meters (140,000 sq ft) and extending more than 150 meters (490 ft). It was constructed during the reigns of King Senusret III in the Middle Kingdom era (12th dynasty) to protect Egypt and the commercial ships from rebel Nubians in the south, according to “Ancient Egypt” by David P. Silverman.The massive fortress was built in 1860 BC. It had about 1,000 soldiers, 300 archers and their families. Queen Hatshepsut ordered a Horus temple to be built inside the Buhen fortress for worship and prayer, and also for traders to take a break while transporting their goods. Interestingly, during that time, Egypt imported and exported many products, such as oils, ivory, pottery, and tiger and elephant skins.The Middle Kingdom era saw many other fortresses besides Buhen, such as Mirgissa, Shalfak, Uronarti, Askut, Dabenarti, and ending with the paired fortresses of Semna and Kumma, located on opposite sides of the Nile River. Each fortress was in visual contact with the immediately adjacent forts.Ahmed Saleh, director of antiquities in Aswan, told Egypt Today that the Buhen fortress no longer exists because it was submerged under the waters of Lake Nasser in 1964 due to the flood; the Buhen fortress is now located 300 meters from the High Dam. He added that the Ministry of Antiquities did not search for it because it was certainly destroyed, like several other Egyptian antiquities. Among the most important ancient monuments lost under Lake Nasser are Nubian fortresses.“But if the Ministry planned to look for antiquities under the waters of Lake Nasser, they could find nothing other than bones, noting that the level of water was higher than the level of the ground. Therefore, the Egyptian government built the High Dam, but it unfortunately swept away several pharaonic artifacts; still, the Ministry of Antiquities saved many artifacts, in cooperation with more than 22 foreign research teams, such as the UNESCO Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, which began in the 1960s.The site was entirely submerged beneath the reservoir waters and rendered inaccessible. However, the campaign saved many temples, including the Hatshepsut and Philae temples, which were rescued and moved to places nearby,” Saleh added.The Middle Kingdom era is called the era of economic prosperity because of many economic projects, such as irrigation, trade, industry and agriculture. Among the most famous kings of the Middle Kingdom were King Mentuhotep II, who restored the unity of the country and spread security after the chaos that plagued Egypt in the era of the Old Kingdom, and King Senusret III, who was one of the greatest kings of Egypt. Senusret III took care of the army to protect Egypt and led many campaigns to secure its borders. He also ordered the digging of the Sesostris Canal to link the Red Sea and the Nile, as well as building a dam to protect the land in Fayoum from the flood.The Sesostris Canal was the source of the idea to build the Suez Canal to connect the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, which became the most important navigational channel in the world and an important source of income for Egypt.King Amenemhat III ruled from c. 1860 BCE to c. 1814 BCE. He was interested in agriculture and irrigation, and he ordered the building of the first pyramid at Dahshur, the so-called ""Black Pyramid"", near Fayoum. Around the 15th year of his reign, the king decided to build a new pyramid at Hawara, as well as a huge temple called “Labyrinth,” named so due to the large number of rooms, roads and corners inside it, making it difficult for any visitor to exit.Unfortunately, as a result of the kings’ weaknesses and greed, chaos spread in the country, which allowed the Hyksos, who came from Asia, to occupy Northern Egypt. The Hyksos abused the Egyptians very much and destroyed many temples and several ancient antiquities. The Egyptians were determined to fight and expel the Hyksos from their country. The struggle started from Upper Egypt, led by Seqenenre Tao, who was martyred in the war with the Hyksos, but his wife Ahhotep encouraged the Egyptians to continue the struggle. She urged her eldest son, Kamose, to continue the struggle, but he was also martyred in one of the battles. Then, the army was taken over by the younger son of Seqenenre Tao, Ahmose I, who continued to fight the Hyksos until they were expelled from Egypt. He then ruled the country.One of the greatest civilizations throughout history is the ancient Egyptian civilization, which has stunned the entire world for ages. During the Middle Kingdom era, when Egypt was at the highest degree of culture and development, and kings were interested in projects of benefit to the people, handicrafts were developed and literature and art flourished.",2018-05-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['senusret', 'egypt', 'era', 'nile', 'middle', 'king', 'fortress', 'sunken', 'buhen', 'iii', 'antiquities', 'kingdom']",Egypt,news article,English
1054,FL-2017-000067-BRA,"Emerging markets: risk, reward and Covid - Financial Times",https://www.ft.com/content/49404486-36e1-4ca8-a9f1-2a6eeb7add2d,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

Is now a good time for retail investors to buy emerging market stocks and bonds?

At the height of a pandemic, as growth stutters across the developing world and governments struggle to replicate the success of vaccine rollouts in advanced economies, it may seem odd even to pose such a question. Yet, it seems to be one that many investors are not only asking, but answering with a “yes”.

The number and value of emerging market-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) and similar products — tradeable funds that typically appeal to retail investors — have risen remarkably during the coronavirus crisis.

There were 1,670 such products worldwide at the end of March, according to industry watcher ETFGI, up from 1,447 at the start of last year, while their market capitalisation rose by more than a quarter to $742bn (£528bn) over the same period.

What’s more, retail investors seem attuned to strengths and weaknesses among the emerging markets (EMs), with their eyes drawn less by problem-hit Brazil than by the huge energies of China.

Interactive Investor, the UK’s second-biggest fund supermarket, says China-focused investment trusts and mutual funds feature strikingly among its biggest sellers so far this year — two out of four EM products in the top 40 investment trusts and one in three in the top 40 mutual funds — when there were none in the same period of 2020.

Deborah Fuhr, US-based founder of ETFGI, says many retail investors, with time on their hands during the pandemic, have taken an interest in global investment themes, such as Chinese technology stocks, especially when they are discussed on television. “A lot of men — I don’t think they had a lot of hobbies they did at home,” she says. “Being locked in the house, many of them decided to put some money aside to play with.”

Retail investors are riding on the back of a broader institutional surge into EMs. Data from industry watcher Morningstar shows that investors pumped more than $100bn into EM stocks and bonds in the nine months to the end of March, more than making up for the roughly $44bn they withdrew in the first half of last year as the pandemic took hold.

“What we can say with a high degree of confidence is that investors at large have begun to dedicate more to emerging markets,” says Ben Johnson, Morningstar’s director of global ETF research. Flows into the asset class broadly over the past 12 months amount to “probably the most significant sign of interest we have seen in about a decade”.

But this all comes against a tricky background for emerging economies. On the one hand, their share of global output has surged this century, doubling in dollar terms. On the other, it is still just 40 per cent of the total, even though they are home to more than 80 per cent of the world’s population. And the pandemic is having an uneven impact, wreaking havoc in Brazil, for example, but largely sparing China.

Also, gross domestic product growth does not translate easily into stock market returns. With markets often skewed by government intervention and opaque rules, well-connected local business people tend to do better than regular financial investors. Emerging markets provide about three-quarters of global economic growth, but their equities have lagged behind the S&P 500 index of US stocks for much of the past decade.

Developed world retail investors have barely dipped their toes into emerging markets. Investment trusts, mutual funds and ETFs — the kind of vehicles favoured by small investors — make up a tiny share of the total investment in EM stocks and bonds, and that share has barely budged for a decade. So there is plenty of scope for increasing EM exposure without upsetting the balance of the average portfolio.

With many analysts thinking that the outperformance of US stocks in recent years is looking decidedly frothy, could views now change? Might this be the moment to look again at emerging markets in general?

FT Money takes a look at the pros and cons.

A new story with old roots

There is a long history of investors hunting for profit in undeveloped economies — whether in Latin American railways, South African gold or Indonesian rubber.

The modern story of EMs starts in the 1980s, when fund managers in the UK and other rich countries sought to take advantage of the high returns on offer from fast-growing countries in Latin America, south-east Asia and other parts of the developing world.

The countries classified as emerging markets have changed almost beyond recognition since then. Today’s MSCI EM index of equities in 27 countries — the most widely-followed benchmark — includes some, such as South Korea, Taiwan and the Czech Republic, that have made such progress that few outside the index-driven investment community would regard them as any less developed than industrialised economies.

But while the landscape has changed, the proposition remains the same: emerging markets, as they catch up with countries in the developed world, will grow more quickly, offering greater rates of return on investments. The downside is that such growth, and the returns, can be highly erratic.

The profits were often stellar during the commodities supercycle of the 1990s and 2000s, when Chines demand fuelled growth in raw materials exporters such as Brazil. Since then, some formerly fast-growing economies — not least Brazil — have suffered stagnation and recession, prompting some to ask whether EM investing still makes sense at all.

Still, some states, especially the south-east Asian countries, have learnt to avoid past mistakes. They have generally tamed inflation, managed domestic and external deficits well, and coped better with volatility by reducing reliance on foreign debt and building cash buffers of foreign reserves.

The rise of China

The biggest single transformation has been the seemingly relentless rise of China. Its demand for commodities — of all varieties, agricultural as well as mineral — was such that many emerging economies rode through the global financial crisis of 2008-09 relatively unscathed. Since then, its growth has remained the single most powerful driver in the developing world.

Nevertheless, emerging economies are not immune to shocks. The “taper tantrum” of 2013 reminded investors that EMs are at the mercy of bigger forces. The US Federal Reserve caused waves when it suggested it might soon begin tapering a massive economy-boosting bond-buying programme — indicating that the rock-bottom yields might soon begin to rise. Foreign investors withdrew from EMs en masse, irrespective of how successfully or otherwise policymakers had reformed their economies.

Since then, the highs and lows of EM assets have often been driven by the US dollar. When the dollar is weak and US growth is slow, investors are willing to take more risk. At such times, EMs offer attractive returns.

But when the US dollar strengthens — as it did unexpectedly in 2018, catching many EM investors off-guard — money can flood out. At times like these, even Chinese assets can take a beating.

These forces are at work today. With the US economy rebounding from the pandemic more quickly than many expected, the biggest issue on the minds of professional investors is whether — or rather, when — US inflation and interest rates will rise, spurred by the Biden administration’s huge fiscal stimulus. If US yields suddenly become tempting again, emerging markets could once more see money sucked away to America.

“The US fiscal spend completely dominates the debate,” said Bhanu Baweja, chief strategist at UBS investment bank and an emerging markets specialist.

But while familiar dangers still lurk so too do the incentives for EM investing. As Jan Dehn, a longtime flag-bearer for EM investing at specialist fund manager Ashmore, pointed out in 2019, emerging economies at that point accounted for 74 per cent of global economic growth and were forecast to contribute 84 per cent by 2023. The pandemic may have slowed the pace of that advance, yet few doubt that, in the long term, EMs are where the growth is.

Yet, gaining a share of the upside from that growth is challenging as the risks are unevenly spread. Contagion between markets is much less than it was. When a crisis blows up in a more volatile market such as Argentina or Turkey, it no longer sweeps across the rest of the asset class. Each emerging market has its own set of challenges and opportunities, and the correlations between them are now lower.

What became of the Brics?

Of the Brics held up as future stars by economist Jim O’Neill of Goldman Sachs in 2001 — Brazil, Russia, India, China and, a later addition, South Africa — three have lost their shine.

India and China, however, have continued to deliver. Beijing’s huge stimulus during the global financial crisis saved not only its own economy but also those of many other developing countries and, perhaps, even the industrialised world.

Beijing’s focus has changed in recent years, from investment to consumption as the driver of its economy, with a concern for financial stability tempering its enthusiasm for credit-fuelled growth. Investors in EM assets should keep a close watch on policy.

India has also seen strong growth over the past decade. This year, it was able to announce a big increase in public spending to counter the pandemic without scaring investors — a testament to their faith in its growth story, although the ferocious second wave of Covid-19 sweeping the country over the past month has raised questions.

By contrast, Brazil, Russia and South Africa have all seen growth stutter, stagnate or even go into reverse during the past decade.

Nicolaj Sebrell, senior equity analyst at Rowan Dartington, part of the St James’s Place wealth management business, says the gains from a country-by-country strategy are potentially great.

He argues that investors can outperform by avoiding basket cases like Venezuela and Argentina and sticking to states with credible policies, reasonable growth prospects and inexpensively priced markets. He says: “EM is an asset class because we’ve defined it that way. But it’s also just a selection of countries. If you can treat them all as individual markets, that has some real advantages.”

Sony Kapoor, managing director of the Nordic Institute for Finance, Technology and Sustainability, says this is an approach not open to many. Only those unconstrained by liquidity and time — sovereign wealth funds and the very rich — he says, can benefit from country-specific knowledge and sit through the risk-on, risk-off cycles of US monetary policy. “For the rest of us, sadly, index-hugging is the default option.”

Nevertheless, the outlook remains uncertain, with the pandemic increasing the differences between states. It is hard to see how those economies that were foundering before the coronavirus crisis will be any better placed afterwards. But those countries that have managed the pandemic well — notably in east Asia — could be rewarded with new investment.

Funds offer a good way in to emerging markets Most investors taking their first steps into emerging markets will do so through actively managed funds, such as investment trusts and mutual funds, which typically aim to beat the market for a fee. Or they will use passively managed exchange traded funds (ETFs), which aim to replicate a benchmark index, charge no or very low fees, and can be bought and sold like shares. Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at Interactive Investor, says that while emerging markets will benefit from the post-pandemic recovery, and the long-term investment case remains intact, “for most emerging markets, vaccination against Covid-19 remains a story for this year and, probably, next year as well”. It is hard to gauge how significant retail investment is in emerging markets. Data from Morningstar suggests that while total investments in EM stock and bonds are worth two and a half times today what they were a decade ago, the amount represented by investment funds — popular in the retail market — is still small. Mutual funds, open-ended trusts and ETFs made up less than 2.5 per cent of global emerging markets equity at the end of March, the data show, unchanged from 10 years ago. In fixed income funds, the share was slightly less than 1 per cent, also unchanged over the decade. Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, says it is hard to say how much of this comes from retail investors and how much from institutions. He says retail investors are likely to be influenced by home bias more than institutional investors. “Retail investors globally are under allocated not just to emerging markets but to any markets outside their home country . . . It’s a characteristic of human behaviour, and I wouldn’t expect to see a dramatic change in any of our lifetimes.” But a preference for home does not necessarily rule out EM exposure. Unilever in the UK and Yum Brands in the US are old favourites among investors looking for a local play on EMs without the complication of investing overseas. Globalisation has multiplied such opportunities. More than 200 Chinese companies are listed on US exchanges, for example, including internet giants such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. Deborah Fuhr of ETF data service ETFGI says one trend driving more retail investment in emerging markets is the rise of so-called robo-advisers. At Wealthfront, for example, a portfolio with a high risk weighting of 8 out of 10 would include a 16 per cent allocation to emerging markets — more aggressive than the median allocation of 6 to 7 per cent among global equity funds. At II, Lipski suggests four funds for retail investors to consider, starting with JPMorgan Emerging Markets Trust, which is conservatively run, with a bias towards domestic consumption. Then there is Stewart Investors Global Emerging Markets Sustainability Fund, which took account of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues long before ESG became a buzzword. Lipski also likes M&G Emerging Markets Bond Fund, for a mix of government and corporate bonds in local and hard currency, and Utilico Emerging Markets Trust, a play on infrastructure opportunities. Michael Arno, a portfolio manager at investment company Brandywine, says that despite the changing nature of emerging markets, the old rules apply. “It’s all about portfolio diversification and making sure you are not taking an exuberant amount of risk, or no more than you can handle,” he says. “But emerging markets are the growing part of the global economy and there are definitely periods when one should be invested.”",2021-05-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['investment', 'growth', 'funds', 'covid', 'risk', 'investors', 'retail', 'reward', 'emerging', 'global', 'pandemic', 'em', 'markets']",Brazil,news article,English

REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany/File Photo

A giant ship has blocked the famous Suez Canal but opened up a torrent of memes and gifs lampooning the hapless container carrier, which has been jammed in the waterway since Tuesday.

Elements of global commerce have been brought to a standstill, but no one was hurt, and the environment is so far undamaged. The lack of stakes surrounding the Ever Given's grounding has made it a prime target for jokes.

Nine tugs attempted to move it while getting some help from the shore with two workers and a digger clawing into the sandy embankment where the Ever Given's bow is dug in.

Images of them - dwarfed by the hull of the monster they were trying to dig out - circulated with comments on Twitter such as ""these two guys and their digger are currently trying to save global trade.""

loading

The Twitter account @SuezDiggerGuy, ""Guy With the Digger at Suez Canal,"" had nearly 15,000 followers by around 0600 GMT Friday and a profile line that read: ""Trying my best. No promises.""

Its timeline was replete with observations such as ""Thinking of naming my digger, Ever Digging"" and bemoaning having his leave rescinded by managers.

Netizens also conjured up Lego images of the digger and the bow of the container ship, which is carrying consumer goods from Chinese factories to European households.

Once it became clear the ship could be stuck for weeks, a website quickly spun up, https://istheshipstillstuck.com.

And the memes filled the internet like cargo ships piling up in the Red Sea. Many of the most popular touched on the angst of the last pandemic-filled year; one labelled the hulking ship “my COVID depression & anxiety” and the tiny digger on shore as “going on a daily walk.”

992,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Local cash floods Vietnam stock market The Star 5/5/2021 - The Star Online,https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2021/05/05/local-cash-floods-vietnam-stock-market,"HO CHI MINH CITY: Individual investors are piling into Vietnam stocks at an unprecedented pace, fuelling Asias biggest rally and stoking speculation that foreign funds will return after fleeing the market over the past year.

The countrys benchmark VN Index soared 17% in the three months ended April 30, beating every major market in the region and almost doubling gains from the S&P 500 Index.

While foreign investors pulled about US$842mil (RM3.46bil) from the countrys shares so far this year, the tide could be turning.

Vietnam equity funds received record inflows in the third week of April even as emerging-market equity funds saw the biggest outflows since January, according to EPFR Global. A key contributor was a new Taiwan-based Vietnam exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has raised more than US$350mil.

A sustained return by overseas investors could drive further gains in a market that  like in many others around the world  has attracted retail punters in droves.

Plunging interest rates spurred ordinary Vietnamese to open nearly 400,000 new trading accounts in 2020, a record high. In the first three months of this year alone, they opened almost 258,000 more, helping send daily turnover on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock exchange to an all-time high.

The stock market was very active and many of my friends were making money from it, so I decided to withdraw money from the bank to invest in stocks for a better return,  said Nguyen Lan Huong, a 30-year-old grocery store worker from the riverside district of Long Bien in Hanoi.

The final catalyst for Vietnam could be if international investors reverse their net sales of the nations stocks. Vietnams retail investors normally model much of their investment behavior around foreign investors when they look for which sectors to favour, according to SSI Securities JSC, the countrys second-largest brokerage.

Vietnam is an investable market,  according to HSBC Holdings Plc. The flood of local cash has seen trading volumes more than quadruple since the end of 2019, based on 50-day moving averages.

723,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Here’s how much a flooded basement will cost Canadian homeowners - Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5206297/flooded-basement-cost-canada/,"Send this page to someone via email

Canadian homeowners can expect to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a flooded basement this spring, especially if their home insurance plan doesn’t include adequate flood coverage.

A flooded basement costs an average of $43,000 to repair, according to the latest numbers from the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC). Flood insurance can help cover that cost, but older plans won’t help at all if the water comes from heavy rainfall, according to Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

“People should call today to find out what insurance coverage they have for their basement,” Feltmate told Global News. Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""People should call today to find out what insurance coverage they have for their basement,"" Feltmate told Global News.

Most traditional flood insurance plans only cover flooding from a backed-up sewer, and do not apply when the water comes in through a basement wall or window — commonly known as overland flooding. That’s why homeowners should specifically check to make sure they have overland flood insurance, which insurers only started offering within the last four years. Most plans cost a few hundred dollars annually.

“Historically, overland flooding was not overly problematic in the country,” Feltmate said. “But with the bigger storms we’re experiencing today due primarily to climate change … we’re getting more overland flooding.”

A drowned basement can be a nightmare, but even a bit of leakage can cause long-term damage in the form of mould and cracks to your foundation.

Severe weather caused $1.9 billion in insured damage last year, according to IBC statistics. It was the fourth-most expensive year on record, even without a single catastrophic disaster like the 2013 Calgary flood or the 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray.

Summer storms caused more than $240 million in insured damage across the Prairies last year, IBC says. Toronto suffered $80 million in insured damage after a flood last August, and a storm caused more than $85 million in damage across Quebec and Ontario last April.

Major disasters cost Canadian governments $3 for every $1 in damage covered by insurance, IBC estimates.

Even if you are covered for overland flooding, Feltmate says it’s critical to know what your cap is for damage. For example, a person with $10,000 worth of coverage would still be on the hook for more than $30,000 in the event of a full basement flood, he says.

Longtime homeowners should check in to make sure they have the new overland flood insurance, even if they’ve never had an issue, Feltmate said. He recommends inviting an insurance adjuster over to help you figure out how much coverage you need for your basement.

Feltmate also recommends being proactive with your insurance coverage, because climate change is making flooding more common across the country.

154,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Time to End Impunity for Suharto’s Crimes in Indonesia and Timor-Leste - Common Dreams,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/06/27/time-end-impunity-suhartos-crimes-indonesia-and-timor-leste,"Indonesia recently held a symposium on the violent events of 50 years ago which brought the Indonesian General Suharto to power. The results were inconclusive as the dictator’s defenders denied the massacres and attacked those who want Indonesia to finally deal with its blood past.



The tragedy of 1965-1966 is part of a long history of massacres by the Indonesian military. As East Timorese, we know very well the brutality of the Indonesian dictator’s regime. I was born after the initial Indonesian invasion in 1975, but grew up under the occupation. As a young student, I saw the Indonesian military intimidate and abuse youth suspected of supporting East Timorese independence. We were not safe anywhere: Suharto’s troops would seize us at home, school or on the streets; many were never seen again. I watched helplessly as soldiers murdered my cousin, Luis Gusmaõ Pereira, in a public market in Triloedae-Laga.



During 1965-1966, the Indonesian military and its militias carried out mass executions of those suspected of involvement or support for the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Amnesty International estimates that between 500,000 to one million people lost their lives. Others were tortured and imprisoned, some for decades. Members of their families were denied employment and schooling. Many had no option but to live among their persecutors, as shown in the Oscar-nominated documentaries The Act of Killing and The Look of Silence.



Cold War fears often justified U.S.-backed military interventions against democratically-elected governments. Sukarno, the founding president of Indonesia and Suharto’s predecessor, carried out a populist political program linked to social and economic justice, supported by the PKI and many other groups. Sukarno also helped found the Non-Aligned Movement that stood apart from the Cold War blocs. The U.S., believing Indonesia was acting too independently, supported Suharto’s seizure of power and cheered the mass killings.



A decade later, Suharto sought and received U.S. backing for its plan to launch the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of Timor-Leste. Up to 200,000 East Timorese were killed, as the U.S. showered military and other support on Indonesia. Timor-Leste’s Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation final report, Chega!, documented numerous crimes against humanity during Indonesia’s 24-year occupation, including massacres, rape, torture, and forced disappearances. Many died of starvation when the Indonesians forced communities from their farms and gardens and then blockaded food supplies. Declassified documents show that the US government understood that both the invasion and occupation were illegal, yet it still provided military assistance, knowing that it would be used against the people of Timor-Leste.



Survivors, the families of victims, and human rights activists have worked to win justice and accountability for the crimes against humanity during the 1965-1966 period. While we’ve seen some light in democratic progress under Indonesia’s current President Joko Widodo, justice and accountability continue to elude us. President Widodo has made some efforts at accountability for the human rights violations during the Suharto years, these efforts have been challenged by members of his own government.



Since we voted for our independence in 1999, there have been several efforts at accountability for the crimes committed in Timor-Leste. However, only East Timorese members of militia that were created and controlled by Indonesia have been convicted and received minimal punishments. Meanwhile, the principal architects of the crimes remain free in Indonesia, some of them still in positions of power. Several have run for President of Indonesia. While the political establishments in both countries are currently determined to ignore them, the people of Timor-Leste and human rights activists continue to push for and demand accountability and justice.



The chains of impunity remain strong in Indonesia; U.S. leaders who supported crimes against humanity in Indonesia and elsewhere continue to avoid accountability and punishment. The U.S. and Indonesia claim they are democratic and law-abiding nations, but they openly resist holding their own officials accountable.



This is not just a matter of dealing with the past. Indonesia’s security forces continue to commit serious crimes in West Papua and elsewhere in Indonesia. In recent months, thousands of West Papuans have been detained while demonstrating for their right to self-determination. Indonesian activists faced intimidation from the state and the military when they dare to speak about massacres or serious crimes of the past. Last October, security officials forced the cancellation of sessions addressing the 1965 massacres at an international writers’ festival in Bali. Recent showings of films about the massacres, including The Look of Silence, have been attacked.



Together, we can end impunity. First, the U.S. and Indonesia must release all their records concerning the crimes committed in 1965-66 and 1975-1999. Revealing the truth is necessary for a genuine justice and accountability for these serious crimes.



Chega! recommends that countries like the U.S. that armed and trained Indonesia’s military provide reparations to the people of Timor-Leste. The U.S. knew very well that its weapons– from military aircraft to M-16 rifles – would rain death and destruction on many thousands of innocent people.



Since Indonesia has proved unable to credibly prosecute its own, international tribunals are needed if those responsible for the crimes of 1965-66 and the crimes in Timor-Leste from 1975-1999 are to be brought to justice.

Rescue teams on Sunday recovered five bodies from the Tapovan tunnel with the help of machines and drones. It is the first time that bodies have been recovered from the tunnel, where 30-35 persons are feared to be trapped. They have also recovered five bodies from Raini village Uttarakhand police have so far ascertained the identity of 25 recovered bodies. Police said 23 severed limbs have also been recovered from different parts of Chamoli district Garhwal Commissioner Ravinath Raman said a body part has been recovered from Raini village.Sources said DNA samples have been collected from the recovered bodies for identification and they have been kept at CHC, Joshimath, District Hospital, Gopeshwar, and CHC, Karnaprayag. The articles recovered from the bodies like ornaments and other identity marks have been photographed and videographed.An aerial survey of the Rishi Ganga River was conducted by five DRDO , four Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) scientists and two combat robotics. On Saturday, the union home ministry granted clearance to NDRF to use special drones to reach inaccessibly areas where people are likely to be stranded.An alarm and hooter system has been installed and made operational for early warning system in the area to avoid further tragedy, an MHA official added. ITBP on Sunday said the rescue teams have been facing difficulties to reach the people trapped at the Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project site.Search and rescue operations at Tapovan have been intensified following the recovery of bodies from the tunnel. Officials said they expect the toll to go up once drilling work is completed. As many as 184 bodies of cattle were also recovered during the operation, they added.A team of SDRF headed by its commandant Navneet Bhullar reached near the site of lake formation in the higher reaches of the mountain.Meanwhile, in their preliminary report, scientists have stated that the glacial lake formed due to the avalanche had begun releasing water, reducing chances of a breach or a fresh flash flood, officials told ET.Till Saturday, electricity was restored in 11 villages and water supply has been restored in 10 of the 13 villages that were cut off due to the glacier burst.Restoration work of five damaged bridges has been initiated by PWD and BRO, the home ministry’s control room was informed by the state authorities.

41,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Excess sodium intake linked to 1.65 million deaths annually - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-excess-sodium-intake-20140813-story.html,"Across the world, the excessive consumption of sodium--hiding in breads, soups and snack foods and beckoning from salt shakers everywhere--is the cause of some 1.65 million deaths by heart disease and strokes yearly, including roughly 667,000 “premature” deaths--those before the age of 70--says a comprehensive new study.

Globally, new research concludes that one in 10 cardiovascular deaths can be attributed to excessive sodium consumption, and one in five of those among people younger than 70.

The study, conducted by an international team led by Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian of Harvard University’s School of Public Health, was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

An invited editorial touted the study as a “herculean effort” to glean the effects of excess salt consumption in a broad population. But citing the findings of two studies published alongside the global assessment, University of Alabama vascular expert Dr. Suzanne Oparil declared it too early for public health officials to take up the cudgels against dietary sodium.

Daily sodium intake averaged 3.95 grams per day across the globe, and ranged upward to 5.15 grams, Mozaffarian’s team found. That level of consumption is well above the range that experts for the Institute of Medicine have concluded is ideal--as little as 1.5 grams per day for those with high blood pressure (as well as diabetics, African Americans and those 50 and older) and as much as 2.3 grams for all others.

Diets high in sodium claimed their highest tolls in a band stretching from the countries of Georgia and the Ukraine and across Central Asia to Russia, Mongolia and China, with slightly lower death rates throughout Asia, the study found. It was lowest in Central America and the Horn of Africa.

The United States, Canada and Europe, where public health campaigns aimed at reducing sodium in foods are already underway, lay roughly at the global midpoint, with just more than 300 deaths per million attributed to high sodium intake.

The study’s seemingly dramatic findings, however, belie continuing controversy over the value of efforts to reduce sodium intake across whole populations.

Among the points of contention is whether diets high in salt cause healthy people to develop high blood pressure or merely exacerbate the condition in those who have it. In contemplating measures to reduce the sodium content in everyday foods, public health officials are also wary of causing harm to patients, including those with heart failure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease, for whom a diet very low in sodium can cause complications and lead to death.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that subjects who reduced their sodium intake lowered their blood pressure. But despite extensive research, debate and efforts at expert consensus, the value of broad sodium-reduction campaigns--as well as the targets such campaigns should aim to reach--remain controversial.

A pair of studies published alongside the global assessment underscore the suspicion that, in broad populations, the relationship between sodium intake, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and death may be quite complicated.

One study published Wednesday found a tenuous connection between sodium intake and hypertension. A second study found that over a roughly 3 1/2 year period, those ingesting between 3 and 6 grams of sodium daily--a span that reflects the global range of sodium intake--were less likely to die or suffer a heart attack or stroke than were those who consumed diets higher or lower in sodium.

In addition, both studies suggested that for some, dietary intake of the mineral potassium may play a role in reducing excessive sodium’s ill effects.

The two studies appearing alongside the global assessment were conducted by researchers at McMaster University’s Population Health Research Institute in Ontario, Canada. Both measured, by indirect means, the sodium-intake levels of more than 100,000 people from at least 17 countries.

In the first of those studies, the link between levels of sodium intake and hypertension was most evident in older subjects, in those who had the highest sodium intake, and in subjects who had hypertension. But in people who fell outside of these groups, researchers found little discernible pattern: a diet that was moderately high in salt--just under 3 grams a day--was not clearly linked to high blood pressure in this study. And those consuming between 3 and 5 grams of sodium daily were only slightly more likely to have hypertension.

Those findings led Dr. Oparil, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, to conclude that more study is needed before public health campaigns aimed specifically at reducing sodium intake can be safely launched.

The three articles “highlight the need to collect high-quality evidence on both the risks and the benefits of low-sodium diets,” Oparil wrote in an editorial published by NEJM Wednesday. Until clinical trials better flesh out the relationship among dietary sodium, potassium, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, she wrote, “the results argue against a reduction of dietary sodium as an isolated public health recommendation.”

That conclusion drew criticism from one public health expert who has worked with food manufacturing giants to reduce sodium content in widely-consumed processed foods.

“Given the very clear relation between sodium intake and higher blood pressure, and evidence that reducing intakes reduces risk of cardiovascular disease, I think the new findings do not change the basic conclusion that we should be moving toward lower sodium intakes,” said Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard University’s School of Public Health, who was not involved in any of the newly-published studies.

“The exact optimal intake is not clear. There is no question that some sodium is essential,” Willet added. As a result, he said, “while we move toward lower intakes, we should be conducting additional research to better define the optimal level.”",2014-08-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['deaths', 'health', 'million', 'intake', 'linked', 'study', 'grams', 'published', '165', 'studies', 'annually', 'public', 'high', 'sodium', 'pressure', 'excess']",China,news article,English

Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has urged his Uttarakhand counterpart Trivendra Singh Rawat to ensure immediate help and rescue of pilgrims from Gujarat stranded in the northern state after a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off near Joshimath in Chamoli district Sunday leading to massive floods in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers. Several people are feared dead in the glacier burst.

An official release issued by the state information department stated, “Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had telephoned Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat and requested him to ensure immediate help and rescue of pilgrims from Gujarat stranded after the natural calamity.”

Rupani has also instructed state Chief Secretary Anil Mukim to coordinate with the Uttarakhand administration and initiate immediate action.

Gujarat Relief Commissioner Harshad Patel told The Indian Express that he has spoken with the local administration in Uttarakhand and sought details of residents from Gujarat who might be trapped there. Till late evening, there was no information with the state relief department of any person required to be rescued or reported missing.

“I have sought information from local administration but been communicated that it is the locals who are mostly affected due to the damage to the dams, tourist areas are not affected. There is no information of any resident from Gujarat who is trapped there yet,” Patel said.

Ahmedabad Additional Collector Harshad Vora in a tweet Sunday sought people to provide information on stranded pilgrims or tourists from Gujarat to the control room of the district disaster management department.

A pilgrim from Rajkot, Krishnaben Pancholi, told a Gujarati news channel over phone that a group of 50 pilgrims from the state was instructed to return to Dehradun from Haridwar, while they were on the way towards Tapovan in Uttarakhand when the calamity struck.

“We are safe. We were going towards Srinagar and Tapowan when we received instruction from the authorities that we should go back towards Dehradun, where we are headed, leaving some of our baggage in Haridwar. There is a high alert in Haridwar and Rishikesh,” she said.

Patna: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today used Narendra Modi's 'Na khauanga na khane doonga' remark to hit out at him over spiraling price of pulses and also attacked him for ""not being bothered"" about drought situation in the country.

Taking pot shots at Modi for his rallies in Bihar, he said, it seems Patna has become capital of the country as well as BJP headquarters these days.

""With price of pulses touching Rs 200 a kg, a joke is doing round quoting the PM's comment 'Na khauanga na khane doonga' (neither will I eat nor allow anybody to eat),"" Kumar told an election meeting at Punpun in Patna district in support of minister Shyam Rajak.

Kumar, a star campaigner of the grand secular alliance, said while 300 districts were under the grip of drought-like situation in the country, the PM and his ministers were ""not bothered"" and roaming around in Bihar for ensuring BJP victory in the poll.

""BJP President has booked a floor of a posh hotel in Patna and monitoring party activities. It seems BJP headquarters has shifted to Patna,"" he said, adding ""but their plan will not succeed.""

Kumar, who has been projected as the face of grand secular alliance in the Bihar elections, said due to shortage of leaders in BJP, they are fighting elections in the name of PM.

""Days are not far when BJP will even contest panchayat elections in the name of Prime Minister,"" he said mocking at BJP.

Kumar counted virtues of unity and mutual trust among partners of grand secular alliance by highlighting joint declaration of name of candidates and joint agenda.

128,Drought Sri Lanka,How Sri Lanka won the malaria war - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/How-Sri-Lanka-won-the-malaria-war/article16756463.ece,"On September 5 this year, Sri Lanka was declared malaria-free at the 69th Session of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Committee for South-East Asia held in Colombo. This is another milestone in Sri Lanka’s outstanding achievements in public health, also reflected in standard health indicators such as life expectancy, infant mortality and average family size.

The only other country to have achieved malaria eradication in the WHO’s South-East Asian region consisting of 11 countries is the Maldives. It is no accident that these two countries have a long history of effective public health interventions and a well-developed health infrastructure. While these malaria-free countries do provide an important breakthrough for the South Asia region as a whole, it is important to note that the long-term viability of malaria-free status in countries that have already achieved this status depends on gradual advances in malaria control and eradication in the region as a whole. This is because malarial parasites can be easily reintroduced from malaria-endemic countries to malaria-free countries through human migration across national boundaries; these can be in the form of flows of tourists, pilgrims, workers, investors and refugees. This should caution us about being unduly optimistic about consolidating malaria eradication in selected countries without containing malaria in the region as a whole. Moreover, it is essential that the WHO regional office works closely with other donors and national governments to fight the remaining malaria outposts in the region.

Sri Lanka’s battle

Sri Lanka’s struggle against malaria has been a long and arduous one. The use of DDT as a vector control measure started in British Ceylon in the 1940s; the introduction of western antimalarials began in the 1930s. As pointed out by Fernando and Warusavithana in ‘100 Years of Malaria Control Efforts in Sri Lanka, 1911 to 2011’, the story of malaria control in Sri Lanka has been characterised by periods of spectacular advances and, equally, setbacks. Sri Lanka experienced one of the worst malaria epidemics ever recorded (1934-1935) after a triple disaster — a severe drought, food shortages and a malarial outbreak in the densely populated wet zone regions which are generally malaria-free.

The development of a comprehensive welfare state in Sri Lanka, inclusive of free education, free health care and subsidised food rations provided by the state to all citizens with effect from the 1940s, was in part a response to this massive epidemic that broke out a few years after universal franchise was introduced to the country in 1931. Confirming Amartya Sen’s view that famines rarely occur in functioning democracies, the elected political leaders in the affected areas highlighted the misery of malaria victims and pushed for health care and welfare reforms. Many in the first generation of political leadership in independent Ceylon saw the devastation caused by the 1934-35 malaria epidemic, and had directly participated in the relief work provided to populations affected by the epidemic. Therefore, they were determined to campaign for expanding health services and making them accessible to the population at large at state expense. Regular DDT spraying in malaria endemic regions began in 1945 and the number of malaria cases reported dropped from 2.7 million in 1946 to 17 in 1963 —a spectacular success in containing the spread of malaria. At that time the health authorities in Sri Lanka were optimistic about achieving malaria eradication in the near future.

However, optimism was short-lived as a full-scale malaria epidemic broke out again in 1968. Vector resistance to DDT and parasitic resistance to antimalarials were first reported in the 1970s, posing a serious threat to Sri Lanka’s progress. along with the malaria eradication strategy. New development projects such as the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Programme (1977) further complicated the task of malaria control due to development-induced population movements from the malaria-free wet zone to the malaria-endemic dry zone as well as due to enhanced vector breeding following environmental changes triggered by development schemes. By the 1980s, malaria infections were back to the levels seen in the pre-DDT era. An increase in P. falciparum malaria was the new challenge even though malaria mortality had declined due to improved health services in the country by this time.

The Anti-Malaria Campaign (AMC)responded to these challenges by switching from DDT to malathion, changing the drug regime administered to malaria patients, changing the approach from malaria eradication to control, and integration of malaria control with other health services in the country. Health volunteers were deployed to educate the public about the disease, its treatment and prevention. A variety of measures such as insecticide-impregnated bed nets and mosquito repellents were introduced in a multi-pronged attack on malaria vectors and parasites. By the early 1990s, there were signs that the interventions being used at the time had the effect of containing the disease and were limiting it to certain pockets where increased surveillance was necessary.

The struggle against malaria in Sri Lanka experienced a major setback due to the civil war between the Sri Lankan security forces and the LTTE, with Vanni, the primary theatre of war, being a malaria-endemic region and a large civilian population in the Northern Province being displaced into this region. An epidemic broke out in Vanni from 1998 to 2002, affecting civilians, LTTE cadres and Sri Lankan security forces. Despite the raging hostilities between the security forces and the LTTE since 1983, there is no evidence of any manipulation of malaria interventions for military purposes either by the state or the LTTE. On the contrary, the two warring parties opted to stop fighting when anti-malaria work was being carried out by the AMC, perhaps realising that malaria was a common enemy for combatants and civilians on both sides of the ethnic divide. The peace accord signed between the government and the LTTE under Norwegian mediation also facilitated the gradual containment of the war-induced malaria epidemic in the affected regions. Even though successful malaria containment in Sri Lanka was achieved prior to the last phase of the war, it is significant that Sri Lanka achieved malaria-free status in the aftermath of the war when the dust had settled and the resettlement of war-displaced population had been largely accomplished.

The future

Malaria is by and large under control in much of South Asia. The remaining hotbeds of malaria transmission in the region are in conflict-affected and frontier regions in Afghanistan, northeast India and Myanmar and require a long-term focal attention in the form of surveillance of the vector, parasite and human behaviour conducive to malaria transmission, a multi-pronged approach inclusive of increased community participation in malaria control activities, livelihood development and poverty reduction, conflict prevention and reconciliation among rival parties. If we are to ensure that the disease burden is to not become an obstacle to future developments in the South Asia region, efforts must be made to rollback these diseases as we seek to roll-out broad-based development in the region as a whole. As elaborated in my recent book, ‘Decolonisation, Development and Disease: A Social History of Malaria in Sri Lanka’ (2014), successful eradication of malaria calls for a shift from a narrow biomedical to a human-centric approach.

Floods and heavy rains have led to evacuations and caused extensive damage in waterlogged eastern Canada

The toll from severe flooding in eastern Canada worsened Monday with thousands of people affected and schools closed, but authorities were optimistic that rising water levels would soon crest.

Several rivers and lakes have reached near 50-year peak levels in Quebec province, between Gatineau in the Canadian capital region and Montreal 200 kilometers (125 miles) downstream, Quebec Public Safety Minister Martin Coiteux announced.

The ground is saturated and unable to absorb any more water.

But recent heavy rains have started to subside and ""as of Wednesday, we expect to see the situation begin to improve,"" Coiteux said.

The Canadian army has deployed troops to help stem the flooding, reinforcing dikes, maintaining water treatment facilities, and protecting other critical infrastructure such as bridges.

Brigadier-General Hercule Gosselin said their ranks would swell to 1,650 later in the day.

Although it is unlikely to get any worse as of Monday, ""the situation will last a few weeks,"" said Coiteux.

""I have never seen so much water between Ottawa and Montreal,"" Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, the wife of the prime minister, told broadcaster RDI.

The day before, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accompanied by his two young children, had traveled to the town of Terrasse Vaudreuil west of Montreal to help locals fill sandbags.

'Exception circumstance' caused floods

There are ""exceptional circumstances"" behind the flooding, said Quebec Environment Minister David Heurtel, pointing to a month of rain coming on the heels of a spring thaw after a ""severe winter.""

For many residents who have been fighting an exhausting battle to hold back the waters, often in vain, despair has started to set in.

In the small community of Pierrefonds, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Montreal, resident John Parker was busy Monday morning hauling wet furniture and personal belongings to the curb, as a pump and hose sputtered water from his flooded basement over a wall of sandbags.

""It will get better, because it can't get any worse,"" he told AFP.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said the recovery and cleanup from this ""historic flood"" will take time.

Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said it was the worst Canadian flood in ""50 years"" but added that the situation was improving in Ontario, where high water levels in one of the Great Lakes—Lake Ontario—threatened coastal communities including parts of Toronto, Belleville to the east and the Thousand Islands region, which is home to thousands of 19th century mansions and cottages.

""We are watching closely the events in New Brunswick"" on the Atlantic coast, and in eastern Quebec where the rains ""appear to be headed,"" said Goodale.

Sunday evening, a 37-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter were reported missing after their car veered into a river and was swept away near Sainte-Anne-des-Monts in the Gaspe region of eastern Quebec.

In British Columbia, on the opposite side of the country, the same combination of rain and snowmelt has caused flooding and mudslides that left at least two people missing, including the fire chief of the village of Cache Creek who had been out checking water levels.

In Quebec, many schools and other public institutions remained closed Monday.

McGill University in downtown Montreal canceled classes and postponed year-end exams, citing difficulties facing students and faculty just getting to the campus.

More than 400 roadways have been closed due to flooding across the province.

Reports say the overflow of two rivers in western Uganda exacerbated the situation, causing buildings to submerge. A major hospital in western Kasese had partly been submerged according to the Red cross.

Betty Mbambu, flood victim spoke to the media: “I had just bought a plot. The flood came and washed away my property, cupboards, mattresses. Right now, we are here trying to see what things of ours we can dig out.

“We woke up and business and the property were destroyed. Right now we are trying to find the remaining properties (items) that could been buried in our house.”

The rains also led to damage of infrastructure, including roads, bridges and several farms were washed away.

In a related development in East Africa, floods have killed 65 people in Rwanda on Thursday and nearly 200 in Kenya last month.

Kasese floods death toll now 11 – Relief Web

The district and Uganda Red Cross authorities said the deceased included two students, and Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) soldier, Lothorach Lokwang, attached to the Bwera-based Mountain Brigade.

At least 11 people have been confirmed dead following the new wave of floods that hit the Uganda-DR Congo border district Kasese on Thursday.

Nine of the deaths occurred in Kitholhu sub-county while the other two were killed in Mpondwe-Lhubiriha town council when floods washed them into River Lhubiriha, which burst its banks.

Also River Thako in the Town Council flooded.

The floods were as a result of River Lhubiriha, which borders Uganda and DR Congo along Kitholhu sub-county, in Bukonzo West Constituency. It burst its banks following the overnight torrential rains in Mt Rwenzori.

The clerics signed the online statement with a clear sectarian and anti-Christian rhetoric which reflects mounting anger among many Saudis over Russian and Iranian involvement in Syria's civil war. Last week Russia began air strikes against Syrian opposition targets which it describes as aimed at weakening the jihadist Islamic State group, a move the government in Riyadh has denounced.

In the clerics' statement, they compared it to the Soviet Union's 1980 invasion of Afghanistan, which prompted an international jihad, or holy war. The statement said: ""The holy warriors of Syria are defending the whole Islamic nation. ""Trust them and support them because if they are defeated, God forbid, it will be the turn of one Sunni country after another.""

The Saudi government, along with Turkey and other Gulf states, is a main supporter of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Iran and Russia, but it is also worried about the rise of jihadist groups such as Islamic State among the opposition. Saudi jets have joined air strikes against Islamic State in Syria, while the government has decreed long prison terms for anyone who supports the group, whose sympathisers have killed dozens in attacks in the kingdom this year.

Sectarian anger has been spreading across the Middle East due to the bloodshed in Syria which is part of a wider struggle for regional supremacy between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran. Both sides have attracted religiously motivated foreign fighters.

Riyadh's state-affiliated clergy have already termed the war a jihad for Syrians, but they have also denounced Islamic State as well as al Qaeda, and said Saudi citizens must not go abroad to fight or give the rebels money except via government channels. The 53 signatories, including prominent Islamists with a history of opposing the government, were careful not to contradict that message by directly calling on Saudis to join the jihad, but they also did not speak out against travel for jihad. Their letter, which used sectarian terms for both Iran and Assad's Alawite sect, a Shi'ite offshoot, also portrayed Russian involvement as part of an Orthodox Christian crusade, and attacked the West for denying the rebels anti-aircraft weapons. The statement said: ""The Western-Russian coalition with the Safavids (Iran) and the Nusairis (Alawites) are making a real war against the Sunni people and their countries.""",2015-10-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['syria', 'jihad', 'war', 'iran', 'muslim', 'islamist', 'state', 'saudi', 'russia', 'countries', 'saudis', 'islamic', 'statement', 'sunni', 'clerics']",Somalia,news article,English
