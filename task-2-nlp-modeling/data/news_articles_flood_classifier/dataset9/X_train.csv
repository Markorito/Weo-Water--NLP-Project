In the light of the above, all hands must be on deck to ensure that we prepare well to mitigate the impact of the predicted 2020 flooding, even in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic, said Sanusi Ado, state coordinator for NEMA, adding that urban centers are also likely to be affected by the occurrence.

Such flood, the official said, can threaten agriculture, water resources, health, transport, and infrastructure sectors in the state.

15,DR-2014-000109-CHN,New energy-rich sorghum offers ethanol without the corn - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/12/biofuels-energy-efficient-sorghum-nexsteppe,"As scientists around the world research biomass feedstocks — trees, shrubs and grasses that are designed to produce energy — a California startup called NexSteppe is betting that fast-growing, drought-resistant sorghum will emerge as a crop to sustainably fuel cars, trucks and power plants.

Sorghum, a millenia-old cereal grain, today feeds animals and people. It is turned into flour, syrups and beer, and used in gluten-free products. In Asia, sorghum is made into couscous, and across Africa, it’s consumed as a porridge.

Last year, though, NexSteppe introduced two new brands of sorghum seeds, dubbed Palo Alto and Malibu, that were bred expressly to be energy crops. They grow on marginal land and in a variety of climates, and they climb to a height of 20 feet after only four months of growth.

“Sorghum is naturally very heat and drought tolerant,” says Anna Rath, NexSteppe’s founder, president and CEO. “It originated in Africa. It’s a camel of a crop, if you will.”

Although NexSteppe has done almost no marketing outside of Brazil, its biggest market, the company’s sorghum is now being grown by farmers in 15 countries, including China, India, South Africa, Germany, Canada and the US.

“We identified a market need that wasn’t being met,” Rath told me, when we met at NexSteppe’s office in South San Francisco, across the bay from San Francisco International Airport. “Until now, crops have always been developed for animal feed and food—with the exception of cotton and tobacco. But there’s a growing need for energy that wasn’t being addressed.”

Rath, who is 38, is a former McKinsey consultant with degrees in biology and genetics, as well a doctorate from Yale Law School. She started NexSteppe with about $1m from friends and family in 2010. Since then, the company has raised about $40m from venture capitalists and from DuPont, which has major investments in biofuels, including a cellulosic ethanol plant under construction in Iowa.

NexSteppe isn’t the only company developing dedicated energy crops. Ceres, a small public company where Rath previously worked, breeds sorghum, switchgrass and miscanthus, but its products have been slow to reach the market. Meantime, the US government and university scientists backed by a 10-year, $500m grant from BP are extensively researching energy crops and biofuels production.

Why do we need dedicated energy crops? First of all, environmentalists say, reducing carbon pollution from the transportation sector will require widespread uptake of biofuels; vast, existing fleets of cars, trucks, buses and planes will need liquid fuels (but not gasoline or diesel oil) for decades to come. Second, most of the world’s biofuels today come from two feedstocks: corn in the US and sugarcane in Brazil. Neither is an ideal energy crop, experts say.

“We don’t view using food crops for fuel as a generally good idea,” says Heather Youngs, a senior fellow at the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), a BP-funded research project at UC Berkeley. EBI is doing basic research on an array of crops with appealing sustainability profiles, including perennial grasses like miscanthus. Since 2006, the US energy and agriculture departments have also funded basic research into the genomics of plant feedstocks for bioenergy.

Brian Siu, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says biofuels ideally should be made out of organic waste or crops that don’t require much water or chemical use. “We have a lot of concerns with corn ethanol,” he says. “Corn is currently produced with a chemical-intensive process. It uses lots of fertilizers. It uses lots of pesticides.” Biofuels made from corn also cost more than fossil fuels, so they require government mandates or subsidies, which are controversial.

While sorghum is also grown for food, Rath says, it “needs a lot fewer carbon inputs than corn or sugarcane”. It also produces more biomass per acre per year than corn or sugarcane. NexSteppe has commissioned an independent analysis of sorghum’s sustainability profile, but it’s not yet available.

That said, unlike corn or sugarcane, NexSteppe’s crops have been bred to optimize energy production. Its Malibu sweet sorghum is designed to produce easily accessible fermentable sugars for fuels, while its Palo Alto high-biomass sorghum aims to deliver a low-moisture feedstock for cellulosic biofuels and biomass boilers that produce heat and electricity. The company, which employs about 35 people, half of them scientists, uses conventional breeding methods, and does’t use genetic modification.

Brazil is “our first, largest and most important market”, Rath says, because demand there is growing for both transportation fuels and electricity. Brazil also has dozens of ethanol plants and biomass boilers that are hungry for feedstocks to supplement local sugarcane. She sees opportunities for growth in China as well as in the US, where a half dozen or so cellulosic ethanol plants are expected to begin commercial production this year.

Over time, a variety of feedstocks are likely to emerge, depending on local conditions as well as government policy. Says Heather Youngs of EBI: “There’s a saying that ‘all biomass is local’ and it’s really true.” The NRDC’s Brian Siu agrees, saying that the sustainability profile of a biofuel is “highly determined by the feedstock and how and where we choose to grow it”. “The ‘how’ and ‘where’ are very important,” he says.

477,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Govt to control drought relief funds - Namibian,https://www.namibian.com.na/191108/archive-read/Govt-to-control-drought-relief-funds,"by Sakeus Iikela

STRICT control measures have been put in place to ensure that all funds being donated towards the government's drought relief programme are accounted for, says the executive director in the Office of the Prime Minister, I-Ben Nashandi.

Nashandi said the government's bank account, into which donated funds are deposited, will be strictly monitored.



The account was also subject to procurement rules and treasury regulations, and it will be audited, he added.



Nashandi was responding to questions from The Namibian on how the government will ensure that funds donated for the drought relief programme do not end up in the pockets of individuals.



“There are sufficient measures to safeguard the funds therein,” he stated.



The government started rolling out the drought relief programme at the beginning of June, following the declaration of drought as a national emergency by president Hage Geingob in May this year.



From May, the government also started receiving donations in cash and kind from foreign governments, international organisations, local corporate entities as well as individuals for the drought relief programme.



At the moment, the government has received a total of N$99 million in donations.



The Namibian earlier this year reported that the government had announced that it will provide N$570 million to help distressed farmers and communities.



However, Nashandi this week said N$570 million was the total budget for the approved drought interventions, and not the available funds.



He said the government at the time of the declaration had less than N$200 million “in the fund”, which is why it requested donations from the public.



Apart from the donations, Nashandi said the finance ministry has so far allocated an additional N$150 million towards the programme to address the high number of beneficiaries registered, compared to the initial estimate.



He added that due to cost escalations and the increasing number of beneficiaries, the drought relief programme might require a higher budget than the initial estimate of N$570 million.



“This means even with the donations and the additional allocation from treasury, there still remains a deficit on the budget for the drought. Therefore, the need for the public's support towards the drought relief programme remains,” he continued.



The comprehensive drought intervention plan includes food assistance to communities affected by drought, and the provision of water tankers.



Under the programme, identified beneficiaries will receive a food basket made up of 20 kilogramme maize meal, 750 millilitres of cooking oil, and tinned fish?).



To qualify for the food basket, a household must not earn an income of more than N$2 600 per month, and must not be a beneficiary of food relief from any other source during the same period.



To benefit from livestock fodder support, farmers must have less than 26 large stock units (cattle) and less than 130 small stock units (goats and/or sheep). Identified farmers will receive free fodder and licks.



Nashandi said the government so far has spent N$54 million for drought relief interventions. Of this amount, N$30 million was spent on water provision in the regions.



Furthermore, N$8,8 million was spent on food provision, and N$4,7 million on logistics. The government also spent N$9,8 million on livestock support.



REPORTED DONATIONS SO FAR



Although Nashandi said the total donations received was N$99 million, The Namibian's calculations reflect that the government has received over N$120 million worth of monetary and other support from various donors towards the drought relief programme.



Of this amount, N$60 million was sourced from the Namibia Post and Telecom Holdings (NPTH). The government also received N$35 million from NamPower, Namdia and the Chamber of Mines.



The Road Fund Administration and Roads Authority donated a combined N$12 million, while the Chinese government chipped in with N$2,3 million for the programme.



The United States, through the US Agency for International Development, donated N$1,4 million. Algeria pledged support of N$3,7 million to Namibia, and the Indian high commission donated 1 000 metric tonnes of food grain.



The First National Bank of Namibia Foundation bought fodder worth over N$2,2 million, which is being distributed to farmers.



Mobile Telecommunications Company (MTC) donated N$650 000 to two major farmers' unions in the country, namely the Namibia National Farmers Union and the Namibia Agricultural Union, respectively.



Chinese telecommunications company Huawei donated N$300 000, while the Turkish embassy gave food worth N$30 000 to the government.

178,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Australia Floods Disrupt COVID-19 Vaccinations - VOA Asia,https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/australia-floods-disrupt-covid-19-vaccinations,"SYDNEY - Widespread flooding is disrupting the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations in Australia as thousands of people are forced to leave their homes.

Emergency crews in eastern Australia have responded to thousands of calls for help. The rain in many areas has been unrelenting. For the first time in years, Sydney’s main reservoir is overflowing, putting suburbs at risk of flooding. Authorities are reporting once-in-a-century downpours north of Sydney, and thousands of people have been told to leave their homes.

Near the town of Taree, a house occupied by a young couple was washed away down a river by floodwaters on what was supposed to have been their wedding day.

The bride, Sarah Soars, told Australian television the property was swept away within minutes.

“I am lost for words. I do not know even what to say, like, everything that we owned, everything that we worked hard for (has) gone within ten minutes and it was out of our sight,” Soars said.

Campaign group Greenpeace has linked the severe storms in eastern Australia to climate change, and the burning of coal, oil and gas.

The wild weather is disrupting Australia’s mass coronavirus inoculation program.

More than six million Australians are now eligible for an injection in the next phase of the vaccination rollout.

Australia’s medical regulator has approved domestic production of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Federal health minister Greg Hunt says the drug is safe.

“This is a fundamental decision which locks in for Australia access to 50 million units of domestically produced vaccines. It means that the manufacturing process has been approved. It is safe, effective (and) meets all of the requirements from one of the toughest regulators in the world,” Hunt said.

Vaccines made by AstraZeneca and Pfizer are approved for use in Australia.

One of Australia’s most senior medical officials, Federal Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy, has said international travel into and out of Australia would be severely restricted for the rest of the year until global COVID-19 vaccinations are more widely administered.

Australia closed its international borders a year ago to foreign travelers because of the pandemic.

Murphy said life in Australia would get back to normal, but it would take time and patience was needed.

145,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Troops return to Chch from East Timor - Stuff.co.nz,https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/7963023/Troops-return-to-Chch-from-East-Timor,"New Zealand's last rotation of troops to East Timor arrived back in Christchurch last week. Military top brass and Timorese leaders say it's the right time to withdraw. Jimmy Ellingham travelled there for a look.

South of Dili, East Timor's hot, dry and dusty capital, a narrow pot-holed road snakes its way over the hills.

It clings to the sides of gullies and groans under the strain of four-wheel-drives and buses so full of people that some have to cling to the outside.

Their luggage and even the odd live goat somehow stay tied to the top as they make their way across the Southeast Asian nation.

A trip to Madabeno, about 50 kilometres from Dili, takes a couple of hours on this road. It's cooler in the hills and it's like taking a step back in time.

Homes are simple and, although new power pylons hang overhead, the electricity hasn't yet been turned on.

A high proportion of the area's 1665 people are young, but unlike in Dili, where there is more development, including a shopping mall, the locals haven't been living among United Nations peacekeepers and foreign forces.

After an on-and-off presence dating back to 1999, foreign forces are leaving East Timor, and its internal security is being left to the Timorese.

By the end of the year, police acting as UN peacekeepers will be gone. New Zealand's last rotation of 80 troops arrived home in Christchurch last week.

Timorese and the departing leaders seem confident that the country will be fine, that it has broken free of its troubled past.

The police force, which disintegrated in 2006, is now back together, while the military has even reached the stage where its members can go on UN missions overseas.

""It will be good so we can stand alone and serve our country,"" says the chief of Madabeno, Francisco Rodrigues Pereira.

""I believe that, with the training we've already got, they can serve this country peacefully.""

Further up the road, at Bandudato, the village chief, Mario Viera da Costa, says the 2006 trouble did not reach his area.

But the flow-on effects did, as people left the city to seek refuge or return to their districts.

That year wasn't a good one for East Timor, as Dili was swept up in a wave of violence. Rogue elements of the military revolted, the police force collapsed and the city was on fire.

New Zealand troops arrived to restore order, some running straight off a Hercules aircraft in full combat gear.

Fearful for their safety, New Zealand embassy staff locked the gates of their beachfront property and hid inside.

Kiwi police followed to act as peacekeepers. Some are still posted to the country as part of the UN mission that ends on December 31.

""I arrived to find that the rule of law had broken down in Timor,"" Superintendent John Spence recalls.

New Zealand, Australian, Portuguese and Malaysian police filled the breach. Since then about 300 New Zealand officers have served there.

""There were armed gangs wandering the streets of Dili. There was rebellion,"" Spence says.

For Timorese forced to flee from their homes, there were primitive refugee camps, which were ""hotbeds of trouble"".

""There were no police officers around, so villagers used to throw rocks at the IDP (internally displaced persons) camps and the camps would throw rocks back.""

The last of these camps was dissolved two years ago, as East Timor has transformed, but in 2006 and into the next year, instability was rife.

Lance Corporal Stu Triggs says in Dili and in the countryside, patrols would have to take arms off people - machetes, slingshots, guns and even poisoned darts.

When the first New Zealand troops arrived 13 years ago, the former Portuguese colony had voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975.

A wave of violence then swept though the country as pro- Indonesia militia, backed by that country's military, couldn't accept the result.

Horrendous crimes were committed, including a massacre in the southwestern city of Suai, where about 200 people were murdered as they sought shelter in a church.

And in 2000, Private Leonard Manning became New Zealand's first soldier to die since the Vietnam War when he was killed by jungle militia near the Indonesian border.

The situation calmed down again in the early part of the last decade, as independence was achieved in 2002 and foreign troops went home.

This year, East Timor held largely trouble-free presidential and parliamentary elections and it is felt the country can now handle its own internal security, so the stabilisation force and UN police are going home.

Since 2006, 13 rotations of New Zealand soldiers have travelled there on six-month tours of duty, costing about $100 million.

They leave behind only a small team to clean up, and five advisers working with the East Timorese military.

Similarly, while the New Zealand police have finished peacekeeping duties, senior officers will stay on for four years to advise on community policing.

The New Zealanders who just left stayed at a camp known as ""Kiwilines"", a well-established site on the southwest of Dili.

Six years ago makeshift camps were slung up wherever they could find spare land - a world away from life back in New Zealand.

Now one of the old camps is a deserted and crumbling building on the waterfront, home to a few families, chickens and some men selling art.

Their living quarters is a small square tin room, with no air- conditioning and no comforts of home. But there is still peace, something that seemed a world away at the turn of the millenium.

Major Tim Tuatini, the officer in charge of the final rotation of Kiwi soldiers, was first in East Timor in 2001.

Like many who have come back, he says the country has changed immensely.

""It's just the small things. There are a lot of children. There are a lot of scooters now, yellow taxis, vehicles moving up and down. It's the hustle and bustle I'd expect from any Asian city,"" he says.

""When I was here last time, if you saw an SUV or large vehicle moving around, it was normally an international who was driving it. Now, you have Timorese driving them.""

This isn't typical in a poor country, where many of the 1.1 million people are subsistence farmers who live in areas devoid of contact with the outside world.

A lack of jobs could be the spark that sets Dili off, says United States doctor Dan Murphy, who runs a stretched and busy medical clinic in the city.

He is ""sceptical"" about the withdrawal of foreign troops and police, saying the situation could turn bad again.

""People still aren't that professional. There's still a lot of self-interest. There are still a lot of problems from the past.""

During the past couple of weeks, Murphy has noticed gangs roaming the streets at night and the odd shotgun sound.

""It doesn't take much to start something,"" he warns. ""The whole thing could go down the drain again. Most people have no job and they don't have much to do. They're sitting around and they've got all this testosterone pumping through their veins.""

Dili is a city of about 200,000 people and it's growing quickly. There, the New Zealand military has remained, under the banner of the Australian-led International Stabilisation Force that officially ended its mandate on October 31.

It seems the Kiwi soldiers have left a good impression with the Timorese.

As a group of them have dinner at a restaurant in Dili, a boy passing by says ""Kia ora, bro"".

Others put it more simply: ""Kiwi, good"".

While East Timor may be more stable, it is not trouble-free.

Poverty and disease are rampant, unemployment is high and basic nutrition is lacking.

New Zealand Ambassador to Dili, Tony Fautua, has talked of moving the two countries' relationship away from one of enforcement towards trade, education and development.

578,Drought Sri Lanka,Why You Are Paying for Everyone's Flood Insurance - LiveScience.com,https://www.livescience.com/28233-taxpayers-under-water.html,"Last month also brought heavy precipitation to parts of the U.S. The only part of this home in Vicksburg Mississippi above water on May 13, 2011 was the roof.

Andy Stevenson, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Finance Advisor and Dan Lashof, Director of NRDC's Climate and Clean Air Program contributed this article to LiveScience's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.

There are many, many compelling and urgent reasons to take decisive action to combat climate change. Here's one that's measurable by dollars added to our budget deficit. Actually by tens of billions of dollars.

The soaring cost of private flood insurance is pricing so many coastal homeowners out of the market that the rest of the American taxpayers are having to bail them out – to the tune of $30 billion under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

With over $139 billion in storm, wildfire, drought, tornado and flood damages taking nearly 1 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012, the insurance industry is referring to last year as the second costliest year on record for U.S. climate-related disasters. And while insurers do include $12 billion worth of flood-related damages in their estimates, they aren't the ones getting stuck with most of the bill. It's us, the taxpayer.

On a global basis, the insurance company Munich Re estimates that flooding represented 16 percent of total climate-related damages over the past decade, or $25 billion, on average, per year. Over that same period, insurers paid out on $3.75 billion per year, on average, or less than 15 percent of total flood-related costs. That percentage seems to be fairly representative as the total losses from floods along the Mississippi in 2011 were estimated at $4.6 billion with only $500 million (11 percent) covered by private insurers.

So if insurers are only paying 10-15 percent of the bill, who actually does pay the cost of flood-related damage? The not-so-surprising answer is you and me, largely through the National Flood Insurance Program, which has nearly $1.3 trillion in policies outstanding. This program includes several state programs, such as the one for Florida (which has over 2 million policy holders and a face value of $475 billion) that had to be created as the rising cost of flooding was not being covered by private insurers.

This massive federal program has nearly doubled in size over the past decade as private insurers have continued to shy away from making bets against Mother Nature when it comes to floods. And while the federal government has picked up the slack in terms of coverage, it has had a tough time balancing the premiums that are paid in with the heavy losses it has sustained from recent climate related events.

In fact, following an estimated $12 billion in payout to 140,000 policy holders from Superstorm Sandy, the program is over $30 billion in debt and has Congress scratching its head about what to do about it since the private insurers have made it very clear this is not a business that they wish to be in. NFIP is insolvent because premiums don't reflect actual risks; and it's hard to make a case that climate-change-charged storms are not a big part of the reason why. [Jersey Shore: Before and After Hurricane Sandy]

In sum, the U.S. taxpayer is currently down $30 billion trying to provide insurance for coastal landowners that no longer have access to affordable private flood insurance. And that figure does not include the costs weathered by the state-based programs that have been set up due to a lack of private alternatives available to their residents. Taken together, these programs constitute a climate disruption tax that the U.S. consumer is being forced to pay to cover risks that the insurance industry, the true score-keepers on climate, won't touch.

As the costs of climate change continue to mount, it is becoming increasingly obvious that we can't afford not to act to rein in the carbon pollution that is supercharging storms and floods. Fortunately President Obama has a big opportunity to reduce emissions from power plants, America's biggest carbon polluters. Under a plan NRDC put forward in December, we could cut these emissions by 26 percent by 2020 and 34 percent by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. The plan provides great flexibility to states and utilities, and offers benefits to every American.

Its benefits—worth between $25 and $60 billion in 2020 — far outweigh the plan's costs — about $4 billion. Implementing it will save tens of thousands of lives through reductions in air pollution. And it will drive investments in energy efficiency and clean energy that will create thousands of new jobs across the nation. Now that's an insurance premium worth paying.

895,FL-2021-000038-KEN,TOM KAGWE - Why the LSK Choice of Female Representative to the JSC Is Crucial - The Elephant,https://www.theelephant.info/long-reads/2021/04/16/why-the-lsk-choice-of-female-representative-to-the-jsc-is-crucial/,"There are reports from some parts of Kenya that 30 per cent of high school girls have been missing from class. This may be the result of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), marriage, pregnancy, the cost of school fees, or a combination of these factors. The Orchid Project reports similar findings, although its survey was published last September and the situation may well have worsened since then:

“The impact of COVID is huge,” says Charles Leshore, who formerly worked for a leading Kenyan health NGO that campaigns against FGM/C. He is also a board member at a school in Kajiado, and has seen the negative impacts there and across the county. “COVID and school closures have significantly erased a lot of good work [around FGM/C] and more girls have succumbed to teenage pregnancy, FGM/C, depression and mental health issues.”

The issue goes well beyond Kenya. Judy Gitau, Regional Coordinator for Africa for the NGO Equality Now (whose Africa office is in Nairobi) warns: “Schools are generally safe spaces for girls and those not in school are more vulnerable to human rights violations, including sexual and labor exploitation, human trafficking, female genital mutilation, early pregnancy, and early and forced marriage. Schools provide a channel via which violation or threats can be reported and action taken. This pandemic has shut down this key source of safeguarding . . . .”

With a couple of exceptions, this article will not name any other NGOs from this point on to avoid seeming to show favour or disfavour.

Our starting point is that this is an opportune moment to pause and ask whether anti-FGM/C strategies have been working. This will be our main focus, with particular reference to Alternative Rites of Passage (ARP, explained below). One of the authors (Hughes) has researched this subject academically, while Newell-Jones has empirical knowledge of it as a development practitioner. We shall also refer to FGM/C as “the cut”, which is the colloquial expression, at least in East Africa. Efforts to end the practice take many forms, of which ARP is only one.

FGM/C in Kenya: laws and incidence

FGM/C has been outlawed in Kenya since 2001, first under the Children Act 2001 and later under the Prohibition of FGM Act 2011. It was further proscribed (by implication, not by name) in the Constitution of Kenya 2010 (CoK), which banned harmful cultural practices without specifying what these are. Although the CoK upholds rights to culture, it also says that these cannot include harmful cultural practices. Under the 2011 Act, an Anti-FGM Board of Kenya was established, with a remit to spearhead anti-FGM/C efforts nationwide. Despite this legislation, and the efforts of the Board, the practice continues. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 21 per cent of all Kenyan women aged 15 to 49 years have been circumcised. This compares to 38 per cent in 1999; the rate is steadily falling. The incidence is, however, much higher in certain communities, e.g. 94 per cent among the Somali and 78 per cent among the Maasai. Worryingly for campaigners, FGM/C is increasingly becoming medicalised, meaning it is being performed in secret by medical practitioners in a child’s home or in government health facilities. Medicalisation was highlighted in the court case brought by medical doctor Tatu Kamau, which she recently lost. In 2018, UNFPA reported that 20 per cent of FGM/C in Kenya was performed by medical professionals, compared to 77 per cent in Sudan and 12 per cent in Nigeria.

What are Alternative Rites of Passage?

This relatively new approach to tackling FGM/C was developed by NGOs and some communities. It has become increasingly popular in Kenya and Tanzania, and with international donors that fund anti-FGM/C work. At least ten NGOs in Kenya run ARP programmes, or have done so in the past. ARP is only believed to be effective in communities where FGM/C traditionally involved initiation into womanhood, not those in which pre-pubescent girls, even babies, undergo it. This is because NGOs seek to use ARP to replicate girls’ initiation, but without the cut. As Christine Alfons, Founder of SAFE Engage Foundation, explained to us: “ARP is more effective in communities where the cut is done towards the marriage time. In Kuria, girls are cut way back before they are ready for marriage, so we don’t need ARP, it adds nothing and takes many resources.”

ARP is known colloquially as a “ritual without cutting” or “circumcision by words”. There is no standard model, but it usually consists of two parts: a training session or sessions, for girls and sometimes boys, followed by a public graduation ceremony where the participants declare that they have renounced FGM/C. The participants include not only girls and boys but also their parents (though not all parents attend, or even oppose FGM/C), elders, other members of the community, and VIPs who can include police chiefs, teachers, faith leaders, representatives of the county council and the Anti-FGM Board. ARP usually takes place during the school holidays, to coincide with the “cutting season”. Most cutting is carried out in the long school holidays in November-December, April, or July-August with local variations.

ARP was first developed in Kenya by Maendeleo ya Wanawake in collaboration with PATH (Programme for Alternative Technology in Health), in the Tharaka area of Meru in 1996. The few studies on ARP that exist all cite this pioneering work, but without being able to access the original data, and in the absence of follow-up studies, it is difficult to draw conclusive lessons from it. ARP remains highly under-researched, both by scholars and development practitioners, and research access is difficult to negotiate. The Anti-FGM Board acknowledges that more research is needed.

ARP training sessions

The training or educational element of an ARP is arguably much more important than the final ceremony, though media coverage, NGO reports and the Anti-FGM Board pay far less attention to this. For PR purposes, it’s not sexy or eye-catching and nor is it deemed newsworthy.

The training sessions, when combined with longer-term community sensitisation and other measures that form an integrated multi-pronged approach, are vital if attitudes and behaviour are to change. Evidence that they actually achieve those aims, however, is hard to find, largely because no long-term evaluations have been carried out on the educational element. We only know of two NGOs that hold quizzes some months later to test how much children remember about the anti-FGM/C messages. It is difficult to access the training, and requests to see curricula and teaching materials are often declined. The following observations are mostly based on Hughes’s experience of sitting in on training sessions run by two major NGOs that did allow access, where she took verbatim notes with the aid of local translators.

The training sessions usually take up to a week, sometimes two, and often take place in girls’ boarding schools where the girls stay for the duration of the ARP. (If boys are included, they usually stay in boys’ boarding schools nearby.) The curriculum can include: traditional culture (good and bad), harmful practices, the law and FGM/C, health and hygiene, food and nutrition, sexuality and reproductive health (including sexually transmitted diseases), drug abuse, human rights, violence against girls and women, self-esteem, the bible/Christian faith (if the community concerned is Christian), and “good morals”.

ARP graduation ceremonies

These are days of high excitement, celebration and expectation. For the children, it’s a chance to dress up, perform songs and dances, and laugh with their friends. It often starts with a parade to the venue, the girls and boys (if they are involved) striding along carrying NGO-branded banners, singing songs about stopping the cut. Journalists and camera crews are out in force, scrambling for visuals and soundbites. Some parents (not all attend) sit separately, looking slightly baffled as the ceremony unfolds. In some ARP ceremonies, parents publicly declare they will not cut their daughters. Hours of speeches from NGO staff, pastors, elders, health workers, teachers, law enforcers and VIPs have tested most onlookers’ patience by mid-afternoon. The graduates are presented with certificates towards the end of the day: the girls’ certificates confirm their personal commitment to remain “cut free”, the boys’ certificates confirm their commitment to keeping their sisters and future daughters “cut free”. Musical performances by the children, and cultural artistes, are highly entertaining and the poems and songs written and performed by children can be very moving.

What are the challenges and weaknesses of ARP?

Besides those already mentioned, these include:

On the training: There is, from observation, wide disparity in the quality of the teaching, with some trainers (rarely professional teachers, not that this would necessarily be appropriate) clearly unprepared and ill-equipped to teach. Many trainers are outsiders, rather than members of the community concerned, though some NGOs do take care to include “grassroots” people. The mode of delivery can resemble brainwashing, while some of the content jars with the avowed aim of empowering girls to make their own choices about their bodies and future lives. For example, the trainers repeatedly tell girls to “be obedient”, especially to men, parents and elders, yet these are often the very people who want to see the practice continue, and who force girls to undergo FGM/C and child marriage.

The emphasis on obedience, this time to God, is repeated in the lessons about faith, and features throughout the programmes run by faith-based NGOs. (We refer only to Christian NGOs here, and have not studied the approach taken by Muslim ones; there is less uptake of ARP in Muslim communities.) It is drummed into the children that FGM/C is a sinful act, it displeases God, is “the devil’s work”, and so on. Some Christian NGO staff defend this approach on the grounds that faith is a key vehicle for messaging, and that it’s important to point out, to a predominantly Christian audience, that the bible does not condone or even mention FGM/C (though it does endorse male circumcision). Some scholars also see the use of religious discourse as helpful in certain situations, noting how “many participants drew inspiration from the Bible in a way that enabled them to cope and deal with adversity”.

But how can biblical arguments convince non-believers? Furthermore, they encourage people to stop practising FGM/C for biblical rather than, say, health and human rights reasons. Fear of divine retribution for “sinfulness” hardly suggests a sincere change of heart. As a 45-year- old Maasai Pentecostal pastor’s wife who took part in a focus group discussion (mediated by Hughes in a Kajiado village in March 2015) said: “As a Christian I have to obey what the law says. As a good Christian, unless something is against the word of God I will do it. But if it’s clear in the Bible that it’s wrong, I can’t continue [to support FGM/C].” Earlier in the discussion, this woman had said she used to “love” FGM/C before she was “born again”.

Good work to tackle FGM/C is undoubtedly being done by some faith-based NGOs and individual churches but it tends to be undermined by what may be called “fire and brimstone” religiosity. This was very evident at some training sessions we observed. The emphasis was on fearing God, confessing sin, and families being excluded from church if they cut their daughters. Evangelical pastors also lead entire sessions that resemble religious services at some ARP ceremonies. However, both Christianity and Islam believe in the perfection of God’s creation of man and woman, which can lead to powerful anti-FGM/C messages. As one clergyman trainer put it: “What God created in human beings was complete, nothing to be added or subtracted . . . God made us perfectly. So those people who come and cut those parts are doing a wrong thing.”

NGOs say that the lessons on culture and tradition are meant to mimic the instruction that girls traditionally had before or after they were cut. But back in the day, girls were taught by older women to be good wives and mothers, to obey their husbands at all times (even if they beat them), to be sexually submissive, and so on. How does this type of message equip today’s girls to become empowered women, and to challenge gender stereotyping? Clearly, it does not. Hence there is a fundamental contradiction here, for example between lessons on traditional culture and those on children’s and human rights. Girls taking part in ARP told us that they were confused by contradictory messaging.

Good work to tackle FGM/C is undoubtedly being done by some faith-based NGOs and individual churches but it tends to be undermined by what may be called “fire and brimstone” religiosity.

Some scholars have previously noted that telling youngsters that education will bring wealth and high social status is not realistic. We concur. Many of the children we saw in these classes clearly come from very poor families and are highly unlikely to make it past primary school, never mind enter college. Yet a repeated refrain by several trainers was along the lines of, ”if you get educated, you can become a pilot, lawyer or doctor, become an important person like me, travel the world, the sky’s the limit!” This isn’t helpful, and may raise false expectations that will soon be dashed, or leave some girls thinking that the ARP training doesn’t apply to them.

Curiously, the Board’s Guideline for Conducting an Alternative Rite of Passage pays little attention to the education component of ARP, but focuses largely on the final ceremony. It gives no detail of what a recommended curriculum might look like, but simply says the training should centre on sexual reproductive health and rights, and subsumes under this “life skills, awareness of sexual and gender-based violence, children’s rights and essential hygiene”. It adds, “Boys and girls are also taken through traditional values, customs and beliefs that positively impact their response to ARP.” This begs the question: but what if the community’s “cultural stakeholders” (who tend to be older men) favour an entirely different set of values and customs that contradict those of ARP? Moreover, a top-down directive from a national body aligned to government is the very opposite of community ownership, and does not augur well for community buy-in – especially in historically marginalised communities such as the Maasai and Samburu, where fear of and antagonism towards government is entrenched.

Views are divided on the use by some NGOs of shockingly graphic videos showing children, even babies, being cut. We believe these are abusive in themselves, and doubly abuse the children shown undergoing the cut. Community members in Kuria in 2015 declared after watching a video of a girl undergoing a very severe type of cut, “but we do not cut like that, our girls are back playing within two days”. Instead of convincing them to abandon FGM/C, the video seemed to reinforce their belief that the way they themselves perform the cut is not harmful. Some NGO staff defend the use of such videos in order to show the grim reality to children who may otherwise disbelieve it. Says Charles Leshore: “The videos bring reality and deep reflections on what FGM/C is, and its negative impact.”

What parts of the training seem to work best? The use of culturally-specific African proverbs went down well. So did the use of humour. So did lessons in West Pokot given by someone calling herself “Mrs Culture”, who spoke passionately about the blight of FGM/C on her own life; the girls loved her honesty and warmth. Lessons on children’s rights were informative about the constitution and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, but were contradicted by repetition of the exhortation to “obey your parents”. Interactive sessions on FGM/C facts and myths were also well received.

On the graduation ceremony: Many NGOs claim, amidst media fanfare, to have “saved” large numbers of girls from FGM/C, simply because they went through an ARP. The Anti-FGM Board itself claims, among its list of key achievements in 2011-14, to have “graduated 10,000 girls through ARP”, which implies that they were “saved”. But NGOs admit that some participating girls have already been cut, and that some girls also attend ARPs several times in succession. Why? Because they are fun events, where girls who may not have much freedom at home get the chance to hang out with their friends, dress up, sing and dance, and eat better food than they get at home. Some ARPs in Kuria have been dubbed “fattening camps” for that reason.

A top-down directive from a national body aligned to government is the very opposite of community ownership and does not augur well for community buy-in.

There are very odd elements in some ARP ceremonies, such as the cutting of a huge iced cake at one in Maasai country, and the presence of some Miss Tourisms in high heels and mini-skirts who were presented as role models for uncut girls. (With great respect to the people concerned, who were obviously sincere, what have scantily-clad beauty queens – which is what Miss Tourisms essentially are – got to do with ending FGM/C and offering realistic role models? Given the widely-held myth that uncut girls are more promiscuous than cut girls, beauty queens in minis and heavy make-up seem to be entirely inappropriate role models.) The day often ends with a free meal, but it was notable, at several ARP ceremonies, that VIPs et al. were served superior refreshments to everyone else in a separate venue.

What relationship does all this have to traditional initiation rites? Very little. The ceremonies include “pick-and-mix notions of pastness, culture, social transformation and tradition . . . incorporated into a hybridised ritual”. Some scholars have questioned whether these rites are not in fact better understood as alternatives to rites of passage, or rites of delayed passage, for “girls who underwent the alternative rites of passage did not feel themselves to be women, nor were they considered women by others”. Some may argue that all this is fine, that the means justify the ends. It would be fine if there was any evidence that they did, if these high-cost events were sustainable, and if there was proof that the whole community fully embraced and endorsed them. Thus far, robust evidence is lacking, and sadly, reports that some girls are still cut even after attending an ARP are common.

On ARP overall: ARP can be highly divisive. The selection processes for girls frequently lack transparency and fail to reach out-of-school girls who are most at risk, and most likely to benefit from engagement. Reports are common of priority being given to the daughters of community leaders. Moreover, the girls are often from one or two schools rather than from across the whole community. From an NGO’s point of view, it is far easier logistically to work with a few schools, and with families whose girls are in school, and who (in some cases) have already decided not to cut their daughters.

In its introduction to the 2018 Guideline, the Board recognises that “such alternative rites were neither accepted by the communities where they were conducted nor held for uncut girls only”. The intention of the Guideline is to ensure “community involvement in the planning and execution of alternative rites of passage, reduce undue costs, give more meaning to the alternative rituals and hold the communities together in the eradication of female genital mutilation”. These intentions highlight some of the significant shortcomings of ARP. Apart from those already mentioned, they also include the fact that ARP tends to be delivered to communities, rather than developed and implemented by them. The external funding often far exceeds what communities could raise themselves, once external funding ends. Such a model is therefore unsustainable. Furthermore, the alternative rituals – though they include traditional elements such as elders’ blessings – are usually newly created and unfamiliar to younger generations and community elders alike.

There are contradictions within the Guideline. In the Foreword, Board chair Agnes Pareiyo states that the aim of ARP is to maintain all traditional culture with the exception of the cut. However, culture is not static (as the March 2021 ruling in the Tatu Kamau legal case made clear), but is an evolving tapestry of beliefs and attitudes linking different aspects of community life. FGM/C is one aspect of culture, which is closely linked to the status, identity, role and life opportunities of girls and women. Abandoning FGM/C needs to be more than just replacing the act of cutting with another ritual. The community awareness and empowerment programme which precedes the ARP ceremony needs to reflect the aspirations of the community, with a strong emphasis on the role and life opportunities of girls and women.

Secondly, there is a contradiction between the attempt on the one hand to harmonise and standardise ARPs by suggesting a set of criteria to be met and steps to follow, while on the other hand encouraging communities to develop and own the process. The Guideline lists things which communities should lead on, but all within a prescriptive framework. This drive for consistency contradicts the guiding principle of being community-led, and is likely to increase the feeling that ARP is externally driven, rather than community owned.

They are fun events, where girls who may not have much freedom at home get the chance to hang out with their friends, dress up, sing and dance, and eat better food than they get at home.

The Guideline recognises ARP as “not a standalone approach but a product of community dialogue and school engagements”. This statement in itself highlights one of the key challenges, namely that the ARP ceremony is seen as the vehicle of change, that somehow the ceremony itself changes beliefs, attitudes and opinions in relation to FGM/C. In section 3.9 the Guideline talks about “a productive ARP that delivers the desired change not only to the girls but also to the community”. There is no evidence that the ARP ceremony itself actually brings about change. At best, the ceremony is a means of consolidating, celebrating and communicating change that has previously taken place as a result of education, awareness-raising and community dialogue. As Seleyian Partoip, Founder of Murua Girl Child Education Program, told us, “We see the ARP ceremony as a way of reducing the stigma against the girls who have not been cut. If we can reduce this stigma then maybe more families will make the move to not cutting their daughters.”

The Guideline describes how the community and its leadership needs to be “fully mobilised” and that this process “may take at least six months” prior to an ARP. It usefully lists community dialogue, capacity building, school outreach programmes and cultural learning and exchange as means of community mobilisation. However, it implies that this process is quite straightforward, whereas in reality this is where the real challenge lies, in encouraging dialogue about the harmful effects of FGM/C and supporting the community in taking the decision to abandon it.

When is ARP likely to be most effective?

The activities which appear to result in attitudinal change in relation to FGM/C are those which take place in communities, regardless of whether the community holds an ARP ceremony. They include awareness-raising and intergenerational dialogue on the direct and indirect impact of FGM/C, the associated sanction and benefits imposed by the community and the links to girls’ education, child marriage, etc. Equally important is the active engagement of the youth in discussing their own aspirations for their future. As Christine Alfons told us, “We are the youth, leading change in our community. The whole community needs to be empowered and mobilised on why to abandon the cutting, as girls alone can’t manage to say no to FGM. And one change needs to lead to others about the roles of men and women in our society.”

Some community organisations in Kenya have developed alternative models of ARP which are proving to be more effective than the model that we, and others, have critiqued. The new models have incorporated some of these features: a steering/planning committee that consists primarily of community members greater involvement of youth in the development, implementation and evaluation of the ARP model; community engagement throughout the year which is holistic, based on dialogue rather than instruction, and involves the whole community; the education/mobilisation programme has a consistent message of empowered decision-making, rather than obedience, and redefines the role, status and life opportunities of girls and women, irrespective of whether they are cut; the ARP ceremony is not introduced until there is sound evidence of change towards the abandonment of FGM/C within the community; resourcing for the ARP ceremony comes from within the community, using resources which would have been used for the traditional cut.

Given the lack of evidence that ARP actually works, more longer-term evaluation and research is needed. The Anti-FGM Board is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of ARPs in Kenya, and its Guideline includes a framework for this. Board representatives often attend ARP ceremonies. In the light of reports of girls still being cut after participating in an ARP, and priority given to girls from more privileged backgrounds, it would be useful if the Board collected and published data on these and other issues.

ARP is being overused in contexts where it is unlikely to succeed, but may be useful in specific contexts when it is community driven and where the community is already changing, and where plenty of mobilisation has already taken place. Most scholars and practitioners agree that community ownership of the process of ending FGM/C is vital to achieving this goal. It follows that ARP should be community owned too, if it is to be continued at all as an anti-FGM/C strategy. Ideally, ARP should be totally community-run without outside intervention; only then will it be sustainable.

Above all, young people themselves need to be more involved in this process. With donor funding being slashed as a result of COVID-19, and the cutting of overseas aid budgets such as that of the UK, the pressure for “magic bullet/quick fix” solutions increases. Reducing gender-based violence, including FGM/C, is likely to remain a priority in the current global climate; however, with reduced budgets it is even more important to ensure funds are spent wisely and approaches like ARP are robustly evaluated and applied only where there is evidence of effectiveness.",2021-04-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['representative', 'choice', 'community', 'kenya', 'arp', 'fgmc', 'ceremony', 'communities', 'ngos', 'female', 'jsc', 'cut', 'girls', 'training', 'lsk', 'crucial']",Kenya,news article,English

There's a lot to play for in AFC Cup as the big names take to the field on Tuesday and Wednesday...

Asia's secondary club competition is about to witness yet another vital round of matches in the South, Central, East and ASEAN Zones on Tuesday and Wednesday. While several groups will see matchday five, some are only in their third round of matches. As such, let's take a peek at what awaits us in the coming days.

GROUP D (CENTRAL ZONE)

Dordoi FC (KGZ) v Altyn Asyr (TKM): Kyrgyz Republic's Dordoi FC will have nothing but a win on their minds when they host Turkmenistan's Altyn Asyr on Tuesday in Bishkek. Dordoi will be pumped up after defeating FC Alay 1-0 in the previous round, which has propelled them to three points, one below joint-leaders Istiklol and Altyn Asyr. As such a win could see them stake claim to progress from this round.

Altyn Asyr might be the fancied side in this tie but after a listless draw against FC Istiklol in the previous round, they have to get going from the outset. A win will be the bare minimum they will want too.

Venue: Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, Bishkek

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+6

AFC Cup: West Zone preview

FC Istiklol (TJK) v FC Alay (KGZ): Tajikistan's FC Istiklol host bottom-placed side FC Alay on Tuesday, looking to surge clear at the top of the table. Though Istiklol played out a 1-1 draw against Altyn Asyr in the last round, the 2015 runners-up are the favourites to gain all three points against a struggling FC Alay who are yet to notch a point in the tournament.

There are some scares for the teams with Istiklol without the suspended Romish Dzhalilov while FC Alay do not have the services of Murolimzhon Akhmedov for the same reason. Will FC Alay pull off a surprise? We'll have to wait and watch.

Venue: Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, Bishkek

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+6

GROUP E (SOUTH ZONE)

Bengaluru FC (IND) v Abahani Limited Dhaka (BAN): Last year's runners-up Bengaluru FC have the perfect opportunity to extend their lead atop Group E when they host Bangladesh's Abahani Limited Dhaka on Tuesday. After downing Mohun Bagan in the opening round, they had to rely on an injury-time goal to overcome Maziya S&RC in Maldives in the previous round. They had a good outing domestically as well over the weekend and will be buoyed as a result as they take on Abahani.

The Bangladeshi team, however, are without a point after two back-to-back defeats in the tournament. They could fall well beyond having any realistic chances of progression if they lose against Bengaluru.

Venue: Sree Kanteerava Stadium, Bangalore

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+5:30

Know Bengaluru's Rivals: Abahani Ltd

Mohun Bagan (IND) v Maziya Sports & Recreation (MDV): Mohun Bagan host Maziya S&RC in Kolkata on Tuesday in a crucial Group E encounter. Both teams have a win in their kitty and have three points each. As a result, an adverse result or a draw could see them fall off the pace with Bengaluru poised to move further forward, barring an upset against Abahani.

Mohun Bagan have been winning games domestically without playing at their best and are chasing the I-League title. As such, their attention could be towards the domestic league which is something Maziya will look to exploit. This should be a tight game.

Venue: Rabindra Sarobar Stadium, Kolkata

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+5:30

GROUP F (ASEAN ZONE)

Magwe (MYA) v Global FC (PHI): Philippine side Global FC stormed to the top of the table in the last round with a victory over Johor Darul Ta'zim and now they are in a position where they can be assured of a top-two finish with a point against Myanmar's Global FC who are placed bottom in the group. Global FC have nine points from four games and have been quietly impressive in the group so far. A win will put them in pole position to secure a win with just one more game remaining.

Magwe, meanwhile, will know that anything less than a win will see them crash out of the tournament. With just two draws so far in their kitty, they are not expected to put up much fight on Wednesday.

Venue: Youth Training Centre, Yangon

Kick-off: April 19, 15:30 UTC+6:30

Beoungket Angkor (CAM) v Johor Darul Ta’zim (MAS): Johor Darul Ta'zim will be desperate to get back to winning ways when they travel to Cambodia to take on Beoungket Angkor FC on Wednesday. Having been outsmarted by Global FC in the previous round, Johor need to win this tie. A Johor loss coupled with a win for Global would see the Philippine side win the group. Johor have been really inconsistent in the tournament so far and need to step up.

The Cambodians have four points from four fixtures and a surprise win against JDT will see them draw level with the Malaysian side but a loss will see them crash out. Anything can happen but for this game, JDT are the favourites.

Venue: National Olympic Stadium, Phnom Penh

Kick-off: April 19, 18:00 UTC+7

GROUP G (ASEAN ZONE)

Ceres Negros (PHI) v Hanoi FC (VIE): Group G is extremely compact at the top with just three points separating the top three teams. As such, surprise leaders Hanoi FC, who have eight points, will be looking to pull clear when they face Philippine side Ceres Negros who were defeated 3-0 by Felda United in the previous round. Hanoi can guarantee themselves the top spot with a win and a little help from Tampines Rovers against Felda United.

Ceres Negros will welcome back Manuel Ott from suspension but are without Martin Steuble as they look to mastermind a victory that will take them level on points with Hanoi. This round will be extremely important for the final outcome in the group.

Venue: Pana-ad Park and Football Stadium, Bacolod City

Kick-off: April 19, 19:30 UTC+8

Felda United (MAS) v Tampines Rovers (SIN): A rejuvenated Felda United are up against a struggling Tampines Rovers on Wednesday as they look to make up ground on group leaders Hanoi FC. Felda had just two points after the initial three rounds but a morale-boosting 3-0 win over Ceres Negros has put them back in the reckoning for progression from the group. But they need a positive result in this game.

Singapore's Tampines Rovers have just the three points to show for their efforts so far and were crippled by back-to-back defeats inflicted on them by Hanoi FC. Felda are the favourites on form but Tampines Rovers cannot be written off yet.

Venue: Tun Abdul Razak Stadium, Jengka

Kick-off: April 19, 20:45 UTC+8

GROUP H (ASEAN ZONE)

Home United (SIN) v Yadanarbon (MYA): Singapore's Home United are in pole position to win the three-team Group I, provided they defeat Myanmar's Yadanarbon on Tuesday. Having registered back-to-back wins over Than Quang Ninh after an opening round defeat to Yadanarbon, Home United sit atop the group with six points from three games while Yadanarbon have four points from two games.

The away team badly need a draw or a win even though they have another game against Than Quang Ninh and will draw inspiration from their opening game victory against the side from Singapore.

Venue: Jalan Besar Stadium, Singapore

Kick-off: April 18, 19:30, UTC+8

Fans' Asian Player of the week

GROUP I (EAST ZONE)

4.25 SC (PRK) v Kigwancha SC (PRK): It's a Pyongyang derby for the first time in the AFC Cup as 4.25 SC host Kigwancha SC in Group I on Tuesday. Having played a game each, both against Mongolian side Erchim FC, the two teams are joint top of the three-team group with a win each. 4.25 SC had the most sparkling of the wins - a 6-0 spanking at home with Kim Yu-song scoring an astounding five goals.

Kigwancha SC, on the other hand, hammered Erchim 3-0 away. As such, this game could very well have a big say in deciding the Group I winners. These two teams should unleash be a fascinating spectacle in Pyongyang.

Hue, Vietnam  Every day for the last four months, Duong Thi Mong has carried food, pots, dishes and other utensils on her shoulders to walk nearly 5 kilometers daily from her house to a nearby village, where she serves com hen (rice mixed with mussel, a popular traditional dish) to local people on streets of Thua Thien Hue province. Mong, a Buddhist from Hue's Vi Da ward in central Vietnam, which is famous for its mussels, said she usually takes her boat to carry food over the Huong River then walks only 600 meters to her destination. However, her boat was wiped out in severe flooding after six tropical storms hit the central provinces in October and November. The 56-year-old mother of two said she earns 80,000 to 100,000 dong ($3.50 to $4.30) per day to support her family, not enough money to buy a new boat. She said she had to work harder and sell food at night to get money to prepare food for the celebration of Tet, or Lunar New Year. Local markets closed for the weeklong traditional festival Feb. 10 ahead of the New Year, which starts Feb. 12. Thankfully, sisters across Vietnam have stepped in to help Mong and others like her.

""I am excited for the nuns who offered me 10 million dong [$435] on Jan. 28. I will use the money to buy a new boat for my work soon,"" Mong said cheerfully, adding that the boat is really a lifeboat that will help save her energy so she can work longer and earn more money to put food on the table. Sr. Maria Truong Thi Minh Yen of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate said her community provided boats for 12 people who lost their boats during the severe floods that left many people nothing in their wake. Yen, who serves Tan Thuy Parish, said she called on benefactors for donations. ""We do want to provide local flood victims with longer-term help so that they can stand on their own feet and return to normal life soon,"" she said. Many victims do not have enough money to be able to purchase basic means of doing their jobs. The 69-year-old nun said her convent gives clothes, blankets, rice and medicine to more than 100 street people, migrants, boat people and slum dwellers on a regular basis. Many live in makeshift shelters while others stay in low-rent, stuffy lodgings as their properties were washed away by flooding. ""They have suffered much from the last natural disasters and the chilly weather this year,"" Yen said. The temperature fell to 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January in the tropical area.

""We plan to offer them necessary finance to do small business, buy tricycles, and raise cattle and poultry for a living,"" she said, adding that students will be given school things while those with health problems will be provided with free treatment. Yen, member of the Hue Archdiocese's committee representing local women religious orders, said some local congregations have built and repaired 40 victims' homes at a total cost of 1 billion dong ($43,000). Luong The Thien from Phu Hiep ward said he built a new house in January after he received 65 million dong from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. His old 40-square-meter house was damaged in the floods. Thien, a 54-year-old Buddhist, said he could not afford to rebuild his house as he works as a motorbike taxi driver to support his wife, who has lung cancer, and three children. ""We are happy to celebrate the Tet festival in the dream house. We are extremely grateful for the nuns' generous help that benefits our life long-term,"" he said, adding that according to tradition, people cannot be well-established in their careers until they have stable homes.

Thien said he has had a good relationship with the nuns since he took a nun from a local hospital to her convent in 2008. The nuns regularly visit his family, and his children receive a monthly scholarship from them. Nguyen The Thieu, a Buddhist from Cau Nhi village, said he is among seven local families who received money to repair their storm-damaged houses. His Catholic son-in-law introduced him to the nuns. ""We have received humanitarian aid seven times from sisters and Catholic benefactors, and we gradually overcame the hard times,"" the 78-year-old father of four said. Sr. Maria Nguyen Thi Hong of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Visitation, who serves Nam Dong Parish, said the nuns offer 60 local ethnic Co Tu and Kinh families money to buy pigs and chicken to raise and fertilizers to cultivate their crops. Local people lost all their crops, poultry and cattle during the floods and now have to collect firewood and bamboo shoots for a living. On Jan. 23, the nuns provided bicycles for 23 students in Nam Dong Parish who walk 5 kilometers to school.

The Gunners striker is hoping his side can qualify for the Champions League and end their English top-flight title drought this term

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang believed Arsenal’s aim in the 2019-20 season will be to qualify for the Uefa Champion League and challenge for the Premier League title.

The Gunners have failed to win the English top-flight trophy since 2004 and only managed to clinch a Uefa Europa League ticket last season after finishing fifth on the table.

Aubameyang, who has scored two goals in the Gunners’ opening two games, has revealed his side’s target for the season.

“I think as I said earlier we have made good signings that will help us,” Aubameyang told Canal Plus, as per the Metro.

“Last season, we were not far away from qualifying for the Champions’ League. Whatever happens, that is the most important thing, the most important aim for us; to be back in the Champions League.

“Aside from that, to fight for the title, we know very well that the big guns are ready but we are also ready and in any case we are going to give our all to match the big guns if possible.”

Aubameyang was the Premier League joint-top scorer with 22 goals last season, along with Liverpool duo of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.

The Gabon international will be hoping to propel the Gunners for their first Premier League title in 15 years.",2019-08-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['target', 'uefa', 'aubameyang', 'arsenal', 'title', 'pierreemerick', 'topflight', 'sets', 'gunners', 'champions', '201920', 'league', 'premier', 'season']",Ghana,news article,English
18,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Economic Milestone: Devaluation Of The Rupee (1966) - Forbes India,https://www.forbesindia.com/article/independence-day-special/economic-milestone-devaluation-of-the-rupee-(1966)/38407/1,"Image: Getty Images Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s move became very unpopular

On June 6, 1966, in one fell swoop, the Indira Gandhi government devalued the Indian rupee by 57 percent, from Rs 4.76 to Rs 7.50 to a dollar, triggering bitter criticism in the Parliament and media. The people, too, joined in claiming that this was the ultimate “sell-out to America and the World Bank”.



The move, however, was in the offing for some time. Since Independence, India had held the dollar constant at Rs 4.76 in spite of increased trade deficits and a reliance on foreign aid to maintain a constant valuation. The final straw was the wars India fought (with China and Pakistan) and the shock of a major drought in 1965-1966. Each instance increased deficit spending, further accelerating the already severe inflation. Besides, the World Bank, largely funded by the US, fell short of its promised aid inflows to India.



Even though PM Indira Gandhi took all the flak for the move, her predecessor Lal Bahadur Shastri (who died of a cardiac arrest during his trip to Tashkent in early 1966) had set the stage for it. According to former diplomat BK Nehru’s account (in his book Nice Guys Finish Second), Shastri is also said to have “eased out” his finance minister the previous year for opposing this devaluation.



The Indian government took the step to counter soaring inflation, but it turned out to be very unpopular and laid the foundation for distrust between the people and the government. The devaluation had its ramifications abroad as well; Oman, Qatar and the UAE, countries which used the Gulf Rupee (issued by the RBI), were forced to come up with their own currencies.



According to Rohit Lamba, post-doctoral fellow at Cambridge-INET at the faculty of economics, University of Cambridge, “Strictly speaking, public perception/reception should not matter for macroeconomic policy. History remembers politicians and policymakers who do the unpopular but economically sound. However, no policy decision is or should be devoid of the politics of it, especially in a democracy. With the state of affairs as they were in 1966, the devaluation was unavoidable. We can argue how we got into that state but that is another debate.”

There is light at the end of the tunnel-- Vinod Singh and his 11 colleagues lived this reality on Sunday.

Singh (33), a welder, was the first one to be rescued from one of the two blocked tunnels. A video where he is seen wriggling out of the tunnel, overwhelmed, chanting slogans in ode to the famous Badrinath temple, has since gone viral. The video was shot by the ITBP (Indo Tibetan Border Police).

Mr. Singh, a resident of Joshimath recalled the seven gruelling hours he spent in the tunnel with his colleagues, till they were rescued by a team of ITBP personnel.

“The tunnel that is four-metre high was covered in a mix of debris and water for up to three metres. We managed to catch hold of the iron railing above and clung to it for our lives, we were exhausted. Sometimes we changed hands or tried to catch hold of the tunnel’s wall to remain alive,” he said on phone from the ITBP’s hospital in Joshimath.

Faint network on phone

Mr. Singh said it was a faint network on his phone that saved them.

“We managed to drag ourselves up to 350 metres to the end of the tunnel, where we saw some light. We decided to stay put there as we could get oxygen through that small hole. I noticed that my BSNL phone had network. I first called my office manager and then my brother. I told my brother to stay calm and send help,” he said.

An ITBP team, deployed 15 km away was rushed to the tunnel and they began the excavation work around 10.30 am. The tunnel was used to dispose waste water from the power project.

“It was a battle for life, the tunnel was full of wet debris and we could not possibly step down. We were cold and our clothes were soiled. There was no option before us but to hang on. The patience finally paid off. I was the first one to be rescued around 6 p.m.,” he said, adding that he had been working at the project for the past one and a half years. His joint family comprises his wife, son, mother and brother’s family.

He said there were no warning signs. “Suddenly there was a strange sound and slush started filling the tunnel….soon there was complete darkness. We got no time to react,” he recalled.

906,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Flooding as a disaster waiting to happen - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/flooding-as-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen/,"The rains are here again. Rather than being a blessing, the rains have become a curse to many Nigerians, especially to coastal states and communities living along the bank of Rivers Niger and Benue. The federal government has issued a flood alert. Will the 2021 predictions go the way of others? TONY AKOWE reports

Since the devastating flood in Nigeria in 2012, it has become important for the government and its agency to make an annual forecast of possible flood and its impact in the country annually. Since the first forecast was made in 2013, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, working with other government agencies, has consistently warned the nation of impending flood across the country and in most cases, the intensity of such flood. Unfortunately, warnings by the agencies have often been ignored by both the people and state governments and their agencies. This year, the government has said not less than 121 local government areas across 28 states are at highly probable risk of heavy flooding, while another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will experience some level of flooding.

Flooding is categorised into river flooding, coastal flooding as well as flash and urban flooding occasioned by poor drainages, blocked drainages and poor adherence to town planning regulations.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) said flooding accounts for 15% of all natural disaster related deaths across the globe.

Floods have since become annual phenomena not only in flood plains, but also in urban and semi-urban areas. Experts link urban flooding to inadequacies of drainage channels that have become too small to contain excess runoff, the use of river channels as waste repositories thus clogging the channels, poor compliance with or non-existence of land use zoning/building codes, poor waste management practices, and removal of vegetation that create resistance and minimise flood impact. Coastal areas of Nigeria are not spared from flooding as they may be worst hit by flood this year. Interestingly, more states in Nigeria are increasingly suffering from annual flooding due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Unfortunately, Nigeria is located downstream of Rivers Niger and Benue, and therefore abounds with water resources that become a menace by causing flooding and flood disasters, the worst of which was experience in 2012 when hundreds of lives were lost, thousands of citizens rendered homeless with property loss running into billions of naira including massive farm lands and crops when water was released from the a dam in Cameroon.

A close study of the predictions revealed that all the 20 local government areas in Lagos State (as against 18 in 2020) are likely to be affected with eight of them being at higher risk of heavy flooding. Apart from urban and river flooding, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Delta and Ondo states stand the risk of heavy coastal flooding. In 2020, similar predictions by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency and advice to states and local government areas to take precautionary measure to mitigate the flood fell on deaf ears in most parts of the country. The consequence was the displacement of over 2.3 million people and the death of 69 others. The outcome was also the washing away of farm lands in Kebbi and Jigawa as well as livestock and other valuables. The agency has continuously expressed concern over disregard for town planning regulations leading to people building on flood plains.

Minister for Water Resources Suleiman Adamu, who announced the 2021 prediction on behalf of the agency, said 121 local government areas in 28 states and the FCT as well as another 302 local government areas across the 36 states and the FCT will likely experience high and moderate flooding in 2021. Acting on information from the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, the minister also said there would be heavy coastal flooding in Rivers, Cross Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states. He stressed the need for concerted efforts to mitigate the impact of the expected flood.

He said: So far, the flood levels will be higher than in previous years, but will not attain the levels of the 2012 devastating floods. In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 LGAs in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will fall within the moderate probable Flood Risk Areas. It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the Highly Probable Risk Areas. The states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience river flooding. These states and the number of local government likely to be affected include Abia (9), Akwa Ibom (2), Anambra (5), Bauchi (2), Bayelsa (5), Benue (3), Cross River (2), Delta (8), Ebonyi (4), Edo (1), FCT (2), Gombe (7), Imo (3), Jigawa (9), Kaduna (2), Kano (2), Kebbi (4), Kogi (9), Kwara (2), Lagos (8), Nasarawa (2), Niger (5), Ogun (3), Oyo (7), Rivers (12), Sokoto (7), Taraba (7) and Zamfara (1).

The list of states to be affected by one form of flood or the other in 2021 show that northern and coastal states are at a greater risk of flooding this year, with some states along the River Niger and Benue are also likely to be affected. Adamu said flash and urban floods from heavy inundation were predicted to occur in some major cities, the severity of which would depend on the availability and adequacy of the drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.

He said: The information contained in the AFO 2021 is a Clarion call to all stakeholders, policy makers, Federal, States and Local Governments, Departments and Agencies to rise and set up appropriate mechanism such as clearing the waterways and flood paths as well as maintaining proper water disposal management practices to curtail the ravages of the impending flood and threats of COVID-19. The year 2012 is a landmark in the annals of flood occurrence in Nigeria. It brought with it massive destruction of lives, property and critical national infrastructure. The need arose therefore, to put in place a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront the menace of this disaster of flooding, hence the coming into being of APO in the year 2013. The 2021 Annual Flood Outlook built on the successes of the previous eight (8) years forecasts by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency. The outcomes of these forecasts have been the increased awareness by the citizenry with respect to measures that need to be taken before, during and after floods. This has culminated in the progressive reduction in the severity of flood and its harmful effects on lives and property. The timeliness in the release of these forecasts is quite commendable and deserving of every possible support by all of us.

He believed that mans interaction with natural process has been both helpful and harmful to some degree, adding that the negative impact of mans activities can be observed in the heightened climate change being experienced globally by way of rising temperatures, intensified rainfall, more destructive storms and floods. He maintained that the annual prediction by the agency is designed to create awareness of the inherent dangers of flooding and to inform people about locations that are prone to Flood risk at a particular time and encourage them to take appropriate actions.

Drawing attention to the 2020 experience, the minister said: The year 2020 saw the devastating impact of extreme flood across the country with practically every state of the federation affected in one way or the other. The flood affected 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 349 Local Government Areas (LGAs) within the 36 States were affected and over 2,353,647 people were displaced with a record of 69 deaths. Kebbi and Jigawa States were worst hit with regards to agricultural lands and houses destroyed. Apart from the physical damages, other indirect losses are often overlooked. These indirect and intangible impacts are generally associated with disruption to normal life as well as long term health issues and stress-related illnesses. We must recognise that extreme weather and flooding extents do happen and that we need to be well equipped to respond to them. I am confident that our communities, infrastructure and businesses will be better protected if due attention is given to the information contained in this 9th edition of the Annual Flood Outlook.

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs. Didi Walson-Jack, said: The overall objective of this event is to sensitise the nation (i.e planners, decision and policy makers, farmers, stakeholders) and the general public towards embarking on preventive measures to improve on safety and reduce potential damages to lives and property from predicted flood events.

She said the event was expected to provide ample opportunity for enlightenment campaigns in the media for better Preparedness on flood mitigation, control and management in flood risks locations across the country. She maintained that the accuracy of the predictions over the years have been fairly high and reliable, stressing however that the focus is rather on prevention and mitigation of possible flood disasters by increasing the awareness of the populace and prompting them to take appropriate preventive, adaptive and mitigative measures.

The Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd), stressed the need to strengthen multi-agency approach to disaster risk reduction in the country.

Mohammed said: To enhance flood forecasting and management in Nigeria, NEMA is currently supporting NIHSA in establishing three Automatic Weather Observation Stations which are at various stages of installation located in Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti and Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. These stations will be used not only for hydrological predictions but also to train students in the field of Geography, Engineering, Agriculture, meteorology, climate change and other sciences. He said further that one of the lessons learnt during the 2020 flood after action review meeting is the need for proper utilization of our dams in the country. When dams meant for irrigation purpose are used for dry season agriculture, they acquire more capacities to hold more water in the rainy season. In addition, a timely controlled release of water from dams will reduce panic release of water during rainy season that can lead to further flooding.

The Director-General of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze said government at all levels in the country must take necessary steps to avert a possible disastrous effect of flood in 2021. Nze said as the rains begin to set in, the country was gradually inching towards the peak of rainy season with its attendant flood incidents. He said Nigerias geographical location downstream of all the countries in the Niger Basin places it at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollution from all countries upstream, adding that this explain why persistent flooding has become an annual event since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster.

He argued that the annual flood forecast was to enable states and local government as well as individuals take concrete steps now to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past few years including clearing of blocked drainages and canals, removal of refuse, weeds, water hyacinth and floats on water channels. People living along water ways as well as those having socio-economic activities in such areas should be encouraged to relocate o safer areas before the peak of rains, while there should also be an improved system for flood monitoring, flood forecasting and early warnings. He stressed that states must intensify soil conservation measuring techniques on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and encourage ecosystem protection, while also enhancing the enforcement of town planning code to allow for the construction of houses and drainage structures.

He said further that while it was not possible to eradicate flooding, efforts should be made to either reduce or minimise it, adding that state governments must educate their people, insisting that states must make efforts to avoid a repeat of the incidences of 2020 which saw over 450,000 hectare of rice plantation being washed away in Kebbi state alone as a result of flooding. Nzeh lamented that while the agency has continued to give early warning signs, many states in the country have failed to listen to the recommendations of the agency, adding that at the moment, Jigawa state has set up a committee that is working to reduce incidences of flooding in the state in line with recommendations from the agency.

The NIHSAs Director of Hydrogeophysics, Stephen Margima Jabo, said flooding has become a global phenomenon that has increased in frequency over the years. According to him, the effective management of flood risk should be a collective responsibility of all stakeholders from the federal, state, and local to individual levels, adding that the existing synergy between Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, stakeholders and other collaborative agencies involved in flood management and disaster issues should be further strengthened. He said government at all level should also put in place measures for better town planning and effective land use zoning, effective flood disaster management in the changing environment, improved biodiversity and ecosystem management for the enhancement of rapid and sustainable development in the country. States, he said should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers particularly, where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood waters will not be lost to the sea.

The agency said among others that stakeholders in the water sector should carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas by the removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers to improve their conveyance capacities and from dams, lakes and reservoirs to increase their storage capacities for the containment of the incoming floodwaters; there is need for construction of weirs, small reservoirs on tributary, streams and rivers for conservation of flood water to be used during the dry season thereby preventing desert encroachment, increasing irrigation food crop production, improvement of grassland areas, nomadic settlement, peace and sustainable development by relevant government agencies; intensification of soil conservation measuring technics on the drainage areas to reduce soil erosion and increase ecosystem protection among others; enforcement of Town Planning Codes in the country to allow for the appropriate construction of houses, and drainage structures and constantly freeing the waterways from obstructions and provision of adequate refuse dumping facilities by relevant authorities.",2021-05-11 00:15:10+00:00,"['water', 'flooding', 'happen', 'local', 'flood', 'waiting', 'states', 'disaster', 'nigeria', 'agency', 'country', 'state', 'areas']",Nigeria,news article,English

Based on data from Kenya Red Cross staff and volunteers a total of 14,083HHs (approx. 84,367 people) have been affected, 21 deaths reported with 2 others injured. The number of displaced households is currently estimated at 6,000HHs. In addition, 531 acres of farmland have been destroyed and 21,675 livestock have been washed away. Assessments are continuously ongoing with a possibility of a significant increase in the number of affected populations. (IFRC, 29 Oct 2019)

Heavy rainfall in many regions of Kenya since the start of the short rains season in early October has led to riverine and flash floods, rock falls, mudslides and landslides. More than 101,000 people have been affected, mainly in the north-eastern, central, and coastal regions, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). The KRCS has confirmed that at least 14,000 people have been displaced who were living in low-lying areas where rivers have burst their banks. At least 29 flood-related deaths have been reported and the death toll and number of people displaced is expected to rise in the days ahead as further information is received and verified from affected areas.(OCHA, 30 Oct 2019)

43,000 people have been affected in Wajir County (north-east Kenya) and the number of flood-related deaths has increased to 29. Approximately 36,000 people have been displaced, more than 101,000 affected, 52 schools and 14 facilities are inaccessible. Roads are flooded and two bridges damaged, including the main bridge linking Tanzania and Kenya. (ECHO, 31 Oct 2019.)

More than 144,000 people in 25 counties across the country are estimated to be affected by riverine and flash floods, rock falls, mudslides and landslides, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). The Governmentâ??s National Disaster Operation Centre (NDOC) also confirmed that at least 17,000 people have been displaced and 48 died due to the floods. With the current weather forecasts, which predicts heavy rains until the end of November, the NDOC expects these numbers to rise, including affecting 200,000 refugees living in settlements in Dadaab.

Kenya Red Cross teams in various parts of the country are supporting the evacuation of families to safer areas. Working alongside the Government of Kenya, Red Cross teams are delivering emergency relief items and essential supplies like household and sanitation items in evacuation centres hosting those who have been displaced by the flooding. Areas affected by flooding so far include Marsabit, Wajir, Mandera, Tana River, Turkana, Elgeiyo Marakwet, Kitui, Meru, Kajiado, Nandi, Kwale, Garissa, Muranga and Busia. (IFRC, 25 Nov 2019)

Heavy rain has been affecting western Kenya, triggering landslides that have resulted in casualties and widespread damage. As of 26 November, at least 52 fatalities after major landslides occurred on 24 November in Tapach, Weiwei and Batei Wards Villages (West Pokot County). Around 45 people are reportedly still missing (ECHO, 26 Nov 2019.)

More than 160,000 people, including nearly 18,000 who are displaced countrywide, have been affected by floods or landslides since the onset of the short rains in October, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). At least 120 people have reportedly died, including 72 people who lost their lives after a landslide buried their houses in West Pokot County in northwestern Kenya, according to the Government. Infrastructure of undetermined value, including roads and bridges, have been damaged, hampering effective humanitarian response efforts in affected areas (OCHA, 27 Nov 2019.)

UNICEF has sent supplies in response to the heavy rains and floods experienced in Kenya since mid-October, bringing relief to around 130,000 affected people. According to the Government spokesman, 330,000 people have been affected, 17,000 displaced and 132 died, due to floods and landslides. Damage to essential infrastructure including roads, schools and health facilities has disrupted access to critical services for children and families. (UNICEF, 4 Dec 2019)

From October to December, Kenya experienced one of the wettest short rains seasons on record, with rainfall totals ranging up to 400 percent of average. A second round of floods and landslides in November caused the death of 132 people, displaced 17,000 people, and affected approximately 330,000 people, primarily in West Pokot.

Flash floods triggered by heavy rains swept through a village in Lao Cai Province early Saturday, killing two people and leaving another missing.

The sudden flood at 2 a.m. brought down with it a large volume of rocks and soil as it hit the village in Minh Luong Commune, Van Ban District, damaging 25 houses and five hectares (12.35 acres) of crops.

""The entire scene is a mess with soil and rocks entering peoples houses, and we are still looking for the missing person,"" Quang Van Viet, deputy head of the Command for Natural Disaster Prevention and Search and Rescue of Lao Cai Province, said.

Lao Cai is home to the resort town of Sa Pa.

The flood also dumped hundreds of cubic meters of soil and rock on a 200-meter stretch of National Highway 279 in Minh Luong Commune, paralyzing traffic.

Lao Cai received heavy rains from late Friday to early Saturday due to a cold spell from the north.

The northern mountain provinces recorded rainfall of up to 100 mm on average, with the weather station in Lao Cai reporting 96.2 mm, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.",2021-04-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['flash', 'stretch', 'village', 'province', 'soil', 'van', 'kill', 'lao', 'floods', 'mountain', 'cai', 'rocks', 'rock', 'northern', 'national']",Vietnam,news article,English
386,Drought Sri Lanka,SL defy controversial call to stun Proteas - cricket.com.au,https://www.cricket.com.au/news/match-report/south-africa-sri-lanka-highlights-match-report-temba-bavuma-run-out-hashim-amla-no-review/2019-02-14,"Bavuma's shocking luck as SL shine

The start of South Africa's first Test against Sri Lanka was hit by confusion and controversy before a run had even been scored as the tourists took the honours on the opening day of the series.

Sri Lanka finished the day in Durban on 1-49 after their inexperienced bowling attack stunned the Proteas, bowling the hosts out for just 235.

The early controversy was sparked by the refusal of a Sri Lankan player review, which prevented the tourists from taking their second early wicket.

Hashim Amla was given not out by umpire Aleem Dar following an appeal for leg before wicket, two balls after left-arm opening bowler Vishwa Fernando had Dean Elgar caught behind in just the second over.

New Sri Lankan captain Dimuth Karunaratne conferred with Fernando and wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella and eventually signalled that he wanted a review.

But he was told he had taken too long and the decision was not sent to television umpire Ian Gould. But an analysis by SuperSport television showed the total time between Dar turning down the appeal and Karunaratne asking for a review was 12 seconds, three seconds inside the allowable 15 seconds to ask for a review.

Replays showed the ball had pitched in line and would have hit the stumps, which would have resulted in the original decision being overturned if a review had been allowed.

The lapse was not costly as Amla made only three before he was caught at second slip off Suranga Lakmal for three in the sixth over.

And the Sri Lankans shook off the incident, seamer Fernando bagging four wickets for the day as the Proteas were bowled out in a spicy Kingsmead pitch.

Karunaratne (28no) and the attacking Oshada Fernando (17no) will resume on the second morning, hoping to lay the platform for a sizeable first-innings lead.

Sri Lanka opener Lahiru Thirimanne was their only wicket to fall, batting for close to half an hour before he was caught by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock for a duck off seamer Dale Steyn.

South Africa's innings was rescued to a degree by a fighting 80 from de Kock before he was the last man out, having at least taken his side past the 200 mark.

""We were a bit unaware of the new guys. I think they caught us off guard,"" said de Kock.

""We had good game plans against Suranga Lakmal, but the two new guys were unseen before. They bowled really well, they didn't miss their lengths often and they made us work hard for what we got.""

After winning the toss and electing to bowl, Sri Lanka had South Africa three wickets down with 17 runs on the board before Faf du Plessis (35) and Temba Bavuma (47) put on 72 for the fourth wicket to calm home nerves.

But the tourists continued to chip away at the wickets column despite a positive run-rate from the hosts.

Fernando (4-62) was impressive with the new ball as he had both openers Elgar (0) and Aiden Markram (11) back in the changing rooms early.

Bavuma showed good application before he was out in unfortunate circumstances, a straight drive from De Kock deflecting off the boot of bowler Fernando and onto the stumps with the batsman out of his crease.

Keshav Maharaj (29) put on 47 with De Kock but was caught by Dickwella off Fernando just before tea, with South Africa adding a potentially crucial 57 before being bowled out.",2019-02-14 08:00:00+00:00,"['controversial', 'proteas', 'fernando', 'stun', 'lanka', 'sri', 'caught', 'sl', 'south', 'defy', 'second', 'wickets', 'tourists', 'wicket', 'kock']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Reports indicate that at least 25 people have been killed due to the heavy rains including nine children who died after their house flooded in Banadir on 7 May, and four people killed by lightening in Puntland on 5 May. In Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms. FAO/SWALIM has warned of the imminent danger of potentially unprecedented flooding expected along the Shabelle river in the coming days and the concern for safety and wellbeing of the people in Belet Weyne and along the river. Reports from Jubaland indicate that the Juba river broke its bank in Doolow, reaching 4.70 metres, which is 0.20 metres above the moderate flooding level, flooding three villages. (OCHA, 9 May 2021)

The recent torrential rains across Somalia affected an estimated 166,000 people. While the rains have reduced in some areas, humanitarian partners are alarmed that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on 25 April and heavy rains last week causing riverine and flash flooding. The seven-day forecast ending 20 May indicates a dry spell is likely across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, which may lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding along the Shabelle and Juba rivers. Humanitarian partners are particularly concerned about areas where the risk of flooding remans, particularly in Belet Weyne in Hiiran region and Doolow in Jubaland where there remains a high-risk level of flooding as the water from Ethiopia highlands stream in. The flood wave from Belet Weyne will be transmitted to the middle and lower reaches towards the end of the week and therefore there is a moderate risk of flooding in these areas during this week. The situation could be further exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks, which is already causing floods in Jowhar.

Conflict and insecurity continue to be a primary driver of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes in Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Yemen and in greater Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile states of Sudan. Most recently, conflict in Tigray region of Ethiopia is causing high levels of population displacement, disrupting livelihood activities and market functioning, and limiting food assistance. In Yemen, intensified conflict in Marib is of increasing concern and a risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) persists. South Sudan also continues to experience one of the worst food insecurity emergencies globally and urgent food assistance is needed to save lives, especially in greater Jonglei and the greater Tonj in Warrap.

High and above-average staple food, fuel, and water prices continue to limit food access and compound the severity of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes in Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, and Somalia. In Sudan, millet and sorghum prices rose 600-650 percent above the five-year average in March across most markets. Similar trends are observed in South Sudan. In Ethiopia, maize prices in Addis Ababa rose to 100 percent above the five-year average and sorghum prices rose 50 percent above the five-year average in Woldia in Amhara region. In Yemen, although four fuel ships were permitted to deliver fuel to Al Hudaydah port in March, fuel shortages and upward pressure on food prices are expected to resume after 1-2 months. In central and northern Somalia, water scarcity has caused the price of a 20-liter jerrycan of water to double compared to 2020.

In bimodal areas of eastern Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia, delayed and significantly below-average rainfall in March is anticipated to result in a second consecutive season of below-average harvests and suppressed livestock production. The population in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse is likely to peak in these areas during the subsequent June to September dry season, as households’ access to food and income erodes amid concurrent conflict, price, and desert locust shocks. In unimodal areas of western Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Sudan, a forecast of above-average rainfall from June to September is likely to cause a consecutive year of flood-related displacement and crop and livestock losses. The population in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is also likely to peak in these areas during this period, which overlaps the local lean seasons.",2021-04-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['rises', 'ipc', 'fuel', 'food', 'price', 'message', 'phase', 'weather', 'wave', 'prices', 'crisis', 'south', 'sudan', 'shocks', 'key', 'yemen', 'update', 'ethiopia']",Somalia,news article,English

The record-breaking rains of August 27 resulted in a near-collapse of the citys infrastructure and exposed the lack of foresight, planning and governance that the metropolis has long suffered. But in order to address the issues, their complexities must first be understood





This monsoon season, Karachi flooded as never before. Streets were turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, landslides occurred in a number of places damaging vehicles and property, and over a hundred persons drowned or were electrocuted. The people of Karachi understand well that the causes of the problems of the city that they love so much are political and institutional and so are their solutions. However, the province and Islamabad, the antagonists in the Karachi situation, have yet to accept and express this.

It is generally believed that the reason for the flooding is encroachments by the residents of katchi abadis on the natural drainage system of the city and that the solution lies in removing these encroachments and the solid waste that has accumulated in the nullahs. However, the situation is far more complex than that, and has aggravated over a long period of time. This article tries to explain this complexity and the steps that have been taken in the past to address it and what, in technical terms, needs to be done now in a very changed situation.





A HISTORY OF DRAINAGE

As most Karachiites know, Karachis stormwater drains into two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other with a distance of between 14-20 kms in between. Forty-three stormwater drains (or nullahs), according to the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) documentation, and 64 according to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), carry the water of their huge catchment areas to them and over 600 smaller drains feed into these 64 nullahs. In addition, real estate has been built over thousands of even smaller nullahs.

Before independence, Karachis population was only 450,000. The city had a sewage system consisting mostly of underground earthenware pipes and it was treated through biological treatment at Gutter Baghicha located in the trans-Lyari area of the city between the Haroonabad drain and the Orangi nullah. The treated Effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. Gutter Baghicha, which covered an area of just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares), has been reduced to 480 acres (according to the NGO Shehri) due to illegal yet officially sanctioned settlements.

With partition and the arrival of about 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand and both formal and informal sector developments took place far away from Gutter Baghicha. The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns, Landhi-Korangi and New Karachi, at a distance of about 20 kilometres each from the then city. Sewage treatment plants were planned for these settlements and treated sewage was to be disposed; in the case of Landhi-Korangi, to the Korangi Creek and in the case of North Karachi, to Khawaja Ajmer Nagri nullah. However, these plants were never constructed and so untreated sewage is still disposed at these locations.

Because of an absence of a sustainable social housing policy, informal settlements developed along the nullahs, and these discharge their sewage into them as well. After the mid-60s formal sector developments, in the absence of an alternative, also used the nullahs for disposal. So one can safely say that, post the mid-60s Karachis sewage system has been officially planned to dispose into the nullahs and, as a result, sludge from sewage began to clog the nullahs and their tributaries.

Map1

In 1978-79, there were very heavy rains in Karachi and much of the housing along the nullahs was washed away. After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities to compact it along the nullah edges to secure them from erosion and flooding and to acquire land to extend their homes into the nullahs. It would not be out of place here to mention that the stormwater drains developed by the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) also carry sewage to the Clifton beach and, in the process, pollute the sea. With the passage of time, solid waste generated by the city increased from 6,500 tons to 14,000-15,000 tons between 2001 and 2020 and, in the absence of proper management and control, became increasingly difficult to manage. This had severe repercussions for the overall drainage system in Karachi.





THE SOLID WASTE ISSUE

Although Karachi is spatially a large city of 3,780 sq kms (with a built up area of approximately 500 sq kms), it has only two landfill sites, both next to each other and in District West. Consequently, solid waste has to be carried for over 40 kms from the eastern edge of the city so as to reach the landfill sites. Because of this distance, and the time and costs entailed, solid waste from most of Karachi does not reach the landfill sites, and is dumped at numerous informal dumping sites along the Korangi Creek and various other open areas and nullahs that join it. Proposals for additional landfill sites have been made since 1975 and, in a 2001 report, one landfill site for each district was suggested, but never implemented.

Meanwhile, a solid waste recycling industry, mostly in the informal sector, developed in Karachi over the years. This recycling industry, which is growing rapidly, acquires recyclable material from two streams. One is known as the clean stream, whereby housewives and markets sell bottles, newspapers, metal objects and cans to kabaarris, who then sell them to the recyclers. The other stream is known as the dirty stream, wherein young boys, mainly of Afghan origin, are organised by contractors to pick all recyclable material from kachra kundis or neighbourhood dumps. They carry it on bicycles to abandoned parks, empty plots or spaces under bridges, where it is sorted out into different categories and sold to the recyclers by weight.

Bones are crushed into powder and mixed with chicken feed; rags are turned into fluff by rag-pulling machines and used for upholstery; small pieces of paper are recycled into board; and plastic items are granulated and the granules are sent to the Punjab for being turned into utensils and toys. The contractors organising this activity pay the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) staff to not pick up the garbage so that the picking can be made easier. The organic waste that is left behind has, over the years, been dumped in the nullahs or has been burned. Burning has been reduced considerably due to public protests.

The homes along the nullahs also throw their waste into them. It is estimated by various reports that no more than 30 to 40 percent of waste reaches the landfill sites. By the mid-90s, most of the nullahs of the city were full of compacted solid waste, and today children play cricket and football on them. A 2001 study by the Karachi Urban Resource Center estimated that, directly or indirectly, the recycling industry employed over 40,000 families. The number today is nearer 100,000 families.





ENCROACHMENTS AND LAND RECLAMATION

In the absence of the implementation of Karachis development plans and the pressure for space for commercial activity, the local government constructed many bazaars over the nullahs such as the Urdu Bazaar and the Tyre Market. Meanwhile, the Government of Sindh, for its own use, has constructed car parking facilities, offices and a MPA hostel on the nullahs, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan is constructed on a nullah, and so is part of the womens college on Burnes Road and a bank building.

Meanwhile, in the posh areas, the VIPs had extended their homes on to the natural drainage systems and some of these were removed in 2004 by orders of the then Mayor Syed Mustafa Kamal.

Pressure for homes due to an absence of affordable housing for the poor has constantly increased in Karachi, especially in the 90s and 2000s. As a result, solid waste has been used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite residential purposes. Such reclamation is, strictly speaking, illegal in both cases. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire KMC tractors to spread and compact it. This land is sold while the reclamation is taking place and even before it is physically visible.

It is estimated that, for parts of Macchar Colony, Sultanabad, Shireen Jinnah Colony and Keamari alone, 17 sq km of land has been reclaimed from the sea, and over 1,000 households live on it. A major part of Phase 8 of Karachis most elite settlement, DHA, has been reclaimed from the sea through the use of municipal solid waste.

Another major problem facing the drainage issue is that the outlets to the sea have been blocked or considerably reduced, as a result of which stormwater disposal is hindered. The Mehmoodabad nullah disposes into the Gizri Creek estuary, where DHA has developed plots for its Phase 7 scheme. A 60 ft nullah, constructed by DHA, now carries sewage and rainwater to the creek. Since this outlet is insufficient, it slows down the disposal to an extent that, at high tide during rainfall, there is a backwash into the nullah. As a result, large tracks of Mehmoodabad, Chanesar Goth and PECHS Block 6 extension are inundated, and remain as such for long periods of time.

Similarly, the Mai Kolachi Bypass and the Karachi Port Trust Officers Housing Society also block the exit of Pitcher nullah into the China Creek backwaters, because of which large areas of Saddar get flooded. A similar situation exists at the point where the Kalri nullah enters the China Creek backwaters.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.

But there are a number of other obstacles too to the journey of stormwater from the north to the sea. A major obstacle is encountered at the Northern Bypass where, because of its height above the Lyari floodplains and the absence of sufficient culverts, water accumulates, flooding large low-lying areas on both sides of the bypass. In addition, road construction in most of the low-income settlements is 3-4 ft above the level of the settlements, and there is no system of draining these settlements in case of heavy rains. As a result, they become islands of stagnant water till it is pumped out or absorbed by the land.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.





GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES

Government agencies have undertaken the rehabilitation and/or the building of a large number of roads. The tender documents require the construction of drains along the sides of the roads. These are invariably built and are usually of an excellent standard. However, more often than not, they do not have a disposal and usually end where the road construction or rehabilitation ends, leaving the stormwater to find its own destination.

Meanwhile, in the last decade and a half, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels, hillocks and water collection depressions. As a result, when it rains, areas immediately south of this region (such as Saadi Town) are completely submerged by floodwaters from the hills.

Areas which have not been levelled out and are next to the ones that have been levelled, collapse in the rains and, if there is housing on them, there is major loss of life and property. With more developments taking place in the Kirthar foothills, the likelihood of flooding and landslides will also increase.





THE KARACHI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

Photo by Tahir Imran

To overcome some of these problems, the Government of Sindh (KWSB and the local government) in the late 80s launched the Karachi Urban Development Programme. The programme consisted of rehabilitating the old sewage treatment plant and the construction of new ones, along with the building of trunk sewers along the main roads so as to take the sewage to the treatment plants. A large Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan was taken for this purpose.

The Orangi Pilot Project-Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) was consulted regarding the implementation of the Orangi Town part of the project. It noticed that the trunks did not pick up the existing sewage system in which local government and the people of Orangi had invested billions of rupees. To connect the existing system, which flowed into the nullahs, would require digging up hundreds of kilometres of existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure to connect to the ADB trunks. Apart from being a waste of government and peoples investment, the communities would never agree to put up with this inconvenience and the psychological impact, of seeing their work and investment destroyed, would have been devastating.

When OPP saw the entire plan for the city, it observed that what was proposed for Orangi was proposed for the entire city. Connecting the existing sewage system to the trunks would require many more ADB loans, increasing Pakistans foreign debt.

The capacity of Karachis sewage treatment plants is 151 million gallons per day. However, since the sewage does not reach the plants, no more than 25 million gallons-a-day can be treated and, since the plants are so grossly under-utilised, severe maintenance problems surface. Meanwhile, sewage continues to flow happily into the drainage system.

These problems were recognised by the OPP-PTI as early as 1988. The OPP-PTI proposed that the reality of sewage flowing into the natural drainage system be accepted, and that trunk sewers be laid in the bed of the nullahs or on either side of them. However, we did not have enough knowledge then regarding the number of nullahs, the relationship of the existing sewage systems to them and the terrain through which different nullahs flowed and, as such, this concept could not be properly framed.

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding.

The knowledge regarding these issues was developed by the seminal work done by architect Perveen Rehman, then director OPP-RTI. She identified and documented 43 nullahs and, on the basis of this knowledge, OPP worked out the details of a sewage system consisting of trunks on either of side of the nullahs and being connected near the disposal points with each other, and pumped from there to the treatment plants (See map below for OPP-RTI proposal).

This proposal was accepted and, with modifications, it formed the basis for the Greater Karachi Sewage Plan (also known as S-3)  part of which is now under construction. At a meeting where this decision was taken, the ADB consultant for the design of the ODA UK-financed trunks expressed grave concern and pointed out that Her Majestys government had invested 1 million pounds in the preparation of the designs.

This ignoring of ground realities and existing infrastructure has been a characteristic of foreign-funded infrastructure projects in Karachi, resulting in excessive costs, as in the case of the ADB-funded Korangi Waste Water Management Project. This was a 100 million US dollar project, of which 80 million US dollars was a loan. After OPP redesigned the project to integrate the existing system and reworked the rates, the cost of the project was reduced to 26 million US dollars, which led the then Governor of Sindh, Moinuddin Haider, to cancel the loan (for existing infrastructure at Korangi Project see map above).

In addition, all foreign-funded projects have a fairly high percentage of costs allocated for capacity building. Yet, over the last 40 years, no capacity to deal with the evolving situation has developed. This is because capacity building is done through foreign trips to look at good practices and through workshops and seminars. No permanent institution for research, monitoring and training has been established  a basic requirement for any capacity building and the establishment of a continuous culture of learning.

During the mapping of the stormwater drains, OPP-RTI had constant interaction with the local communities living along the nullahs. It was only them who knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of the various smaller drains that have disappeared. So far, how they can be made part of the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

OPP also studied how the Japanese, after the devastation of the Second World War, had dealt with a similar situation. They had secured the edges of the nullahs to prevent erosion. In appropriate places, they had covered the nullahs and used their roofs as public space and created sports grounds, childrens play areas and community spaces for older people. Unfortunately, OPP could not carry out these proposals.





QUALITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND DESIGN STANDARDS

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding. If the latter, then engineers will have to work to establish appropriate standards. In the Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020, it was also proposed that dams be constructed in the foothills of the Kirthar range, to store large quantums of water. However, only one dam, the Thaddo Dam, has been constructed. Will the construction of additional dams reduce the pressure of water entering Karachi? This too needs to be ascertained.

Politicians, bureaucrats, developers and even a number of engineers have stressed that the removal of encroachments from, and the cleaning of, the nullahs is the first step towards easing the situation in Karachi. However, from what has been discussed above, the most important step that needs to be taken is to remove the encroachments at the outfalls, so that water can enter the sea. Also, it has to be understood that, if the housing along the nullahs is removed, the water will erode the edges of the nullah and cause a major disaster by flooding out the housing at the edge, as it did in 1978 and 1979, and we will be left with a huge housing and relocation problem.

It is essential that, even before attempting such an exercise, a proper documentation of the potential affectees is drawn up, with Nadras assistance, and encroachment removal is across the board, with the source criteria being applied for both rich and poor, unlike in the past. It is also relevant to note here that there is sufficient federal and provincial government land within the city to easily house over 80,000 families at almost no cost to the state. Proposals for this have also been floated off and on in the press.





THE NEED FOR LOCAL GOVERNANCE

Many of the problems that have been identified above cannot be dealt with together. A criteria for prioritising them will have to be developed. All of them are really a part of a larger planning process for Karachi. Such a planning process requires research, on the basis of which politicians can take informed decisions; the development of plans (with the participation of communities) by an empowered and well-staffed planning institution, and their implementation in a transparent and accountable manner. And finally, there will have to be a monitoring, operation and maintenance process, especially at the neighbourhood level.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place.

Much of this work will be have to done at the grassroots level and will entail the empowering of the Union Councils and the involvement of citizens in the formulation of the Union Councils annual development programme. Karachi packages, as developed in the past, and projects unrelated to a larger plan, will not help in the creation of an appropriate planning process, nor will time- and cash-bound projects funded by international financial institutions such as ADB and the World Bank. History taught us these lessons long ago, but we have failed to learn from them.

What is being suggested above cannot be carried out by provincial bureaucrats or by short-term sophisticated consultants and the companies to whom contracts for delivering services have been handed out to by the Government of Sindh. Nor can a national disaster management authority develop long-term plans for disaster prevention without an implementation arrangement with the line departments and local governments. To deal with the Karachi situation, an effective local government organisation is required, which ends the fragmentation of Karachi into different planning jurisdictions, with all its departments under central control. So far, the Sindh government has been averse to this, because it wishes to control the city through a highly centralised form of governance, because it does not gain the required number of seats to promote decentralisation.

However, the prime minister has proposed autonomous city governments for the major cities of Pakistan. For this, a political consensus among the different parties would be required and, given the sentiments and the enormous resources that Karachi possesses, this would be difficult if not impossible to achieve.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place. A very important ingredient for what has been suggested are human resources. For that it is necessary that a research and training institute be established, whose training would be for politicians at all levels and for staff involved in project preparation, implementation and monitoring.

An association with community leaders and activists would have to be an important part of the training. Can this be made possible over a period of time? If yes, there is hope for a better Karachi. If not, we will simply continue to muddle through.

“Assam is reporting floods. Bihar is also in a flood-like situation. Cherrapunji, which is known to receive a lot of rainfall around this time of the year, has recorded up to 55 cm in a day. This pattern of continuous heavy rains will gradually reduce from Tuesday. While from Thursday, torrential rains will increase in central India and over the north-west parts of the country from next Sunday, ” said Dr. Mrutunjay Mohapatra, director-general, India Meteorological Department (IMD).

The eastern-end of the monsoon trough continues to run along the Himalayan foothills with the convergence of strong southerly and south-westerly winds from the Bay of Bengal over the north-east and eastern India.

This is likely to cause widespread and very heavy rain in many parts of north-east India in the next four-five days. There may be extremely heavy rain, measuring over 20 cm in a day, in the next 24 hours, according to IMD.

Heavy rains are expected in Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during the next five days. Widespread rainfall is also expected over Madhya Pradesh for the next five days and over Chhattisgarh and the Vidarbha region on Monday and Tuesday.

There will be widespread rains in the west coast also this week, IMD said in its bulletin.

However, rains will be subdued over north-west India and the western Himalayas.

The Central Water Commission (CWC) has warned of an above-normal flood-like situation in Dharamtul, Brahmaputra, Dhubri, Goalpara and other parts of flood-prone Assam.

A severe flood-like situation is also likely in Assam’s Kopili and Kamrup.

The restoration operations at Baghjan gas well in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district, which reported a blowout – an uncontrolled release of gas and oil – on May 27 and later caught fire on June 9,were hampered last week for at least three days because of inundation of low-lying areas, while the well continues to leak gas and oil condensate, according to an Oil India Limited (OIL) spokesperson.

The well is set to resume its operations gradually.

From June 1 to 28, Sikkim and sub-Himalayan West Bengal have received 56% rainfall, Bihar received 92% of excess rains, and Assam and Meghalaya received an excess of 34% of rains.

Monsoon this time covered the entire country on June 26 – a good 12 days in advance.

Usually, monsoon covers the country by July 8. But from last Friday an intense monsoon phase in the north-east and eastern India started.

Monsoon rains in the country are 20% excess of the long-period average (LPA) as of Sunday -- 36% excess over central India; 8% excess over north-west India; 4% excess over southern peninsula and 20% excess over eastern and north-east India.

LPA is the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1961 and 2010, which is 88.06 cm.

IMD has predicted a normal monsoon this year at 102% of LPA.

A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people are dependent for a livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its population.",2020-06-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['rainfall', 'imd', 'northeast', 'west', 'country', 'heavy', 'received', 'rains', 'extremely', 'excess', 'india', 'receive', 'monsoon', 'parts', 'days']",India,news article,English

Francis Ighorurhie, aged 38, reportedly drowned on Thursday night at Kaiama Community in Kolokuma-Opokuma Council of Bayelsa State. Two Primary school pupils also drowned along Goodnews street in Azikoro Town in Yenagoa Council of the state.

It was gathered on Friday that Fr. Francis Ighorurhie, a Missionary of St. Paul (MSP) from Delta State, was until his death the Parish Priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church, Kaiama.

A priest, who spoke anonymously, said, this is a sad moment for us. Father was on his way back from Bomadi in Delta State when he met his untimely death. But for the flood, he could have driven his car straight to his residence instead of parking same by the road.

It was as he was walking on the wooden bridge part of which had been submerged that he slipped and got drowned. Those staying at his residence had to raise alarm when they saw his car by the roadside and he was nowhere to be found.

They however became suspicious when they saw a bag containing some provision floating on the water not far from the bridge. Divers were contracted and his remains were recovered.

He added that his remains had been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa.

Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State government, yesterday, in a statement, sympathised with residents of the state over the impact of the rising flood, assuring that efforts are underway to mitigate its devastating effects on the people.

The state government, during its Eight Executive Council Meeting, presided over by the Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stressed that government is aware of the difficulties being experienced as a result of the flood, which has become a perennial problem due to climate change.

Continuous rains and inflows from rivers around the Rwenzori region are responsible for the rising water levels in Lake Albert and flooding of surrounding areas.



The floods have devastated several areas in Ntoroko district, where more than 70,000 people are living in camps in Kanara Sub-county, 1,300 homes are abandoned and uncountable properties destroyed.



Jaconius Musingwire, the Western Region Manager of the National Environment Management Authority -NEMA observes that heavy water inflows especially from rivers streaming out of the Rwenzori mountains have significantly increased the water volumes in Lake Albert.



The situation, he says, has been worsened by silt that has been carried down into the lake raising the water levels. Musingwire says there is a need for a multi-sectoral approach to deal with environmental degradation in the region which has left the earth clear of natural vegetation cover.



//Cue in; “That water no longer…



Cue out…higher magnitude.”//



Meanwhile, Ntoroko district administration needs at least 4 billion Shillings to resettle flood victims displaced by the rising water levels. In an interaction with a URN, the flood victims appealed to the government to resettle them anticipating that the floods may not rescind soon.

REISTERSTOWN, Md. (April 1, 2021) — Governor Larry Hogan, today, proclaimed the first Maryland Flood Awareness Month. Maryland Flood Awareness Month will run from April 1 to April 30, 2021. Every year, floods in Maryland kill more residents and destroy more property than any other natural hazard.

The frequency and intensity of storms are expected to increase over time. Recent predictions suggest that flooding in normally dry areas is likely in the future. This could mean deeper flooding, floods moving further inland, and more damage from storms. This is not only a potential danger for coastal Maryland but for all communities in Maryland.

The Hogan Administration is joining with the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, the Maryland Insurance Administration, the Maryland Department of Planning, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the Maryland Department of Transportation, the Maryland Environmental Service, the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy, and the Maryland Association of Floodplain and Stormwater Managers to encourage all Marylanders to learn more about the different flood hazards faced by individuals and communities across the state.

“Our Administration is dedicated to working with our state, local and federal partners to assist Marylanders to become aware of their risk and take steps to protect themselves from the risk,” said Governor Larry Hogan.

Maryland Flood Awareness Month will raise awareness about the many flood hazards faced by individuals and communities across the state and provide information on what Marylanders can do to protect themselves, their property and possessions, their finances, and communities. The Maryland Resiliency Partnership will work with a variety of public and private partners to help educate the public around three key messages as they relate to different flood hazards: know your risk, reduce your risk, insure your risk.

Throughout the month of April, information and activities will focus on these three key messages as they relate to each week’s theme:

Individuals preparing for the impacts of flooding; Riverine flooding and flooding outside the regulatory floodplain; Coastal hazards (storm surge, nuisance flooding, sea level rise, erosion, subsidence, and flooding outside the regulatory floodplain); Urban and flash flooding, dam break, and flooding outside the regulatory floodplain; and Communities preparing for the impacts of flooding.

During the month of April, these agencies will be sharing information on their social media platforms; hosting virtual events to engage in conversations about flooding; and providing digital resources on the Maryland Resiliency Partnership website.

Additional information about Flood Awareness Month can be found on the Maryland Resiliency Partnership website (resiliencypartnership.com).

401,Drought Sri Lanka,Cook confident England can end World Cup drought - Sportstar,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/alastair-cook-2019-england-world-cup-predictions-team-india-cirat-kohli/article26314600.ece,"Former England skipper Alastair Cook believes England can end decades of World Cup disappointment with a triumph on home soil this year.

England has never won the men's World Cup, but with 100 days to go until the start of the latest edition, a team captained by Eoin Morgan is top of the 50-over world rankings.

Cook, who retired from international cricket last year as the country's highest Test run-scorer and most-capped player, said there are several reasons why Morgan's men could go one better than the England teams that lost in the 1979, 1987 and 1992 finals.

“They're a very settled side, they've got 15 players pretty much nailed on for that squad,” Cook said at a World Cup event in London's Trafalgar Square on Tuesday.

READ: Sri Lanka needs to carry momentum into the World Cup, says Dilshan

“Everyone knows their role, they're very comfortable in their role, they've got a lot of strength in depth, they seem to have a lot of options covered and they're an exciting team to watch.

“They are a brilliant one-day side.”

Cook never played in a World Cup, with the left-handed opening batsman dramatically dropped from the squad that then failed to beat a fellow Test nation while suffering a group-stage exit at the 2015 edition in Australia and New Zealand.

But Cook said a change of attitude lay behind England's rise up the one-day rankings since that dismal display.

“Probably over the years we've really concentrated on Test cricket as a nation. Over the last three or four years we've really given the one-day cricket its due,” he said.

'Sky's the limit'

It was a point emphasised by former England spinner Graeme Swann, who said: “I just think England are picking the right team these days.

“They're picking one-day specialists and the sky's the limit.

“When they bat, people like Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, they think that (scoring) 400 is feasible rather than an impossible dream. I think England has finally picked a very aggressive team as well, with Eoin Morgan, who's a brilliant captain.

“They've got a team that is putting them in firm contention to win this World Cup,” insisted Swann, who added “I never thought we (England) would win it deep down when I was there.”

Swann was a member of the only England men's side to have won a major global trophy - the 2010 World Twenty20 in the Caribbean - and sees parallels between that team and Morgan's men.

“The only world trophy I thought we had a genuine chance of winning was the World Twenty20 in the West Indies that we did, because we were ahead of the curve there.

“We picked a team of specialists, people like Craig Kieswetter, Michael Lumb - and I think that's what England have finally started doing in the one-day game as well.”

'Never write off India'

But Swann warned that England would face several tough opponents in its quest for World Cup glory.

“You can never write off India, they are an exceptional one-day team, Virat Kohli is a brilliant captain, brilliant player.”

As for champions Australia, England's oldest rivals and five-times World Cup-winners, Swann said: “The Aussies are like Germany in the football - you can never write them off at a World Cup.”

Swann though said he was particularly looking forward to watching Pakistan, who won the 2017 Champions Trophy one-day tournament in Britain.

“They are so mercurial, you never know what you are going to get. When they are on fire, they are absolutely explosive and when they're not, they're awful.”",2019-02-19 08:00:00+00:00,"['swann', 'write', 'world', 'end', 'oneday', 'theyre', 'cup', 'drought', 'confident', 'england', 'team', 'think', 'cook', 'brilliant']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
889,FL-2021-000038-KEN,"Somalia: Mohamed Farmaajo in Shuttle Diplomacy, Warns Against Interference - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202104200028.html,"President Mohamed Farmaajo of Somalia is seeking the support of the African Union in his last week's decision to extend his term of office by two years, even as he chastised the international community for interference.

On Monday, President Farmaajo landed in Kinshasa to meet with his host Felix Tshisekedi, also the current Chair of the African Union. A statement from Villa Somalia said President Farmaajo will be on a 'working visit' to speak with Mr Tshisekedi in his capacity as the African Union Chair.

""During the visit, the two leaders will discuss how to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Somalia and the DR Congo,"" Mr Farmaajo's office said.

The meeting though forms part of the latest shuttle diplomacy by Mr Farmaajo to seek support following a controversial extension of his term by two years.

This week, the African Union Bureau of Heads of State and Government is expected to discuss the situation in Somalia, following the decision by the Lower House to delay elections by two years.

Chaired by Tshisekedi, it also includes leaders from Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, South Africa and Senegal. It was unclear on Monday if these leaders will be travelling to Kinshasa as well.

Although Mr Farmaajo has argued that Parliament was merely providing more time for the country to conduct proper universal suffrage, international partners including the AU have rejected the delay.

Parallel electoral processes

A joint statement issued last week said the international partners would not accept any extensions of mandate, parallel electoral processes nor any activities that could worsen the security situation in Somalia.

Mr Farmaajo has dismissed international critics and accused them of interfering with Somalia's internal affairs. He said last week Parliament had created a ""historic chance"" for Somalis to choose their own destiny after the failure of FMS members to support the implementation of the initial September 17, 2020 Agreement.

He said Somalia will ""not tolerate external interference in sensitive sovereign affairs especially elections which were issues of independence to the people and the Federal Government of Somalia.""

But after the EU, United States of America and the UK warned of ""re-evaluating"" their relationship with Somalia, including suspension of crucial support programmes, he summoned their representatives in Mogadishu on Saturday.

The meeting took place at the 'Big Tent' near the former Somali Air force Headquarters inside Mogadishu's Aden Abdulle International Airport.

It was the first meeting between Somalia's development supporters and President Farmaajo since the Lower House of Somalia's parliament voted for an extension of the elected institutions for two years.

The endorsement, which occurred on April 12, mandated the National Electoral Commission to prepare for one-person-one-vote elections for a period not exceeding two years.

No statement was immediately issued after the meeting, but the partners had in the past stated they would not support a partial or parallel electoral process or initiatives to extend prior mandates.

Election agenda

President Farmaajo signed the piece of legislation just hours after the Lower House's endorsement last week on Monday.

There are fears tensions over the election agenda could either divert attention from war on al-Shabaab or allow militia to crop up defending their political kin.

Last week, the African Union Mission in Somalia, the combat force created by the AU to fight terrorism in Somalia, announced it would be gradually handing over key security responsibilities to Somalia National Army.

The duties to be granted by December this year include guarding of crucial installations, al-Shabaab combat strategy and border security.

An impasse on an electoral deal, however, could delay the transfer.

On Friday night, government forces reportedly surrounded Shirkole neighbourhood in Mogadishu's Hodon district where General Sadaq Omar Hassan alias Sadaq John, the former Mogadishu Police Commander who attempted to block the entrance of the Lower House of the parliament on Monday, is hiding.

Sadiq John was immediately fired by Commissioner of Somali Police Force, Hassan Mohamed Hijar and endorsed by President Farmaajo. Since then, Sadaq John has surrounded himself with a unit of the police force that remained loyal to him while the Somali security forces are attempting to seize him.

We prefer to die in our ancestral homes than vacate for flood Fishermen vow

Why they refused to stay out of harms way  NISEPS

By Wole Mosadomi

A major calamity now looms in Niger State following the refusal of fishermen to vacate flood-prone areas already identified by the state government following an authenticated meteorological report that those areas would be worst hit by flooding once the rains set in.

The report can hardly be faulted since the state and the federal agency have always issued the advisory on a yearly basis in a bid to mitigate the catastrophic effect of heavy flooding in the state particularly in the riverine areas of the state with heavy fishing population.

Once the alarming scientific report was issued, the Niger State Government through its Environmental Protection Agency, NISEPA, quickly approached those who are likely to be hit by the looming flood, to vacate the flood plains and move to more secured locations.

If the agency expected an urgent compliance with its directive, it got it all wrong, as the potential victims largely ignored the protection agency and continued with their business of catching, drying and selling fish as if nothing is amiss.

Beyond the fishermen, majority of the residents living close to drains, have also ignored the advisory to move away from the endangered places, preferring to continue staying there and doing their daily business.

Most of them have even turned their drainage into dumping grounds, filling them with refuse with reckless abandon and thereby threatening their health and well being in the process.

But their recalcitrance notwithstanding, the Niger State Emergency Protection Agency, NISEPS, has continued to move from one street to the other, pleading with the residents to stop dumping refuse in drainage and to move away from endangered locations as the rains begin to thunder.

But those spoken to in Minna, the state capital, say they see nothing wrong in pouring refuse into drains and that they have not committed any known offence doing that. For this reason, women, children, men, boys and girls are routinely seen turning their refuse into the drains without any fear or shame.

I am just an errand boy. I am only given a directive by my parents to go and dump the refuse into the drainage and I carry out the order, a young boy, who stays in Minna with his parents, said without remorse when confronted by Arewa Voice.

In fact, I really enjoy going into the drainage to even play after dumping the refuse there and as much as the drainage is big and deep, we will continue to use it as dumping site, more so that the rains will always wash it away, he remarked with confidence.

However, NISEPA sees the action beyond a childs play because of the devastating effects it has on the people.

The Director-General of NISEPA, Alhaji Ahmed Inga, in an exclusive interview with AV correspondent, said despite the annual sensitisation of the people on the inherent danger of indiscriminate refuse dumping into drains, the residents have continued to engage in the illicit act with ease.

Alhaji Inga said: This year, we have started appealing and sensitizing the people, especially in the urban areas and those in the riverine areas to adhere strictly to advice of professionals on flooding.

Waterways are being cleared and due to human activities; we have been calling and will still be calling on people to try as much as we can to change our attitudes towards our environment.

It is our attitude that always put us into serious situations of flooding, and later we will be calling for help. If we observe now, the waterways are now being turned into dumping sites by people within the communities and these are the same people that will start calling for help during flood.

In as much as we are not going to change our attitude towards environment, then we cannot get away from distress calls every time, he remarked.

Drastic steps to be taken by government: The state government has concluded plans to deal with those building on waterways which are the major obstacle to free flow of water in the drainages. Those people building on waterways are our major problem and recently government has taken serious measures because very soon, all buildings on waterways will have to give way because some people dont care of what happens to their neighbours provided they are safe but government is not insensitive because government cares for everyone.

There are Laws that go with such offences and the enforcement will soon take effect and there is a clear directive on that. We as an agency has the responsibility to supervise, identify, advise, monitor and see to all these and very soon, the distillation of waterways to ensure free flow of water in the drainages and will commence and there will be strict monitoring because there will be Community Vanguard that will watch over those drainage channels and anybody caught contravening the law will be made to face wrath of the law, Inga declared.

People residing in riverine areas: The Director-General said that one of the major problems his agency is facing is on how to convince the people residing in the riverine areas to leave their abode temporarily to the upland to save their lives and properties from flood during the raining season.

Why they are adamant: They remain unperturbed despite our sensitization to them to vacate their homes temporarily from the downstream to upstream and return back after the rains but they remain adamant.

They are so attached to the riverine areas for some factors which have made them to get glued to those riverine communities.

They claim that one of the reasons they dont want to move out of the riverine area is that the soil gives them high yield; when there is flood or immediately after the flood any crop planted brings enormous yield than those in other areas of the state.

Secondly, they said if there is flood, they use to harvest more fish and that brings to them a lot of money, he said.

The DG, however, said that: Government is planning to provide them with highly improved seeds for farming so that when the prediction for flooding start coming to pass, their crops must have been ready for harvesting and with this development, it is hoped that they will yield to our clarion calls from now.

But the explanations so far made by NISEPA appear to have fallen on deaf ears, as the fishermen insist that they would rather die in their ancestral homes than vacate them.

Some of the fishermen, who spoke to AV, said that government should rather prepare a place to bury them after the flood than move them into any camp given the nasty experiences of those who have been taken into internally displaced persons camps across the state.

We will rather die here in our ancestral homes honourably than being taken into slumps in the name of IDPs, some of the fishermen stated.

For now, there seems to be a deadlock between the fishermen and the state government but it is not clear who will win the fight.

A major state of emergency was declared in Timor-Leste overnight after torrential rain led to flash flooding and landslides, a situation exacerbated by an alarming COVID-19 outbreak that sent much of the country into an extended lockdown last month. Mollymook local and former UN Peacekeeper Grant Schultz lived and worked in Timor-Leste and said photos of the flooding were extraordinary. ""It's a double blow for people in Timor-Leste, particularly in Dili which seems to have suffered the worst flooding, as the COVID infection rates are skyrocketing, and vaccinations due to be rolled out are now at risk because there is no refrigeration due to power cuts,"" he said. ""I recognise some of those Dili streets and to see that amount of water is just extraordinary, locals are used to heavy downpours during the wet season but certainly nothing like this."" Mr Schultz encouraged people to donate what they could to an online fundraiser for the flood victims. ""Timor is only a 45 minute flight from Darwin and we've got a long history of those people looking after Australia in World War II, at great personal sacrifice to themselves,"" he said. ""It's important to support them in times of need, particularly as they deal with these floods and a COVID outbreak at the same time. ""If people can dig deep into the pockets and find a few dollars, every little bit counts."" On Monday, authorities confirmed 11 people were killed in Dili with 6,000 left homeless and warned those numbers could increase as the country grappled with the heaviest rainfalls in recent history. The National Directorate of Civil Protection told Portuguese News Agency Lusa ""the whole city is a disaster zone"" and it was not yet possible to determine the number of victims. Dili, the capital of Timor-Leste, and neighbouring Flores Island in Indonesia were reported to be the hardest hit by three days of torrential rain which caused floods and landslides and cut power supplies and communications. Timor-Leste was also due to receive its first COVAX vaccines this week but the medical supplies storage depot where they were supposed to be stored was flooded. The fundraising webpage, established by Timor Awakening director Michael Stone, raised more than $20,000 in the 20 hours following the Easter Sunday flooding event, and the organisation appealed to the Australian government to provide humanitarian assistance. ""I hope in this time of dire need our great country Australia, with one of the best humanitarian and disaster relief capabilities in the world, together with our friends in New Zealand and other good neighbours, can provide a co-ordinated disaster relief effort, including the protection of the front line workers,"" Mr Stone wrote in a Facebook post.

459,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Les Rives de l'Aveyron: from the orchard to the bottle - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9130366/les-rives-de-l-aveyron-from-the-orchard-to-the-bottle/,"In Albias, between Montauban and Monteil, Les Rives de l’Aveyron is settled among the orchards of apples, pears and kiwis. The small family business has come a long way since its creation, three generations earlier.

Olivier Thibaut, expert in communication and graphic designer, joined his father Bertrand in the company about 10 years ago. To the experience with the orchards was then added an ambition to diversify, which gave birth to a workshop for processing fruit juices and to local sales.

Olivier Thibaut

A production valued in its entirety thanks to the juice processing workshop

Besides differentiating it from other farms, the juice processing workshop has allowed the company to enhance the value of its entire harvest. “We have almost no waste. All the slightly damaged fruits are processed into juice. We also help our neighbors add value to their fruits, for example, when scab problems occur, or when frost damages their harvest.”

The activity has been profitable since last year, but setting it up required a lot of hard work. “We built the workshop 8 years ago. But at the beginning, we could not find any qualified employee to help us get started. So I learned everything on the job.” A few years later, this self-taught juice producer recruited employees which he himself trained.

His efforts paid off and last year, the company sold, to large retailers and directly at the farm, nearly 200,000 bottles of 100% natural non-filtered juice and non-alcoholic sparkling fruit juices. The company also received a gold medal for its apple-pear juice in 2018, and a gold medal for its apple juice and apple-pear juice in 2019.

A desire to bring consumers closer to the producers

In addition to his juice processing workshop, Olivier was one of the first to set up, upon his arrival at the company, direct sales and picking in the orchards. “This brought some income before the harvest. We train the visitors so everything goes smoothly during the picking. It is also an opportunity for them to understand how an orchard works, and to see that, unlike what they hear on TV, there is biodiversity in the orchards,” explains Olivier. An activity which benefits everyone. At 1.00-1.20 €/kg [0.50-0.61 $/lb] for apples and 1.40 €/kg [0.71 $/lb] for kiwis, Olivier and Bertrand offer producer prices.

For a few years now, father and son have been opening the gates of their orchards on the first weekend of the fall holidays, which they have called “Vitamin Days”. For the occasion, a small concert is given and a market of local producers is held on the Sunday. “It is an opportunity for people to come visit the orchards, to pick Chantecler apples and kiwis.” A successful event, since the orchards welcomed 2,500 visitors last year, which is 500 more than the previous year.

Multiple ongoing projects

When it comes to projects, Olivier is full of ideas. After modernizing his bottle labels, the manager is now targeting new markets. “The demand is increasing and people consume more and more locally. We would now like to touch the fast-food industry and we plan to offer other formats for our juices. We are also working on a deposit system, but for this, retailers must get involved.”

Olivier also wants to expand and modernize the site. “We are making an expansion of 21,528 square feet and we have installed solar panels on the roofs. There is a plan to buy another juice production line and to create a parking-lot in order to receive our clientele.”

998,FL-2017-000155-VNM,"Death Toll From Floods Climbs in Vietnam, While Victims Plead For Aid in Cambodia, Laos - Radio Free Asia",https://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/toll-10202020175620.html,"Local residents and volunteers deliver aid packages to residents affected by heavy flooding in Quang An commune, in Vietnam's Thua Thien Hue province, Oct. 20, 2020.

The death toll from flooding and landslides in Vietnam continued to rise Tuesday, while those hit by the disasters triggered by tropical storms in the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos criticized government inaction and made urgent appeals for assistance.

In Vietnam, at least 104 people are dead in the countrys central region, with 49, 27, and 11 deaths reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam alone, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster and Control. Twenty-seven people are missing, including 15 workers from a hydropower plant in Quang Tri that was hit by a landslide on Oct. 12.

The committee said that some 90,000 residents of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Tri provinces have been evacuated to higher ground. Nearly 7,000 hectares of rice paddy and crop fields have been submerged, while more than 5,800 head of cattle and 685,000 poultry birds have been killed or carried away in floods.

Vietnamese state media on Tuesday reported that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved the allocation of 100 billion Vietnamese dong (U.S. $4.3 million) and 1,000 tons of rice to the five worst flood-hit provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Ha Tinh.

Meanwhile, the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre said a tropical depression in the Philippines has strengthened into what is being called Storm Saudel. Over the next 24 hours, Saudel is expected to enter the South China Seacalled the East Sea in Vietnamand become the eighth storm to batter Vietnams central provinces since the start of the rainy season.

Tran Quang Nang, head of the weather forecasting department under the National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre, rejected reports circulating on Facebook, allegedly citing Japanese forecasters, that Saudel is a super typhoon.

All of these predictions about Typhoon Saudel are baseless and fake, Nang said. The Japanese weather forecasting center and other countries have said no such thing.

Nang called on the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to punish those responsible for spreading inaccurate information on social networks, causing public confusion.

This issue should be handled promptly to ensure people only access accurate information released by the authorities so they can respond to natural disasters, helping to mitigate the damage they cause, he said.

In Cambodia, the death toll remained at 25 from a day earlier, with some 40,000 evacuated to temporary shelters, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha told RFAs Khmer Service. More than 200,000 hectares of paddy field and nearly 80,000 farms have also been destroyed, with more than 500 school buildings and 79 garment factories damaged.

Roads, hospitals, and dams have also been affected, authorities said.

In a notice issued on Tuesday, the Poipet Administration of Banteay Meanchey province, along Cambodias border with Thailand, temporarily closed portions of National Road 5. Downtown Poipet saw flooding of homes and roads, which the notice attributed to rains in Thailand.

Sann Ratha, a resident of Kaun Damrei village, in Poipets Sangkat Nimith district, told RFA that water levels increased so rapidly that several hundred families were forced to leave their homes.

He said people are stranded and in desperate need of food and other supplies.

We are under the attack from the floodour village looks like a river now with water everywhere and houses submerged, he said.

The current situation is worse than during the [1967-1975] civil war. We need the authorities to help us immediately.

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen traveled to affected areas visiting with victims and handing out food. He said in a post to his Facebook page that he plans to spend two days in hard-hit Banteay Meanchey province, where 13 of the countrys 25 deaths have occurred and an estimated 20,000 families have been affected.

Opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha is also traveling to Banteay Meanchey to provide assistance.

Din Puthy, head of the Poipet-based Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association, expressed skepticism over the governments handling of the flooding Tuesday.

He voiced concerns that authorities appear to prefer taking selfies with small numbers of villagers and posting them on social media to pretend they are helping the victims.

The victims are not receiving equal treatment, he said. Only a few people have received some assistance while many others have been left behind.

More aid needed

In Laos, where storms have ravaged Savannakhet province in the countrys center, authorities remained unable to access many areas due to damaged roads and a lack of boats to transport aid and other supplies, Lao sources said.

More than 125 villages in eight districts have now been flooded, with many houses and over 10,000 hectares of paddy fields submerged, official sources in the province say. Nearly 30,000 people have been impacted in Savannakhet, according to official count.

An official from Savannakhets inundated Phin district told RFA Tuesday that people are in need of dry goods, drinking water, medicine, and other necessities. The official said that while most aid had been distributed it still is not enough.

In Phin district, 45 villages are heavily flooded, but they have received some help alreadythey mostly need sticky rice and consumer goods, he said.

He said villagers with boats had been using them to help one another and that there have been no accidents during rescue and supply operations.

A villager in Phin told RFA that the water level is so high that the local river had flooded homes along its banks and urged authorities to provide more assistance.

They have helped a little, but its very difficult for us, he said. Higher-level authorities should take care of this. Were asking for more riceall houses need rice to eat.

Authorities in Savannakhets Xonbury district said waters remain high and will rise in days to come, forcing villagers to stay in clubs, schools, and other places set up by the local government as temporary shelters until flooding recedes.

According to the Meteorology Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Laos will continue to endure heavy rains and strong winds throughout the country in coming days. It urged villagers to remain vigilant for flash floods and landslides.

Dehradun, Rishikesh in the Garhwal hills and Nainital, Ranikhet, Almora in Kumaon remain unaffected by the event. This is much relief for the thousands of small businesses that have been looking forward to tourists after a dismal 2020. To get the latest from the ground, we rang up Uttarakhand Tourism and the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam, which manages a large part of the tourism experience in the region. Here’s what they told us:

Uttarakhand glacier burst: what you need to know

The incident—a glacial lake outburst flood—took place on Sunday morning and most of the damage took place in the few hours thereafter. Authorities are not expecting any further impact from this incident.

The event has affected a small part of the very large state of Uttarakhand. The incident took place near Raini in Chamoli district, towards the edge of the Nanda Devi National Park.

Areas affected are 35km upstream from Joshimath. Access to Chamoli and Nanda Devi National Park has been hit though rescue teams are working at restoring the road links.

Dehradun , Rishikesh , Haridwar have not been affected by Sunday’s flash flood. Hotels and other facilities are open and functional. Roads in these regions are also unaffected by Sunday’s incident.

Rafting on the Ganga was temporarily suspended as a precaution. But water levels in the river at these places did not rise as feared. The situation around Shivpuri, Rishikesh, Haridwar remains normal.

Nainital, Mukteshwar, Almora, Ranikhet are not affected either. They are nowhere close to Raini or even the Alaknanda River, which bore the brunt.

The ski resort of Auli is also very far from the affected region. It remains accessible and operational.

For questions and clarifications, you can call Uttarakhand Tourism (0135-2559898) or the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (0135-2746817, 0135-2749308).

How you can help

Meanwhile, help has been pouring in for those affected by the tragedy. Among others, cricketer Rishabh Pant has donated his match fee to the flood relief and Khalsa Aid India has despatched a team of volunteers to the site. If you’d like to lend a hand, you can donate to the Uttarakhand Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.

One of the 16 Jiahu bone flutes in the collection of Henan Museum. Provided to China Daily

Editor's Note: Every week we look at a work of art or a cultural relic that puts the spotlight on China's heritage.

Music is as old as mankind and has taken as many forms as human evolution.

In 1987, 16 bone flutes which date back to around 6,000 BC were excavated from an early Neolithic tomb in Jiahu, Central China's Henan province. These bone flutes, the nation's oldest known musical instruments, are much older than flutes excavated in Mesopotamia and appeared 2,000 years earlier than in Egypt.

In ancient times, superstition and witchcraft were invoked to explain natural phenomena and bone flutes were used as the medium to link God and humans in sacrificial rites.

The Jiahu bone flutes, now kept in Henan Museum, and still playable, are made of the wing bones of red-crowned cranes and are about 20 cm long. They are open-ended and their finger holes vary from five to eight, although most have seven. The best-preserved one is 22 cm long and has seven holes.

Several half-way marks have been discovered on some of these bone flutes, which indicate that the number of holes and the distances between them were accurately measured and amended before drilling, to ensure they accorded with the musical range in which the flutes were intended to function.

Once these flutes were made, a smaller hole was sometimes drilled beside a few finger holes to correct the deviation of intonation. This technique is still in use in Chinese instrument making.

""The discovery of the Jiahu bone flutes has improved our understanding of Chinese music history stretching back 10,000 years,"" says Chinese music expert Xiao Xinghua, who has studied bone flutes for more than 10 years.

But the discovery of Jiahu bone flutes also leaves many unsolved mysteries, Xiao adds. For example, the finger holes are only 0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter. How were such small and smooth holes drilled? What kind of tools did the flute makers use?

Another enigma concerns the flute makers' mathematical abilities and musical temperament. Only if both of these had existed to a high degree could they have determined the number of finger holes on each flute and their spacing so that all the finger holes were positioned to provide the perfect intonation on bones of varying length and thickness.

156,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Sad wombat who warmed hearts dies in Australia - World - DunyaNews Pakistan,https://dunyanews.tv/en/World/341915-Sad-wombat-who-warmed-hearts-dies-in-Australia,"""He just loved people so much, he fretted if he wasnt being handled.""

SYDNEY (AFP) - An Australian wombat who became depressed after a massive cyclone tore through his wildlife park home, depriving him of cuddles with tourists, has died, prompting an outpouring on social media.

Tonka, a bare-nosed wombat, was raised by rangers at Queensland’s Billabong Sanctuary after his mother was hit and killed on the road and he was rescued from her pouch.

The furry marsupial watched television with rangers, slept with a toy teddy bear, and delighted in having his tummy rubbed, the Sanctuary near Townsville said in a Facebook post.

But after the monster storm Cyclone Yasi tore through Queensland in 2011, prompting the closure of the park for 10 weeks, Tonka went into a mysterious decline, refusing food and losing weight.

It wasn’t until the park reopened that Tonka became his normal self, cleaning out his food bowl for the first time in weeks.

""The conclusion? Tonka had missed his pats and cuddles and become depressed! Since then he never looked back,"" the sanctuary said.

Tonka, who was seven, was put down on Saturday after extensive tests showed he had irreversible kidney damage.

Bob Flemming, who owns the park, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the response to Tonka’s death had been overwhelming.

""People have been sending in their photos of their experiences with Tonka, their children holding Tonka over the years,"" he said.

""He just loved people so much, he fretted if he wasn’t being handled.""

In hundreds of comments online, several people wrote that Tonka had been the highlight of their Australian trip.

""You will be missed so much. Will never forget your gorgeous waddle,"" wrote one.

94,Drought Sri Lanka,India’s Planned Investment in Sri Lanka’s Trincomalee Port Gets a Push - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/indias-planned-investment-sri-lankas-trincomalee-port-gets-push,"NEW DELHI - India’s plans to invest in a strategic port in Sri Lanka as a counterbalance to China’s massive infrastructure investments in the Indian Ocean island country got a push Wednesday as Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited New Delhi.

China’s development of the key Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, which is a gateway to crucial shipping lanes, has raised concerns in New Delhi about Beijing’s widening naval influence in its neighborhood.

In New Delhi, India and Sri Lanka signed a memorandum of understanding on economic cooperation and expressed commitment to its implementation. Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Gopal Baglay, tweeted that it signaled “deepening economic collaboration.”

The specific deal to develop the World War II oil storage facility in the eastern port of Trincomalee, South Asia’s deepest natural harbor, is expected to be signed next month when Modi visits Colombo.

Although India’s planned investment in energy infrastructure in Trincomalee will be far more modest compared to Beijing’s ambitious Hambantota project, analysts say it will enable New Delhi to secure a foothold and ensure that no other country uses the harbor for military purposes.

While Colombo has assured India that Hambantota will be used only for commercial activity, its potential use as a naval base worries New Delhi. Those worries have intensified since a Chinese submarine docked briefly in Colombo port in 2014.

FILE - A group of Sri Lankan visitors at the new deep water shipping port watch a Chinese dredging ships work in Hambantota, March 24, 2010.

India has long fretted about China’s expanding foothold in the Indian Ocean region through infrastructure projects in countries such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

“We find that India is now getting more and more strategically encircled by economic infrastructure projects,” according to Vijay Sakhuja, Director of the National Maritime Foundation in New Delhi.

Besides Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, he points to China’s building of Gwadar port in Pakistan. Warning that these projects, built to facilitate trade, also have a strategic element, he says, “We should not be surprised by frequent PLA [People’s Liberation Army] navy presence in the Indian Ocean, particularly in Gwadar, which will cause some discomfort to the naval planners in New Delhi.”

For Sri Lanka, India’s planned investment in the energy project in Trincomalee will help counterbalance the massive infrastructure deals signed with China by the former government of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had leaned heavily toward Beijing.

“The spin off of that [project] is balancing what is perceived as predominant Chinese influence as far as the economy is concerned,” said Paikiasothy Saravanumuttu at the Center for Policy Alternatives in Colombo.

The new government is trying to move away from the heavy dependance on Beijing for foreign investment. During a recent visit to Tokyo, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe sought Japanese investment for the Colombo and Trincomalee ports.",2017-04-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['infrastructure', 'lankan', 'port', 'lanka', 'sri', 'push', 'planned', 'lankas', 'foreign', 'hambantota', 'investment', 'indias', 'delhi', 'gets', 'trincomalee']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
484,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Mid-Year Budget Review - Ghanaians Want More Improvement in Their Lives - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907220631.html,"There is some anxiety among ordinary Ghanaians as to the measures the government is expected to introduce in the mid-year budget review to continue the path of stabilisation of the economy and place it on the path of strong, diversified and resilient growth.

Generating the needed resources through taxation and other fiscal policy measures are key to building a resilient economy, much in line with the government policy Ghana Beyond Aid sustainable development agenda.

Boosting revenue mobilisation by strengthening tax administration, plugging revenue loopholes and leakages, and combating tax evasion, building reasonable levels of foreign reserves, maintaining a solid balance of payment position and maintaining overall stability of the Ghana cedi against currencies of major trading partners are key priorities of the government.

It is our expectation that the measures that the government plans to introduce must help to consolidate the relatively economic gains achieved in order to create more wealth and prosperity for the benefit of all.

The Trade Union Congress (TUC), Ghana, as the mouthpiece of Ghanaian workers, at the end of its General Council Meeting on June 28, among other concerns, expressed the need to effectively translate the gains in the macroeconomic management into real and visible improvements in the living conditions of Ghanaians.

""Indicators presented by the Ghana Statistical Service and the Economic Management Team suggest that the economy is growing and there is some relative macroeconomic stability. The figures show that inflation and fiscal deficit have been declining consistently; there is trade surplus, and the value of the Ghana Cedi has stabilised in terms of the major international currencies,"" the TUC has noted.

The TUC, however, pointed out ""We have pointed out time and again in our previous statements, the apparent good sets of macroeconomic statistics are not adequately and visibly reflecting in the lives of the majority of Ghanaians... .the cost of living remain high, while the economy is growing, real wages are declining. No economy can grow on sustainability basis if real purchasing power keeps declining.""

""The people of Ghana are expecting that the improvement in the macroeconomic management, as shown by the macroeconomic indicators, should reflect visibly in their pockets and in their lives,"" the TUC added.

The Ghanaian Times cannot agree more with the sentiments expressed by the TUC, and also humbly summit that the economy must be resilient enough to meet the aspiration of the ordinary Ghanaian.

There is growing inequalities in the country, evidently confirming that economic gains are only concentrated in few hands, at the expense of the majority.

We are aware of pro-poor policies and other social protection interventions, but how sustainable are these measures?

Under the Sustainable Development Goals, agenda 2030, for which Ghana is a chief advocate, we are expected to work hard towards achieving economic growth that will help translate into economic well-being and welfare of Ghanaians and to reduce inequality as much as possible.

It is refreshing that the Sustainable Development Goals Voluntary National Report showed that macroeconomic indicators including budget deficits, inflation and interest rates were declining, poverty has declined from 24 per cent to 23 per cent in 2017, and that trade balance recorded surpluses in 2017 and 2018, resulting in improved balance of payment terms.

The efforts of the economic management team is laudable, and Ghanaians still expect them to do more to grow the economy and ensure economic benefits truly reflect in the lives of majority of Ghanaians so that no one is left behind.",2019-07-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['review', 'lives', 'macroeconomic', 'ghanaians', 'budget', 'economy', 'midyear', 'sustainable', 'development', 'management', 'economic', 'trade', 'ghana', 'tuc', 'improvement']",Ghana,news article,English

â?¢ The March to May (MAM) rainfall period was one of the wettest the region has seen since 1981 (Figure 1), following an already record wet 2019 October to December (OND) rainfall period.

â?¢ The early onset of rains and above-average rainfall since February promoted land preparation and planting activities for the MAM season across Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, along with the Belg season in Ethiopia.

â?¢ However, the abundant rains have also caused localized flooding, mudslides, flashfloods, and river overflows over the past months causing casualties, population displacement, infrastructure damage, and crop damage in parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and Yemen.

Two cars crashed due to the balcony’s collapse, resulting in two injuries.

A combination of snowfall for 15 minutes and rainwater reaching 20cm high caused Mansoura’s streets to flood, halting traffic in many areas.

Numerous shop owners called emergency services and the governorate operations room for help after their establishments were flooded.

One shop worker, Mustafa Ali, said: “The water entered the stores and goods and electrical appliances were destroyed. We were unable to control it due to the clogging of sanitation.”

A child was also electrocuted in Port Said Street after several electrical poles fell, and was taken to the hospital for treatment.

Rains shattered the windows of two cars and billboards fell as a result of strong winds, while a tree fell on a car Al-Jaish Street near the Daqahliya Supply Directorate with no injuries.

Authorities across Egypt continue to face the wave of bad weather hitting various governorates, and are following up progress on clearing clearing floods as well as running traffic on alternative roads to keep citizens safe.

45,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Opinion | The Other Refugee Crisis - New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/opinion/the-other-refugee-crisis.html,"Gaza is perhaps the best example of this. The eight original refugee camps have morphed into towns that, together, are now one of the most densely populated areas in the world, home to 1.7 million people. Separate from the U.N.H.C.R. and with a different mandate, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East was founded in 1949 for around 750,000 Arab Palestinians forced to flee their homes in 1948. But with no peace deal or return in sight, the agency looks after their five million descendants at a cost to the international community of over $1 billion a year. The agency was supposed to be an exception, but Gaza now looks like the rule. In Dadaab, the United Nations resettles around 2,000 refugees annually to Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States. But the birthrate in the camp of 1,000 a month will always outstrip that effort.

As refugee populations spiral higher, host nations usually move toward ever stricter encampment policies. Kenya is one of the strictest; last year the police rounded up thousands of refugees found outside designated camps and incarcerated them in the national stadium. Pakistan has threatened several times not to renew refugee status for Afghan refugees, and periodically attempts to force people back to Afghanistan. In Jordan, refugees have the right to move and work in theory, but authorities have reportedly issued no new work permits since 2014 and have begun coercive administrative measures to keep them in the camps.

To leave Dadaab, residents require a “movement pass,” just like under apartheid. Acquiring one usually involves a bribe. Thus, members of the third generation that is now beginning life in Dadaab may well spend their whole life in the camp. If they win one of the fiercely contested slots at secondary school, they could gain diplomas and degrees online or through the mail, but when there’s no viable path to a free future elsewhere, education in the closed camp is a cruel trick: There are no jobs except volunteer positions with the aid agencies that run the hospitals, schools and social programs, and these pay a fraction of what Kenyan staff members receive for doing the same job.

One might expect that in such circumstances, talent would curdle into bitterness, but the most striking thing about Dadaab is that the miserable conditions do not seem to have engendered radicalization. People are frustrated, but until now, the isolation of the camp and the United Nations mantras on rights and gender balance have fostered a subdued but tolerant society in which women are more emancipated than their sisters back in Somalia.

This is the ultimate contradiction of camp life: how to locate hope for the future in a desperate situation that appears permanent. People are trying. Life in Dadaab and all the other camps is a daily exercise in manufacturing hope. But for many, the fiction of temporariness no longer holds. And we are seeing the results of that realization washing up on Europe’s beaches.",2015-10-09 07:00:00+00:00,"['nations', 'times', 'united', 'refugee', 'camp', 'life', 'refugees', 'york', 'camps', 'dadaab', 'work', 'agency', 'crisis']",Somalia,news article,English

603,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Sex-for-food: girls face impossible choices in Southern Africa - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/sex-food-girls-face-impossible-choices-southern-africa,"From sex-for-food to forced marriage, girls are caught between impossible choices for survival as severe food shortages sweep across Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique.

The Southern African food crisis is especially acute in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Zambia, which account for 75% of the people needing food assistance.

The ongoing food crisis in the four countries is compounded by a number of factors including drought, the effects of cyclone Idai and its related flooding, conflict and economic downturn.

INCREASING NUMBER OF GIRLS LACK FOOD SECURITY

“Plan International is extremely concerned at the increasing number of adolescent girls caught up in food insecurity, especially where they are being traded off by family members in an effort to earn the next meal,” says Stuart Katwikirize, Plan International Regional Head of Disaster Risk Management.

The organisation is calling on the international community to make assistance available to millions in desperate need, particularly children and adolescent girls who are at highest risk.

HOW ARE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN MOZAMBIQUE?

In Mozambique multiple and consecutive incidents, including drought, cyclones, floods and insecurity, have left an estimated 2.5 million people - almost 10 per cent of the country’s population - in need of lifesaving and resilience-building assistance. In addition, an estimated 67,500 children under the age of five are in need of treatment for acute malnutrition (6,500 children for severe acute malnutrition and 61,000 for moderate acute malnutrition).

Poor performance of the January-March 2019 rainy season in southern provinces (Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane caused substantial agricultural losses, with lingering effects expected to last until the next main harvest in February 2020.

“Drought affects men, women, girls and boys in different ways because their roles and responsibilities are different. Adolescent girls and women are typically more affected by drought because it is usually their job to find water and food for the family, therefore they are more likely to drop out of school to care for their younger siblings as their parents travel long distances looking for food.” Says Anne Hoff, Country Director, Plan International Mozambique.

HOW ARE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE?

Zimbabwe is facing a multi-layered crisis as a result of the El Nino induced poor seasonal rainfall, the devastating impact of Cyclone Idai and a challenging political and macroeconomic environment characterised by hyper-inflation and very low incomes affecting 5.5 million people living in both rural and urban areas.

“Children are increasingly dropping out of school because of hunger issues which remains a serious concern,” said Angela Muriithi, Country Director, Plan International Zimbabwe. “An estimated 2.2 million people in urban areas are facing food and economic insecurity, with 53% of households in Harare reporting inability to pay school fees.”

HOW ARE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN ZAMBIA?

In Zambia, about 2.3 million people during the lean season, between October 2019 and March 2020, are estimated will suffer from severe food insecurity following the devastating effects of erratic rains, drought, water logging and the late start to the 2018/2019 rainy season which had affected agriculture production.

“Overall purchasing power is fast deteriorating for most vulnerable households exacerbating burdens for women and girls. If urgent humanitarian action is not taken to assist communities in desperate need, the situation will get much worse,” said Ramin Shahzamani, Country Director, Plan International Zambia.

HOW ARE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN MALAWI?

In Malawi, 1.06 million people (7% of population) are expected to be severely food insecure between October 2019 and March 2020. The affected population is in 27 out of 28 districts. The main drivers of food insecurity in Malawi this season include floods, drought, infestations of the fall armyworm, and high prices for staple foods compared to last year and the 5-year average.

Plan International’s key priority is to support children, with a particular focus on vulnerable adolescent girls and young women who are now adopting negative and irreversible coping strategies in response to food insecurity, increasing their protection risks.

HOW ARE ADOLESCENT GIRLS AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA?

Limited access to basic sanitation services including menstrual and hygiene management as well as safe drinking water also remain a major obstacle to achieving improvements in the health and development of children and women in all four countries. It underpins a host of problems, contributing to childhood illness, malnutrition, and elevated school drop-out rates for adolescent girls, amongst other issues.

“Adolescent girls from highly food-insecure areas in rural areas are considerably more likely to migrate from rural to urban locations than boys of the same age, because of weaker bargaining power and access to opportunities within the household. In doing so, many girls face heightened risks of coerced and transactional sex and exploitative labour, as well as social isolation,” said Phoebe Kasoga, Country Director, Plan International Malawi.

The risk of exposure to domestic violence and intimate partner violence is also expected to increase as a consequence of heightened family tensions.

664,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Ras Gharib citizens protest flood response during PM's visit - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/ras-gharib-citizens-protest-flood-response-during-pm-s-visit/,"Prime Minister Sherif Ismail's visit to Ras Gharib on Saturday was interrupted by angry residents protesting what they see as a slow response to flooding in the area.

Ismail visited the Red Sea town in order to inspect the official response to 48 hours of flooding from heavy rain that destroyed homes, cut roads and power supplies, killing and injuring dozens.

The government has ordered emergency funds to restore services and repair damaged infrastructure, as well as compentation for the families of those killed and injured.

However, Ismail's visit to Ras Gharib lasted only 25 minutes, with several relatives stopping his motorcade and preventing him from entering the downtown area.

Dozens of residents cut the coastal road leading to Cairo, chanting slogans against the prime minister, complaining about water and electricity cuts resulting from the floods.

Ismail tried to calm citizens and promised to meet all their demands.

He said that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had informed him by telephone that LE50 million would be allocated for compensating those affected by the floods, in addition to another LE50 million to repair damaged infrastructure.

According to the Health Ministry, 27 people have so far been confirmed dead across four governorates, although the number may rise as more bodies turn up.

The death toll in Ras Gharib rose to 11 after residents found a dead man 20 kilometers south of the city.

A committee from the Ministry of Solidarity carried out an inventory of the losses prior to compensating those affected in Ras Gharib.

Each of the families of those killed will be granted LE10,000, with the familes of those injured getting LE2,000 to each.

In 2004, Paul Martin's Liberals chose to drop Jean Chrétien's policy and tack in a more pro-Israel direction. The change became public when Canada voted alongside the U.S. against a motion at the United Nations that affirmed the right of Palestinians ""to mobilize support for their cause."" Although Stephen Harper and his Conservatives would continue to claim to be better friends of Israel, it was clear from 2004 on that the differences between the parties amounted to only a matter of degree. Differences shrank further in 2012 when Tom Mulcair, a self-described ""ardent supporter of Israel in all instances and circumstances,"" won the leadership of the New Democratic Party. That consensus of party leaderships began to dissolve with Jagmeet Singh's election as NDP leader in October 2017. The latest Gaza war has shaken things up again. ""I don't think Canadian politics on this particular issue is the same as it was a month ago,"" said Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith. ""And I don't know that it ever will be the same."" Today, Paul Manly represents Nanaimo-Ladysmith for the Greens, but until 2014, he was a New Democrat. ""I was one of 14 candidates that were rejected by the NDP for having said anything about Israel and Palestine,"" he told CBC News. Former New Democrat MP Jim Manly makes a statement in a pre-recorded video released on YouTube on Oct. 20, 2012, after the ship Estelle was commandeered by Israeli troops.(Canadian Press) In 2012 Manly's father, Jim, himself a former NDP MP and United Church minister, was detained by Israeli commandos who boarded a vessel that was attempting to break Israel's naval blockade and deliver supplies to Gaza. ""When my father was in detention in Israel, no NDP MP would speak out for him, and my own member of Parliament was told that she couldn't speak about the issue,"" Manly said. ""So to not be able to speak up for a constituent stuck in an international situation when other countries are speaking for their citizens really lays bare the hard line that was taken by Tom Mulcair at the time."" Greens divided But Manly's new party has also experienced friction in the wake of recent events. A statement by Green Party Leader Annamie Paul calling for a ceasefire and condemning both Palestinian rocket attacks and excessive Israeli military force appeared to be an attempt to put forward a moderate position close to that of the Trudeau government. Green MP Jenica Atwin responded on Twitter: ""It is a totally inadequate statement.... End Apartheid."" Green MP Jenica Atwin blasted her own leader's statement on Gaza as ""totally inadequate.""(Twitter) Paul, who converted to Judaism 20 years ago, has spoken in Israeli media about the prejudice she faced when running for the Green Party leadership. ""It started out as innuendo, with veiled suggestions and attacks against me as a Zionist,"" she said. ""And then because neither we nor others responded to it, people became more emboldened and more explicit. ""I was accused of the usual tropes, including being in the pocket of foreign agents, being embedded in a political party to further the goals of those foreign agents, and the usual things related to money."" Green Leader Annamie Paul, a convert to Judaism, says she's faced prejudice in politics.(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) The recriminations fly This month, as tensions in the Middle East flared, it was Paul's senior adviser, Noah Zatzman, who charged that ""a range of political actors"" were disseminating ""appalling antisemitism and discrimination ... beginning with Jagmeet Singh and [former Green leadership candidate] Dimitri Lascaris and many Liberal, NDP and sadly, Green MPs."" (The entire Green caucus has only three members.) Zatzman told CBC News he wanted to be clear that his comments about Green MPs did not refer to Elizabeth May, whom he called ""a great friend of the Jewish community."" He said he has suffered ongoing harassment as a result of the position he took within the party, to the extent that his parents felt compelled to delist their address. A Facebook post by Noah Zatzman, senior adviser to Green Party leader Annamie Paul, accused the party's own MPs of antisemitic behaviour.(Facebook) ""I think using accusations of antisemitism to shut down legitimate criticism of human rights abuses is offensive and dangerous, and it dilutes the weight that word carries when it's used to identify real antisemitism,"" Manly told CBC News. Manly responded to Zatzman's claims by publishing an article by his friend and chief of staff, former Israeli soldier Ilan Goldenblatt, entitled ""Criticizing Human Rights Abuses Is Not Anti-Semitism."" NDP position shifting Paul Manly would not be disqualified from today's NDP. Singh hasn't moved the party as far or as fast as his critics on the left would like. But the party has moved beneath his feet. Delegates to the NDP's April convention supported motions calling for ""an end to Israeli occupation of Palestinian land"" and an end to ""all trade and economic cooperation with illegal settlements in Israel-Palestine."" When similar motions were proposed at the NDP convention in 2018, they failed even to come to a vote. The NDP's approach to Middle East policy seems to be shifting under leader Jagmeet Singh.(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) The motions led the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) to accuse the NDP of harbouring ""a toxic obsession with Israel."" It said Singh's comments on the recent conflict — by focusing on Palestinian victims while overlooking deaths and injuries from Hamas rockets — were ""cold-hearted, morally reprehensible and inconsistent with his previous statements on the matter."" But Singh has continued to recalibrate his position. ""If we want to achieve peace, we need to apply pressure to achieve it,"" he said this week, making it clear that pressure should be on Israel. Trudeau: Harper-era policy on autopilot Conservative Foreign Affairs critic Michael Chong gave CBC News a restrained statement just before the ceasefire: ""Canada's Conservatives have been clear that Israel is one of Canada's closest allies and we support Israel's right to defend itself. Dialogue and peaceful negotiation are the only path forward towards a settlement between Israelis and Palestinians and an eventual two-state solution. We urge calm and sincerely hope that hostilities cease."" While the Conservatives haven't changed their position on the topic, they have dialed back the volume. Support for Israel is no longer a staple of party fundraisers and the foreign policy focus has clearly shifted to China. The Conservative Party isn't really seeking to highlight differences with Trudeau's Liberals on the conflict — partly because there really aren't any big ones. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau maintained, without fanfare, Stephen Harper's pro-Israel voting record at the UN and, a few months after becoming prime minister, voted in Parliament to condemn BDS (the movement to boycott Israel) ""both here at home and abroad."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has largely maintained the Harper government policy on UN votes related to Israel.(Amr Alfiky/Reuters) When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Trudeau to intercede to discourage the International Criminal Court at The Hague from investigating the 2014 Israel-Gaza War, Trudeau wrote to the court that Palestinians, as stateless people, had no right to bring cases for war crimes. But some in his party no longer seem willing to go along with that approach. Splits in Liberal ranks Liberal MP Erskine-Smith said the government is too tolerant of Israeli settlements. ""For as long as I've followed politics, we haven't seen Canadian governments that have acted vocally consistent with Canadian foreign policy, which is that settlement expansion is contrary to international law,"" he said. In April, Erskine-Smith presented a petition calling on Canada to oppose the pending evictions of Palestinian families from homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem, an issue that helped trigger the recent deadly conflict. Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith says his government should take a harder line on Israeli settlement expansion.(CBC) ""There's an asymmetry to the conflict between Palestine and Israel,"" he told CBC News. ""And pressure needs to be brought to bear upon Israel to ensure that we don't see continued settlement expansion and we do see greater concern around human rights."" The Trudeau government has voted against dozens of UN resolutions that affirm existing tenets of Canadian policy — such as UN resolution 17/96, guaranteeing the protections of the Geneva Convention to Palestinian civilians. Like the Harper government, it says it does that to protest what it calls the singling out of Israel. Friendly criticism Erksine-Smith said he agrees that ""there are many other countries deserving of criticism on human rights bases as well. And so the singling out of Israel, I think, can be problematic. ""My overall view, though, is that for the very reason that we hold up Israel as an ally, as a democracy with an independent judiciary that shares our values in relation to human rights, it's on those grounds that we ought to criticize as a friend."" Both Liberal MP Erskine-Smith and Green MP Manly said they have been deluged with mail about events in Gaza, and both say they believe that strong reaction was conditioned by a year of protests over racial justice in North America. Changing times Erskine-Smith described a recent friendly conversation with an Israeli diplomat. ""My message to him was: I've not seen this level of correspondence from people who don't follow politics and aren't seized with this really complex issue,"" he said. ""And I think those who represent the Israeli government and Canada need to know that."" The MP said he told the diplomat that current Israeli policies are ""undermining Canadian support for our continued friendship."" If currents are shifting in Canada, Israeli politics are in turmoil. There is a strong chance that the Netanyahu era is drawing to an end. For those whose task it is to argue Israel's cause in Canada, a new Israeli government could make life easier. Israel's longest-running prime minister is too much of a known quantity to change many minds on either side of the debate in Canada. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.(Sebastian Scheiner/The Associated Press) While the NDP says it wants to halt Canada's arms sales to Israel (which are negligible anyway), what really matters to Israel is Canada's diplomatic support. Without it, Israel's guaranteed votes at the UN could shrink to only the U.S. and the handful of small Pacific Island states that vote with U.S. foreign policy. And even Washington's support — the cornerstone of Israel's security, along with its nuclear deterrent — is looking much less certain in these changed times.",2014-08-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['ancient', 'civilizations', 'israel', 'long', 'battled', 'shows', 'study', 'minister', 'cars', 'policy', 'green', 'israeli', 'paul', 'ndp', 'change', 'mp', 'party', 'climate', 'factories', 'trudeau']",China,news article,English
776,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Mother Nature chimes in as officials ponder controversial landfill proposal - ncpolicywatch.com,http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2020/11/13/mother-nature-chimes-in-as-officials-ponder-controversial-landfill-proposal/,"A day of dangerous flooding underscores concerns of local residents regarding proposed Vance County facility

The rain, curtains of it, had fallen in North Carolina all of Thursday. Relentless and unforgiving, floodwaters filled rivers and creeks, which broke their banks. It swept mud from hillsides, buckled roads, swallowed cars. It killed people in several counties.

For residents of Egypt Mountain Road in Kittrell, in rural Vance County, the flooding was an unspoken expert witness in their fight against a Land Clearing and Inert Debris Landfill proposed for their neighborhood.

Late Thursday afternoon, the Vance County Board of Adjustment heard more testimony about the potential environmental impacts of the LCID, as these landfills are known. LCIDs accept tons upon tons of trees, stumps, brush, unpainted wood and concrete, often from construction sites. If the board grants a conditional use permit, this LCID would be built within a half-mile of 60 homes, on roughly 80 acres of steep, rugged and forested terrain that bottoms out at Long Creek, a tributary to Tabbs Creek and the Tar River.

Two months ago, Kenneth Harrison III of K&K Organics, and his attorney, Tom Terrell, had deployed a battalion of expert witnesses — traffic engineers, real estate appraisers, landfill consultants — to testify in hopes of convincing the board to approve the plan. The residents were caught off-guard by the proceedings, which are quasi-judicial in nature and include sworn testimony, similar to a court. The board gave the residents 60 days to hire their own attorney and gather their own expert witnesses, which coincidentally included the flood.

Jeff Garrett lives with his wife Angie on 170 acres that have been in the family for five generations. His mother’s ashes are scattered on the farm, which abuts the property where the LCID would be built. “The creek floods five to 10 times a year,” Garrett said. “And five of those times it’s a major flood.”

The slopes on the proposed landfill acreage are steep, a 70-foot drop in some places. “You’re talking about a lot of water,” Garrett said, comparing the force to “throwing a bowling ball from the top of a hill.”

“How in the world will you build a containment that will hold that water before it gets to the creek?” he added. “There’s a place for these sites, a place far from water.”

John Alderman, a retired biologist with the state Wildlife Resource Commission, discovered freshwater mussels in Tabbs Creek more than 30 years ago— about 350 million years after they emerged from primordial soup. “They watched the dinosaurs come and go,” Alderman said. “The waters were filled with these creatures. Now 80% of the species have been wiped out.”

Both endangered and threatened species of mussels live in Long and Tabbs creeks. Birds, fish and mammals eat mussels, which are also vital to maintaining water quality by filtering out pollutants.

Alderman now works as a consultant to industry, including developers of megasites. “I tell my clients, ‘Put your site where there will be the least damage, the least impact. Be careful. These creatures are going extinct on our watch.'”

Terrell asked Alderman if he “had any evidence” that the LCID would be improperly designed and maintained.

“These designs aren’t made for major rain events,” Alderman replied. “It is not the engineers’ fault. These are 500-, 1,000-year storm events. Whatever is approved can be washed out.”

Terrell has a reputation for being an aggressive, at times even rude litigator. His line of attack was to question the opponents’ witnesses if they had “evidence” that environmental laws would not be followed or enforced.

While it’s impossible to speculate on this particular project, Jill Howell, the Tar-Pamlico Riverkeeper said, the fact that Harrison had already broken environmental laws by illegally dumping on the property without a permit shows “bad faith.”

In addition, the NC Department of Environmental Quality is so short-staffed and underfunded that its enforcement and inspections have suffered. The agency has lost a third of its funding and more than 370 employees in the past 10 years, and, stretched thin, inspectors can visit landfills only once a year, sometimes less frequently. For example, after notifying the agency of illegal clearing along a stream in eastern North Carolina, Howell said, it took two weeks for inspectors to visit the area. Two months later, dirt was still flowing into the waterway. A year later, the site still hasn’t been restored, she said.

Sedimentation and erosion are the least glamorous aspects of environmental protection, but controlling the flow of dirt is essential. When sediment accumulates in rivers and creeks, it clogs fish gills, blocks light, and carries pollutants from the land. It consumes space where water would otherwise go, and worsens flooding. If the land is cleared for the LCID, the trees and vegetation that currently hold the dirt in place and control flood waters will be gone, leaving exposed hillsides that would turn to mud.

“LCIDs can have minimum impacts if sited correctly,” said Howell, who has a master’s degree from Yale University in environmental management. “Flat topography, distance to water and homes. This is site is far from ideal. It poses unreasonable risks to Long and Tabb creeks and the Tar River.”

Former legislator and U.S. attorney, ex-state Treasurer and now a bank president, Richard Moore lives on Egypt Mountain Road about four miles from the proposed LCID site. “This thing is going to be humming wide open,” Moore said, adding that he’s concerned not only about traffic, but about invasive beetles riding in on the trucks filled with brush and trees. From there, the insects can spread and decimate forests. “I’m scared for my timber.”

Kittrell, Moore noted, was the first resort in North Carolina, known for its natural springs. The water table is high, gurgling just below the surface.

“The aquifers in this area are really special,” Moore said. “Water is everywhere.”

As the meeting ended Thursday evening, downstream the Tar River kept rising. In Tarboro, it’s projected to crest tomorrow at nearly 32 feet, major flood stage.

Our activities in the flood-affected areas of Sindh are part of MSFs commitment to support the Pakistani authorities in responding to emergencies, including natural disasters, MSF country representative in Pakistan Aymen Abdullah said in a statement. We have also donated medicines to the local authorities to support them in meeting urgent medical needs in the area.

More than 350 villages in Sindhs Dadu district were affected by the floods after heavy rainfall in August 2020. Dadu was one of the worst hit areas in the province and its population of over 240,000 were declared calamity-affected by the provincial government. While the floods damaged the houses, roads were also washed away thereby further limiting peoples access to healthcare facilities.

The post-flood period is critical as there is a high risk of outbreaks of vector-borne and water-borne diseases such as malaria. The objective of our mobile clinics was to improve peoples access to healthcare by providing them with basic care at their doorstep and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. We treated patients with acute respiratory diseases, skin infections, malaria and other illnesses, said Anna Cilliers, MSF medical coordinator.

MSF is also supporting Sindhs department of health in an awareness campaign on dengue fever. The cases of dengue fever in Karachi increased recently, and 12 union councils of East and South Karachi were declared hotspots. MSF is broadcasting awareness messages of prevention and protection from dengue fever through TV channels, cable networks and social media.

600,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,"The climate crisis, migration, and refugees - Brookings Institution",https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-climate-crisis-migration-and-refugees/,"The following is one of eight briefs commissioned for the 16th annual Brookings Blum Roundtable, “2020 and beyond: Maintaining the bipartisan narrative on US global development.”

On March 14, 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai struck the southeast coast of Mozambique. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported that 1.85 million people needed assistance. 146,000 people were internally displaced, and Mozambique scrambled to house them in 155 temporary sites.1 The cyclone and subsequent flooding damaged 100,000 homes, destroyed 1 million acres of crops, and demolished $1 billion worth of infrastructure.2

John Podesta Founder and Director - The Center for American Progress

One historic storm in one place over the course of one day. While Cyclone Idai was the worst storm in Mozambique’s history, the world is looking towards a future where these “unprecedented” storms are commonplace. This global challenge has and will continue to create a multitude of critical issues that the international community must confront, including:

Large-scale human migration due to resource scarcity, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and other factors, particularly in the developing countries in the earth’s low latitudinal band

Intensifying intra- and inter-state competition for food, water, and other resources, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa

Increased frequency and severity of disease outbreaks

Increased U.S. border stress due to the severe effects of climate change in parts of Central America

All of these challenges are serious, but the scope and scale of human migration due to climate change will test the limits of national and global governance as well as international cooperation.

The migration-climate nexus is real, but more scrutiny and action are required

In 2018, the World Bank estimated that three regions (Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia) will generate 143 million more climate migrants by 2050.3 In 2017, 68.5 million people were forcibly displaced, more than at any point in human history. While it is difficult to estimate, approximately one-third of these (22.5 million4 to 24 million5 people) were forced to move by “sudden onset” weather events—flooding, forest fires after droughts, and intensified storms. While the remaining two-thirds of displacements are the results of other humanitarian crises, it is becoming obvious that climate change is contributing to so-called slow onset events such as desertification, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, air pollution, rain pattern shifts and loss of biodiversity.6 This deterioration will exacerbate many humanitarian crises and may lead to more people being on the move.

Multilateral institutions, development agencies, and international law must do far more to thoroughly examine the challenges of climate change (early efforts, like the World Bank’s 2010 World Development Report on climate change,7 had little uptake at a time when few thought a climate crisis was around the corner). Moreover, neither a multilateral strategy nor a legal framework exist to account for climate change as a driver of migration. Whether in terms of limited access to clean water, food scarcity, agricultural degradation, or violent conflict,8 climate change will intensify these challenges and be a significant push factor in human migration patterns.

To date, there are only a few cases where climate change is the sole factor prompting migration. The clearest examples are in the Pacific Islands. The sea level is rising at a rate of 12 millimeters per year in the western Pacific and has already submerged eight islands. Two more are on the brink of disappearing, prompting a wave of migration to larger countries.910 By 2100, it is estimated that 48 islands overall will be lost to the rising ocean.11 In 2015, the Teitota family applied for refugee status in New Zealand, fleeing the disappearing island nation of Kiribati.12 Their case, the first request for refuge explicitly attributed climate change, made it to the High Court of New Zealand but was ultimately dismissed. Islands in the Federated States of Micronesia have drastically reduced in size, washed down to an uninhabitable state, had their fresh water contaminated by the inflow of seawater, and disappeared in the past decade.13 Despite their extreme vulnerability, the relatively small population (2.3 million people spread across 11 countries14) and remote location of the Pacific Islands means that they garner little international action, for all the attention they receive in the media.

Although there are few instances of climate change as the sole factor in migration, climate change is widely recognized as a contributing and exacerbating factor in migration and in conflict.

In South Asia, increasing temperatures, sea level rise, more frequent cyclones, flooding of river systems fed by melting glaciers, and other extreme weather events are exacerbating current internal and international migration patterns. Additionally, rapid economic growth and urbanization are accelerating and magnifying the impact and drivers of climate change—the demand for energy is expected to grow 66 percent by 2040.15 Compounding this, many of the expanding urban areas are located in low-lying coastal areas, already threatened by sea level rise.16 The confluence of these factors leads the World Bank to predict that the collective South Asian economy (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) will lose 1.8 percent of its annual GDP due to climate change by 2050.17 The New York Times reports that the living conditions of 800 million people could seriously diminish.18 Diminishing living conditions on this scale and intensity will prompt mass migration—possibly at an unprecedented level.

Northwest Africa is facing rising sea levels, drought, and desertification. These conditions will only add to the already substantial number of seasonal migrants and put added strain on the country of origin, as well as on destination countries and the routes migrants travel. The destabilizing effects of climate change should be of great concern to all those who seek security and stability in the region. Climate and security experts often cite the impacts of the extreme drought in Syria that preceded the 2011 civil war.19 The security community also highlights the connection between climate change and terrorism—for instance, the decline of agricultural and pastoral livelihoods has been linked to the effectiveness of financial recruiting strategies by al-Qaida.20

The intersection of climate change and migration requires new, nimble, and comprehensive solutions to the multidimensional challenges it creates. Accordingly, the signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change requested that the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change (WIM) develop recommendations for addressing people displaced by climate change.21 Similarly, The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration (adopted by 164 countries—not including the U.S.—in Marrakech in December 2018) called on countries to make plans to prevent the need for climate-caused relocation and support those forced to relocate.22 However, these agreements are neither legally binding nor sufficiently developed to support climate migrants—particularly migrants from South Asia, Central America, Northwest Africa, and the Horn of Africa.

Time to envision legal recourse for climate refugees

As gradually worsening climate patterns and, even more so, severe weather events, prompt an increase in human mobility, people who choose to move will do so with little legal protection. The current system of international law is not equipped to protect climate migrants, as there are no legally binding agreements obliging countries to support climate migrants.

While climate migrants who flee unbearable conditions resemble refugees, the legal protections afforded to refugees do not extend to them. In the aftermath of World War II, the United Nations established a system to protect civilians who had been forced from their home countries by political violence. Today, there are almost 20.4 million officially designated refugees under the protection of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)—however, there is an additional group of 21.5 million people23 who flee their homes as a result of sudden onset weather hazards every year.24

The UNHCR has thus far refused to grant these people refugee status, instead designating them as “environmental migrants,” in large part because it lacks the resources to address their needs. But with no organized effort to supervise the migrant population, these desperate individuals go where they can, not necessarily where they should. As their numbers grow, it will become increasingly difficult for the international community to ignore this challenge. As severe climate change displaces more people, the international community may be forced to either redefine “refugees” to include climate migrants or create a new legal category and accompanying institutional framework to protect climate migrants. However, opening that debate in the current political context would be fraught with difficulty. Currently, the nationalist, anti-immigrant, and xenophobic atmosphere in Europe and the U.S. would most likely lead to limiting refugee protections rather than expanding them.

The SDGs can help, but not without an update to the US response

While there are no legally binding international regimes that protect climate migrants, there are voluntary compacts that could be used to support them. Most notably, 193 countries adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which address both migration and climate change.

Several of the 169 targets established by the SDGs lay out general goals that could be used to protect climate migrants. SDG 13 on climate action outlines several targets that address the climate crisis:

13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries

13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning

13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

To meet these goals, extensive bilateral and multilateral development assistance will be needed. The U.S. must create a strategic approach to focus development assistance and multilateral organizations on those targets—particularly to create resilient societies that can keep people in their communities.

Although the SDGs do not explicitly link climate change and migration, SDG target 10.7 calls for signatories to “facilitate orderly, safe, and responsible migration of people, including through implementation of planned and well-managed policies.” Again, the United States should channel multilateral development assistance to support the implementation of this target.

The scale and scope of climate change demand dynamic and comprehensive solutions. The U.S. must address climate stress on vulnerable populations specifically, rather than funneling more money into existing programs that operate on the periphery of the growing crisis.

U.S. development agencies and international development financial institutions need to redirect their development assistance to incorporate today’s unfolding climate crisis. Significantly more resources will need to be channeled to the new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (USDFC), USAID, the Green Climate Fund, UNHCR, as well as to other critical international bodies, in particular those that make up the International Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations.

The Obama administration undertook myriad efforts to update the institutions that can address climate. Several of President Obama’s executive orders, particularly Executive Order 13677, which required incorporating climate resilience into decisionmaking on development assistance, took on the climate crisis. For the first time in the Department of Defense’s history, the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) recognized climate change as a “threat multiplier,” with the potential to exacerbate current challenges.25

While the current administration has deemphasized or opposed climate-friendly approaches, the current security implications of the migration crisis might prompt a re-examination of those policies. There should be bipartisan support, particularly in the security community, for reducing the conditions that accelerate international migration.

The case for scaling up US action to confront the climate crisis

A variety of medium-term investments (five to 10 years) could create more resilience to the effects of climate change. For example, the climate change factors that push migration in Northwest Africa could—at least in part—be addressed by supporting irrigation infrastructure, providing food supplies, fostering regional water cooperation, and supporting livelihood security.26

Dedicating greater resources to mitigate climate migration is also part of an effective solution. Research is needed to determine the best way to improve the migratory process itself—be it increasing migration monitors, providing safer modes of transport, and consolidating and expanding destination country integration resources.

This discussion is not new: In 2010, Center for American Progress staff were part of a task force that suggested a “Unified Security Budget” for the United States, to address complex crisis scenarios that transcend the traditional division of labor among defense, diplomacy, and development.27 The need for longer-term, more calculated assessment strategies and investments has only increased over the past decade. The Pentagon already supports a variety of operational missions that respond to sudden onset climate disasters. The Navy, in particular, serves at the emergency hotline for international extreme weather events and mobilized to support the Haitian people after the 2010 earthquake, the Filipino people after the 2013 typhoon, and the Nepalis after the 2015 earthquake.

Alternatively, creating a single dedicated fund (by drawing funds from Operations and Maintenance, Research and Development, and the Refugee Assistance Fund) would allow the United States to streamline and refine its support strategies, address the effects of climate change directly, and rebuild its reputation abroad. Such a dedicated fund should try to emulate and partner with the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), Germany’s Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), and Japan’s International Cooperation Agency (JICA). American seed funding in this area could lead to major investments of allies and partners—and in cooperation with the development agencies of these countries can mobilize massive resources at the scale required to confront the global climate crisis.

The strategies to address climate migrants presented here are far reaching, but this crisis will only intensify, and our response to it will define international relations in the 21st century.",2019-07-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['refugees', 'change', 'climate', 'crisis', 'support', 'development', 'address', 'countries', 'international', 'million', 'migration', 'migrants']",Mozambique,news article,English
652,FL-2016-000114-EGY,'Worst over': Australia begins flood clean-up - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/worst-over-australia-begins-flood-clean-up/,"Weary residents in Australia’s flood-hit northeast returned home Wednesday to begin a massive clean-up after almost two weeks of heavy rain, as the wild weather moved south to inundate more towns.

Communities remain cut off and thousands are still without power in the state of Queensland, but the weather bureau said the downpours that have seen areas doused with more than 300 millimeters (11.8 inches) of rain daily were easing.

“It looks like the worst is probably over,” Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Vinord Anand told AFP.

“We are still seeing rainfall rates that are meeting our severe weather warning criteria, but rainfall totals are not high as they have been in the last five to 10 days.”

The daily rainfall totals were falling below 250 millimeters and would “ease slightly” on Thursday and Friday as the monsoonal trough slowly moves offshore, he added.

Australia’s tropical north typically experiences heavy rains during the monsoon season, but the recent downpours have seen some areas get a year’s worth of rainfall in just a week.

The rains turned roads into rivers and were so incessant authorities were forced to open floodgates of a major dam on Sunday.

With floodwaters receding in some areas of the hard-hit city of Townsville, residents headed home to help each other clean up their mud-caked properties.

“Just coming up the driveway, looking at all the mud, that’s when it hit home,” resident Clayton Linning told national broadcaster ABC Wednesday.

“There are a lot of neighbors we’ve never met before and now we have, which is really nice. It’s an unfortunate way to have to build community but it does.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said Wednesday that officials were working to ensure affected locals would get access to recovery payments and support.

The Insurance Council of Australia added that claims were “rising by the hour”, with losses of Aus$45 million (US$32 million) from 3,500 applications so far.

More than 100 extra police have been deployed to help with the disaster, while the army, which has a major base in Townsville, has also been active.

Meanwhile police said they had launched an investigation into the deaths of two men aged 21 and 23 after their bodies were found in floodwaters, amid local media reports officers had been chasing them after an alleged liquor store break-in.",2019-02-06 08:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'residents', 'rainfall', 'seen', 'australia', 'weather', 'townsville', 'areas', 'rains', 'told', 'totals', 'rain', 'worst', 'begins', 'cleanup']",Egypt,news article,English
931,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Agency warns states contiguous to River Niger to brace up for impending flood - Guardian Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/news/agency-warns-states-contiguous-to-river-niger-to-brace-up-for-impending-flood/,"As River Niger reaches red alert

Following warning alert received from the Niger Basin Authority indicating that River Niger has reached Red alert of 6.60m the Nigerian Hydrological Service Agency has warned states contiguous to the Niger River to brace up for impending flood disaster.

The agency warned that It is expected that the flood magnitude sighted in Niamey, Niger Republic on the 23rd August 2020 would arrive Nigeria through Kebbi state on the 6th of September and flood other states contiguous to River Niger including Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa

NHSA Director General Engr Clement Nze in a press statement made available to journalists yesterday explained that he River Niger Basin which covers nine (9) countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote DIvoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, has Nigeria at the lowest portion of the Basin, meaning that that once the upper catchment of the Basin gets flooded, Nigeria should be prepared to experience flooding incident.

He said As at today, the Middle Niger of the Niger Basin made up of Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso and part of Mali, have been flooded. The flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malanville (Benin Republic) have gotten to the Red Alert Zone

Nze pointed out that Operators of Kainji and Jebba Dams have long been alerted to take appropriate measures in the operation of the reservoirs and accordingly, Kainji Dam is now spilling water at the rate of 1,000 m3/s that is 86.4 million cubic metres/day, saying this means that communities downstream Kainji and Jebba Dams could be flooded while Shiroro Dam on Kaduna River is still impounding, though there is the possibility of spilling water in the weeks ahead.

On River Benue sub-basin, the DG stated that the agency has maintained close contact with the Cameroonian authorities with regards to flood scenarios in the upper catchment of the sub-basin and Information received by NIHSA from the relevant authority in Cameroon stated that the Lagdo Dam is still impounding water.

He noted that the high intensity of rainfall during the last week of August has already saturated the soil and any rainfall of high intensity with long duration would translate into flooding in most part of the country.

He revealed that So far, Urban/Flash Flood has wrecked havocs in about 70 council areas in 20 states of the federation and the FCTof the Federation, including the FCT.

The NHSA boss recalled that the year 2020 Annual Flood Outlook predicted that some parts of at least 102 LGAs in 28 States fall within the Highly Probable Flood Risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 States of the Federation, including the FCT, fall within the Moderately Probable Flood Risk areas. The remaining 397 LGAs fall within the Low Probable Flood Risks areas.

It also warned The states that are contiguous to rivers Niger and Benue, namely:  Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa are likely to be affected by river flooding, while Coastal flooding is expected in Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, and Bayelsa States.

On account of poor drainage systems, flash and urban floods are expected to occur in major cities across the country, namely BirninKebbi, Sokoto, Lokoja, Kaduna, Suleja, Gombe, Yola, Makurdi, Abuja, Lafia, Asaba, Port Harcourt, Yenagoa, Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Benin City, Oshogbo, Ado-Ekiti, Abakaliki, Awka, Nsukka.

The DG warned that the country still has many days of rainfall in the course of the year and More floods are expected in the months of August, September and October this year, in the event there is release of excess water from the Dams in other countries upstream rivers Niger and Benue this year, this will have more negative impacts on Nigeria which is located downstream other countries in the Niger Basin.

He urged that to prevent flood disaster,

This was disclosed by the NHSA Director-General, Mr Clement Nze, in a press briefing on Wednesday in Abuja. He urged that strict town planning codes be enforced, calling for constructions of flood walls, buffer dams, dykes and other infrastructure that can hold water and prevent flooding.

What the NHSA is saying

Federal, states and local governments should clear drainage systems and canals, and embark on projects that will improve hydraulic conveyance of surface run-offs during peak flows carry out river training activities and maintenance of drainage areas through removal of silt and sediment deposits in rivers, to increase storage capacities, Nze said.

As per the latest news reports at 12.50 PM, CM Pinarayi Vijayan has reviewed all the efforts taken to tackle the rain havoc in Kerala and expressed satisfaction with regard to the flood relief efforts undertaken by the Army, Navy and the Air Force, NDRF as well as the Coast Guards. According to the latest tweet from the CM’s office, “As the the water level in Idukki dam continues to rise, more water will have to be released. It has been estimated that at least three times the volume that is being released now will have to be spillled. This will raise the water level in Periyar river and its subsidiaries.” Considering the situation, CM Pinarayi Vijayan has instructed to alert those people living in downstream areas with the help of announcements and pressed for relocating people living in vulnerable areas.

The death toll in Kerala has touched 26. Meanwhile, the IMD has predicted more rains across eight districts in Kerala in the next 48 hours and the situation looks grim at the ground level. Kerala rains are lashing down across the state like never before, leaving people in a state of utter helplessness and panic in areas that have been most affected. The latest update has come from the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, which has issued a tweet, announcing that a ban has been imposed on the movement of heavy goods vehicles and tourist vehicles in the high ranges of Idukki on account of the unabated rains in the area. There are also local news reports that drinking water supply was also hit in many places around Malappuram, Palakkad and Ernakulam districts. Today, the US government has also issued a travel advisory asking its citizens to refrain from visiting Kerala at this time.

What happened on Thursday across districts?

On Thursday, the decision to open one of the shutters of the Idukki dam on Thursday on a trial basis for hours led to a sense of foreboding and panic among the public. Following this, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan cautioned people not to panic and he stated that it is a ‘unprecedented situation’ whereby 22 dams had to be opened at one go and in the case of Idukki, dam, it was reopened after 26 years as per local news reports. Trial runs continued throughout the night. Past midnight, the water level mark at Idukki dam had touched 2400.38 ft. This morning, the water level had touched 2401 ft at 7 AM.

District Collectors were given permission to hire the necessary number of bulldozers, generators and lights. They were directed to provide essential supplies such as water, food, clothes and toilet facilities to the people in affected areas and those staying in relief camps. The service of doctors has been ensured in these camps.

Worst hit districts in Kerala?

The worst-hit districts have been Malappuram, Idduki, Wayanad, Kannur and Palakkad. People living near the banks of the Periyar river and other low-lying areas in Ernakulam were asked to stay alert since the time the red alerts have been issued. Already, 57 reliefs camps are functional in Ernakulam, with 1076 families staying there. There is considerable worry about the catchment areas around the Boothanthankettu dam, where the water levels are reportedly increasing and if more shutters of the Idukki dam are opened again, the water levels are bound to rise further.

When the dams were opened on Thursday, the areas around Palakkad and Aluva faced the onslaught of rising water levels. Wayanad and Idukki were badly hit, so was the Nilambur region. Landslides in five locations around Idukki district led to the death of at least 11 people on Thursday, including an entire family of five members and one person went missing. According to local news reports, the situation in Nilambur was grim.

Meanwhile, in Kozhikode district, close to a place called Thamarassery, a river had changed its course, causing the death of one person and destruction of at least twenty houses. On Wednesday night, however, the body of a youth was found three kilometers from the river and it was recovered on Thursday along with a vehicle. Another tragedy has been reported in Ernakulam district, where two Class 12 students died. However, the Cochin International airport had commenced with flight arrivals after a few hours of diverting flights from landing on Thursday afternoon.

768,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt has genuine intention to reach an agreement on GERD before flood season: Sisi - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online,https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/408479/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-has-genuine-intention-to-reach-an-agreement-.aspx,"Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said on Sunday that Egypt has a genuine political intention to reach an agreement on the Ethiopian dam (GERD) at the earliest opportunity and before the flood season.

El-Sisi’s remarks came in a message handed by Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry to Congolese President and Chair of the African Union this year Félix Antoine Tshisekedi, a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry read.

The Egyptian, Ethiopian, and Sudanese foreign and irrigation ministers are currently holding meetings in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa to resume talks on the GERD dispute under the auspices of the African Union.

Egypt and Sudan have warned of serious implications to their people and water interests if the second phase of filling the GERD is implemented without an agreement next July.

Ethiopia, however, reiterated its plans to complete the filling in that date whether or not an agreement is reached.

In his message, El-Sisi affirmed Egypt’s support to the efforts made by the Congolese president to help reach an agreement on the GERD.

El-Sisi said Egypt hopes that the current African Union-sponsored meetings succeed in launching an effective path for negotiations with the participation of international partners.

This effective path of negotiations should enable the three concerned countries to find solutions to the disputed technical and legal issues, with the aim of formulating a comprehensive agreement on the filling and operation of the dam, El-Sisi said in the message.

Egypt has welcomed and endorsed a Sudanese proposal in February to involve international partners as mediators in the talks. This includes a quartet of the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and the African Union. Ethiopia rejected the proposal, saying it is ready to talk only under the auspices of the African Union.

El-Sisi’s message hailed the Congolese efforts aiming to reach a balanced, legally binding agreement on the dam that would secure the interests of the three countries and enhance integrity and cooperation among them.

Sisi’s remarks come only a week after he took a hard line on the GERD dispute, warning that a compromise in Egypt’s water share was a “red line.” He pledged action if the country’s share of water from the Nile is jeopardised.

“No one can take a drop of water from Egypt,” El-Sisi said, warning of “inconceivable instability in the region that no one could imagine” if that is to happen.

Taking part in the Kinshasa talks, scheduled for 4-5 April, FM Shoukry affirmed that Egypt has maintained a genuine political will over the past 10 years to reach an agreement on the GERD.

He said this agreement should achieve Ethiopian developmental goals and, at the same time, protect the interests of Egypt and Sudan.

Shoukry “stressed the necessity that the Kinshasa meetings lead to launching a new round of negotiations that are characterised with efficiency and seriousness,” the foreign ministry said.

The FM also affirmed the need for international partners to attend the desired round of talks to guarantee their success.

These negotiations are considered the last chance that has to be exploited by the three countries in order to reach an agreement during the coming months and before the next flood season, Shoukry said.

Shoukry affirmed Egypt’s keenness to resolve the controversial issues that have obstructed previous rounds of negotiations.

Egypt’s Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdel-Ati also attended the talks and the meeting with the Congolese president.

Shoukry and Abdel-Ati reviewed with President Tshisekedi Egypt’s efforts over the last decade to reach an agreement on the GERD.

Shoukry affirmed that Egypt has consistently introduced solutions and proposals on the issue in a way that addresses Ethiopian concerns.

These solutions and proposals were meant to guarantee the achievement of Ethiopian developmental goals and also protect the interests of the downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan, Shoukry added.

The success of the current efforts to settle the GERD issue and avoid the aggravation of the situation in a region already suffering from turmoil and instability, however, requires a political will from all parties to reach a just agreement, Shoukry said.

Tshisekedi on Sunday said the goal of the Kinshasa talks is to revive the negotiation process among the three countries on the GERD, Al-Arabiya reported.

He affirmed the necessity to reach solutions to the issue within the framework of the African Union.

Tshisekedi also called for taking into account the humanitarian dimension of the GERD issue and working to achieve the interests of the three countries’ peoples.

Weather forecast Today: Predicting a very heavy rainfall in Mumbai, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded an orange alert for the city. An orange alert implies that authorities should be prepared to handle any situation arising out of severe weather conditions.

Ratnagiri district, which was ravaged by cyclonic storm Nisarga last month, is likely to receive extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places on Friday, while Raigad will receive heavy showers on Saturday, senior director of IMD Mumbai, Shubhangi Bhute, said.

Heavy to very heavy rains are likely to lash isolated places in Mumbai, she said. As per the IMD’s calculations, a rainfall between 64.5 mm and 115.5 mm in 24 hours is considered as heavy rainfall, while a downpour between 115.5 and 204.5 mm is very heavy rainfall. Rainfall above 204.5 mm in 24 hours is categorised as extremely heavy rainfall.

The IMD on Thursday said that a cyclonic circulation lies over south Gujarat and neighbourhood, and another cyclonic circulation lies over east Uttar Pradesh and neighbourhood in lower and mid tropospheric levels.

Under their influence, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy to very heavy falls is likely along the west coast, Gujarat, interior Maharashtra over the next 5 days. Konkan and Goa are likely to receive isolated heavy to very heavy falls on July 3 and 4.

Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, east UP are expected to receive scattered to fairly widespread rain over the next 24 hours.

Widespread rain is likely to continue in northeast India and east India during the next 5 days.

Subdued rainfall activity over western Himalayan region and adjoining northwest India are likely to continue during the next 2 days and its distribution and intensity are very likely to increase further.

Isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall with isolated extremely heavy falls are expected over north Konkan on during next two days, over Gujarat region on July 4-5 and over Madhya Maharashtra on July 4.

Isolated heavy to very heavy falls are also very likely over coastal Karnataka during till Saturday and over Saurashtra and Kutch during July 4 to 6.

IMD has forecast partly cloudy sky for Delhi today, with possibility of thunder and lightning. The maximum temperature in the city will be around 39 and 30 degrees Celcius respectively.

For Mumbai, the IMD predicted generally cloudy sky with moderate rain. The maximum and minimum temperatures will be 33 and 25 degrees Celcius respectively.

Yesterday, the highest maximum temperature of 44.8 degrees Celcius was recorded from Bikaner in west Rajasthan while Amraoti in Vidarbha reported the lowest minimum temperature of 20.3 degrees Celcius.",2020-07-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['imd', 'issues', 'india', 'likely', 'today', 'mumbai', 'predicted', 'weather', 'heavy', 'rains', 'forecast', 'rain', 'isolated', 'mm', 'orange', 'receive', 'rainfall']",India,news article,English
625,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Joint Call for Action to Address the Impacts of Climate Change and a Deepening Humanitarian Crisis in Southern Africa - Zimbabwe - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/zimbabwe/joint-call-action-address-impacts-climate-change-and-deepening-humanitarian-crisis,"Current Situation

There are more than 11 million people now experiencing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4) in nine Southern African countries1 due to deepening drought and climate crisis. If urgent humanitarian action is not taken, the number will likely rise in the coming months, according to the Regional Interagency Standing Committee Africa (RIASCO).

In Zimbabwe, 3.58 million people are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or Phase 4 (Emergency). In Zambia, 2.3 million people are currently estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or worse. In southern Angola, 1.6 million people are impacted by the drought with at least 562,000 in IPC Phase 3 or worse. By September 2019, 1.6 million people in Mozambique faced difficulties in accessing food as a result of agricultural losses, internal displacement and destruction of infrastructure and livelihoods stemming from two cyclones that devastated in the country in March and April 2019. In southern Madagascar, 916,201 people are facing severe acute food insecurity.

Climate shocks and climate change. Climate change is a central force driving a continued rise in global hunger, with both droughts and flooding negatively impacting food production. Evidence shows children suffer disproportionately from the impact of climate change. In fragile states and low-income communities, including in Southern Africa, the poor and marginalized will be most affected. Persons in low-income quintiles of society – and particularly children, women and the elderly who are less capable of coping with the negative effects of climate change – will be the most severely affected.

• Western and central parts of the region are experiencing poor rainfall and bad drought conditions, with some parts of Southern Africa facing the lowest rates of rainfall since 1981. Namibia received its lowest recorded rainfall in 35 years leaving 40 percent of its 2.4 million people characterised as severely food insecure.In drought-affected parts of the region, a growing number of traditional community water points have dried out or do not meet the minimum water demand, resulting in household water insecurity, lack of water in institutions (including schools and health facilities), depletion of watering points for agriculture and livestock which in turn increases unplanned migration of people and livestock. The region has had only two favourable agricultural seasons since 2012 and many areas have yet to fully recover from the devastating impact of the 2015-2016 El Niño season.

• At the same time, the eastern part of the region saw unprecedented back-to-back cyclones (Idai and Kenneth) impacting Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Comoros and southern Tanzania.

• Southern Africa is currently at the forefront of the climate crisis and facing the consequences of it first-hand. Mitigation (reduced emissions) and adaptation (increased resilience) are required to reduce the impact of climate change in the coming years. A multisectoral and joint approach between UN Agencies with a focus on immediate life-saving response, as well as longer term systems strengthening is needed to address the complexities of climate change at the country level.

Access to water. In drought-affected parts of the region, a growing number of traditional community water points have dried out or do not meet the minimum water demand, resulting in household water insecurity, lack of water in institutions (including schools and health facilities), depletion of watering points for agriculture and livestock which in turn increases unplanned migration of people and livestock.

Lake Kariba, a critical water resource for Zambia and Zimbabwe, is only 16 per cent full at present, down 7.5 meters from the same time last year. In Zimbabwe, the fragile economic situation and cuts to electricity have impacted access to water, curtailing the ability of local authorities to pump water and procure water treatment chemicals for urban areas while in rural areas only 30 per cent of rural water sources have water, are functioning and are protected.

Nutrition. While Southern Africa does not report the critical levels of acute malnutrition seen in East Africa, any incremental increase in acute malnutrition, is an additional stress on the individual child and household. It also presents a stress on health system, which are often poorly equipped to deal with increasing numbers of acutely malnourished children. In addition, considering the high burden of stunting already present across Southern Africa, children that are both stunted and wasted have the highest risk of death compared to those who are stunted or wasted alone.

• In Zimbabwe, national global acute malnutrition (GAM) has risen to 3.6 per cent, up from 2.5 per cent in 2018, and eight districts have GAM rates above 5 per cent, which is rarely seen in Zimbabwe and signifies a deteriorating situation. Doctors in Zimbabwe have been on strike for the previous two months, which has led to an ongoing human resources crisis and may lead to additional challenges for the management of children with acute malnutrition or other resources if no urgent solutions are found.

• In Mozambique, an estimated 67,500 children require treatment for malnutrition, including 6,500 for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). More than 250 cases of pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency) have been reported in Sofala province, which was hardest hit by Cyclone Idai.

• In Huíla and Cunene, in the south of Angola, between 70 and 80 per cent of the population are currently affected by food insecurity with increasing numbers of children identified as acutely malnourished through screening and programme admission data.

• Acute malnutrition continues to be of concern in the most drought affected districts of southern Madagascar, with 17,800 children treated for SAM with UNICEF support in 2019 to date, compared to 8,643 during the same time in 2018, largely due to a scale up in outreach screening and referral activities. An additional threat is the likely pipeline break for commodities for treating moderately malnourished children, which will likely lead to an increase in the numbers of severely malnourished children.

• A continuing challenge across Southern Africa relates to the lack of representative quality and up to date nutrition information in the most vulnerable communities and most drought-affected areas. This limitsthe ability to highlight the severity of the situation in terms of nutrition outcomes and can mean that a deteriorating situation may not be recognized in time to protect children from becoming malnourished. Representative and quality nutrition assessments in the most affected areas are key to support evidence-based targeted and timely responses.

Agriculture and livelihoods. The aggregate regional cereal output in 2019, including a production forecast for the winter wheat crops, to be harvested from October, is estimated to be nearly seven per cent below the 2018 production. The largest yearly decreases were registered in Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Production of maize, the main staple in the region, is estimated at nearly 10 per cent below the previous five-year average. Livestock rearing and production—a key coping and resilience pathway and a contributor to national GDP in Southern Africa—is also being impacted by reduced water availability and degradation of pastures, as well as increased outbreak of transboundary animal diseases.3 In the southern region of Angola, the drought has affected 2.2 million cattle and 1.2 million sheep, leading to the death of 27,767 animals. The continued presence of the Fall Armyworm (FAW) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease, a new disease reported for the first time in northern Zambia, are presenting additional risks to crop production in the region. Macro-economic volatility, including high levels of inflation, rising unemployment and eroded household purchasing power have further compounded the high levels of food insecurity in several countries.

Health. During 2019, climate shocks have exacerbated outbreaks of measles in several countries across the Southern African region, including Angola (3,127 cases with 64 deaths, of which 73 per cent are from Lunda Sul, and 17 per cent from Moxico, with 85 laboratory confirmed as of 30 June 2019); Comoros (132 cases with no deaths, 56 confirmed by 11 August 2019) and Madagascar (a total of 202,692 cases with 966 deaths reported from 7 October 2018 to 10 Sept 2019). Namibia is facing an expansion of transmission of hepatitis E and has been experiencing an outbreak since 2017 in informal settlements with poor access to safe water and sanitation, with 6,527 cases and 55 deaths (including 1,585 confirmed cases) reported by 6 October 2019. These countries also have a significant HIV burden. Food insecurity and resulting malnutrition in people living with HIV, especially children, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

During the 2016/17 drought, a reduction in outpatient consultations and admissions in some countries of Southern Africa like Lesotho, (including for deliveries) were reported due to closure of health facilities as water was depleted, leaving communities without access to critical health services. Approximately 135/404 health districts in Angola, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Eswatini and Zimbabwe reported increased caseloads resulting from upsurges of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria, which put pressure on health facilities (RIASCO 2017). Outbreaks of waterborne diseases occurred against the backdrop of severe water shortages resulting from the drought.",2019-11-14 08:00:00+00:00,"['deepening', 'africa', 'change', 'children', 'southern', 'joint', 'humanitarian', 'crisis', 'climate', 'cent', 'including', 'region', 'zimbabwe', '2019', 'impacts', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English

At least 20 people have died and more than 9.26 lakh people in 2,071 villages have been displaced in the current wave of floods that began last week, officials of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) in Guwahati said. Around 27,308 people took shelter in 193 relief camps, the official added. Also Read - Bihar Flood Situation Grim, 'Orange Alert' For Mumbai, Konkan Region | Take a Look at Monsoon Across India

The downpour and resultant flooding has also affected operations at Baghjan – where a leaking oil well of the state-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) caught fire on June 9. Adjoining areas in Tinsukia district have been badly hit by floodwater and the accident site has been inundated, affecting the efforts to douse the blaze and cap the oil well that had been spewing natural gas and oil condensates uncontrollably since May 27.

“All connecting roads to the OIL’s oil well site have been submerged with floodwater. Bridges have been damaged. At many places, water is flowing over the road with knee to waist high. OIL’s operational areas are heavily inundated,” an OIL release said.

“Floodwater has entered the debris area, Kill Pump area and CMT Water Pump area, making these unsafe for carrying out further operations. The India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall till June 30,” it added.

Earlier on Sunday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah discussed the Assam flood situation with Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal over phone and inquired about the incidents of landslide in different parts of the state.

“Shah assured all help and support from the central government in dealing with the floods, relief and erosion of rivers while asserting that the central government stood together with the state government in these difficult times,” the Assam government said in a press briefing.

A statement issued by the Assam Branch Indian Tea Association (Abita) said if the present situation prevails, the prospects of production in its tea estates may suffer a severe setback, which would have an impact on the overall annual production.

Abita has 275 member gardens, whose total production in 2018 was 246 million.

“High temperature, high intensity rainfall, less sunshine due to frequent overcast sky, has affected tea bush productivity with multiple cumulative short, medium and long-term effects on the tea bushes,” it said.

“The need of the hour is support from the government towards formulating a plan of action to prevent the recurring floods in the tea estates to ensure survival of the estates and employment of workers,” it added.

Incessant rain in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam has led to the Brahmaputra and almost all its tributaries being in spate affecting many Abita member tea gardens.

In Upper Assam’s Dibrugarh district, most of the tea sections, labour lines and roads in the Abita gardens of Maijan, Greenwood (Nagaholie division), Hazelbank (Oaklands), Balijan (N) and Mothola are flooded.

The worst affected gardens in Tinsukia district are Dinjan, Rungagora and Dhelakhat.

In Jorhat district, 140mm rainfall was recorded in July.

In Golaghat district, there are reports that flood-hit people of villages near Hathikuli tea estate and Kaziranga National Park have taken shelter in the garden school, crèche, hospital and other high lands in the estate.

The garden has provided drinking water to the flood-hit people and the outpatient department in the hospital has been kept open round-the-clock.

In Sonitpur district, several Abita member gardens have been affected by floods.

The river surrounding Mijicajan tea estate has cut into an embankment and washed away a part of the garden road and flooded tea areas.

Waterlogging in the tea-growing sections of New Purupbari, Monmohinipur, Nahorani, Rupajuli and Gingia tea estates have been reported. Floodwaters have entered the outskirts of Shakomoto tea estate and has flooded the labour lines. Erosion has been reported at Behupukri division of Monabarie tea estate and the Balijan river surrounding Bormahjan tea estate is flowing above the danger mark and may flood the garden areas any moment.

The association said waterlogging in labour lines and tea sections has been reported from Kopati tea estate in Darrang district, Budlapara, Corramore and Attareekhat gardens in Udalguri district and Ananda, Silonibari and Dejoo tea estates in Lakhimpur district.

A senior official of Amalgamated Plantations Private Limited, which owns Hathikuli, told The Telegraph: “Our hospital is open to all for emergency.

As Coaches, Trainers, Players Call for Dissolution of Executive - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/201907160533.html,"A section of baseball coaches, trainers and players have called for the immediate dissolution of the executive of the Ghana Baseball and Softball Federation (GBSF).

Referred to as Concerned Baseball Coaches and Trainers in Ghana and Concerned Players, the group made the appeal to the Director General of the National Sports Authority (NSA), Professor Peter Twumasi, in two separate petitions, insisting that the mandate of the current executive had expired.

The group stated that efforts to get the executive led by Mr. Albert Frimpong to organize fresh elections have fell on deaf ears and has in a way stalled the development and promotion of the sport as members of the two groups stay away from activities organized by the executive.

The petition, signed by over 25 coaches, trainers and players, said members have lost interest and trust in the present executive owing to the lack of initiatives and competition.

According to the group, the executive, since its election into office in May 2010, have failed to organise any congress or general meeting to afford stakeholders the opportunity to brainstorm on the way forward for the association.

The petition added that ""They have equally failed to organize any competition, be it league or any programme at junior or high school level.""

The petition which was also copied to the Minister of Youth and Sports, Isaac Kwame Asiamah, and sighted by the Times Sports chronicled a plethora of issues including the failure of the executive to source for sponsorship for the development of the twin game (baseball and softball).

""The neglect of the sport by the executives for the past nine years has culminated in a significant number of teams both at the senior and junior levels folding up, thereby reducing drastically activities on the baseball and softball front.""

It said instead of rallying members of the federation for the common good, its actions have scattered members some of whom feel intimidated in expressing their concerns about happenings in the GBSF.

As a result, the group indicated that activities of the national team have become that of individuals as the executive have shown no interest in the national team.

It also stated that Ghana has lost her enviable third ranked baseball nation in the country as a result of the absence of leagues and competition for the past nine years.

55,DR-2015-000134-SOM,World Bank Forecasts Global Poverty to Fall Below 10% for First Time; Major Hurdles Remain in Goal to End Poverty by 2030 - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/10/04/world-bank-forecasts-global-poverty-to-fall-below-10-for-first-time-major-hurdles-remain-in-goal-to-end-poverty-by-2030,"WASHINGTON, October 4, 2015 – The number of people living in extreme poverty around the world is likely to fall to under 10 percent of the global population in 2015, according to World Bank projections released today, giving fresh evidence that a quarter-century-long sustained reduction in poverty is moving the world closer to the historic goal of ending poverty by 2030.

The Bank uses an updated international poverty line of US $1.90 a day, which incorporates new information on differences in the cost of living across countries (the PPP exchange rates). The new line preserves the real purchasing power of the previous line (of $1.25 a day in 2005 prices) in the world’s poorest countries. Using this new line (as well as new country-level data on living standards), the World Bank projects that global poverty will have fallen from 902 million people or 12.8 per cent of the global population in 2012 to 702 million people, or 9.6 per cent of the global population, this year.

Actual poverty data from low income countries come with a considerable lag but the organization, which released the information on the eve of its Annual Meetings in Lima, Peru, based its current projections on the latest available data.

Jim Yong Kim, World Bank Group President, said that the continued major reductions in poverty were due to strong growth rates in developing countries in recent years, investments in people’s education, health, and social safety nets that helped keep people from falling back into poverty. He cautioned, however, that with slowing global economic growth, and with many of the world’s remaining poor people living in fragile and conflict-affected states, and the considerable depth and breadth of remaining poverty, the goal to end extreme poverty remained a highly ambitious target.

“This is the best story in the world today -- these projections show us that we are the first generation in human history that can end extreme poverty,’’ Kim said. “This new forecast of poverty falling into the single digits should give us new momentum and help us focus even more clearly on the most effective strategies to end extreme poverty. It will be extraordinarily hard, especially in a period of slower global growth, volatile financial markets, conflicts, high youth unemployment, and the growing impact of climate change. But it remains within our grasp, as long as our high aspirations are matched by country-led plans that help the still millions of people living in extreme poverty.”

In April 2013, nine months after Kim became president of the World Bank Group, its Board of Governors endorsed two goals: to end extreme poverty by 2030, and to boost shared prosperity by raising the incomes of the bottom 40 percent of populations.

Kim said that further reductions in poverty rates would come from evidence-based approaches, including: broad-based growth that generates sufficient income-earning opportunities; investing in people’s development prospects through improving the coverage and quality of education, health, sanitation, and protecting the poor and vulnerable against sudden risks of unemployment, hunger, illness, drought and other calamities. These measures, he said, would also greatly boost shared prosperity, improving the welfare of the least well-off in every country.

“With these strategies in place, the world stands a vastly better chance of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and raising the life prospects of low-income families,” said Kim.

Poverty remains concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia

For the last several decades, three regions, East Asia and Pacific, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, have accounted for some 95 percent of global poverty. Yet, the composition of poverty across these three regions has shifted dramatically. In 1990, East Asia accounted for half of the global poor, whereas some 15 percent lived in in Sub-Saharan Africa; by 2015 forecasts, this is almost exactly reversed: Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for half of the global poor, with some 12 percent living in East Asia. Poverty is declining in all regions but it is becoming deeper and more entrenched in countries that are either conflict ridden or overly dependent on commodity exports.

The growing concentration of global poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa is of great concern. While some African countries have seen significant successes in reducing poverty, the region as a whole lags the rest of the world in the pace of lessening poverty. Sub-Saharan poverty fell from an estimated 56 percent in 1990 to a projected 35 percent in 2015. Rapid population growth remains a key factor blunting progress in many countries—as this year’s Global Monitoring Report to be launched on October 8 shows.

In its regional forecasts for 2015, the Bank said that poverty in East Asia and the Pacific would fall to 4.1 per cent of its population, down from 7.2 per cent in 2012; Latin America and the Caribbean would fall to 5.6 per cent from 6.2 in 2012; South Asia would fall to 13.5 per cent in 2015, compared to 18.8 per cent in 2012; Sub-Saharan Africa declines to 35.2 per cent in 2015, compared to 42.6 per cent in 2012. Reliable current poverty data is not available for the Middle East and North Africa because of conflict and fragility in key countries in the region. *For more detail on the regional forecasts, see page 6 of attached Policy Research Note.

“Development has been robust over the last two decades but the protracted global slowdown since the financial crisis of 2008, is beginning to cast its shadow on emerging economies,” said World Bank Chief Economist Kaushik Basu, a former Chief Economic Adviser to the Indian Government. “There is some turbulence ahead. The economic growth outlook is less impressive for emerging economies in the near future, which will create new challenges in the fight to end poverty and attend to the needs of the vulnerable, especially those living at the bottom 40 percent of their societies.”

Measuring Poverty Globally and Nationally

The updated global poverty line and rate are based on newly-available price data from across the world- impacting not only where the global poverty line is drawn, but the cost of the basic food, clothing, and shelter needs of the poorest around the world. However, this global measure is only one of many important measures to track in order to better reach the poor and vulnerable.

“When global organizations set global goals, we have to be able to compare progress across countries using a common measure, treating the absolute poor in one country the same as in another, “ said Ana Revenga, Senior Director of the World Bank’s Poverty and Equity Global Practice. “But just as important are the national poverty lines set by each country, reflecting their own standard of living. These are crucial for governments and policy makers when they are planning the programs that will improve lives, or the policies that will help bring the poorest in their country out of destitution.”

Revenga said the World Bank Group would continue to work with its country clients and partners to improve how it measures and tracks poverty, to build country statistical capacity and fill persistent data gaps, and to integrate solid data and analysis into its development work to better reach people and their families who live in entrenched poverty.

Photo by VnExpress/Phuoc Tuan.

Torrential downpours and discharge of water from hydropower dams have caused rivers in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces to swell and threaten severe flooding.

Storm Molave, said to be the strongest to hit Vietnam in the last two decades, made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai Wednesday morning before weakening into a tropical depression by 4 p.m.

The provinces have been hit by rains of up to 500 mm between Tuesday night and Wednesday night. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

In Quang Ngai, the Tra Bong River was flowing above flood warning danger level 2 at Chau O station while the Tra Khuc, Ve and Tra Cau rivers had crossed the highest danger level of 3 by 4 p.m. Wednesday, according to the province's Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

They are forecast to continue rising quickly on Thursday, possibly triggering severe flooding in large parts of Quang Ngai Town, the capital, and several districts.

The release of water by local hydropower dams is worsening the situation.

Dak Drinh hydropower plant discharged up to 1,680 cubic meters of water a second on Wednesday and Nuoc Trong, the largest irrigation and hydroelectricity project in the central region, discharged 1,100 cubic meters.

Authorities hurriedly evacuated people living in low-lying areas and made emergency announcements about the water discharge via loudspeakers to warn local residents.

In Quang Nam Province, home to ancient town Hoi An, the water level in the Vu Gia River reached 9.41 meters by early morning Thursday, 0.41 meters above danger level 3, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, which warned rivers in the province would rise quickly in the next few hours.

Dak Mi 4 hydropower plant plans to discharge up to 11,400 cubic meters a second and the Vu Gia River is expected to rise to 11.2 meters, surpassing the historic flood level in 2009.

Nguyen Huu Vu, a local official, said authorities have evacuated over 4,000 families living along the river.

If the hydropower plant discharges over 5,000 cubic meters per second, 120,000 houses would be submerged under 0.5-1.5 meters of water, Vu said.

The National Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said on Wednesday that Quang Nam could face severe flooding in the next one or two days.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung instructed provincial authorities to evacuate people from areas threatened by landslides and ensure the safety of reservoirs and hydropower plants.

The central region, including Quang Nam, was hit by prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides for three weeks from October 6 that caused at least 130 deaths.

The flooding left 290,000 houses submerged and large swathes of agricultural land inundated, killed livestock and caused damage the government said was ""the worst in the last five years.""",2020-10-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'nam', 'dam', 'quang', 'rains', 'water', 'hydropower', 'trigger', 'flooding', 'heavy', 'central', 'fresh', 'discharge', 'level', 'ngai', 'meters', 'vu', 'plant']",Vietnam,news article,English

KEY MESSAGES

• Mozambique is experiencing its worst food insecurity emergency since the 2015/16 drought with an atypically high number of households in need of emergency assistance. This is the result of multiple shocks including tropical cyclones Desmond, Idai, and Kenneth with associated torrential rainfall and severe flooding and drought in southern semiarid areas. These shocks have significantly impacted crop production across the country and livelihoods, specifically in Cyclone affected areas.

• Most of the country is facing Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. In southern semiarid areas this is the second consecutive poor season and households have little to no food stocks, which is atypical for this time of year. Tropical Cyclone affected households lost their crops for the 2019/20 consumption year and are continuing to rebuild their livelihoods. The rest of the country is experiencing Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes due to a normal harvest.

• Due to the significantly below-average harvest, the lean season is expected to begin atypically early. Household food stocks are likely to be exhausted by September, even though efforts are ongoing to maximize the second season, which typically contributes a small portion to the annual households’ food stocks, particularly for cereals. In October/November, agricultural labor opportunities are expected to seasonally increase with the start of the rainy season, but is expected to remain below average.

• In areas most affected by this year’s shocks, namely in Gaza, Inhambane, Sofala, Manica and parts of Zambézia provinces, poor households are expected to continue engaging and increasing their reliance on livelihood coping strategies to meet their minimum food needs. The poor and very poor households are expected to continue facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) food security outcomes in January 2020, with humanitarian food assistance needs most likely increasing until the harvest in April 2020.

NATIONAL OVERVIEW

Current Situation Current estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA) indicate over a million MT of crops were lost including corn, rice, groundnuts, beans, and vegetables were destroyed nationwide as a result of the poor rainfall in the southern semiarid areas and three Tropical Cyclones, Desmond, Idai, and Kenneth. MASA estimates nearly 800,000 MT loss in national maize grain production, representing a reduction of more than 30 percent as compared to the last two years’ average. MASA also estimates, this year’s shocks caused the death of nearly 120 cattle, 1,120 small ruminates and more than 22,000 chickens. The tropical cyclone damaged fishing boats and equipment for fishing as well as infrastructure, a key livelihood for thousands of households along the coast. Based on available information on losses caused by this year’s multiple shocks, combined with the remote sensing analysis particularly of the Water Requirements Satisfaction Index (WRSI) (Figure 1), the 2018/19 crop production will be significantly below last year’s production and the 5-year average.

Current household food stocks are much lower than average in southern semiarid areas as well as areas affected by tropical cyclones. In southern areas, as a result of the second consecutive poor season households have little to no food stocks. Most of the markets are relatively well supplied thanks to the flow of food commodities from surplus areas, including some remote areas, resulting in abnormally higher retail prices. In the rest of the country markets and households have average stocks.

As many households continue relying on markets for food, particularly in shock affected areas, poor households continue to engage in self-employment activities to access incomes. However, as more and more people engage in self-employment activities, opportunities to sell are reduced and prices decrease; limiting incomes.

Second season planting and production is progressing in the flood affected areas where households have been planting following the receding flood waters. On the other hand, in the southern semiarid areas, second season production is limited due to lack of residual moisture. As of late May, in cyclone affected areas various organizations provided nearly 150,000 kilograms of maize grain seeds and 78,000 kilograms of beans seeds to about 20,000 households. FAO is also providing agricultural inputs (assorted vegetable seeds, beans seeds and agricultural tools) to slightly over 65,900 households for second season planting. The total number of beneficiaries is most likely to be around 95,000 households with other organizations’ contribution. In the flood affected areas, prospects for second season are good due to existing residual moisture and water bodies from where households can get water for irrigation. However, production from second season is for rapid consumption and does not guarantee durable food stocking.",2019-06-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['security', 'mozambique', 'second', 'tropical', 'southern', 'outlook', 'affected', 'season', '2019', 'food', 'households', '2020', 'poor', 'production', 'areas']",Mozambique,news article,English

The villages were close to the Dez and Karkheh rivers, Shush county governor Adnan Qazi was quoted by IRNA as saying.

At least 47 people were killed in the past two weeks in flash floods in various provinces in Iran, from north to south, after the heaviest rains in the country in at least a decade.

Iran has announced a state of emergency in several provinces threatened by flooding and tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes in the flood-hit provinces, where dozens of villages have been evacuated already.

President Hassan Rouhani, accused by critics of mishandling the crisis, has promised compensation to all those affected.

The head of the judiciary, hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi, has said that officials who mishandled the disaster and caused the death of civilians could face prosecution.

Authorities are concerned about rising threats of dam failures and water releases that could create further damage in various provinces.

Officials in Tehran have called on people to stay away from rivers and areas near dams, saying that all the relevant organizations were on high-alert due to possibility of flooding in the capital.

Floods have affected at least 26 out of Iran’s 31 provinces since heavy downpours began on March 19.

DEHRADUN: It's winter. February temperatures can drop to below zero in the hills of Uttarakhand's Chamoli and summer is a long way off. Why, then, did a glacier break off, with disastrous effect? Geologists who have been studying the region's glaciers said climate change is to blame.""This is an anomaly. In winter, glaciers remain firmly frozen. Even walls of glacial lakes are tightly bound. A flood of this sort in this season is usually caused by an avalanche or landslide. Neither seems to be the case here,"" Manish Mehta, senior scientist at Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, told TOI. He could not immediately recall a precedent.Mehta had led a study last year which found that the eight glaciers of the upper Rishiganga catchment - Uttari Nanda Devi, Changbang, Ramni Bank, Bethartoli, Trishul, Dakshni Nanda Devi, Dakshni Rishi Bank and Raunthi Bank - had lost over 10% of their mass in less than three decades. From 243 sq km in 1980, they had shrunk to 217 sq km in 2017, with Uttari Nanda Devi receding the most (7.7%). The upper Rishiganga catchment is where the glacier burst took place on Sunday.In the same period, the equilibrium line altitude (the zone on a glacier where its mass lost is balanced by its mass gained over a year) fluctuated a lot - between 5,200m above sea level and 5,700m. ""It does not change if climate conditions are consistent,"" MPS Bisht, director of the Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, which was also part of the study along with IIT-Kanpur and HNB Garhwal University, said.Himalayan glaciers have been retreating faster than anywhere else in the world. ""Yet, the state of glacier response (how much it retreats or advances) has not been studied extensively. So, we mapped the variations of extent and dynamics of the glaciers in the upper Rishiganga catchment, Nanda Devi region and found most glaciers have been shrinking,"" Mehta said.This has been pronounced since the 1990s. ""We found south-facing glaciers receded faster than north-facing ones, possibly because of longer exposure to insolation (solar radiation). How glaciers respond to climate is also dependent on its size and geometry.""Because the glaciers are of the ""winter accumulation type,"" a decrease in precipitation may have caused this, the study said. ""The equilibrium line altitude swing suggests glaciers in the region have responded to deprived precipitation conditions since 1980,"" Bisht said. And while temperatures have been increasing since the 1980s, the study said, the glaciers are more sensitive to changes in precipitation. The larger context, however, is that of increased global temperatures. Mehta said, ""Against the backdrop of warming since the mid-1990s, accelerated glacial reduction could be correlated with increased global temperature.""",2021-02-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['glacier', 'feb', 'cold', 'glaciers', 'flood', 'joshimath', 'chamoli', 'winter', 'ganga', 'river', 'district', 'month', 'break', 'burst', 'tunnel', 'uttarakhand']",India,news article,English

By Codi Kozacek

Circle of Blue

Governments in the United States and Canada are working to create new targets for phosphorus loading in Lake Erie to better address the changing drivers of toxic algal blooms in the lake. Draft numbers for the new targets could be released as early as this fall.

The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, a binational pact to protect the Great Lakes first signed in 1972, limits the amount of phosphorus that can be discharged into the lake to 11,000 metric tons per year. Despite meeting this target for all but five years since 1984, harmful algal blooms have reemerged in Lake Erie, prompting a call for new targets in 2012 when the GLWQA was last renewed.

The development of the new targets—and measures to implement them—gained more urgency last week after a harmful algal bloom contaminated the water supply for more than 400,000 people in Toledo, Ohio.

“When they set the 11,000 metric tons [target], it was about total phosphorus,” Raj Bejankiwar, a physical scientist for the International Joint Commission—the governing body of the GLWQA—told Circle of Blue. “In the 1970s and 80s, of the entire phosphorus loads coming into Lake Erie, 70 percent of that total phosphorus was not available to the algae. Only about 30 percent was bioavailable. In recent years, about the last 14 to 15 years of data, most of the phosphorus getting into the lake has been dissolved phosphorus, which is very bioavailable.”

“We are asking the governments to look into the timing of the loadings as well as the nature of the phosphorus.” –Raj Bejankiwar

International Joint Commission

In addition, that phosphorus has been coming into the lake in big pulses, with much of it being released between March and June, Bejankiwar said.

“The [phosphorus] targets are typically for one year, but we can’t look at it in terms of annual loads—we have to look at spring loading,” he said. “The big issue is, under climate change, we are seeing more severe rainfall and more frequent rainfall in the springtime. That’s why we think the current 11,000 metric tons [target] is not working. We are asking the governments to look into the timing of the loadings as well as the nature of the phosphorus.”

Voluntary Measures Not Enough

Once the new targets are approved, the respective state and provincial governments will be assigned to find ways to meet them by reducing phosphorus output. Under the original GLWQA, this took the form of banning phosphorus from detergents and regulating phosphorus discharge from municipal wastewater treatment plants and factories, as well as working with farmers to reduce erosion. Before the GLWQA, the total amount of phosphorus entering Lake Erie each year was upwards of 20,000 metric tons, meaning the countries cut their discharges approximately by half to meet the targets.

Recommendations in the most recent IJC report on Lake Erie, released in February, and in studies released by researchers at the University of Michigan, found that similar cuts will be needed to clean up the lake this time. As Circle of Blue reported in February, the studies suggest that total phosphorus coming into Lake Erie’s western and central basins will need to be reduced by 46 percent, and phosphorus coming from the Maumee River should be reduced by 39 percent.

The IJC is limited to a research and advisory role, and its recommendations do not have the force of law. Toledo’s drinking water scare, however, has the IJC and many other groups calling for meaningful action.

“We believe that this incident is saying we need to have stronger actions in terms of regulations,” Bejankiwar said. “It is always good to have voluntary actions, but in these days it is highly likely we should also take strong regulatory actions.”

“[The problem] is not going to go away. It needs focused attention and a lot of important conversations need to happen.” –Jennifer Caddick

Alliance for the Great Lakes

Ideas for regulations—such as banning fertilizer application on frozen ground—have been introduced by a coalition of conservation organizations and Lake Erie business associations. Regulatory bills have not yet been introduced by state or federal legislators.

“Our recommendations are specifically talking about calling on the governors and the premier of Ontario to implement measurable [phosphorus] reductions on a specific timetable,” Jennifer Caddick, engagement director for Alliance for the Great Lakes, told Circle of Blue. “We haven’t seen any movement on that, but it has not even been a week. I’m sure there are lots of conversations happening on that.”

Caddick added that the IJC’s report was an important starting point for these discussions, providing solid numbers about needed reductions.

“We really hope in the next couple weeks people will continue to focus on this,” she said. “It is not going to go away. It needs focused attention and a lot of important conversations need to happen. We and our partners are continuing those conversations, and we urge the governors and senators to engage in those conversations quickly as well.”

1022,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,"Kenya floods uproot families, complicating coronavirus fight - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-floods-health-coronavirus-trfn-idUSKBN22J1N3,"NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - John Otieno was caught unawares in late April when flood waters hit his home and farm in Kogelo village, western Kenya, swamping his buildings and poultry, and destroying six acres of maize.

â??We woke up to massive floods in the morning from the Nyando River, and my entire farm and houses were swept away,â? said Otieno. â??I only saved my two goats.â?

In Kenyaâ??s Western and Nyanza regions, heavy rainfall since March has displaced more than 100,000 people and devastated homes and crops.

At the same time, the government is fighting to contain the coronavirus outbreak at national and local levels, with measures like social distancing.

In the western part of the country, following such guidelines is nearly impossible for those forced from their homes by the rains and flooding, residents and aid workers said.

Otienoâ??s family of six was among several evacuated from his village and is now sheltering in nearby Okanja primary school. There they are finding it hard to stay away from others to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19.

â??We have stayed here for two weeks, and it is very challenging to maintain social distancing,â? Otieno told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

Women and children sleep together in the school compound, while men spend the night in separate rooms.

The nearly 500 displaced people staying in local schools are trying to follow government guidelines to prevent COVID-19 infection, such as wearing face masks and sanitising hands, said Otieno.

â??Well-wishers came and distributed some masks but there were not enough for all of us,â? he added, urging the Kisumu County government to supply masks and send medical officers to check on the situation regularly.

Families at the Okanja school are fortunate, however, because it has plenty of rainwater collected in tanks. Church and other local leaders have donated equipment, so they can easily wash their hands and keep good hygiene.

Kenya has so far recorded more than 580 cases of the virus, with 26 confirmed deaths. Most infections have occurred in cities like Nairobi and Mombasa, but community transmission is also happening in other parts of the country.

Health cabinet secretary Mutahi Kagwe said in early May that people should observe the virus containment protocols recommended by the government, particularly keeping a distance of at least 2 metres (6.6 feet) from others.

â??If we donâ??t adhere to the measures, the disease will spread very quickly within our communities,â? he added.

While the coronavirus outbreak threatens all Kenyans, the heavy rains and floods have made thousands of families more vulnerable to the virus, aid workers said.

Nearly 200 people have been killed by floods and landslides in Kenya this year â?? considerably more deaths than caused by the COVID-19 respiratory disease so far, government figures show.

According to Peter Abwao, a spokesman for the Kenya Red Cross, about 17,000 households, each with an average of six members, have been affected by floods, with 10,000 families left homeless in the western part of the country.

The aid agency has been working with the Kisumu County government to get those displaced by the floods relocated to more schools, so that if possible, each family has their own classroom, to be able to maintain social distancing.

MORE FLOODS DUE

Mayâ??s weather forecast, from the Kenya Meteorological Department, predicted above-average rainfall during the first week of the month and near-average precipitation in the second half, with rains likely to continue into June.

Senior meteorologist Misiani Zachary warned further flooding was likely, especially in western areas that have already received lots of wet weather.

Zachary also said persistent rains could lead to huge cracks in roads and landslides, hampering relief for remote villages.

â??The ongoing rains will absolutely create impassable roads for the rescue team of medics and other emergency assistance,â? he added.

Julius Otieno, a community liaison officer at the Nyando Constituency Development Fund who has been helping flood victims on the frontline, said thousands of acres of crops and rice plantations had been destroyed.

Meeting the basic needs of displaced people was difficult during a pandemic, he added, warning that other diseases like cholera and malaria could easily break out.

â??As much as the government discourages people coming together in large numbers, we have no choice at the moment as this is an emergency,â? he said.

â??Food is provided (in the shelters), so we are trying our best to ensure movements in and out of the schools are restricted.â?

RISING LAKE

On top of the flash floods and major rivers bursting their banks, there is a new phenomenon to contend with: a backflow of water from Lake Victoria due to heavy rains in its catchment area, which is inundating its shores.

That has rendered more than 1,000 families homeless and roads impassable in parts of western Kenya, complicating the humanitarian situation further.

The lakeâ??s rising level is also affecting people in Uganda, where authorities say the problem began last October.

The waterâ??s depth has crept up from 12 metres to more than 13.3 metres, affecting major towns in the three countries that border the lake, including Kisumu in Kenya, Mwanza in Tanzania, and Entebbe in Uganda.

The effects of the lakeâ??s unusually high waters are hampering hydropower generation and transport, and have also flooded settlements on its shores.",2020-05-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['uproot', 'virus', 'fight', 'social', 'complicating', 'displaced', 'waters', 'families', 'coronavirus', 'schools', 'otieno', 'kenya', 'rains', 'floods', 'western']",Kenya,news article,English
160,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Amazonian catfish's 5000-mile migration endangered by dams - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2016/06/amazonian-catfishs-5000-mile-migration-endangered-by-dams/,"Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii, a commercially valuable catfish species and an apex predator, grows to 3 meters long. Scientists have long suspected that it makes an extraordinary migration from the Amazon headwaters to the Amazon Basin and back.

Now researchers — using an innovative technique that examines the chemical composition of adult catfish ear bones — have found proof of the 8,000-kilometer journey. The fish can drift as far downstream as the Amazon estuary, then swim back to the headwaters stream where they began, or to other Amazon tributaries.

Unfortunately for the catfish, more than 400 dams have been built, are under construction, or are planned for the Amazon Basin and Andes feeder streams. Global research has shown that long homing migrations by fish are incompatible with dams.

The researchers are urging governments in six Amazon Basin countries to reconsider and redesign their Amazon dam plans, or risk losing this natural wonder — along with seeing negative impacts to the entire freshwater food chain.

A singular Amazonian catfish is capable of an amazing feat: hidden from human eyes, the species travels vast distances over its lifetime, making a round trip covering more than 8,000 kilometers (nearly 5,000 miles), to return to its natal breeding grounds, a new study confirms.

But even as this record-setting feat — the longest freshwater migration in the world — is scientifically confirmed, the species is threatened by hundreds of planned Amazonian dams.

Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii is a commercially valuable catfish species and an apex predator, growing to 3 meters (more than 9 feet) long. Understanding the migratory patterns of the fish, whose range spans six Amazonian countries, “is paramount for designing adequate conservation and management strategies, especially in view of the current and proposed hydroelectric development throughout the Amazon basin,” the researchers write in the Journal of Applied Ecology.

Observations in the 1990s concerning the size distribution of catfish caught along the length of the Amazon River first led researchers to suggest that long-distance homing migration might be taking place, explained study lead author Fabrice Duponchelle of France’s Institute of Research for Development. Subsequent genetic analyses were consistent with that hypothesis, but still didn’t offer definitive proof.

Intrigued by the possibility that catfish might be homing over such vast distances, Duponchelle employed an innovative technique in the new study to get conclusive evidence: chemical analysis of the otolith, a type of ear bone.

As otoliths grow, their chemical composition changes to reflect the background levels of particular chemical elements found in the environment. Like tree rings, the layers of bone relate to their age: the center, innermost layer of otolith is the oldest, and reflects life as a hatchling; the outer edge is the most recent, and reflects the last stage of the fish’s life.

The scientists examined how chemical composition — specifically the ratios of two strontium isotopes — changed from the otolith’s center to its edge. Because strontium levels vary geographically across the Amazon region, it was possible for the research team to match the isotope ratios seen within the bones to their geographic origin in one of three areas: the Amazon River and its Andean and lowland tributaries; the Madeira sub-basin; and tributaries originating on the old, granite Brazilian and Guiana shields. In this way, the lifetime migration patterns of 37 catfish were carefully pieced together.

Adult catfish were sampled from their breeding grounds in the upper Madeira and Amazon rivers. The life histories stored in their bones revealed that — as larvae and juveniles just a few centimeters long — they had drifted downstream, eventually reaching the lower Amazon, with some going as far as the Amazon estuary.

Most returned to their original breeding grounds thousands of miles upstream as adults, particularly within the Madeira sub-basin.

Several of the catfish studied showed alternative movement patterns, however, corresponding to migrations that began in one sub-basin and ended in another. “There are always both homers and strayers” in migratory fish species, Duponchelle told Mongabay — a pattern that helps safeguard the species against extinctions. None of the catfish examined showed evidence of being resident in their natal sub-basin throughout their life, suggesting that the initial downstream migration is a compulsory part of their lifecycle.

The team’s ground-breaking work provides conclusive evidence of the homing behavior shown by B. rousseauxii on its 8,000-kilometer journey. “Such long-distance natal homing is exceptional in purely freshwater fishes,” the researchers state.

The distance covered is “rather exceptional from a global perspective too,” said Herman Wanningen, director of the World Fish Migration Foundation. The catfish can hold its own against long-distance freshwater-saltwater migrants such as sturgeon, salmon and the European eel; the latter covers 10,000 to 12,000 kilometers (6,214 to 7,456 miles) on its journey between the Sargasso Sea and European lakes and rivers.

Unfortunately for the Amazon catfish, the length of its journey makes it especially vulnerable to disruption by the hundreds of hydropower dams slated for construction across the Amazon basin and in the river’s headwaters.

Two major completed hydropower projects on the Madeira River already pose a significant barrier to their migration route, despite mitigation efforts. Although fish passages to aid upstream migration were incorporated into both the Jirau and Santo Antônio dams, these measures have proven ineffective, the researchers write, concluding that “a substantial part of [the catfish’s] possible spawning grounds in the Amazon Basin is already strongly compromised.”

The scientists warn that negative impacts to this top Amazon predator will have knock-on effects along the whole food chain. Researchers call for urgent modifications to proposed, under construction and existing dams to restore connectivity across the migration route.

But even if upstream migration could be restored, a trickier problem is maintaining the downstream movement of the catfish during their very small juvenile stages, Duponchelle said. “These young stages — adapted to migrate downstream in running, highly oxygenated waters — now have to face huge lakes [created by dams], with often poorly oxygenated waters, roamed by predators they did not normally encounter [in the past], such as piranhas, for instance.”

Lessons learned from around the world indicate that dams and migratory species cannot coexist, Wanningen cautioned: “The only way to protect these long distance migrants is to keep certain river systems open for free migration to fulfil their lifecycle.”

“The solution would be to implement river basin planning, where choices are made about which rivers will be kept free flowing and protected, which rivers are restored by removing barriers or where fishways are installed, and which rivers are utilized for energy production/hydropower,” he said.

“This is what should be done first and then new hydropower plants can be built.”

Duponchelle hopes that the new study, when combined with the work of other scientists who have provided evidence of the ecological and social impacts of dams, along with research that identifies better, cheaper and greener energy alternatives to Amazon hydropower will be taken into account before it’s too late.

“Unfortunately,” he concluded, “what happens in the world everywhere suggests than the power of money far exceeds the power of reason.”

Assam's overall flood situation improved considerably on Monday though one person lost his life due to drowning taking the total death toll to 91, an official report said.

A population of 42,921 in eight of the 33 districts are currently affected by the floods, though the water level of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries are showing a receding trend, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said in its bulletin.

The number of affected people was nearly 88,000 in 10 districts on Sunday.

Flood water claimed one life at Bajali in Barpeta district taking the total death toll to 91 since Sunday night, the ASDMA said.

The affected districts are Darrang, Barpeta, Chirang, Morigaon, Nagaon, Hojai, Jorhat and Cachar.

Morigaon is the worst affected district with a population of 25,888 reelings under the floodwater, followed by Barpeta with 9,554 and Jorhat with 3,762 people affected.

The flood victims are returning to their homes but 2,816 people are still lodged in 11 relief camps at Chirang, Chirang, Morigaon, Nagaon and Jorhat districts.

A total crop area of 16,221 hectares of land was still under floodwater.

The rivers flowing above the danger level include the Brahmaputra at Neamatighat in Jorhat, the Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat, the Desang at Nanglamuraghat in Sibsagar and the Kushiara in Karimganj, the ASDMA added.",2019-08-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'flood', '91', 'affected', 'jorhat', 'toll', 'districts', 'improving', 'chirang', 'assam', 'barpeta', 'taking', 'situation', 'asdma', 'rises', 'total']",India,news article,English

The water ram-headed deity Khnum forming humans on his potter’s wheel - Canadian Museum of History



Papyrus depicting Isis and Osiris



Habi the Blue Nile God



Ancient Egyptian crocodile deity Sobek

CAIRO – 28 June 2020: When many contemplate the name ""Nile"", the first thing that comes to their minds is Egypt, which is easy to explain, given the great importance of this river to Egypt throughout history.The famous Greek historian Herodotus summarized the importance of the river to the Egyptians by saying ""Egypt is the gift of the Nile"".There are many myths associated with the Nile, including that the Nile is the gift of the gods, and that its flood season begins with the appearance of the brightest star; when it overflows, it brings prosperity and fertility; the gods control the river, and the deity Khnum is the lord of the water who brings prosperity and creates humans from the mud of the Nile River flood; the deity Habi controls the flood of the Nile because he is both genders and therefore very fertile; parts of the body of the severed god Osiris is in the Nile; and that the Nile’s flood and its decline were linked to the death and resurrection of Osiris and the myth of worshiping the Nile animals (the crocodile deity Sobek).The ancient Egyptians thought that the Nile is the gift of the gods. They equated it with life itself, and they organized their daily lives according to the high and low levels of its water. The Egyptian calendar was based on the three seasons of the Nile: The flood, agriculture, and harvest.The flood season began with the appearance of ""Al-Shaary Al-Yamani"" or ""Sirius"", which is the brightest star. Its appearance also means the beginning of a new Egyptian year.Herodotus' sayings and recordings show that the flood of the Nile was coincident with the summer solstice phenomenon, that is, June 22/23 of every year.Because the Nile means life, when it overflows it brings prosperity and fertility to the soil and people around it, but if its water level rises too much, people lose their mud houses, and if the level does not rise enough, drought and famine occur.Thus it was important for the gods to control the river. The two main deities involved in organizing this process are Khnum and Hapi, according to legend.Khnum, the Nile god with a ram's head, was the god of water, who brings life to the banks of the river, where plants grow and animals reproduce, and since silt forms after the flood, Khnum was also thought to create humans.Elephantine Island, now in Aswan, was home to worshipping Khnum, while his temple is located in the city of Esna, located 60 km south of Luxor Governorate in Upper Egypt.As for the god Habi, he was the one in control of the flood of the Nile. Usually, this god appears in both genders, having male features and a female upper body, which reflects both the personality of the father and mother of the Nile, and so he/she is able to achieve fertility. Surprisingly, the word “Habi” means ""happy"" in the ancient Egyptian language.In multiple scenes in different temples, such as Karnak and Luxor temples, Habi can be seen with lotus and papyrus. This indicates the union of Upper Egypt, represented in its logo, the lotus flower; and the lower represented in its logo, the papyrus.In addition, God Osiris played a role in one of the famous legends of the Nile, and this legend says that Osiris was killed by his brother Set because of jealousy. His body was cut into 40 pieces, and thrown into the Nile, which, in turn, threw shredded parts of Osiris' body in the Mediterranean.However, his wife, Isis, succeeded in finding and collecting his body parts, and thanks to the magic powers she possessed, Isis managed to revive Osiris and conceive a child, and then gave birth to Horus who grew up in the papyrus field in the delta, far from his malevolent uncle Set.Later, the god Horus succeeded in avenging his father, Osiris, by killing his uncle Set, and from here the death and resurrection of Osiris became associated with the flood of the Nile and the decline of its water level.Some sources say that the ancient Egyptians believed that the flood of the Nile was the tears of Isis, mourning the death of her husband Osiris, which is what is now called in Egypt “Wafaa el-Nile” [Loyalty of the Nile], which the Egyptians celebrate for two weeks starting from August 15.For this reason too, sources indicated that Egyptians threw similar items into the River Nile ""until it calms down and stops flooding.""Furthermore, many Nile animals played a major role in ancient myths indicating that the ancient Egyptians' fear of crocodiles and hippos pushed them to worship them, so as to ensure their protection from attacks and from evil in general.The crocodile ""Sobek"" was a god worshiped in Fayoum, and in Kom Ombo in Aswan. Some fish and birds of the Nile were seen as a sign of abundance, livelihood and resurrection in the afterlife.In 1954, the Egyptian leader at the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser, decided to build the High Dam in Aswan on the banks of the Nile. However, the artificial lake behind the dam threatened the monumental temples of Abu Simbel as well as other Pharaonic treasures.Therefore, Egypt and Sudan launched an urgent appeal to UNESCO in 1959 to protect antiquities. Indeed, 22 artifacts have been saved, including the Abu Simbel Temple, which has been dismantled to 16,000 pieces and moved to a new location in a process that required the participation of some 2,000 scientists, engineers, experts, and workers.",2020-06-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'egypt', 'gift', 'water', 'egyptian', 'egyptians', 'nile', 'khnum', 'god', 'osiris', 'river']",Egypt,news article,English
738,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Flood risk awareness: Dialogue around “re-location” has arrived - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/climate-change/flood-risk-awareness-dialogue-around-re-location-has-arrived-1004165991/,"Canadian P&C insurers believe they are starting to make headway with national and provincial governments on the climate change adaptation file. This has put the industry in the thick of a relatively new political dialogue about re-locating Canadians who live in high-risk flood plain areas.

Silvy Wright, president and CEO of Northbridge Financial Corporation, has just become chairwoman of Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), a national trade association representing Canada’s private home, auto and business insurers. In a wide-ranging discussion about IBC’s priorities during her upcoming term, Wright noted that the P&C insurance industry will continue to support the work of national, provincial and territorial governments in advancing the cause of climate adaptation.

“Climate change is a societal challenge, not just an industry challenge,” Wright said. “IBC is focused on working with the government to drive increased investment in climate change resilience. That includes developing a national flood plan.”

Working on the flood plan is at the centre of identifying areas in Canada at high risk of flooding. Wright said four key points have emerged from discussions with governments and other stakeholders about updating the plan.

“We have to begin raising awareness about high-risk areas,” Wright told Canadian Underwriter. “We believe we still have consumers who are not aware of that risk and, unfortunately, are left in dire situations when a catastrophe event [like a flood] occurs.

“Second, we have to deal with re-location of property in high-risk areas. This isn’t just the insurance industry; we are working with governments to support that.

“The third key item would be to advocate for a moratorium on new buildings in flood plains.

“And of course, investing on needed infrastructure. Using our [P&C industry] data and our mapping gives governments the data intelligence to make proper decisions and help consumers manage their risk.”

IBC president and CEO Don Forgeron says governments now see the P&C industry in a leadership role when it comes to adaptation to climate change. He noted that the industry has been talking about climate change for 30 to 40 years, but the issue has become prominent over the last decade.

Severe weather has caused almost $1-billion worth of insured catastrophe losses annually for most of the past 10 years. This year, as Wright noted, the industry has paid out $600 million for damage losses due to severe weather – and there has not been a single major catastrophe yet this year.

The industry is continuing to find success working with governments to improve the country’s flood maps, Forgeron said. Such maps are important for showing which Canadian areas and properties are at high risk of flood. That in turn allows Canadians living in high-risk flood areas to protect themselves — or even move out.

Flood maps are at the root of a new political dialogue – echoed within the insurance industry – about whether damaged property in flood zones should be rebuilt in the same high-risk areas, or simply re-located into to a lower-risk area.

“[Re-location] is a new concept in Canada,” Forgeron said in a conference call with Wright. “At other times, it was about rebuilding everybody in the same flood plain, where they’ve been flooded in three out of the last four years. Now we are talking about actually moving them out of there. I think that’s an indication of how serious the issue has become.”

The sun’s reflection illuminates the great Okavango delta in the Kalahari desert. The bright line of the river shows the annual summer flood advancing from the well-watered Angolan Highlands (upper image margin). The flood water slowly seeps across the 100-mile delta—supplying forests and wetlands—and finally reaches the fault-bounded lower margin of the delta in the middle of winter. The wetlands support a variety of plant and animal species in the semiarid Kalahari, making the Okavango delta one of the most famous tourist sites in Africa. Most of the water from the Okavango is consumed by forests or evaporates. Only 2% exits the delta.

In the Danakil depression in northern Ethiopia, Earth is tearing itself apart. Three tectonic plates—the Arabian, Nubian, and Somalian—are sliding away from each other at a rate of a few centimeters per year. As they diverge, they leave a widening rift valley that will eventually become ocean floor. For now, eastern Africa is one of the few places where it’s possible to see a spreading ridge—a feature normally found in the ocean—on dry land. Danakil is also a good place to see lava fields extending across barren desert. Sedimentary deposits of sand and evaporites appear tan; lava fields and flows are black or grey. The chemical composition of the lava, as well as how long it has been exposed to weathering, can affect its colour.

A long stream of dust and sand crossed the Atlantic Ocean in late June bringing a tan haze to parts of South America and the United States. The dust blows from the northeast to the southwest in this image. The densest layer of dust obscures the blue water from view, but it is not confined to the dark central stream. A broad tan veil of varying hues can be seen throughout the image, hanging in the atmosphere under the white clouds. The coast of South America lies in the southwest corner of the image. From late spring to early fall, strong winds in west Africa frequently kick up massive dust storms which sometimes travel over the northern Atlantic Ocean via the Saharan Air Layer – a layer of warm, dry air from the desert which rises high over the cooler, moister air sitting over the water. The layers don’t mix, allowing the dust and sand to catch the ‘express train’ ride to South America and the United States.

On 23 June, a lengthy river of dust from western Africa began to push across the Atlantic Ocean on easterly winds. A week later, the influx of dust was affecting air quality as far away as the southeastern United States. The dust flowed roughly parallel to a line of clouds in the intertropical convergence zone, an area near the equator where the trade winds come together and rain and clouds are common. In the image above, the dust appears to be streaming from Mauritania, Senegal, and western Sahara. Each year, 40m tons of dust from the Sahara is carried over and dumped into the Amazon river basin. The minerals in the dust replenish nutrients in rainforest soils, which are continually depleted by drenching, tropical rains.

Canada’s Northwest Territories are home to many natural wonders and resources, but are being mined for diamonds in recent years. One area of highly visible development has been the Lac de Gras kimberlite field, about 150 miles south of the Arctic Circle. Kimberlites mean diamonds. Named for deposits first found in Kimberly, South Africa, kimberlites are forged deep within Earth’s mantle. Under intense pressure and heat, carbon is squeezed into diamonds and then erupted to the surface in kimberlite pipes. In the Lac de Gras kimberlite field diamonds have been pushed towards the surface. The region has been developed extensively over the past decade to harvest them. One such development is the Diavik diamond mine (right, down), which opened in 2003. It employs 700 people, produces 1,500 kg of diamonds each year, and grosses $91m in annual sales. The nearby Ekati diamond mine (left, up) opened in 1998 and has production similar to Diavik.

Crete and the Aegean Islands: Vegetated land appears green, sparsely vegetated soils appear greenish-tan, arid desert is seen as light tan, and the basic colour of water is blue. What is unusual about this image, however, is the presence of milky silver tones – a result of sunglint, sunlight reflected from the ocean surface directly back at the satellite imager. If the ocean water were perfectly smooth, like a mirror, the reflection of the sun could be viewed very brightly. The surface of even the most peaceful oceans is textured by small waves, so the light is not perfectly reflected. Where the surface is the smoothest, it appears the brightest; rougher water reflects less light and is dark. The movement of water around islands causes turbulent flow as it passes the obstruction and can roil the surface of the ocean. Winds moving over obstructions also create turbulence. In sunglint areas, the play of moving wind and water changes the surface reflectivity, much like streaks on a mirror. The view that results can reveal much about the surface of the ocean that is not normally visible.

In mid-July, a combination of lightning, parched forests, and hot temperatures fueled dozens of wildfires in Canada and the northwestern United States. By 17 July, 102 fires were burning in British Columbia and 13 more in Alberta. Across the border, 33 fires raged in Washington and Oregon. Dense plumes of smoke billowed from many of the blazes. Actively burning areas are outlined in red. Forests appear dark green. The snow-capped peaks of the Canadian Rockies are visible in the center of the image. Large banks of white clouds hover over the Pacific Ocean, northern Alberta, and Wyoming.

A thick plume of dust blows out from Sudan across hundreds of kilometers of the Red Sea, with smaller plumes also visible over Saudi Arabia and Eritrea. Prevailing northwest winds over the water blew the plumes to the southeast. Though they are not as concentrated or intense as in other parts of the Middle East, airborne dust events occur with greater frequency in Sudan than anywhere else in the region. Dry lake beds and ephemeral rivers provide ample dry sand and clay that are picked up by winds blowing from interior Africa out to sea.

Turkmenistan is a desert country that lies east of the Caspian Sea and borders Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. In this natural-colour image, the Hanhowuz (Khauzkhan) reservoir jumps out as a splash of turquoise amid desert browns. The reservoir was constructed in a natural depression to capture winter runoff and overflow from the Garagum canal for use later during the driest periods of summer. In the image, the canal is the brown ribbon dropping down from the upper right corner and heading south and east from the reservoir. But the canal that started as an engineering wonder for arid lands has also turned out to be an environmental tragedy. It has starved the Aral Sea, which has lost about 90% of its water since the canal’s creation in 1988.

Typhoon Neoguri pounded Okinawa and other western Pacific islands with torrential rain and damaging winds in mid-July, en route to a likely landfall in Japan. At the time, Neoguri was a category 2 typhoon moving through the East China Sea. The storm was imaged by a special ‘day-night band’ that detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses light intensification to detect dim signals. The instrument can sense light as much as 100,000 times fainter than conventional visible-light sensors, making it very sensitive to moonlight and city lights. Here cloud tops are lit by the nearly full moon.

Fires continued to fill the skies with smoke near Lake Baikal, Russia. The coutnry’s fire season began early this year, due to a very warm and dry spring. Fires began springing up in the far northern regions in April, a time when snow typically blankets the region. The Irkutsk region and the Krasnoyarsk territory have been the hardest hit by blazes.

Augustine To's organic farm is among the few that still cultivates papayas. Kahon Chan / China Daily Augustine To works in his field. Kahon Chan / China Daily

An alien plant form has invaded Hong Kong and within a few short years has virtually overrun the territory. The invader is a genetically modified form of papayas, which has become so prevalent that a debate is underway as to whether the engineered food should be exempted from the Genetically Modified Food Ordinance, which became law on Sept 1. Local organic farms are mounting vigorous opposition. Kahon Chan reports.

On a typical July morning in Pahoa of Hawaii, papaya farmer Lea Bernardo woke up to a staggering scene: thousands of papaya trees in his farms and in neighboring farms had been chopped down at the trunk, leaving all the fruit to rot. The Hawaii Papaya Industry Association called it was an act of ""eco-terrorism"" and offered a reward of $10,000 to track down the offenders.

The papayas trees that had been attacked were genetically modified (GM) to resist a deadly ring spot virus, as were the trees on 170 other farms on Oahu and the Big Island. The ring spot virus became epidemic more than half a century ago and during the 1950s wiped out all the papaya farms on the island of Oahu. Scientists from the University of Hawaii came up with a permanent solution in the 1990s - the genetic makeup of papaya plants was partially swapped to make them immune to the virus. The modified plant has been described as transgenic.

Transgenic papayas were first grown commercially in 1998 and now make up the majority of Hawaiian papayas. Though the genetically altered plants were credited with saving the industry, according to Hawaii's Department of Agriculture, the annual yield of papayas in 2009 remained lower than when the ring spot virus was at its peak.

The act of vandalism in July was another harsh reminder that environmental activists continue to haunt the food industry and even consumers. These activists oppose the practice of genetically modifying plants because the downstream affect of the modifications cannot be foretold. Greenpeace, for instance, contents the GM papaya contains a protein that causes allergies and a strain of antibiotic resistance marker gene. Evidence to support this argument, however, is limited.

Organic farms in Hawaii have faced a more pressing challenge. Certified organic farms are prohibited from producing GM crops and if bees land on flowers of organic papaya trees after a buffet in a GM papaya field, DNA of the modified papaya will blend with that of the organic fruit so that its seeds are thus ""contaminated"". The fruit can no longer be sold at the lucrative ""organic"" price.

In Hong Kong, 9,000 km away from the vandalized farms in Hawaii, Augustine To Yat-man lost his only certified non-GM papaya tree early this summer. It came down during a tropical storm. The good news for To is that the lateral shoots growing from the broken trunk will grow into virtual clones of the certified tree and its fruit will be ready for harvest in just a few months.

Exposed to open air, however, To's organic papaya trees are now just as vulnerable as those in Hawaii.

""The problem is how necessary it was,"" he questioned. ""No one will die from a papaya hunger. It is ridiculous to work on this project with uncertainties,"" he added, entering his own doubts about the need for GM papayas.

In 2006, an NGO, the Green Produce Foundation, reported that transgenic papaya seeds were unwittingly distributed to the foundation in the spring of 2005. Green Produce described the error as ""heartbreaking"" as its organic farms had been growing and selling GM crops for a whole year.

Papayas do grow fast. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has tested DNA among engineered crops since 2008 and found out 35-61 percent of the papaya samples collected from local trees contained engineered genes. They are all over the place.

The prevailing theory points to villagers' habits: seeds of savory fruits are randomly dumped in their backyards and the subsequent cross-pollination has carried the viral resistant genes everywhere. Since organic farms have to bear the high cost of genetic modifications testing if the produce proves to have been result turns out to have been modified. As a result, certified farms in Hong Kong avoid growing papayas.

When the Genetically Modified Organisms (Control of Release) Ordinance kicked into effect on Sept 1 2011, papaya remained the only GM crop extensively grown in Hong Kong. The new law, enacted in accordance with the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, under the Convention on Biological Diversity, regulates the release of GM organisms into the environment. The ordinance specifies that if a GM organism is released into the environment, it must be destroyed, unless it is approved or exempted.

A controversial legislative process is underway aimed at excluding papayas from regulation. Augustine To, with other farmers and NGOs, formed a union in June demanding that the proposed exemption be thrown out.

He said: ""The government spared no resources to rectify the situation and turned a blind eye to it. Is this what a responsible government should do?""

To show what could be done, the union plans to designate a ""genetically modified organism-free (GMO-free) agricultural zone"" in the rural area of Hok Lau in Fanling. That plan is to swap other villagers' papaya trees with non-modified papaya seedlings on a voluntary basis. ""The villagers are not stubborn. I walked into a neighbor to tell her that 'my tree is better than yours' and offered the swap. She was happy about it.""

The official explanation of the AFCD is that according to a risk assessment required by the new ordinance, papaya is not a native plant and that its transgenic version is ""extremely unlikely"" to bring any adverse impact on the local habitat.

The unofficial obstacle is the vast spread of transgenic papaya trees. Augustine To estimated there are at least 500 papaya trees in the proposed ""GMO-free zone"" and his estimate for all of Hong Kong would be counted into ""many thousands"".

Jonathan Wong, director of Hong Kong Organic Resource Centre and a professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University, agreed the exemption is ""unfair to some degree"" to local organic farmers, but the entire GMO Ordinance might be rendered valueless if papayas are not exempted. ""If you enforce it against the papayas, how practical would it be?"" Provided that transgenic papayas are in the wild for several years, it has become difficult to reverse their potential impact on the habitat.

Wong does not support genetic engineering, but he does not deny the lack of strong evidence that the engineered papaya is harmful in any way. For instance, allergies attributed to transgenic papayas may have nothing to do with the engineered gene. ""We are talking about coexistence. One cannot write off the other. Conventional agriculture is still the mainstream.""

The center is now looking into ways to help the organic farmers, including recognition of a papaya fruit as organic even its seeds were contaminated by the viral resistant gene.

In the eye of a supporter of genetic modification, there is even a feeling that the intent of the ordinance has been ""somehow distorted"".

Lam Hon-ming, deputy director of the State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology at Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that the ordinance never was intended to imply that GM crops are dangerous, either for human consumption or for the environment.

""A procedure to follow and a prevention are two different concepts,"" he said.

He understands that advocates for organic farming would prefer ""the world to be wholly organic"", but with inadequate scientific proof to back their argument against modified crops, he said ""it does not make much sense to chop away others' trees because you want to protect your organic crop"".

Lam expressed concern even at the way the GMO ordinance is phrased, in that it stipulates the release of any such organism ""must not"" be approved by the Director of AFCD unless he is satisfied that ""possible adverse biosafety effect"" is acceptable or manageable. Wording such as this, Lam argues, might reinforce ""misinterpretation"" of the intent of the ordinance, adding that it appeared the law was drafted to satisfy the demands of pressure groups.

Green Produce Foundation, which was the recipient of the errant distribution of GM papaya seeds in 2005, is participating in the campaigning against exempting papaya crops for organic food standards. But in order to prevent the public from unwittingly GM plants in the future, the foundation argues the case also underlines the importance to enforcing mandatory labeling for engineered foods sold in the market.

Lam Hon-ming countered ""there is no real case to pursue"" a mandatory labeling that may involve a lot of public expenses.

The Executive Secretary of Green Produce Foundation Vicky Lau Yuen-yee said she hears differently from people in the food industry. She said if a mandatory labeling law were put in place, food companies would simply avoid the labeling hassle by switching to non-modified foods.

""We may have no confirmed evidence, but if there is concern, there should be mandatory labeling for consumers to make their own choice,"" she said, ""At least people should be informed about what they are buying.""

After all, it is the market that matters. Back at his organic farm deep in the woods, Augustine To admitted that public attention to the campaign has been limited and the government could just ignore their voice with all the procedures underway.

""In the end, we will leave the consumers to determine if our argument is important or not,"" he said.

A tag is tied to the organic papaya fruit sold in Wan Chai to inform customers not to plant the seeds, which might be contaminated by engineered genes.

However, suburban Mumbai received significantly less rainfall.

The Colaba-based Regional Meteorological Centre in south Mumbai recorded 101 mm of rainfall in 24 hours, starting from 8:30 am on Monday.

While the corresponding figure for the suburbs, recorded by the Santacruz-based centre, is 11.2 mm.

Location-wise rainfall in Mumbai over the last 24 hours showed Cuffe Parade received 128.7 mm of rains, followed by Worli (114.7 mm), Nariman Point (105 mm), Dadar (105.9 mm) and Byculla (99 mm).

While major areas in the suburbs recorded up to 40 mm of rains over the past 24 hours.

“Intense rains were received in localised places in Mumbai on Monday night, followed by intermittent light to moderate showers in the south-central parts of the city. However, the suburbs received less rainfall because there was no monsoon cloud bands over the region,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).

South Mumbai has reduced its rain deficit for June because of the torrential downpour over the past 24 hours and the tally stands at 524.5 mm, which is 16.4 mm short of the long-period average (LPA), the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1961 and 2010.

So far, Mumbai’s suburbs have recorded 395 mm of rains in June, which is 98.1 mm short of the LPA and the lowest for the month in the past five years.

IMD authorities said that the suburbs are likely to end June with a 22% of rain deficiency.

Though the city woke up to light showers on Tuesday morning, the rains stopped in a while because of a partly cloudy sky.

The weather bureau has issued a yellow alert – be aware for moderate or intermittent rains – for the day.

IMD authorities classify light rain between 2.5 and 7.5 mm; moderate rain (7.6-35.5 mm); heavy rain (35.6-64.4 mm); and extremely heavy rain (64.5 - 124.4 mm).",2020-06-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['suburbs', 'south', 'rain', 'mumbai', 'hours', 'rains', 'central', 'mm', 'light', 'record', 'recorded', 'rainfall', 'past', '24', 'received']",India,news article,English

Mr Hassan Ali, who farms along the river, is counting loses after his onions were washed downstream.

Governor Roba warned locals to be cautious as the water levels continue rising.

By MANASE OTSIALO

Devastating floods from the swollen River Daua along the Kenya-Ethiopia border have left several villages in Mandera County under water, hundreds displaced of locals and farms washed away.

The most affected villages are Rhamu Dimtu, Khalicha, Yabicho, Girisa, Sala, Hareri, Darika, Gadudia and Khalalio.

Also at risk are residents of Bellah, Bulla Haji, Neboi, Shafshafey, Boystown and Border Point One, all located along the river.

FAMILIES DISPLACED

In Darika village in Mandera East, 56 families were forced out of their homes after houses were filled with water on Friday night.

â??We have nowhere to go to but to light a bonfire and stay in areas that are a little higher because there are floods everywhere,â? said Mr Ali Adan, a resident.

Mandera has recorded little rainfall this season but residents living along the river have been affected by floods.

â??We are always in this situation every time it rains heavily in Ethiopia where this river comes from and our pleas to have the water harvested and put to good use by our county government have fallen on deaf ears,â? said Mr Adan.

ONION FARM

Mr Hassan Ali, who farms along the river, is counting loses after his onions were washed downstream.

â??I have lost at least Sh600,000 in this situation after my onions were washed away by floods,â? he said.

Mr Harun Siad, another farmer, said his water pumping system on his 30-acre farm has been washed away.

â??I have lost my crops, farm machines including water pumping generators, all valued at Sh1.5 million,â? he said.

On Thursday, Governor Ali Roba raised concerns over threats posed by floods in the county due heavy rains in neighbouring Ethiopia.

â??We have reports of massive flooding of Daua River being experienced upstream from the Ethiopian highlands, which is the source of the river, and all the way to Mandera town,â? the governor said.

WATER SOURCES

The floods, he noted, had submerged the main sources of water serving Mandera Municipality residents.

Suftu intake, he said, was completely submerged as is Neboi whose three wells have collapsed.

The damage to water infrastructure has left the only private well â?? Haji Kerrow â?? to serve the populous Mandera Municipality. But Mr Roba said the water emergency teams are working round the clock to restore supply to the residents.

EMERGENCY TEAM

He warned locals to be cautious as the water levels continue rising.

An emergency surveillance team from the county government is on standby to evacuate residents threatened by floods from Rhamu Dimtu to Border Point One, according to the governor. But by Friday, the said team was yet to reach the affected areas.

The swollen river has so far claimed the lives of four teenagers along the Kenya-Ethiopia border.

Khalalio MCA Abdinoor Dakane Rafat appealed for humanitarian assistance for the affected families.

â??The situation is getting out of hand as the water levels continue rising. More people will be displaced and I call on well-wishers to come forward and offer assistance,â? he said.",2020-05-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['ethiopian', 'heavy', 'affected', 'river', 'ali', 'roba', 'washed', 'county', 'situation', 'mandera', 'water', 'kenya', 'highlands', 'flood', 'rains', 'floods']",Kenya,news article,English

As we conclude the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, lets remind ourselves about cities across the globe that have been designed to embrace livable and sustainable human settlement while putting a comparison with Uganda’s capital that poses as a flopped state seeking emergence renaissance. A ‘1.7 million people City’ seated on 189 square kilometers gives an average density of 8994 persons per square kilometer approximately (UBOS data 2019), with numerous hills and beautiful sceneries that have attracted the largest number of Ugandan elites.

The uncontrolled organic urban development taking pace on the look of urban authorities that has rendered ex-green belts, swamps and public harbours susceptible to a risk of being eaten up by human activities. The increasing land value in the city centre is sending away the urban poor and directing them to settling in wetlands and other protected areas due to lack of alternatives.

Kampala has for a longtime proved to be a city with imbalances between population growth and settlement patterns. It is a place of sarcastic and adverse urban development, city-wide decay and low rate of response to emergencies. Pavements and rooftops mean that less rainwater can soak into the ground. The pattern of streets and buildings has interrupted some of the natural drainage ways and reduced the width of some channels. As a result, more water runs off more quickly, and the drainage system has often become overloaded.

The city is majorly challenged with lack of hydraulic and hydrological-related data where it has failed to manage a clear record of its rainfall amounts, wetland distribution, drainage systems and general water flows data, uncontrolled urban expansion, abandoned buildings, illegal connections of sewage into the separate drainage network, and great amounts of sediments and organic matter which decrease the performance of the drainage facilities, lack of legal instruments and difficulty to approve new legislation, urban planning restrictions, institutional and political problems, opposition by the population, designers and public managers.

Additionally, it’s identified with overlooked scramble and partitioning of land within the wetlands hence bleeding with limited space for catchment of storm water. Land managers spearhead wetland destruction through personalisation and issuing of land titles in these vulnerable places.

The notion, “water is life” is gradually decelerating in the city centre since a dream of a heavy rain is a nightmare to many. The manner in which wetland resources have been depleted is a disgrace to the face of urban planning as a profession and provokes ridiculers into questioning the prevailing urban management systems. The massive erosion, silting of drainage channels, poor waste management as well as reclamation all contribute to this ‘city of floods.’

Natives interpret the status quo as a normal phenomenon that seasonally comes and goes, forgetting the long-term consequences that are left behind. People seem not to be bothered because after a flood wash, business resumes ordinarily.

The urban authority in-charge of the city alleges that it formulated a drainage master plan to curb the flood and its effects which has been challenged with limited funding and skilled workmanship. The drainage master plan that was formulated in 2003 was a way of directing storm water that increased steadily due to the reduction in the green spaces that have been pressurised by the ever-increasing population.

Until now its workability is questioned. This has overtime hyped the concern of many government bodies including the National Physical Planning Board that has responded by cautioning the city managers to take concern of the known flooding, housing and planning challenges to ensure improved livelihoods for the citizens. The challenges of excess storm water management in Kampala can be wrapped under one theme “lack of an operational and easily implementable urban and environmental master plan”.

In 2016, an Italian based consultancy firm specialised in water and land scape designing called “SGI Studio Galli Ingegneria” was contracted to review the 2003 Kampala Drainage Master Plan to check its operationability, its challenges and to pledge a way forward, a project that lasted for five months.

As a result, different additions were observed and taken onboard. It has also been noted with great concern that drainage has been given priority under KIIDP 2, a project that supports Kampala City improvement through world bank funding. However, it is ironical to say that with all such consideration, the drainage system has continued to smack as the biggest challenge that the ‘country’s capital’ battles with especially during a heavy rain.

The central government’s silence over the castrophe makes one to think that there is a ‘burning solution’ that is being planned indoors that is yet to be unveiled, only to hear tales. Kampala metropolitan is a home of numerous wetlands including Bwaise, Ndeeba, Katwe, Nakivubo, Namasuba among others but soon will be living in a shadow of its glamorous natural resources as more swamps continue to be reclaimed.

The city of floods is this town that has been built on wetlands without safeguards to stormwater/flooding and yet city buildings and infrastructure seat on former water catchment arenas. Therefore, city wide developments should be established in a manner that advocates for the wellbeing of natural resources, drainage channels should be reconstructed, waste should be properly disposed at household level, buildings close to drainage channels should have paved compounds as ways of controlling blockages in stormwater flow.

Management of a flood wash should be handled by respective risk management committees at local council level, maintain records of the people/areas affected and have constant checkups and monitoring tours within these sections but most importantly to utilize the use of a GIS system to predict future hazards.

Finally, the city authority must perceive the fact that people settling in these low-lying areas are to stay with the flood until our contemporary political and budgetary system support proper urban planning.

Enforcement of non-structural planning laws is particularly challenging due to the physically extensive informal housing in wetlands which is exacerbated by political, policy, and socioeconomic arrangements.

“There may not be enough time to prepare after you are notified of a flood watch…” (Boulder, 2002). Therefore, urban managers should also empower communities to maintain their drainage systems, through regular inspection and cleaning of drains, an important task that can be performed without specialized skills.

428,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Why Water Pricing and Management in Singapore Needs to be More Ambitious - BRINK,https://www.brinknews.com/why-water-pricing-and-management-in-singapore-needs-to-be-more-ambitious/,"Photo: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images

A recent poll in Singapore’s national daily, The Straits Times, showed that 75 percent of Singaporeans have no idea what their monthly water bill is.

Yet, when the Singapore government recently announced that the country’s water price would be increased in two stages, they opened the sluice gates to a torrent of mainstream and social media comments that questioned need, relevance and appropriateness of the price increases.

Singapore last increased its water price in 2000, so almost a generation has grown up with no adjustment in water prices. In comparison, electricity rates are adjusted regularly, so when electricity rates are modified, it is not news. Reactions from the media and the public are very different regarding changing water prices.

The impact of the price increase will be softened by the increase in the value of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) voucher, one of the support measures by the government to help lower-income households in the face of a slowing economy.



Singapore needs to change the narrative from an argument of cost recovery for domestic and industrial water supply, to one of managing a scarce, strategic and essential resource. For this, a profound societal mindset change is necessary as to how water should be managed in the future.

The Situation Now

Consider some facts. First, the Public Utilities Board (PUB), the national water agency, has been an incredibly efficient institution. It managed to increase its operational efficiency, managing to balance its books until 2010, when it last made an operational profit of S$48 million ($36.9 million). From 2011, it has been making operating losses, which were subsidized by government grants. PUB losses have increased from S$36 million in 2013 to S$57.2 million in 2015.

Our studies indicate that between 2000 and 2014, because of inflation, the price of water decreased by 25.48 percent in real terms. In contrast, electricity and gas prices have increased at a rate slightly higher than inflation.

In addition, the monthly median income of employed residential households was S$4,398 in 2000. This increased to S$8,292 by 2014. Thus, assuming a household used 20 cubic meters of water per month in 2000, the water bill represented 0.69 percent of income. By 2014, it had declined to about 0.36 percent.

At present, about 50 percent of the water used in Singapore comes from Johor, Malaysia. Due to recent prolonged drought, storage at Linggui Reservoir in late 2016 was at a historic low. On January 9, Foreign Minister Balakrishnan noted in the Parliament that there is a “significant risk” that the reservoir may not have any water if 2017 turned out to be a dry year.

Water demand in Singapore will be significantly higher by 2050. Efficient water management must become a priority.

Fortunately, storage is now over 30 percent, but nothing assures this may not change again in the near future.

If the Linggui dries up, Singapore would lose half its water supply and could experience a significant reduction in its NEWater production—high quality recycled wastewater. If the supply from Linggui is cut by half, the question is how would this affect wastewater generated and thus NEWater production?

Add to this the potential uncertainty imposed by climate change, which is likely to contribute to prolonged droughts—a situation already being witnessed in many parts of the world. A prudent strategy for Singapore will be to prepare for not if, but when the supply from Linggui will be reduced to a trickle. Over the past six years, we have regularly argued that it is not floods, but droughts, that Singapore needs to fear.

The current estimate of water demand in Singapore by 2050 is expected to be significantly higher than what it is at present. Accordingly, efficient water management must receive priority and national attention.

At present, in Singapore, domestic and industrial water uses are far too high for comfort. Both need to be reduced significantly by judicious use of pricing, economic incentives, public education and awareness, and, above all, behavioral changes.

Take domestic water use. Per capita daily consumption in Singapore stands at about 150 liters, which is among the lowest for Asian cities, but it is over 50 percent more than the per capita consumption in many other water-efficient cities.

What Can Singapore Do?

Water conservation practices will count, and a combination of economic instruments and attitudinal changes by developing conservation ethics can ensure more efficient use of water.

Singapore’s current targets are to reduce per capita water consumption to 147 liters by 2020 and 140 by 2030. This is too little, too late. The city-state should be much more ambitious.

Between 1960 and 1970, Singapore carried out a unique study on how much water an individual needed to lead a healthy life. It showed that when consumption went over 75 liters per day there were no health benefits for individuals. An average Singaporean now uses twice this amount. Given that many European cities have progressively reduced their daily water consumption to less than 100 liters, Singapore needs to consider a much lower target of around 110 liters per day by 2035, which is achievable. By 2035, based on our estimates, it is likely that the population in the most water-efficient cities will be using around 85 liters per day.

Finally, a mindset change is needed in terms of benchmarking good practices. Major technological breakthroughs often come from the developed world. However, many of the most significant policy breakthroughs are coming from the developing world. For example, the city of Jaipur in India informs people, in their regular water bills, of how much they are receiving in the form of public subsidies. For most Singaporeans, it may come as a surprise to know that they do not pay for all their water-related services through their water bills. For example, the government pays for all stormwater management services as public goods, which households in numerous cities pay directly through their water bills.

Given the strategic importance of water in Singapore, it is essential to engage the population in the formulation of future policies through a robust communication strategy with all the facts, figures and implications of possible decisions. This will ensure its water security for decades to come.

Iranian authorities barred international journalists from covering the disastrous floods that have stricken most of the country’s provinces and caused death and mayhem during the normally festive two-week Nowruz holidays that follow the Iranian new year. Not even the smattering of foreign journalists still huddled precariously in Tehran were granted permission to head to Golestan and Mazandaran provinces or even Shiraz to speak with victims, rescue workers, and good Samaritans—something reporters do during natural disasters all over the world, including recent floods in Nebraska and Mozambique.

So tightly and firmly do Iranian authorities want to maintain control over the messaging over the flood that, with the exception of reporters from state television and the official state news agency, even Iranian journalists were kept away for President Hassan Rouhani’s visit to the disaster scenes in the southern province of Khuzestan. This came after angry protesters confronted Rouhani during his visit to flood zones in Golestan. “I have three children,” one woman cried to him. “Attend to our suffering!”

To find out what’s happening in Iran in the wake of the floods, the world is forced to piece together a narrative based on amateur video trickling out of the country on social media and messaging apps.

And what a story the videos tell.

Horrific images include Iranians clinging for dear life on traffic posts as floods wash away others away, entire towns inundated with muddy water, Iranian motorists stuck inside their cars as unceasing waters carried them off. In all at least 44 people were killed in the nationwide floods. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of transportation infrastructure has been destroyed, including 314 bridges, according to local press.

But the videos also showed scenes of heroism and solidarity. A man in Fars province struggles to save a woman and child being swept away by floodwaters. Villagers in Kermanshah province work together to save farm animals from drowning.

Meanwhile authorities looked pathetic. In an ostensible attempt to prevent fraud, but also to ban heroes from emerging outside the elite circle of power, the judiciary banned celebrities from raising funds for the flood victims, instead demanding that all donations go to the government or official charities.

Mostly bigwigs showed up at the flood zone for infuriating photo ops, in what will likely be remembered throughout Iran as the country’s Hurricane Katrina moment, when the administration of George W. Bush so badly bungled its response to the 2005 Louisiana hurricane that it defined the rest of his presidency.

In one scene in Iran, a bigtime Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officer meekly dips his hand into the floodwater, as if by his very gesture he could reverse the tide.

Heavy rains continue to batter most Iranian provinces.

Clearly the regime was caught unaware and unprepared for the disaster in part because of the Nowruz holidays. The governor of Golestan province, now fired, was apparently abroad somewhere. Rouhani himself was resting on Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf.

But holidays didn’t stop ever-vigilante IRGC thugs from stopping and arresting Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe from departing unhindered from Tehran as she visited her family during Nowruz holidays in April 2016. If they were so tightly prepared that they could identify a young mother traveling with her 22-month-old daughter as a threat to national security, they could surely have foreseen heavy storms meteorologists had been warning of for days, and gathered bags of sand and mobilized officials ahead of the deluge. That’s especially true since places like the north of Iran regularly suffer from flooding.

The regime claims to have maximum control over all aspects of life in Iran. Though that sounds totalitarian to non-Iranians, the promise of security and stability appeals to many inside the country collectively traumatized by the the chaotic disasters that befell Iran in the twentieth century.

But the floods showed what a paper tiger the regime is. People are largely left to fend for themselves as ineffectual hardline regime stalwarts bark orders or stage photo ops.

Like the military-dominated regimes in Egypt and Algeria, Iran under the sway of the IRGC is weak and incompetent. It’s also brittle. State television on March 29 cut off a live broadcast of a crisis management meeting chaired by Rouhani after one official complained about a lack of opportunity for participants to express their concerns about the floods.

A defensive Rouhani said it was “impossible” to prevent floods, pointing to the 2011 tsunami in Japan and even the recent floods in Nebraska as examples.

But Iranians are outraged. Even if unpreventable, how could a regime that spends so many resources on controversial troop deployments and missile advancements claim not to be able to mitigate the damage. One Iranian man posted a video of himself directly addressing Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the leaders of the IRGC.

“You gave so much for Syria, what did you get out of it?” he says. “People are being destroyed by this flooding. Our own children are drowning. You who didn’t want Israel to exist in twenty years, with this situation, our country won’t see another year.”

There’s only one way for Iran to take advantage of the floods, and that is if the Trump administration begins mouthing off about the issue. That will give the regime the ability to cast the many critical of its performance as stooges of the west.

US policymakers should understand that Iran’s inability to respond to the floods in the most basic way, and it’s unwillingness to listen to the environmental scientists who have for years warned of Iran’s impending water management crises, is a far bigger condemnation of the regime than any tweet by National Security Advisor John Bolton or State Department press release.

We tried to reach it through another village Muraina but with no roads in sight we didn't know which way to approach the lake situated at around 2800 metres,"" said Inspector Sanjay Upreti who was part of the 12-member SDRF team led by Commandant Navneet Bhullar that went to the lake on foot.

117,Drought Sri Lanka,"How big droughts, forest fires could be the new normal in Appalachia - PBS NewsHour",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/widespread-forest-fires-claims-may-signal-new-normal-appalachian-mountains,"The South is burning. Wildfires have burned more than 100,000 acres across seven states in the southern Appalachian Mountains since late October. Of the 44 ongoing blazes, the biggest struck northern Georgia and western North Carolina, where whole towns have fled as part of a slate of mass evacuations. All of which, scientists say, is pretty weird.

“It’s very rare to have this many fires burning this amount of area in the Southeast,” U.S. Forest Service ecologist James Vose. “It’s typically a wet climate, especially in that southern Appalachian region where these fires are occurring.”

This year, the situation changed. The Southeast has experienced a once in a generation drought, with the area seeing little to no rainfall at all since September. Columbia University bioclimatologist Park Williams said the epicenter of the drought — the spot between northern Georgia, eastern Tennessee and the western Carolinas — rivaled conditions typically witnessed in the American West. More than 47 million people live in these southern drought areas, which extend from Oklahoma to Virginia, according to the Associated Press.

“Those regions are definitely experiencing a one in 50 year event,” Williams said. This aridness arrived just as autumn trees across the region shed their colorful leaves — a highly flammable fuel for wildfires.

Yet climate change indicators suggest droughts of this magnitude are becoming the status quo, Vose said. Though Southeast climate leans toward abundant rainfall, the region is no stranger to drought. It cycles between stretches of dry and moist. But since the 1980s, droughts have become more frequent in the Southeast. Vose said these dry spells are also growing longer, meaning it’s drier for longer when it’s dry, and it’s wetter for longer when wet.

In the past, these dry periods would be interrupted by a rainstorm every couple of weeks, which stymied large fires, Vose said, but the new norm of extensive dry periods means that there is no rainfall to keep the fires in check.

“Consecutive dry periods are predicted to occur as a result of anthropogenic [man-made] climate change,” Vose said. “These trends make larger area burns and more fires perhaps more likely in the future.”

An onslaught of regular droughts will impose benefits and strains to southeastern wildlife. Many native water-loving pine trees will falter, but oak forests thrive in drought-stricken areas, especially those cleared by fire. The human toll may be harder to afford. More than 200 patients landed in the hospital last week in Chattanooga, Tennessee due to breathing difficulties related to wildfire smoke plumes. So far, the U.S. Forest Service has spent $45 million to firefighting expenses.

What triggered the latest wildfires remains unknown, but arson investigations are underway in Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina and Kentucky.",2016-11-22 08:00:00+00:00,"['fires', 'dry', 'big', 'vose', 'southeast', 'droughts', 'rainfall', 'forest', 'drought', 'climate', 'region', 'appalachia', 'tennessee', 'southern', 'normal']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
803,FL-2020-000164-IND,"Why Is India Banning China's TikTok, UC Browser, Weibo, and WeChat? - Foreign Policy",https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/02/india-banning-chinese-mobile-apps-tiktok-tech-market/,"News and analysis from India and its neighboring countries in South Asia, a region home to one-fourth of the world’s population. Delivered Thursday.

Why Is India Banning China’s TikTok?

Welcome to Foreign Policy’s South Asia Brief. This week: Why India banned 59 Chinese apps, South Asia records 1 million coronavirus cases, dangerous floods hit Bangladesh, and a review of the new novel A Burning.

If you would like to receive South Asia Brief in your inbox every Thursday, please sign up here.

Why India Banned TikTok

On Monday, India’s government announced it would block the use of 59 mobile apps because they were “engaged in activities … prejudicial to [the] sovereignty and integrity of India.” While New Delhi’s press release didn’t mention Beijing by name, the list of 59 apps—each run by Chinese companies—made clear that it was the intended target.

The blocked software includes the video-sharing app TikTok, which has been downloaded an estimated 600 million times in India; UC Browser, an internet browser that uses very little data and is popular among Indians using low-cost smartphones; and other well-known apps such as Shareit, Baidu, Weibo, and WeChat.

India cited section 69A of its Information Technology Act in its explanation for why it took action. But according to Indian law, it could have kept the decision confidential. Taking a public stand against China was the point. After last month’s deadly skirmish with Chinese troops, New Delhi has faced domestic pressure to come up with a robust response. Its options on trade were limited and potentially self-defeating, while military options were even more dangerous. China’s technological exports were a natural arena to turn to—and one in which India could actually impose some damage.

Monday’s decision is momentous on its own, but it will also likely spur tit-for-tat actions between the world’s two biggest internet markets in terms of users. It may even set a precedent for other countries looking to regulate or ban Chinese tech firms.

The impact on China. India is China’s biggest external market for apps such as TikTok and UC Browser. While India represents a relatively small source of revenue for Chinese apps, it is still its fastest growing major market. As Indians grow richer, average revenues per user will increase: India’s digital advertising market is expected to grow by 26 percent this year, CNN reports. New Delhi’s actions close off this market. There may be further action on other Chinese software and hardware, especially 5G products, as Indians become more aware of the potential security threats of Chinese technology.

Just this week, for example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission officially designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats, effectively barring U.S. internet providers from using federal subsidies to buy their equipment.

The impact on India. New Delhi’s decision will hurt Indians, too. While the move will please the country’s jingoistic media and those calling for revenge after last month’s border skirmish, banning TikTok will hurt thousands of Indian content creators who depend on the Chinese app for their livelihoods. Even so, Indian companies such as Roposo, a local alternative to TikTok, may see a surge in interest and new users. Chrome is still the most popular browser app in India, and companies such as Google may also benefit from the blocking of UC Browser.

A new era of techno-nationalism? While the immediate impetus for India’s actions comes from the border clashes, the app ban itself is not that surprising given the broader trend of countries trying to safeguard their citizens’ data. As more Indians come online through cheap smartphones and low-cost data plans, personal data will become more valuable to tech firms and governments alike. Given how intertwined China’s biggest companies are with the state, it was only a matter of time before countries such as India imposed their own Great Firewalls.

If anything, India may have left it too long, given the inroads made by apps such as TikTok, and the fact that the most popular smartphone brands in India are not just companies such as Huawei and Xiaomi, but also less Chinese-sounding brands such as Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus. (Vivo is the title sponsor of the popular Indian Premier League cricket series, a relationship that may well now be cut short before next year’s tournament.)

The question now is how Beijing might retaliate.

What We’re Following

Coronavirus update. South Asia’s countries now have more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases between them. India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are among the top 20 countries in the world with the most cases, in fourth, 12th, and 18th places respectively. As shown above, the region’s countries have been doubling their total cases between every 14 and 20 days. And with testing rates still low, aggressive contact-tracing is next to impossible. Nonetheless, the region is reopening for business, as leaders begin to accept that some form of herd immunity may be the only solution for people who depend on daily labor.

Dangerous monsoon flooding in Bangladesh. Thousands of hectares of farmland in Bangladesh lie submerged from floods triggered by monsoon rains. A disaster management official told Reuters that the crisis could worsen, with more than 200,000 people marooned and more rainfall expected this week. The crisis was exacerbated after the Brahmaputra River burst its banks in the neighboring Indian state of Assam last weekend, flooding thousands of villages in the area.

Russia’s Afghanistan “bountygate.” After revelations last weekend that U.S. President Donald Trump may have received intelligence showing that a Russian spy unit was paying the Taliban bounties to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, there has been fallout in Washington. While Trump says he was not actually briefed on this intelligence, a growing number of voices on Capitol Hill are calling for action. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Trump’s failure to act was a “dereliction of duty,” while Trump’s former National Security Advisor John Bolton said the news merited “a very serious response.”

It’s worth pointing out that that Russia’s involvement in Afghanistan should be no surprise. Russian night vision scopes have previously been found in Taliban hands, and U.S. commanders in the region have long admitted that Moscow was arming the Taliban. As Sajjan Gohel and Allison Bailey wrote for Foreign Policy this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin has worked to enhance ties with the Taliban for years, “with the purpose of expanding its strategic interests in Afghanistan. … Once NATO and U.S. forces leave, Russia will once again have an opportunity to step in.”

Turbulence ahead for PIA. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has been banned from operating in the European Union for the next six months. The decision came after Pakistan grounded 262 airline pilots from PIA and other domestic airlines with allegedly “dubious” licenses—a finding that emerged after an investigation into a deadly plane crash in Karachi last month.

Question of the Week

Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan faced criticism this week for using the word “martyred” to describe the killing of a terrorist. Who was he referring to?

A) Osama bin Laden

B) Ayman al-Zawahiri

C) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi

D) Baitullah Mehsud

Scroll down for the answer.

What We’re Reading

Megha Majumdar’s A Burning is one of the most talked-about novels this summer, and for good reason. As I wrote in a review of the book, Majumdar’s compelling, timely, and propulsive book “is soaring up the global bestseller lists thanks in part to its resonance with this summer of discontent and despair, a time when public trust in leadership and Big Tech is dwindling. One reason why A Burning should appeal to readers unfamiliar with India is that the novel is not just a critique of modern Indian society but a universal parable on inequality.”

Read the full review here.

And the Answer Is…

A) Osama bin Laden.

The former al Qaeda leader was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan in 2011, a decade after he masterminded the 9/11 attacks. Discussing the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in a speech in parliament this week, Khan said, “I will never forget how we Pakistanis were embarrassed when the Americans came into Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden, martyred him.” Opposition leaders in parliament strongly objected to Khan’s remarks: One called bin Laden the “ultimate terrorist” who “destroyed” Pakistan.

That’s it for this week.

1034,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,"Expert Predicts More Heavy Rain, Flooding in Kenya, Southern Ethiopia - VOA News",https://www.voanews.com/africa/expert-predicts-more-heavy-rain-flooding-kenya-southern-ethiopia,"U.S. weather forecasters predict continued heavy rainfall in eastern African regions that have already been hit hard by heavy rains and flash flooding.

The regions including the southern part of Ethiopia, Southern Sudan, Uganda, the northern part of Tanzania, and Kenya usually get limited rainfall from September to December, according the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

This year, however, heavy rains have struck northern Kenya for weeks, causing flash floods that have displaced thousands of people and swept away hundreds of livestock.

Galma Dabaso lives in Walda, one of the affected areas. He says the area has lost hundreds of animals.

â??The rain started last night and [is] still pouring. We have never seen this much rainfall. It has caused so much destruction. We are circled by water. Houses are destroyed, rivers have overflown. We are moving to the higher ground to save our lives and animals,â? he tells VOA's Horn of Africa region.

Wassila Thiaw, a NOAA meteorologist, said while this is the beginning of the short rainfall season, eastern Africa has seen extremely heavy rainfall.

Parts of southern Ethiopia that ordinarily do not receive rain until around October, according to NOAA, have recorded more than 120 millimeters above their normal rainfall usual levels. ""That is about 625 percent of their normal rainfall,â? Thiaw said.

â??These rainfalls in the region,"" he says ""are very unusual.""

Thiaw blames the current heavy rainfall in East Africa on large-scale movements in the ocean and the atmosphere.

He says winds have brought in moist, warm air from the western Indian Ocean. This, he says, ""contributes to the moisture surplus that trigger extremely heavy rainfall amount in this regionâ?¦ triggering flooding that we have been seeing.â?

Thiaw says the situation to continue in coming weeks.

â??Over all we predict above [average] rainfall for in October November and December in the area,"" he says, adding that continued flooding and heavy rainfall could affect food security.",2019-10-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['southern', 'africa', 'predicts', 'rainfall', 'regions', 'heavy', 'seen', 'ethiopia', 'thiaw', 'region', 'expert', 'kenya', 'flooding', 'rains', 'rain']",Kenya,news article,English

The sudden, destructive deluge hit the country during Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, when many take to the road for vacations.

915,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Nigeria: Flood of Tears, As Homes, Farmlands Get Washed Away - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009050051.html,"Floods have again hit several parts of the country, severely affecting farmlands and displacing thousands of people, especially in Kebbi State where our correspondent reports that it ravaged over 500,000 hectares of farm produce estimated at over N5billion, while also rendering people homeless in other states, heightening threats to food security.

Besides other factors threatening food security in Nigeria, including the seemingly intractable terrorism, banditry and killer herdsmen's onslaught which are steadily spreading across the country, harvest of farm produce might be imperiled this year and even the next as a result of flooding.

In Kebbi State for instance, 500,000 hectares was recently devastated by flood, 450,000 hectares of it being for rice farms.

This has heightened fears that by next year, majority of farmers in the state, particularly rice farmers, would be out of business.

Many farmlands visited by our correspondent were overrun by floods, just as rice farms were submerged.

A farmer, Libabatu Usman Kamba, expressed fears over imminent food scarcity, particularly as most of the farmers would not be able to mobilize for the next farming season due to the zero harvest this year.

Kamba said she cultivated over 20 hectares of rice this year at Cida Kai village in Dandi Local Government Area but lost over 16 hectares of the rice farm to flood.

She said her crop was ready for harvest and was hoping to get 40 bags of rice per hectare and 700 bags of paddy rice.

Though she could not say what she spent on the hectares submerged in the flood, she added that most farmers would not be able to go for dry season farming this year, hence the need for urgent government intervention.

""The losses recorded this year are so enormous that majority of small holder farmers would not go back for this year's dry season farming.

""The usual practice by most farmers is to re-invest what they realized from rainy season farming for dry season farming,"" she said.

Zuwaira Abubakar, another rice farmer in Argungu, said barely all rice farms in the area were submerged and that would affect farmers' capital for dry season farming. Zuwaira, who cultivated over 25 hectares of rice, said she lost all to flood, adding that she had spent over N300,000 in the farm before the flood came.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid. Many of us will be out of business if no intervention comes our way.

""Farmers don't keep money, the more we make in the business the more we open more farmlands, that is the secret of the farming business otherwise you won't last long in it,"" she said.

In Danko Wasagu Local Government Area, a farmer, Usman Umar, told Daily Trust that they did not experience massive destruction as was the case in most parts of the state, noting that only about a hectare of seven hectares of his rice farm was washed away by the flood.

Another farmer, Suleiman Bashir, who stood helplessly by his rice farm which was submerged along Dukku/Makera road in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area, appealed to the state and federal governments to come to their aid.

""I don't know what to do, I have two large rice farms and they have been completely submerged.

""We are appealing to the state and federal governments to assist us,"" he said.

The chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Sani Dododo, said farm produce worth over N5 billion was destroyed by flood.

He added that the loss recorded in rice farming could be put at 90 percent of the total value of farm produce in the state.

""Over 500,000 hectares of farmlands have been destroyed by flood, the destruction translates to over N5billion worth of farm produce.

""Rice farms constitute to about 90 percent of the farm produce destroyed,"" he said.

The National President of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Aminu Goronyo, who toured some of the affected places while in the entourage of the Kebbi State governor, described the incident as devastating.

Goronyo assured the farmers of federal government intervention because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had sent its officials to the state to assess the situation for immediate intervention.

""The CBN governor has directed RIFAN to mobilise one million farmers that can produce five million metric tonnes of rice during the dry season commencing in November for support,"" he said.

Also speaking with newsmen at Bakin Gada in Argungu Local Government Area after inspecting rice farms destroyed in some local government areas, Governor Abubakar Bagudu expressed shock over the incident, describing it as regrettable.

Thousands rendered homeless in Bauchi

Thousands of displaced people including women and children and the aged have moved into public schools, primary healthcare centres and shops while hundreds of others have relocated to neighboring Jama'are, Azare and Giade local government areas of Bauchi State for shelter.

When our correspondent visited some of the affected areas on Wednesday, dozens of families had taken refuge at various public schools including the Adamami Primary School which was still occupied by the flood.

A victim and father of 11 children, Hamisu Magaji, said three families were sharing two classes.

""One class is accommodating 42 children sleeping on school desks while the male heads of families are sleeping on tables because water has taken over the environment.

""We are staying here due to the flood which destroyed our houses, properties, food and farmlands but we leave everything to God.

""We are yet to receive support or assistance from anybody four days after the incident, life has been difficult, especially taking care of the families but we are struggling to feed them, that notwithstanding, we are appealing to the government and organizations to come to our aid,"" he said.

His daughter, 18-year-old Halima Hamisu, who cooked food for children in the camp, told Daily Trust how they managed to sleep on school desks.

""We arrange the desks laying mats on top and putting long sticks on four angles to hang mosquito nets.

""We line up between 8 and 12 children inside the net and that is how we have managed in this class for the past four days as our mothers have relocated to a nearby village because they are nursing babies,"" she said.

A woman with four children at the Government Day Secondary School camp in Adamami, Barakana Mohammed, said her six months old daughter had been infected with cold.

""I have been sleeping on the floor with my children for four days due to the flood that destroyed our house and property and the bad condition coupled with the weather affecting the children.

""Life has become difficult living in a classroom but we pray for God's intervention.

""We are calling on government to come to our aid.""

A 60-year-old woman, Aishatu Abdullahi, now taking refuge at the camp, decried the absence of essential commodities and the sanitary situation in the camp, saying, ""We don't have food in the camp because water has destroyed everything and the little our caregivers are struggling to bring to the camp is not enough as we have small children.

""I am appealing to the government and privileged individuals in the name of God to support us with food and other relief materials so as to rescue us from additional hardship.""

The village head of Adamami, Malam Isa Nalaraba, said the flood had caused a lot of destruction but, ""We thank God for saving our lives and our children because almost more than half of Adamami is destroyed by the flood which displaced many people to neighboring communities while others have become refugees in their locality while many other residents have relocated to neighboring towns and villages.

""We are appealing to the government and individuals to assist the victims with relief materials to support them and continue their lives.""

Habiba Sani who was to wed in three months and three others including a 14-year-old girl and a 60-year-old woman drowned in flood waters in Bakatma, Shira Local Government Area of the state.

Habiba's father, Malam Sani Biidis, told Daily Trust that he was away when his neighbor invited her and his daughter to accompany him to remove weeds in a rice farm beside a river that was flooded following heavy downpour.

He described the deceased as a kind hearted and obedient girl who hardly argued or disagreed with people within and outside the family.

""They met their sad end when they tried to cross the river at a point where everybody including children used to pass from the village because the area is not deep or wide but as a result of the flood the volume and speed of the water had increased, unfortunately the moment they entered the river the flow dragged them down and they could not swim out of the water.

""It was some children who witnessed the incident that rushed to inform the family that they tried to cross the river but drowned in the process.

""When they launched the search operation their corpses were found in a nearby area some meters from the point of passage.

""I was away from home when I received a phone call that my daughter and one other girl had drowned.

""Habiba's death is painful but I leave everything to God and pray for their souls,"" Bidis said.

Badamasi Shittu, the father of the 14-year-old Ziyada Badamasi, said he asked them to go to his rice farm to assist him remove weeds and apply fertilizer.

""My daughter, Ziyada, told me that they would go before I arrived to apply the fertilizer.

""When they reached the point where people cross the river, they met some children but decided to cross and when they reached the center of the river, Ziyada shouted for help as the flow pulled them down and there was no mature person around to rescue them.

""It was one of the children who rushed home and notified us that Habiba and Ziyada had drowned,"" he said.

The Acting Permanent Secretary in the State Emergency Management Agency, Habu Ningi, said the flood affected 11 villages including Adamami, Bakatma, Alkaleri, Sawi, Dirmi, dago, Shira, Yana , Bege, Bukul, Fago , Tsafi and Disina all, in Shira LGA.

Bakatma village, Adamami, Alkaleri, and Disina town and other villages in Shira Local Government Area were flooded following heavy downpour between Sunday and Monday morning, destroying over 2,600 houses and many hectares of farmlands.

A resident of Adamami, Adamu Oni Adamami, said the heavy rain started on Sunday and around 11 pm people in the town were confused because water had taken over everywhere, gushing into houses at a high speed.

""The rain continued unabated and people started running for safety, especially women and children, to higher areas.

""The rain did not stop until 6am on Monday thousands of houses collapsed and many hectares of farmlands were destroyed.""

Oni added; ""Another devastation the flood caused is destruction of food.

""Apart from losing houses majority of the victims have no food and the farmlands have been destroyed, leaving us in a big calamity now and in future because the time to cultivate new crops has passed.

""We are calling on the government, individuals and corporate organizations to come to our aid before the situation goes out of hand.""

Niger farmers count losses

Many farmlands have been wiped out in Niger State where there is wide lamentation among farmers who are appealing to the government to come to their aid.

Our correspondent gathered that entire farmlands were washed away by floods, leaving farmers with nothing to harvest.

An affected farmer, Tukura Saidu from Kuyi village, said over 40 farmers were affected in his village as yams, maize and rice planted were all wiped out, adding that it was the first time of experiencing such a huge loss to flood.

Also, fish worth over N100 million were washed away by flood at Lapai Gwari in Bosso Local Government Area of the state, it was gathered.

A fish farm according to Daily Trust findings, the major place where fish sellers get fresh fish, was greatly affected, causing a rise in the price of fish in the area as residents now have to travel elsewhere to get fish.

A fish farmer, Malam Mohammad Tukur, lamented that the devastation caused by ravaging floods in Lapai Gwari was the first of its kind and appealed to the state government to urgently assist them.

He said about 2000 fish farms had been washed away.

Another farmer, Malam Abdullahi Saidu, said customers from across Nigeria were trooping to the farm before the incident but many farmers had lost millions of naira worth of investments to floods.

The Vice Chairman of Bosso Local Government Area, Malam Saidu Zegi, said in April this year, rainstorms affected over 200 people, just as many farmers lost their farmlands.

The Director General, Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, described the incident as not only pathetic and tragic but also devastating.

Inga said they had sent a team of experts from the agency to investigate the extent of damage caused.

This according to him is to enable the state government come up with modalities of assisting victims.

He said though the state government was battling with insufficient funds occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, it would not fold its arms to allow the people suffer without any aid.

Floods hit Enugu farms

Enugu State is not left out of the massive flooding and destruction of crops. Mr. Austin Obiora has a rice farm of about 235 hectares at Ihuokpara community in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

Speaking with Daily Trust, he recalled how a heavy rainfall on August 26 caused a massive flood which affected his farm. About 16 hectares of the rice field was adversely affected.

According to him, the rice had started flowering when the flood came.

""I had to start afresh because the rice planting season was almost over.

""I started doing another ""broadcasting"" (spreading) of rice seeds in a systematic and orderly way to enable them germinate very well,"" he said.

""It costs about N250,000 to cultivate one hectare of rice field and when multiplied by 16 hectares, it will be over N4m because I have to add the cost of labour,"" Obiora said, adding: ""Therefore, I lost over N4m due to the massive and devastating flood.""

He, however, didn't feel discouraged by the huge loss because he said upon realizing that some large hectares were still there for him, the unaffected hectares represent compensation for his loss.

""We pray that it doesn't happen again in the next planting season, nobody wants to incur losses,"" he said.

Asked whether any government agency came to his aide, he said he considered it would be a waste of time and energy to approach any government body, just as he did not insure his farm in the first place.

However, Obiora said he had learnt his lesson as he has started making arrangements for insuring his farms in future.

Another farmer, an elderly Rev Dr Lambert Echetu who is into maize and cassava farming, told our correspondent that the combined misfortune of flooding and activities of herdsmen had caused a lot of havoc to his maize farm of two hectares at Amagunze in Nkanu-East Local Government Area.

He said: ""The cattle and flood messed up my maize farm.

""I planted maize covering two hectares.

""I spent about N240,000 on clearing the bush, seeds and fertilizer.

""We went to the Government House, Enugu to complain about the Fulani herdsmen and their cows destroying our farms.

""The first tragedy was done to the farm by the cows.

""The second tragedy was caused by the huge flooding, even though the place is swampy.

""When I got to the Government House, they would refer me from one office to the other and it was like a wild goose chase and I left,"" he said.

Echetu further said: ""As a servant of God, when I tried to get help from people and I didn't succeed, I handed everything over to God.

""I love farming because I have passion for it.

""I prayed over the farm project before I decided to farm.

""I have a lot of people who need my help in the village.

""My intention is after harvesting the maize, and bringing it to the church, I will distribute the maize to the congregation.""

He said despite the setback, he won't give up farming and had acquired over 100 hectares of land at Ihu-Okpara community, specifically for planting cassava in the next planting season.

Kano, Jigawa farmers cry out

Last month, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) revealed that 20 of the 44 local government areas in Kano State were at high risk of flooding during this year's rainy season.

Tarauni, Garum Malam, Rimin Gado, Gaya, Gezawa, Gwale, Shanono, Gabasawa, Gwarzo, Ungoggo, Warawa, Dawakin Kudu, Dambatta, Bebeji, Kabo, Wudil, Kura, Nassarawa, Kano Municipal and Kumbotso were the local government areas identified in the report.

With the recent wave of rainfall in the state, some of the identified local governments have already begun to experience heavy flooding which resulted in the destruction of several hectares of farmlands by flood, causing loss of millions of naira worth of farm products.

According to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) in Kano, so far, hundreds of rice farmers in five local governments have reported to have been affected by the flood.

The state chapter chairman of RIFAN, Alhaji Haruna Abubakar Aliyu, said farmers in Dambatta, Makoda, Ajingi, Gaya and Rinim Gado have been seriously affected by the flooding.

""Based on the directives received from the RIFAN head office after we had sent our report on the damages caused to our various members, the head office asked us to compile a detailed report on the flood which currently we are working on.

""We have so far identified five local governments, though we are aware there are more than that but we are still working on it,"" he said.

The state chapter chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Alhaji Zubairu Ibrahim, said the association was still assessing the areas affected and number of farmers and farm lands affected.

He added that the outcome of the ongoing assessment would be made public and the association was working on measures to be adopted in assisting the affected farmers.

Attempts to contact the state commissioner for agriculture and who is also the deputy governor proved abortive but sources close to the ministry said a committee had been inaugurated by the state government to look into the issue and present its report for further action.

In Jigawa State, following a two-day heavy downpour in Birninkudu Local Government Area, several houses and farmlands were said to have been destroyed.

Alhaji Wada Faka, the chairman of the local government, said a yet-to-be ascertained number of houses and farmlands were destroyed in Malamawar Gangaran, Babaldu, Wurno, Kiyako and Samamiya villages.

NEMA had also stated that the Nigerian Hydrological Agency (NIHSA) 2020 Annual Flood Outlook already listed 12 local government areas in the state as flood-prone areas.

The NIHSA report listed Kaugama, Taura, Guri, Gwaram, Dutse, Auyo, Miga, Malam Madori, Ringim, Birniwa, Jahun and Kafin Hausa as probable flood risk areas.

Nasarawa farmers groan under flood

Many farms and farming communities were recently submerged in flood waters in Nasarawa, a state with many small, medium and large scale farms.

A farmer in Doma Local Government Area, Abu Doma, said his farm and many others were washed away in a few days.

Same goes with people residing on the bank of the River Benue along the state's boundary with Benue State.

This is the second year in a row that River Kilema in Lafia has flooded and submerged farms, houses and cemeteries among others.

An official of the State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) who prefers anonymity said it was taking measures to mitigate a possible humanitarian crisis in the state.

The agency has been urging those living in flood-prone areas to leave such places.

He said last month, heavy floods occurred in three local government areas including Awe, Nasarawa and Toto.

The Director of flood, Erosion Control and Land Reclamation, Mr. Jonathan Kwaghkaha Ortoho, said plans were on to tackle erosion at Umasha, Toto, Loko, Nasarawa, Rukubi, Doma and Tunga areas of the state.",2020-09-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'washed', 'children', 'homes', 'flood', 'local', 'farm', 'area', 'farmlands', 'nigeria', 'tears', 'state', 'away', 'rice', 'hectares']",Nigeria,news article,English

For the past few days, it has been raining in many parts of the country and as is the unfortunate norm, whenever it rains, many areas including roads flood and are rendered impassable not to mention the destruction of property and sometimes lives. While we might not have control over the rain, we surely should be able to control the after effects.

Year after year, the country grapples with the problem of rain floods which are mainly caused by poor drainage systems, disregard of environmental guidelines such as erecting buildings in swampy areas that are prone to floods, poor garbage disposal which usually blocks drainage systems, in turn hindering passage of water, among others.

The Kampala Capital City Authority 2017 Kampala drainage master plan cites poor design and construction of drains, poor inter connectivity of drains, limited sensitisation of the public, unplanned settlements and poor enforcement mechanisms and mindsets of the people as some of the issues that affect drainage.

In Kampala for instance, the same areas keep flooding every time it rains heavily even for just a few hours, causing an aftermath of traffic jam and in unfortunate circumstances, accidents where people and vehicles are washed away by the floods.

Some of these areas include Industrial Area, where motorists can be seen daring the raging filthy water that takes over road space turning them into mini rivers. Since this is a recurring problem and is almost expected every year, it should be continually planned for and a lasting solution found.

The areas in different parts of the country that are prone to flooding should be identified before the rains start and a plan to prevent the effects of flooding be devised.

We shouldn’t have to keep crying foul about the same problem year in, year out as if it is impossible to solve. We could start with simple steps such as ensuring that man hole covers are intact as these have also been a death trap, especially when rain floods occur.

Then there’s the emphasis on the state of the drainage system. With well-planned and constructed drainage systems, we can alleviate floods.

As has been suggested before by many concerned and expert parties, these systems must undergo regular maintenance which includes unclogging and revaluating their ability and effectiveness to serve their purpose as the water volumes may keep increasing.

Better planning for urban settlement, harvesting rain water, respecting the natural water catchment areas are also probable steps to take.

While we appreciate that some work has been done to alleviate floods in some areas, more has to be done as the rain and consequent floods wait for no man.",2021-02-15 08:00:00+00:00,"['solution', 'areas', 'lets', 'kampala', 'lasting', 'drainage', 'rain', 'rains', 'floods', 'systems', 'water', 'poor', 'problem']",Uganda,news article,English
134,FL-2020-000164-IND,Global ripple effect of shifting monsoons - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200629124059.htm,"Scientists from the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory and a dozen other international research institutions have produced the most elaborate set of projections to date that illustrates possible futures for major monsoon regions.

Multiple regions around the world plan energy production, agricultural practices and other essential economic endeavors based on the annual arrival of monsoons, which entails a seasonal shift in the direction of winds that provides periods of steady rainfall. However, unchecked greenhouse gas emissions could disrupt these traditionally predictable events.

Using RegCM4, the latest version of a popular regional climate model developed by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Italy, the team ran a series of simulations to project and evaluate changes in nine monsoon regions across five continents. The researchers designed the simulations with a tight grid of each region containing spacing of less than 16 miles, which provided a substantial level of detail.

The team, part of a global effort called the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment, or CORDEX, published its findings in Climate Dynamics.

""This is the first time that a regional climate model has been used to provide a global view of changes in monsoons,"" said lead author Moetasim Ashfaq, a climate computational scientist at ORNL. ""It took a great deal of time and effort to compile and analyze such high-profile, high-resolution data, and these detailed simulations would not have been possible without a significant international collaboration.""

ORNL researchers simulated the South Asian monsoon region using resources of the laboratory's Compute and Data Environment for Science and the compute cluster Eos, and the rest of the simulations were conducted at various other computing centers. The team uncovered commonalities in regional monsoon responses to increases in greenhouse gas emissions. These responses included monsoon onset delays, shorter monsoon seasons and more intense seasonal fluctuation.

The simulations predicted and compared changes that would occur in different scenarios provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, known as Representation Concentration Pathway, or RCP8.5 and RCP2.6.

RCP8.5 assumes that carbon emissions follow a ""business as usual"" scenario without policy interventions, whereas RCP2.6 is based on much lower increases in emissions with aggressive mitigation policies. Although the monsoon patterns will likely change for both RCPs, the simulations revealed that the amount of change would likely be minimal under RCP2.6 but could be significant under RCP8.5.

""If emissions are reduced based on RCP2.6 out to the year 2100, the simulations show that the long, damaging shifts in monsoon behaviors can mostly be avoided,"" Ashfaq said. ""If you look at the best-case scenario, we do still see changes, but they are insignificantly different from the typical year-to-year variation in regional monsoons that communities are already accustomed to.""

Seasons of change

Seven of the nine monsoon regions showed a gradual delay in monsoon onset with a continuous increase in global emissions, which could create wide-ranging consequences that directly affect approximately two-thirds of the world's population by the end of this century. Unlike the areas that receive relatively even amounts of precipitation in all seasons, heavily populated monsoon regions receive 60% to 70% of their precipitation during the summer monsoon season.

""The RCP8.5 simulations reveal robust delays in the start of rainy seasons that ripple through many aspects of everyday life in these regions,"" Ashfaq said. ""For example, a monsoon that usually starts in the first week of June in South Asia and West Africa may be delayed as long as 15 (days) to 20 days or even an entire month over parts of these regions by the end of the 21st century.""

Although the simulations also showed a delay in the end of the rainy season, otherwise known as monsoon demise, this shift was not nearly as dramatic as the delay in monsoon onset, shortening the length of the entire monsoon season. The researchers also discovered that affected monsoon regions are likely to see more precipitation during that period, leading to more intense rains. Conversely, the rest of the year would see longer dry periods.

This increased seasonality could exacerbate the prevalence of floods, droughts, wildfires and other extreme climate events that already pose challenges to these regions. Significant changes in monsoon behavior could contribute to outbreaks of vector-borne diseases, such as cholera, dengue and malaria.

Since agricultural activities in monsoon regions are typically timed to coincide with the periodic onset and demise of the rainy season, these factors could alter the production of rain-dependent crop yields.

""More than half of the world's arabica coffee supply is produced in Brazil, and more than 70% of the cacao used to make chocolate comes from West Africa, whereas more than one-third of rice exports come from India and Pakistan,"" Ashfaq said. ""If regional agriculture is subjected to monsoon onset delays and shorter rainy seasons, production of these types of commodities will be reduced and have a significant impact on the global economy.""

Many countries located in these regions rely on hydropower to generate electricity, including Brazil, which produces 75% of its energy via this method. Shorter monsoon seasons would not provide enough rainfall at the correct time to supply adequate power without overhauling current operations.

A delicate balance

In addition to identifying potential monsoon changes and their implications, the team also investigated the root causes responsible for these shifts.

In the absence of organized weather systems and a sustained moisture supply, the relatively dry pre-monsoon season receives only intermittent and convective rainfall, which is thermally driven. Lands in these regions get warmer every year during the pre-monsoon period, commonly reaching surface temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The combination of convective precipitation warming the upper atmosphere and hot surface conditions warming the lower atmosphere causes disparities between warm air over the land and ocean that force the dry season to give way to monsoon rains.

However, the simulations revealed that a continuous increase in global emissions will make the pre-monsoon environment less conducive for convective precipitation, which will delay the warming of upper atmosphere and the transition from the dry to the rainy season. One key factor the researchers determined will decrease convective rainfall during the pre-monsoon period is the formation of a deeper and less saturated boundary layer -- a part of the lower atmosphere where moisture and energy are exchanged between the land and the atmosphere.

""The upward force needed to lift air parcels to their level of free convection increases with the depth of the boundary layer,"" Ashfaq said. ""And the warmer the atmosphere, the more moisture needed for convective instability, which is essential for the development of thunderstorms. Fulfilling the requirement during the pre-monsoon period is challenging because of the limited moisture supply as winds blow away from the land.""

The team will contribute their CORDEX simulations to the regional climate change chapter of the next IPCC assessment.

The frontman's representative speaks on the player's inability to join a new club so far in the transfer window

Abdul Majeed Waris' representative Yussif Alhassan Chibsah has explained the reason behind the striker's inability to decide his future ahead of the coming season.

Out of Porto's plans for 2019-20 campaign, the 27-year-old is in the search for a new club, having spent the second half of last term on loan at French Ligue 1 fold FC Nantes.

A move away has, however, failed to materialise so far despite reported interest in his services from Nantes and St. Etienne

""Majeed is training with team B,"" Chibsah told as reported by Ghanasoccernet.

""He has a contract until 2022, so another three years.

""We are trying to figure out what the club wants to do with him.

""FC Porto only releases him for €6 million.

""I am trying to unblock the situation, it is not easy.

""He had a good time in France but that amount is driving many people away.""

Last season, Waris made 33 league appearances for Nantes, starting 25 of the matches and scoring five times.

He also netted twice in two matches in the French League Cup.

The Tamale-born player previously played for Swedish side Hacken, Russian club Spartak Moscow, Trabzonspor in Turkey and French outfits Valenciennes and Lorient.

He was undoubtedly the biggest casualty when Ghana announced their final squad for the recent Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, having made the preliminary list.

638,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Volcanic Woes May Have Contributed to Ancient Egypt's Fall - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/volcanic-woes-may-have-contributed-to-ancient-egypts-fall,"Ice cores and ancient river records suggest that volcanic eruptions may have reduced the flow of the Nile River. Failures of the Nile floods that usually irrigated Egypt’s farms could have fed social unrest.

Imagine it’s 245 BCE. You’re Ptolemy III, a Macedonian king ruling Egypt, and you’re leading an army against your biggest rival, the Seleucid Empire. But there’s a revolt back home, and you must return to the people that your dynasty would rule from 305 BCE to 30 CE.

Sometime in the 3rd century CE, the Roman historian Justin would write that if you had “not been recalled to Egypt by disturbances at home, [you] would have made [yourself] master of all Seleucus’s dominions.” Other writings declare that you did what you had to do to relieve a famine in Egypt. The summer was unusually dry that year, wrote a priest, and the Nile didn’t flood like it usually did. You imported grain from rainier territories—gaining you a priestly commendation in 238 BCE about the sacrifices you made for the “salvation for the population.”

A team of 21st century CE scientists and historians is offering a new look at something that might have indirectly caused the upheaval that changed Ptolemy III’s fortunes. Fast-forward to the present day: A team of 21st century CE scientists and historians is offering a new look at something that might have indirectly caused the upheaval that changed Ptolemy III’s fortunes as well other unrest that beset the Ptolemaic empire—large volcanic eruptions.

In a new paper in Nature Communications, the researchers present a raft of evidence—from climate modeling and ice core and Nile River hydrological records to ancient Egyptian chronicles—indicating that a series of eruptions may have caused sharp drop-offs in the summer rainfall usually brought by the African monsoon.

The loss of monsoon precipitation would have depleted the headwaters of the Nile River and deprived Egyptian civilization of the annual Nile flooding that it depended on to sustain its agriculture. As food became scarce, insurrections may have followed, including one known as the Theban revolt, which rose against the ruling Macedonian Ptolemies starting in 207 BCE.

“The Ptolemies lost control over huge areas of Egypt for almost 2 decades” during the Theban revolt, said Francis Ludlow, a coauthor of the study and a climate historian at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. It “was a very destructive revolt, with damage to temples and huge losses of tax revenues for the state.”

Volcanoes and the Nile

Researchers know well the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions. Major eruptions spew sulfur dioxide, among other substances, into the atmosphere, which reacts to form aerosol particles. These particles reflect sunlight back into space, cooling the atmosphere.

Texts from 1788 describe a low-flowing Nile in the summers of 1783 and 1784, which caused a food shortage that killed many people. Generally, this cooling decreases evaporation, and less evaporation means less water in the atmosphere for rain. The summer floods along the 6,800-kilometer-long Nile got their water mainly from rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands, and that rainfall comes from the African monsoon, which is driven by summer heating of the atmosphere. A cooler atmosphere supplies less water for the monsoon and thus less water for the Nile.

This effect has been documented. Texts from 1788, for example, describe a low-flowing Nile in the summers of 1783 and 1784—during and after Iceland’s Laki eruption—which caused a food shortage that killed many people. Recently, other scientists have used models to show how the Laki eruption and its 80 megatons of sulfur aerosols could have indirectly wiped out those monsoons so integral to the Egyptian population’s well-being.

Some possible factors didn’t make it into this research, however, according to Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He told the New York Times that the study didn’t account for weather influences on the Nile like El Niño.

Islamic Nilometer

To investigate a possible connection between volcanic eruptions and a Nile flood failure, the researchers on the new paper turned to one of the longest hydrological records on Earth: the Islamic Nilometer, an ancient structure built in 622 CE that people used to track water levels on the Nile. The researchers studied eruptions that occurred from 622 CE to 1902 CE and compared the dates of those eruptions—like Laki in 1783 and Tambora in 1815—with dates of Nile failures recorded by operators of the Nilometer. In summers during eruption years, the researchers found, floodwaters averaged 22 centimeters lower than in noneruption years.

Although these eruptions occurred long after the end of the Egyptian empire, the researchers assume that they would have affected the African monsoon similarly. “It would be surprising if the climate system operated completely differently in the Ptolemaic era,” Ludlow said.

The researchers then looked back in time with ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica to find evidence, like the presence of sulfur, that would point to volcanic eruptions. They then counted the layers in the ice cores like tree rings to date those eruptions and compared those dates with dates of major societal challenges like famine, disease, and land abandonment.

It turns out there was a major eruption in 209 BCE, just 2 years before the Theban revolt began. Other major eruptions occurred in 247 and 244 BCE, just as Ptolemy III clashed with Seleucus II in the east. “[We observed] in historical records a dynamic societal response” to the climate changes, said Joseph Manning, a historian at Yale and lead author of the new paper.

The mix of different records “is an important part of putting together the effects of the eruptions,” Heli Huhtamaa, a climate historian at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, told Science. She said that she found the team’s analysis very convincing.

Climate and Society

“Environmental pressures don’t act in a vacuum.” The researchers stress that their claim is not that volcanic eruptions caused social unrest or that regional climate change alone brought down an empire.

“Environmental pressures don’t act in a vacuum,” Ludlow said. More likely, “pressures from poor flooding coalesced at certain points of time with political and economic factors” like tensions between warring regions and high state-levied taxes. Food shortages resulting from lack of Nile flooding could have added the heat needed to boil an already simmering pot of unrest.

The current standard for the spacing of a topographic grid for regional mapping and modelling is 30 metres, as the the Canadian Water Network noted in a recent study, Improving Flood Risk Evaluation through Cross-Sector Sharing of Richer Data. The study found this standard is too coarse to represent fully the results of pluvial flooding, which results from intense rainfall events.

In Canada, digital terrain models for flood mapping have a resolution of 30 by 30 meters. The Insurance Bureau of Canada would like to improve that to five by five meters or better, IBC federal affairs vice president Craig Stewart told Canadian Underwriter earlier.

IBC was a partner for the Canadian Water Network in the pilot test, which was done in Edmonton, Regina, Halifax, Windsor and the Town of Tecumseh, Ont., which borders Windsor to the east. Founded as a result of the Walkerton, Ont. water contamination tragedy, the Canadian Water Network has a board comprised of members from academia, municipalities, utilities and conservation authorities.

There may be an advantage to having flood maps with a two-metre resolution in certain areas such as dense urban centres, the Water Network suggests in its Oct. 11 report.

During the pluvial flood modelling pilot, participating municipalities tested flood modelling with two-metre resolution. This provided much greater detail (compared to 30-metre resolution) and improved the predictability of the results. But it also had a significant impact on the time it took for the computers to run the models, the network said in the report.

“A dense dataset is likely too costly and impractical to produce national-scale pluvial flood maps. A 5-metre grid spacing reduces processing time, with minimal reduction in output quality as compared to finer grid spacing. However, it may be advantageous to use 2-metre grid spacing in certain key areas, such as dense urban centres.”

Having higher resolution makes it easier to model the impact of things like storm sewers, dikes and dry ponds.

The full report, published this past June, was not made public because it has proprietary information from the modelling firms, as well as private data from the participating municipalities, a spokesperson for the Canadian Water Network told Canadian Underwriter.

In recent years, the highway has only been opened during holidays, to enable travelers to enjoy the view and have easier access to the fascinating Mount Karkom site.

Driving along Route 10, you can reach stunning sites such as the Kadesh Barnea observation point, 670 meters above sea level, where you can gaze at northern Sinai, and the Har Hursha lookout that offers a wonderful view north toward Kadesh Barnea, and northeast toward Ramat Barnea and Mount Hamran. The view to the west is even more enticing, as you look over the border into Sinai.

With binoculars you can clearly make out the area of Ein al-Qudeirat, which some believe is the site of the biblical Kadesh Barnea – a large oasis where the Israelites dwelled for a long time during their wanderings in the desert following the exodus from Egypt. Another marvelous lookout – which faces west toward Sinai and the winding border fence – is 11 kilometers south of the Har Hursha lookout, slightly south of Border Marker 47, several hundred meters south of the memorial to Capt. Orion Salomon and Tal Tzuri, who died in a flight training accident in 1980.

Another interesting stop along the route is the Sabha cistern, about 1 kilometer down a dirt road east of the highway. The ancient water cistern, apparently from the Nabatean period 2,000 years ago, leads to an underground pool. It is filled with water year-round and on hot days, you can take a dip. Typically for the Nabateans, the cistern is well-hidden. It’s not easy to find if you don’t know of its existence. It’s currently covered with a sheet of tin that can be easily removed.

Mount Harif junction is 55 kilometers south of Nitzana Junction. The mountain rises to an elevation of 1,000 meters, though the highway is 200 meters below. From here you can continue south toward Mount Karkom and Eilat or turn east onto Route 171 and drive 40 kilometers north to Mitzpeh Ramon.

Off-road adventure

The opening of Route 10 gives those with 4X4 off-road vehicles a relatively comfortable way to reach Mount Karkom, one of the most intriguing sites in Israel. The rest of the year, the only way to reach Mount Karkom is from the northeast, via a very long off-road drive from the direction of Mitzpeh Ramon. During Hanukkah, one can drive down Route 10 then turn east and drive off-road for just 10 kilometers to reach Mount Karkom.

Travel on Route 10 will be permitted from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M., and strict safety rules will be enforced: driving on marked routes only, in accordance with road conditions and not along the border fence. There are military posts spread out along the route for security and guidance. ID must be presented in order to enter the route. Photographing the border fence is prohibited. There are no gas stations along the route, so fill the tank ahead of time. Overnight camping is permitted only in approved campgrounds. Vehicles may not be left unsupervised. Littering is prohibited, to protect the wildlife. The area near the route is a military zone with training grounds. Touching unexploded ordnance or ammunition is strictly forbidden: If you come across any, you must report it to the Israel Defense Forces. In many areas along the route, there is no cellular reception.

682,FL-2018-000134-IND,Heartwarming! Kerala Closes Dam Gates to Save Elephant Trapped By Flood Waters! - The Better India,https://www.thebetterindia.com/155953/kerala-closes-dam-gates-saves-elephant-trapped-floods-news/,"The scenic Athirappilly Falls in Thrissur is a favoured location for filmmakers, and movies like Raavan and Baahubali have been shot here.

However, as Kerala continues to reel under the devastating floods, a very different kind of scene would have played out, had it not been for the locals, forest officials and wildlife lovers.

On Monday, locals discovered a stranded wild elephant who had presumably been swept away from a different location. The pachyderm had somehow managed to climb on a rocky terrain but was unable to move out as it was engulfed by gushing water from all sides.

They alerted the authorities and thus began a 4-hour effort to save the elephant.

Speaking to Hindustan Times, a senior forest official said, “The elephant was tired, and it seems it was stranded there for more than 24 hours. We found gushing water should be controlled to save it. We immediately approached the officials of Peringalkooth dam, and they agreed to shut three sluice gates for two hours.”

The officer elaborated that once the water receded, crackers were burst to lead the tusker into the forest.

184,FL-2021-000025-AUS,"IAG highlights agg erosion, as Australia flood claims pass A$385m - Artemis.bm",https://www.artemis.bm/news/iag-highlights-agg-erosion-as-australia-flood-claims-pass-a385m/,"The severe flooding and storms affecting parts of Australia have already been counted to have driven insurance claims amounting to A$385 million and this number will rise significantly.



The Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) said this morning that it has counted 25,681 insurance claims to-date with an estimated loss of A$385m, due to the floods and severe weather catastrophe across parts of New South Wales and Queensland.

Flood waters are now beginning to subside and rainfall levels have dropped, but claims are expected to continue to be filed over the coming days and weeks.

Insurer IAG has reported that it has received roughly 8,000 claims, as of yesterday afternoon (March 25th), but expects the number to rise.

The claims are largely related to property damage, the insurer said, and based on its exposure and the claims received to-date IAG estimates the net cost of the floods and weather at approximately A$135 million.

That’s after IAG has shared a portion of the losses with its quota share reinsurance partners and the bill is estimated at A$200 million pre-quota share, the carrier said.

IAG said that its net costs from the flood event will be capped at A$169 million, which is its maximum retention per-event, for a first event, under its 2021 catastrophe reinsurance program.

IAG also explained that its net catastrophe claim costs for the eight months to 28 February 2021 were around A$375 million.

After this March flood event and based on an expectation of seasonally lower perils costs in Q2 of the calendar year, IAG estimates FY21 net natural perils claim costs of approximately $660 million to $700 million, which would take it just above its allowance of $658 million for this period.

This is based on an assumption of an estimated $150 million to $190 million of losses from additional catastrophe events in the months of March to June 2021.

IAG noted that it has its FY21 stop-loss reinsurance protection for retained natural perils claims, covering it for $100 million in excess of $1.1 billion ($68 million in excess of $743 million, post-quota share).

Finally, IAG also highlighted its aggregate reinsurance cover, saying that this provides provides $350 million of reinsurance in excess of $400 million (pre-quota share).

Individual events are capped at $200 million, in excess of $50 million from 1 January 2021 and as a result, IAG expects that the heavy rain and flooding event will erode around $150 million of the $400 million deductible on this aggregate reinsurance tower.

Insurer Suncorp also highlighted its claims this morning, saying that it has so far received over 5,400 claims across New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, of which 80% are in New South Wales and more than 85% of total claims are related to property damage.

The insurer said that claims will continue to rise over the coming days. While Suncorp did not detail any potential reinsurance impact, its quota shares will respond and its low retentions may mean some reinsurance claims are also warranted, once the full bill is known.

Finally, insurance and reinsurance broker Aon said that, “The number of claims and resultant losses will further increase; perhaps significantly and approaching AUD1 billion (USD760 million) in New South Wales alone.”

With the flooding affecting Queensland and Victoria as well and claims coming in from these regions, it does seem likely the ultimate industry loss from this event will surpass A$1 billion.

Aon noted, “The overall economic loss, including damage to infrastructure and agribusiness, will be much higher than the eventual insurance industry impact. It is expected that the economic loss will well exceed USD1 billion. Flood events typically result in a higher protection gap given challenges around underinsurance and lack of proper take-up.”

NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's quest to realize climate resilient growth is facing headwinds as widespread flooding experienced in the March-May season of long rains is damaging livelihoods and vital ecosystems in the country.

A number of civilians have lost their lives and property of unknown value destroyed in the recent past as storm water swept across Kenyan lowlands and densely-populated urban slums following a heavy downpour.

Local media reported Friday that four people were killed in Nairobi's Kibera slum Thursday night after they were swept away by raging waters as they attempted to cross a swollen river in the country's biggest slum.

The heavy rains that pounded the capital Thursday night caused flooding in other informal settlements, marooning local residents and worsening the risk of disease outbreaks.

Kenya Metrological Department said Friday that the heavy rains are expected to subside this weekend, but due to already saturated soils, it is likely to trigger landslides in hilly parts of the country.

The weathermen said that light showers could become a regular phenomenon in many parts of the country until the end of May, hence signaling improved agricultural productivity.

Massive flooding that accompanied torrential rains in western Kenyan lowlands and the coast region in the past week has displaced hundreds of families, destroying farms, roads and critical amenities such as schools.

Cyrus Oguna, spokesman for the Government of Kenya, said at a briefing early this week that the state was working on a long-term plan to help communities cope with recurrent floods.

""In the interim, we will be providing humanitarian assistance to flood victims in different parts of the country. These assistance include food, life-saving medicine and shelter,"" said Oguna.

He said the government had prioritized early warning, renovation of urban drainage infrastructure and tree planting to cushion local communities from negative impacts of flooding.

Kenya has been experiencing widespread flooding in the past several years during rainy seasons worsened by human encroachment on natural buffers like forests, wetlands and mangrove swamps.

The recurrent floods, that are also linked to climate change and unplanned settlements in urban areas, have jeopardized the country's ability to realize low-carbon development.

Keriako Tobiko, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said that Kenya's ability to tame climatic shocks including severe droughts and floods, is key to boosting green and inclusive growth.

""We aspire to attain green growth through strengthening the capacity of communities to withstand negative impacts of climate change,"" Tobiko said at a virtual Kenya-European Union green diplomacy conference held Tuesday.

He said the government will increase funding, promote uptake of clean technologies and regeneration of ecosystems to boost resilience of communities amid climatic stresses.

Tobiko said that some climate change adaptation projects under implementation including construction of large dams, restoration of degraded landscapes and household-based water harvesting initiatives, are aimed at containing floods.

He said that Kenya is leveraging on domestic resource mobilization, partnership and technology adoption to realize climate resilient and sustainable growth as part of the pandemic recovery.

Chris Kiptoo, the principal secretary in the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said the government is focusing on community-led interventions to minimize the impact of flooding, drought and habitat loss on livelihoods.

""Ultimately, local-led actions will strengthen resilience of our communities and the natural habitats whenever they experience climate change-related impacts like acute drought and flooding,"" said Kiptoo, adding that climatic stresses will be inevitable in the future hence the need to boost coping mechanism for local communities as part of Kenya's green aspirations.

478,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: 77962 NSS Personnel Deployed ... to Various Sectors - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907160438.html,"About 77,962 National Service Personnel have been deployed across the country in all sectors for the 2019/2020 service year.

Out of the number, 66,348, representing 85.1 per cent of the total postings have been deployed to the public sector while the private sector received 11,614 personnel representing 14.9 per cent of the total figure.

Consequently, a total of 6,000 were deployed to support the Agricultural sector including the Planting for Food and Job (PFJ) Policy.

At a press briefing to announce the postings in Accra yesterday, the Executive Director of the National Service Scheme (NSS), Mr Mustapha Ussif said 2,000 personnel were also posted to support NSS's newly introduced poultry entrepreneurship programme which focused on all the value chain in poultry production.

Postings registrations, he said, would commence at all regional centres across the country from Monday, July 22 to Friday, August 20.

He mentioned that the period was provided to ensure service personnel had sufficient time to go through the registration processes before formally beginning their service on September 2.

According to Mr Ussif, all service personnel were required to provide their student's identification cards (ID) and any valid national ID card to avoid impersonation or ""attempts by unscrupulous persons to compromise the process"".

The Executive Director, however, noted that the personnel were required to book an appointment on the scheme's website before reporting to the premises of the designated registration centres to register, adding that personnel who showed up at the registration centres without appointment letters would be turned away.

He revealed that the trend in the regional distribution with regard to requests, choice of regions and deployments had not seen much change as compared to previous years.

""The Greater Accra, Northern and Ashanti regions received very high posting requests while the two upper regions, Upper East and Upper West recorded low requests but we are working to shore up the numbers in these two regions with late registrations and postings in due course,"" he added.

Mr Ussif advised the service personnel to stay away from people who might approach them to offer assistance to change their postings, saying such persons should be reported to any officer of the scheme or the law enforcement agencies for the necessary action to be taken against them.

Started in 1973, the National Service programme is a compulsory one-year service required of all citizens of Ghana who are 18 years and above, at the time of deployment to, among other objectives, encourage the spirit of national service among all segments of Ghanaian society.

774,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Flood death toll hits 20 as Japan warned of more rainfall - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/flood-death-toll-hits-20-as-japan-warned-of-more-rainfall/,"TOKYO (Reuters) – The death toll from floods and landslides unleashed by torrential rains on Japan’s southern island of Kyushu rose to 20 on Sunday, with 14 people missing, NHK public TV said.

More heavy rain is forecast after Saturday’s deadly deluge in the Kumamoto prefecture, Japan’s worst natural disaster since Typhoon Hagibis in October last year left about 90 people dead.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a meeting of Japan’s disaster response task force to step up the search and rescue operations.

“Nothing is more important than human lives. Please make utmost effort through the night to search for missing people,” Abe said after Japanese television broadcast images of overturned cars, people shovelling mud from their homes and the military rescuing stranded residents in boats.

“We had no electricity and no running water,” one rescued woman told the broadcaster. “It was tough.”

TV footage also showed a gymnasium-turned-evacuation center equipped with face masks, disinfectants and thermometers to prevent coronavirus infections.

The Japan Meteorological Agency urged people to stay vigilant, as more rains are predicted.

“From this evening on, extremely heavy rains with thunder are expected in southern as well as northern Kyushu,” an agency official told Reuters.

“The rainfall so far has already loosened the ground. There is a high chance of landslides occurring, even without much additional rain.”

An El Nino-induced drought has wilted crops across Zimbabwe and left about a third of its 15 million people in need of food assistance, according to a U.N. agency.

The situation was worsened when Zimbabwe, along with Mozambique and Malawi, were last month battered by Cyclone Idai, leaving hundreds of thousands needing food, water and shelter.

An appeal document given to reporters by the ministry of information showed the government is seeking about $300 million in aid for food while the rest would fund emergency shelters, logistics and telecommunications among other needs.

Hundreds of people have died in Mozambique and Malawi and the death toll in Zimbabwe was now 344.

Meanwhile, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the cabinet had hiked the maize price paid to farmers by 86 percent to $232 a tonne and maintained a subsidy for millers in a bid to keep the price of the staple maize meal down.

In February, Zimbabwe scrapped a 1:1 peg between the U.S. dollar and the bond notes and electronic dollars it introduced to compensate for its hard currency shortage, merging the surrogate currencies into the RTGS dollar.

Mutsvangwa said farmers would be paid 726 RTGS dollars ($232), up from 390 RTGS dollars.

The RTGS dollar was trading at 3.12 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday on the bank market and at 4.4 on the black market.

Two of its biggest plants, the 180-megawatt Nalubaale and 200-megawatt Kiira plants outside Jinga, are being battered by rising flood waters and floating papyrus.

On April 14, a floating mass of papyrus mats (used across Lake Victoria and now cast afloat like islands) crunched into the dam wall. Bits of papyrus were sucked into the turbines. The country was plunged into a blackout as around 20% of the grid’s capacity suddenly went offline.

The story of that moment started six months earlier, in October, when it started raining in Uganda. It hasn’t stopped since. Lake Victoria’s levels have risen by 1.3m and are just 8cm away from their highest-ever level. Similar downpours filled the lake in the early 1960s and mid 1990s.

With 23 rivers feeding the lake and only one exit, past Jinga and into the Nile, Lake Victoria is perfect for hydropower. To help alleviate the pressure, the amount of water being released at Jinja has more than doubled.

But this isn’t just an issue of too much rain. Human expansion has played a large role.

In a press release detailing the government response, Uganda’s water and environment minister, Sam Cheptoris, said a loss of forest cover as well as encroachment on wetlands and river banks meant that there was more silt in the lake and fewer natural barriers to fast-flowing flood waters. Towns and roads also mean more cement and tar, so rainwater doesn’t soak into the ground and instead goes straight into rivers.

The higher water levels have meant jetties and landing sites being submerged, leading to a halt in ferries. The floating mats have also become a hazard to other shipping; so vital to local economies. Resorts, hotels and homes have been flooded. The flooding is also affecting Lake Kyoga, with flooding at a much lower level in Lake Albert.

Cheptoris noted that drinking water and sanitation systems have also been affected by the deluge, with a likely increase in water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, malaria and bilharzia.

In response to the crisis, Cheptoris said the government will “remove” anyone encroaching on water bodies and forests. Chiefs who have not taken “action against encroachers” will also be dismissed.

Practically, this affects people within 100m of river banks, 30m of wetlands and 200m of lake shores and forest reserves.",2020-05-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['lake', 'started', 'cuts', 'power', 'floating', 'wetlands', 'river', 'response', 'uganda', 'water', 'flooding', 'victoria', 'waters']",Uganda,news article,English

Phan Duong

She was worried the 80-kilogram beast might be swept away or escape.

The resident of a village in Quang Dien District explains: ""Pigs can be really destructive if they escape. I did not dare sleep at night.""

Central Vietnam has been hit hard by tropical storms, torrential downpours, floods, and landslides for three weeks now.

The woman, who is in her 50s, took the sow and its litter of four to her brothers house since it is on higher ground than hers, and never left them alone for a moment.

With a stick in one hand, she made sure the sow behaved. But the animal was spooked and attacked her more than once. Vung has a wound on her right thigh from a bite.

But importantly she has been able to safeguard the familys most valuable asset.

She had spent a year raising the pig and saw it give birth to four piglets. If she manages to keep all of them safe, and the animal continues to have more litters, she can solve the problem she has been facing: that of paying her daughters tuition.

Her daughter is a freshman at a college in Da Nang City, and Vung has to send her VND1.5 million ($65) every month for living expenses besides paying VND6 million a year tuition for the two-year course.

Since her daughter was in 10th grade Vung had been telling her, ""I think you should drop out of school and work; I am not able to afford your schooling.""

But the girl would plead: ""Please let me stay in school so that I can have a proper career in future and build us a better life.""

Vung relented.

Their family consists of just the two of them. Vung does the best she can, growing rice on a 750-square-meter farm and doing agricultural labor and menial jobs for others.

Every year in October she travels to the Central Highlands to harvest coffee and cassava for farmers there. But this year she has been stuck in floods described as the worst in decades.

Earlier this year, along with many other localities across Vietnam, Thua Thien-Hue was also hit by the African swine fever, an incurable and fatal disease in pigs.

Vung worked for other farmers, burying pigs killed by the disease.

""God blessed me and kept my sow healthy.""

Now she has once again kept the sow safe through the floods.

But she has not been able to save a small flock of chickens and a cassava crop that had almost been ready for harvest.

All hopes for the mother and daughters future now rest on that one sow.

People in Dong Hoi Town of central Quang Binh Province move a pig to safety as flood waters are about to rise, October 21, 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Huu Khoa.

When meeting us in the courtyard of a government office to receive a donation of essential items from readers of VnExpress through FPTs Hope Foundation, Vung cannot hold back her tears, and tells us all about her pigs and chickens.

The floodwaters have now started receding in several parts of the central region, including her Quang Dien District, and people are trying to pick up the pieces again after two weeks of living with the floods.

Vung is still at her brothers house with her pigs since it is still not safe to return home.

Her 20-year-old single-storied house has deteriorated and its walls are cracked, and now after the floods Vung is afraid they could collapse at any time.

""More storms are coming, so Id better stay here.""

Storm Molave is expected to reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning.

In Phong Dien, another district in Thua Thien Hue, we met Le Thi Sinh, 51.

Three years ago her son passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children. Her daughter-in-law works elsewhere and sends home money for Sinh and her husband to raise the two kids, one of whom is learning to talk while the other is in kindergarten. Sinhs husband has a number of health problems and so she is the familys breadwinner.

No one had foreseen such severe flooding. Like many other locals, Sinh and her husband did not have enough time to prepare for the disaster.

When the waters came, they packed off the children, belongings and grain to the first floor. They hung their six piglets, each weighing around 15 kg, from the ceiling, but one was swept away and another was killed.

The floods also swept away their flock of 200 chickens and destroyed their cassava and sweet potato crops.

Her grandchildren cried and asked for their mother. Then they asked for their father after seeing a man next door casting a net to catch fish. There was nothing Sinh could do except shed tears of grief.

Sinh still has a litany of problems to worry about like a loan she took to buy supplements for the pigs and chickens and buying formula and other essential items for the children.

She hopes to get relief from the authorities and plant a new crops and resume her livestock and poultry farming.

In the districts Phong Xuan Commune, locals grow trees and paddy. In May Storm Noul destroyed grown paperbark and acacia trees, and now the floods have destroyed all the young ones.

In Phong Hien Commune 2,000 families have been living in the floodwaters. They have lost 250 hectares (620 acres) of cassava, 27 hectares of glittering chive, 25 hectares of sugarcane, and 15 hectares of other crops.

""There is nothing left,"" Nguyen Si Hiep, chairman of the commune Fatherland Front Committee, said. The front, an overarching public organization, is tasked with ""promoting national solidarity and unity of mind in political and spiritual matters,"" and conducting many of the government's social programs, especially those to mitigate poverty.

Hiep said the commune administration is advising farmers to switch to short-term crops after the floods recede so that they could earn some income before the new year arrives.

There is way too much attention on flood relief though it is just one part of the big picture when a natural disaster strikes. Reconstructing the livelihoods and rebuilding the lives of millions of people in the central region is now a serious challenge in what has already been a disastrous year.

A World Bank report released last week estimated that 12 million people living in coastal provinces face the threat of severe flooding and over 35 percent of people live on eroding coastlines.

Each year an average of $852 million and 316,000 jobs in key economic sectors are at risk from riverine and coastal flooding.

In this context, I reviewed the concept of social capital. Economists treat social capital as an important resource of the nation. It is understood as the two-way and multidimensional cooperation between members of the society, the power of connection between people in a community, a country, and transactions based on mutual trust that bring mutual benefit.

The fact that Vietnamese everywhere are pitching in to provide succor to people in the central region these days is an expression of social capital in Vietnam.

The World Bank believes that social capital helps the community coordinate voluntarily and effectively because it is based on a common goal to help solve collective problems. The natural disasters in the central region are a collective problem. To address this problem, the government can collaborate with the community and make use of the social capital that has been on display in recent days.

Dealing with the aftermath of the floods gives the government an opportunity to tweak its policies. Authorities should make appropriate decisions to remove unnecessary barriers, paving the way for an increase in tolerance and trust, which would help heal the wounds caused by natural disasters.

A timely and substantial reconstruction plan for people like Vung and Sinh will help soothe the gaping economic wounds suffered by the central region, sustain growth and lead to a sustainable development vision for the country.

967,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Uganda 'When It Rains … We Cry': River Submerges Livelihoods - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/rains-cry-overflowing-river-submerges-livelihoods/,"ELEGU, UGANDA — It didn’t rain the day 2-year-old Raymond Giga was found submerged in water next to the bed he shared with his mother.

But the River Unyama still poured in from the east and swallowed him, says Raymond’s mother, Sylvia Gimono, her eyes wet with tears. Raymond was two weeks shy of celebrating his third birthday when he tumbled off the bed into water pooling on the floor. His mother, in a nearby room, didn’t hear a sound.

An hour after his sister found him, Raymond was pronounced dead.

Gimono, who runs a small motel in this burgeoning community on the border of Uganda and South Sudan, blames the flood for taking her child’s life and decimating her business. She moved to the northern town of Elegu to make a living off increased trade as both countries, after years of internal conflict, settled into periods of peace. But she encountered a new kind of threat.

The November flood, which left thousands homeless and ruined numerous operations like Gimono’s, wasn’t the first. Destructive floods have overwhelmed the area multiple times in recent years as increasingly heavy rains meet with the side effects of a swelling population, including uprooted trees along the river’s banks and the destruction of wetlands through farming. While some officials point to the ramifications of growth, residents accuse the government of failing to implement a long-promised flood mitigation plan that may have spared businesses and saved the lives of children like Raymond.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Ugandans who live near the border with South Sudan chopped trees along the riverbank to make room for an increasing population. This has made it more difficult to prevent flooding.

Government officials “are not feeling the pitch of the suffering of the people,” says Michael Lakony, a chairperson of the district where Elegu is located, about 163 kilometers (101 miles) from the nearest big city, Gulu. “This is a known disaster and should be easy to deal with.”

The town sits in a low-lying area especially susceptible to floods. “When it rains in Gulu,” he says, “in Elegu we cry.”

Uganda is experiencing more frequent and fierce droughts and floods, according to a 2018 climate change profile by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rainfall is expected to increase, particularly here in the country’s north, escalating the risk of natural disasters.

Floods killed seven people last year, displaced more than 4,000 community members, and ruined billions of Ugandan shillings’ worth of goods, including cement and maize, Lakony says. Gulu received more than 90 centimeters (35 inches) of rainfall from September to November, about double the usual average, according to data from the national weather agency.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu sits in a low-lying area susceptible to flooding. Residents say the government hasn’t done enough to address the increased risk.

The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives could have solved the flooding problem in 2018, Lakony says, when it signed a memorandum of understanding with TradeMark East Africa, a Nairobi-based nonprofit focused on trade, to implement a flood mitigation plan worth 1.8 billion shillings (about $490,000). The plan called for constructing a drainage system to contain the floods and creating channels 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from Elegu to divert the water.

The area, by that point, had grown from a scattering of grass-thatched homes to a substantial community with a tarmacked road, the groan of breaking trucks and the constant buzz of moving commerce.

The growth started in 2008, soon after the end of Uganda’s two-decade civil war, which displaced nearly 2 million residents and, according to some estimates, killed more than 100,000 people. Three years later, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan and officially became a country. And the village of Elegu became a town.

Elegu’s population has grown about 30 times since 2012, when it had 4,000 residents, Lakony says. But nothing has come of the flood plan.

Government officials disagree. Amelia Kyambadde, the minister for Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, says an initial evaluation showed the area was too swampy to implement the mitigation plan. Government engineers are aware of the situation, she says, and are working with TradeMark East Africa on an alternative solution. She declined to discuss the timeframe.

TradeMark East Africa didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu’s main road lacks a drainage system that would help ward against devastating floods.

Wilfred Baguma, a local councilman, says water overflow has been an issue since the 1970s. But increased rain and farming near the snaking Unyama riverbank have worsened the problem.

Low-lying areas like Elegu tend to flood because residents have chopped down the trees near and along the river that could have contained overflow, says Joshua Zaake, executive director of Environmental Alert, a nongovernmental organization based in Kampala.

Many who have benefitted from growth are now the ones suffering. Sarah Nakizza, a household goods trader at Elegu market, has lost products to the floods. When the water flows through the market at night, she says, most of her stored goods get swept away.

Ugandans in the region initially made money exporting food, water, soap, eggs and construction materials to the newly independent South Sudan. But Elegu quickly grew into a way station for people who desired goods from either side — cooking oil, sugar and tinned milk are cheaper in South Sudan, for example — and for traders in need of accommodation.

Trucks lining the main road have Kenyan, Tanzanian and Ugandan license plates. Vendors sell sliced pineapples along a street crammed with lodges and a boisterous market.

Some now fear the repercussions of that development. Residents like Gimono demand a clearer strategy to deal with the lack of drainage channels and other mitigation techniques. If for nothing else, she says, than for her son.

Otherwise, “next time it will be another woman’s child killed by floods.”

With waters receding, the flood crisis in Assam is showing signs of improvement. But 38-year-old Dalimi Kalita wades through her waterlogged courtyard in Chandrapur, about 30 km away from Guwahati, with a worried look.

Dalimi is concerned about the stinking, stagnant flood water - a possible breeding ground for diseases like the dreaded Japanese Encephalitis.

Her 6-year-old daughter is already running a fever.

""The government needs to give some medicines to pre-empt an outbreak. My child already has cold, fever and I am really worried,"" Dalimi told NDTV.

The floods have been a double blow for Assam. Death and destruction caused by the now receding waters have been compounded by the loss of lives due to the outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis since April.

At least 62 people have died of the floods in Assam but the Japanese Encephalitis outbreak has claimed more than 100 lives since April and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome or AES has killed about 200.

Since 2013, floods and Japanese Encephalitis outbreaks have gone hand in hand, killing over 1,000 people.

""Many people are in relief camps and they become vulnerable to communicable diseases and when the flood water recedes there is a threat of another outbreak of vector borne disease like dengue,"" Dr BC Bhagobati, state surveillance officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme of Assam said.

In areas that are still cut off like Laharighat in Morigaon district, health workers are finding it difficult to reach flood victims.

The government has cancelled the leaves of all doctors, paramedics and other health staff till September largely to tackle the Japanese Encephalitis outbreak but villagers say there is a lot more that needs to be done.

33,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Responses to “Should Obama Quit His Job?” - The Globalist,https://www.theglobalist.com/should-obama-quit-his-job/,"Does this happen in other countries? The President of the United States gets to take a four-day family vacation — and the opposition party attacks?

It probably does happen in other countries. Even so, while watching the news, I decided that — if I were Barack Obama — I would resign.

Why would I do that? The simple reality is: “President of the United States” is a lousy job to have these days.

As President, you face an opposition party that is fueled by populism, but never even considers the consequences of all the often wholly contradictory initiatives it suggests.

This includes cries for stronger American intervention on behalf of potentially unreliable partners in Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, Libya and South Sudan. In all these crisis zones, the American right wants to position the United States squarely on one side or the other of centuries-old – sometimes millennia-old — ethnic and sectarian strife.

As President, one would have to wonder if anyone in the opposition had really thought these policies through in terms of their impact on the way they would stretch the country’s already stretched military, on the way they would undermine the country’s fiscal soundness and on how they would extract a potentially disastrous human toll at home and abroad?

Domestic and international expectations – at loggerheads

Balancing this, you, as President, must also face a world that expects the United States to play a central role in sustaining global stability, but at the same time expects America to adhere to certain limits on the use of its power.

The world does not want to be ruled by America. It wants America to lead it into a more optimistic future, where the Four Freedoms of Franklin Roosevelt provide the North Star, the guiding light toward the realization of pluralistic, multicultural dreams and ambitions.

These two views are diametrically opposed. They are polar opposites In the United States and around the world.

The President of the United States must nonetheless manage U.S. foreign policy through these two prisms.

As if that weren’t enough of a practical challenge, the list of global hot spots that a U.S. President is expected to “fix” is long. Currently, it includes

■ The most recent eruption of the Israel-Palestine conflict

■ The emergence of China as a global power

■ Iran’s nuclear ambitions

■ Regional territorial disputes over islands in the South China Sea

■ The handover of Afghanistan

■ Global weather anomalies that are raising environmental red flags

■ A potentially catastrophic drought drawing near in the Western US

■ An Ebola outbreak in West Central Africa — and

■ Desperate children under arrest at United States’ southern border.

Of course, the opposition party mercilessly finds a way to attack the President on each and every one of these issues, while always keeping their eyes on the important stuff, like Benghazi.

Some might suggest that dealing with all of these complex issues and being second-guessed every step of the way by an often irrational domestic opposition is asking too much of any President. But then, just when you were getting fed up with dealing with all of this, they say you can’t take a vacation!

Mr. President, I would just quit if I were you. But while you consider this, you have my permission to take a few days off.",2014-08-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['party', 'quit', 'job', 'opposition', 'does', 'united', 'obama', 'potentially', 'president', 'way', 'global', 'america', 'states']",China,news article,English
582,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Protecting Small Farms in Mozambique From Drought - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/protecting-small-farms-mozambique-drought,"Project Aims to Halt Cycle of Hunger and Poverty

By Alex Russell on April 22, 2019 in Food and Agriculture

During the months that Jonathan Malacarne spent traveling from village to village in rural Mozambique, the weather could be dry and dusty or soaking wet from heavy rain. Either way, people from the community would walk and ride bikes from miles away to meet under the shade of a tree or in a classroom to learn about insured maize seeds.

Malacarne, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Davis, is part of a team of agricultural economists testing whether these insured seeds can increase food security for farmers who regularly risk losing crops to extreme weather. In Mozambique, this includes flooding from a rare but catastrophic cyclone like Idai in 2019 but is more likely to be extreme drought that can strike in any year.

“Drought is definitely among the most frequently cited and most severe concerns that households have,” Malacarne said. “Heavy reliance on a rain-fed staple crop in a drought-prone region with limited access to financial services all translate into high levels of food insecurity pretty quickly.”

The lasting impacts of drought

Small-scale farmers in Mozambique may plant a handful of crops but maize, or corn, is their main staple. Most often maize is ground into meal and cooked into xima, a stiff porridge. For many farmers, maize is their only source of income.

Increasing how much maize farmers can grow, even despite drought, would go a long way toward making households more food secure. According to the World Bank, about 30 percent of the population in Mozambique is undernourished.

One of the challenges is that farmers in Mozambique mostly plant local seeds saved from last year’s crop. The seeds cost nothing but require regular rain until the cobs mature. Farmers who instead spend money on improved, drought-tolerant seeds will get much bigger harvests, especially if there is a moderate drought. But, if the rains never come at all, the farmer who paid for better seeds will lose more.

“If you spend all your money on seeds that are expensive to buy and then they fail anyway, there’s nothing left to get your family through to the next season,” Malacarne said. Malacarne first learned about these kinds of constraints as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nicaragua before he joined the Ph.D. program in agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis.

For small-scale farmers, a severe drought can lead to impacts that last well beyond a single season. Families might sell some of what they own, like livestock or tools, making it harder to start over the next season. Another option is to skip meals, which can compromise adults’ ability to work or stunt the growth and development of their children.

“These circumstances can quickly push families to a tipping point after which they will always be poor, with no chance to build back the assets they need to escape poverty,” said Michael Carter, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis and director of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Assets and Market Access.

Carter has been studying these dynamics for decades. He believes one way to disrupt them is for farmers to increase their assets. In Mozambique, where there is little opportunity to earn outside of agriculture, this means growing more maize. However, this requires risking cash that would sustain the family in a severe drought.

“Reducing this risk is one way of shifting the tipping point, which reduces the intervention needed to help households escape chronic poverty and possibly even develop some resilience to the next shock that comes along,” Carter said.

Adding insurance to seeds to increase overall drought protection

Since as early as 2014, Carter and Travis Lybbert, also a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis, have wanted to test whether bundling drought-tolerant seeds with insurance could overcome the limitations of the seeds alone.

“Seeds that enhance the resilience of farmers facing drought has been probably the most popular public and private crop investment in the past 20 years,” Lybbert said. “Adding insurance expands this resilience to include even the worst possible outcomes.”

In 2015, with support from USAID, Carter, Lybbert and Stephen Boucher, also a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis, launched a study to test how bundling seeds and insurance would actually work in Tanzania and Mozambique.

The UC Davis team partnered with CIMMYT, a nonprofit research center based in Mexico that has spent decades selectively breeding maize seeds that can withstand some drought. They also developed an index insurance that would replace the seeds in the event of a severe enough drought.

Index insurance is a type of insurance that avoids the cost of verifying losses by basing payouts on an easy-to-measure index of factors, such as weather or average yields. In Mozambique, seed replacements would trigger when satellite data showed a lack of rain early in the season or when full-season rainfall and vegetation growth estimated that crops had failed.

“In the extreme case, families can lose everything, even seed for next year,” Malacarne said. “Being able to start over with improved seed is a big deal, and they’re also learning about how insurance works.”

Taking a new kind of drought protection from village to village

In Mozambique, Malacarne would watch as members of the survey team gave their presentation on the drought-tolerant seeds and insurance either in Portuguese, the national language in Mozambique, or in one of the local languages like Shona or Ndao.

Toward the end of the presentations, when it came time to make sure everyone understood the index insurance that would guarantee the seeds, each attendee held two cards, one red, one green. Everyone in the village has a good harvest? Green card, no replacement. Had a bad harvest but most neighbors had a good one? Green card, no replacement. Almost everyone had a bad harvest? Red card, replacement.

No one in these parts of Mozambique, about six hours from the nearest major city, had any experience with insurance. But everyone understood drought. They also understood community. When the research team designed the contract zones, they were careful to keep communities together.

“In these areas the community is the unit of organization generally,” Malacarne said. “That everybody in the community would get the same payment made sense.”

In the time Malacarne spent in Mozambique, he and his team, along with seed company representatives and local agricultural extension workers, visited 69 communities. In addition to the presentations, the team gathered three rounds of hourlong, one-on-one surveys with about 1,500 farmers to measure the bundle’s impact.

For all the time Malacarne spent in Mozambique, he mostly knows the farmers there through the data collected in those surveys. It’s a different experience than he had in Nicaragua, where he worked with individual farmers over a long period of time and could see firsthand the challenges they face.

“We are trying to learn things that are going to guide policy in a way that impacts a lot of people but not necessarily these specific people,” Malacarne said.

Though the research team has just completed its final round of surveys, early analysis shows that the project worked exactly as it was designed. In 2017, when a severe drought struck in Tanzania, the insurance triggered the replacement of 1,220 packets of seed. In Mozambique, higher yields were driven by only moderate periods of drought but good seasons overall.

Across both countries, over 2,000 households bought drought-tolerant seeds and nearly 1,000 bought the seeds bundled with insurance. Farmers who bought the improved seeds, with or without insurance, had higher yields by about 380 kg per hectare. That’s about 50 percent more maize than farmers without the improved seeds could grow.

This success could lead to farmers continuing purchasing the improved seeds, and also insurance if the project’s partners in both countries continue to make it available. “In order to help people to solve the problems they face in a way that makes sense for them, you have to understand what those decisions look like through their eyes,” Malacarne said. “That’s what research does.”

Noramfaizul Mohd Nor was travelling with a convoy of humanitarian workers when a contingent of Ugandan-nationals with AMISOM opened fire, killing Nor and wounding another journalist, TV-3 reporter Aji Saregar Mazlan, Somalia's transitional government said in a Saturday statement.

""The police and the security forces immediately reached the location of the incident and started a full investigation for the shocking action,"" the government said.

Attempts to reach AU representative were not immediately successful Saturday.

On Friday, Nor was heading to the outskirts of Mogadishu to cover a Malay-sponsored project to help drought victims on behalf of Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.

In an interview with Bernama, Malaysia's Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said Nor was a ""hero.""

""He was willing to take the risk to provide extensive coverage of our missions to help others in many parts of the world,"" he said.

Reporters without Borders, an activist organization on behalf of journalist, said Friday that Somalia continued to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, often caught in the cross-fir between Islamic Al-Shabaab militia and pro-government forces.

""Nor joins the long list of journalists killed in the course of their work in Somalia, Africa's deadliest country for media personnel with 23 killed since 2007,"" Reporters Without Borders said Friday.

“No loss of wildlife has been reported so far. Animals are acquainted with such conditions and they do have natural protection to deal with such situations. But we can say that these situations put extra pressure on them,” said state’s principal conservator of forests PK Kesavan.

Saying many landslides happen in the periphery, not in deep forests, he also termed as “misleading” a video doing rounds on social media depicting the plight of a deer herd facing surging flood waters in Wayanad.

“Black bucks were shown in the video. But in Kerala we don’t have that species of deer. It is a misleading video intended to create a scare,” said Kesavan, adding personnel are keeping a strict vigil in forests.

Idukki, nestled in southern part of Western Ghat mountain ranges, hosts the Periyar Tiger Reserve - which has 35 tigers as per the last census, the Shola National Park, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, the Kurinjimala Sanctuary and Eravikulam National Park, which is home to near-extinct Nilgiri tahr (ibex) as well as rare bird species like Malabar grey hornbill, Nilgiri pipit and Nilgiri wood pigeon.

Kurinji lovers upset

Heavy rains have doused the spirits of ‘neela kurinji’ lovers and they fear large tracts of the plants could have been destroyed in the surging flood waters. Tourism officials who expected a windfall are also concerned.

The floods struck at a time when the neela kurinji (strobilanthes kunthiana) were set to bloom with clock-like precision after 12 years. When it bloomed last in 2006, the state tourism department claimed at least four lakh tourists swarmed the hill destination of Munnar, considered the best spot to watch the spectacle, and this time, it was expecting at least double that number.

“Wet conditions are a threat to kurinji because it needs good sun. Flash floods have affected plants in some areas. Still we expect widespread blooming by next month,” said G Rajkumar, an activist who has been working for the flower’s conservation for the past 40 years.

He attributed the present tragedy to human incursions and unnatural growth plans. “It is a lesson for all. Landslips and flash floods happened in areas that witnessed widespread human incursions. River should be allowed to run their natural course and it is time to rethink about management of dams,” he said.

For local people, kurinji is symbol of plenty and exuberance and for visitors, it is a visual feast. The flowers find abundant mention in both Tamil and Malayalam ballads and are also a favourite subject for modern writers. Tribal people often calculate their age with its blooming season.

Considering the ecological sensitivity of the area, the then VS Achuthanandan-led state government had declared a kurinji national park spread over an area of 32 sq km. His government also carried out a massive demolition drive against land encroachment in Munnar and surrounding areas but later this lost steam following stiff opposition from many, including his own party members.

Later governments scaled the area of the park, citing human settlements while land sharks exploited the situation to the hilt. The result is that the misty getaway of Munnar has turned into a concrete jungle and landslides are common at many places.",2018-08-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['wildlife', 'denies', 'floods', 'national', 'blooming', 'forest', 'munnar', 'video', 'nip', 'lovers', 'casualty', 'kerala', 'dept', 'neela', 'human', 'bud', 'kurinji', 'nilgiri', 'park']",India,news article,English

SUMMARY OF THE CRISIS & RESPONSE

On 25 April, Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in northern Mozambique, bringing a path of destruction and damage to the Cabo Delgado and Nampula districts. Tropical Cyclone Kenneth was the second cyclone to hit Mozambique in a span of just six weeks and the first to make landfall this far north in the country. Entire villages were flattened and thousands of people were displaced, in a country already dealing with the consequences of drought and Cyclone Idai.

More than 55,400 hectares of crops have been either partially or completely destroyed, and many fishing villages lost their boats and equipment during the storm. A cholera outbreak has been declared, with cases reported in Pemba, Metuge and Mecúfi.

To support the Government-led response to Cyclone Kenneth, humanitarian organizations are appealing for US$103.7 million to assist more than 373,800 people in need. UN agencies and partners are currently operating with depleted stocks and a seriously stretched to respond to both Cyclone Kenneth and Cyclone Idai, where urgent needs remain.

Additional funding is urgently required to enable the delivery of immediate life-saving assistance to people in desperate need.

Durduri, Somalia – A hundred years ago, it was a bustling port that served the vibrant fishing community living along Somalia’s coastline, the longest on mainland Africa.

Now, Durduri is a sun-bleached, wind-swept, white-sand graveyard of stone structures. There is no harbour, no jetty. The drying and smoking house is just a tumble of bricks.

This is one of many historical coastal trading towns that have risen and fallen with empires. When the busy trade routes moved away, fishing was one of the few lifelines left.

Talk to locals now and you will find this too has dried up – they say there are no more fish in the sea. They blame not the pirates who brought the attention of international law enforcement to Somalia’s waters, but the foreign fishing boats that have plundered sea-life stocks.

Inside Somalia’s Eyl, families pay for piracy crackdown

And if things don’t change, they say, a return to piracy will be their only way of survival.

‘They take everything’

Ahmed Mohamed Ali walks disconsolately along the beach at Durduri, 100 kilometres west of the port city of Bosaso, perched on the northeastern point of Puntland, Somalia’s semi-autonomous northern state.

Ali said he was forced to quit fishing, the only job he has ever known, after a foreign fishing ship bore down on him and his colleagues one night at sea.

“It was a huge ship. We fled for our lives. Had we not it would have all been over and we’d have been dead,” the 27-year-old told Al Jazeera.

Large foreign vessels “come at night and take everything”, he said, gesturing angrily out to sea. “With their modern machinery, there is nothing left.”

And the Somali fishermen can’t match them. “We don’t carry guns; we don’t even have any weapons,” he said.

Ali’s accusations are backed up by two new pieces of research, conducted by separate Somali development agencies, which suggest that international fishing vessels – particularly Iranian and Yemeni, but also European ships including Spanish – are illegally exploiting the East African nation’s fish stocks on a massive scale.

In a country torn apart by civil war, without a federal government until as recently as 2012 following more than two decades of fighting, the population of 10.5 million largely suffers from a crippling paucity of economic opportunities.

Somalis say illegal, unlicensed, and unregulated fishing forced them to turn to piracy 10 years ago in order to recoup their losses. “We got fed up and took guns to the sea,” said one Bosaso fisherman, Mohamed Adan Ahmed.

Piracy put a stop to illegal fishing, but these findings suggest it was merely a hiatus; now that international anti-piracy task forces have halted the hijackings, illegal fishing vessels have returned.

In 2014, 86 percent of Somali fishermen spotted foreign fishing vessels close to the shore, according to a report by international charity Adeso, which conducted interviews down the length of the coastline over a six-month period last year.

Sightings were more frequent in Puntland and have more than doubled in the last five years, according to the IUU Fishing in the Territorial Waters of Somalia report.

It first became a problem in the mid-1990s, according to Halimo Isman, who said at the time she was the only fisherwoman working in Durduri’s waters.

In the new village that has sprung up close to the old port, she told Al Jazeera huge foreign fishing vessels dwarfed the Somalis’ small, fibreglass skiffs. “It became impossible to share waters with them.”

Her family were originally pastoralists, but, like many Somalis, they lost their livestock in a drought, so came to the coast in search of a new livelihood. Isman married a fisherman in 1987 and he taught her how to fish, repair nets, and dry the catch of the day.

“Fish, including sharks, were available everywhere,” the 55-year-old recalls. But in 1996, she quit. The seas were out of fish, she said. Today, Isman keeps goats and sheep and grows vegetables and date palms on the brackish land.

Search for a better life

Foreign vessels take three times more fish than Somalis do – 132,000 metric tons each year compared to 40,000 by locals – another report released in September said.

From 12 months’ research, the agency Secure Fisheries found the amount of fish being harvested is unsustainable. Illegal vessels are harvesting tuna stocks at the maximum capacity, leaving nothing for Somalis, it said.

“Piracy can come back because people have nothing,” said elder Saed Jama Yusuf, speaking at the harbour in Bosaso, where his fellow fishermen bemoaned their feeble catches. “We will make preparations, gather our resources for funds.”

The federal government’s Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources was unavailable for comment, but Minister Mohamed Omar Aymow has previously denied there is a risk of piracy returning.

“There is not a big fear,” he told Voice of America in September. “We don’t have pirate men who are organised like the group we are fighting against now [Al-Shabab].”

However, in March two Iranian vessels suspected of fishing illegally were seized by Somali pirates, an incident described as the first successful hijacking in three years. The crew of one ship escaped after nearly five months, while the others remain in captivity.

“If the illegal fishing doesn’t stop, people will look for alternatives – like piracy, joining al-Shabab, becoming criminals, or migrating,” said former fisherman Ali.

Last month, residents of Durduri told Somali news agency Hiiraan Online that members of ISIL had arrived on a boat and taken as many as 40 young men.

With no work available, it is easy for such violent groups to recruit young men, Ali warned.

Will anyone help?

The challenges of policing Somalia’s waters are enormous. The 200-nautical-mile economic exclusion zone, representing 830,390 square kilometres, is far larger than its land area.

The maritime police in Bosaso, where human smugglers shelter migrants trying to sail north across the Gulf of Arden – one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes – operate on a shoestring budget of less than $10,000 per year, said Colonel Mohamed Ali Hashi.

Coastguards are volunteers, dressed in makeshift uniforms, cobbling money together for fuel, he told Al Jazeera.

Hashi, the commander of Bosaso’s maritime police, said foreign vessels are employing Somalis on board as armed guards, but he has “no speedboats, no firearms”.

“If the government doesn’t authorise me to fight illegal fishing, I can’t,” he said. “Since NATO has been here, piracy is down but illegal fishing has increased. NATO and the EU never help us, never give us a hand.”

Robert Mazurek, director of the Secure Fisheries agency, told Al Jazeera “the international community has done very little to combat [illegal] fishing in Somali waters”.

Asked for a response to the accusation, NATO responded: “Actions to counter illegal fishing would breach the scope and capabilities of the mission.”

So what is the way forward for Somalia’s fishing industry and security in its waters?

Development organisations want new legislation, improved information sharing between international and regional bodies, increased use of satellite tracking to identify vessels operating there, and investment in local fisheries infrastructure.

“We need more concerted efforts, advocacy, a holistic approach to address both illegal fishing and to support local communities affected by illegal fishing practices,” Adeso programme director Abdi Mohamed Dahir told Al Jazeera via email.

Locals such as Ali believe Somalia’s rulers must take responsibility.

“We have a government but it’s fragile,” he said. “A strong government that could protect our seas would be a solution. There is no other way.”",2015-10-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['return', 'piracy', 'overfishing', 'international', 'pirates', 'vessels', 'foreign', 'somalias', 'fishing', 'somali', 'told', 'fish', 'illegal']",Somalia,news article,English

What is glacial burst?

These rare instances occur when water dammed by a glacier or moraine is released. The glacier containing the body of water melts and overflows the glacier.

Why does a glacier break?

Glaciers break can happen due to erosion, a buildup of water pressure, an avalanche of rock or heavy snow, an earthquake or cryoseism, volcanic eruptions under the ice.

It can also happen after a massive displacement of water in a glacial lake when a large portion of an adjacent glacier collapses into it.

The direct causes of glacial lake outbursts are earthquake, heavy rainfall/snowmelt, long-term dam degradation, etc.

Several feared missing

Over 150 people have lost their lives and over 150 are missing following the massive flood near the power project, officials said.

People stuck in those areas have been advised to call: Disaster Operations Center number 1070, 1905 or 9557444486.

Trivendra Singh Rawat said that 600 personnel from the Indian Army and ITBP are on standby for dealing with any emerging situation and all the rescue teams are doing their best to save lives of missing workers at NTPC (140 nos) and RishiGanga site (17 nos).

CM Rawat said that medical teams have been rushed to the affected site and a 30-bed hospital has been kept ready at Joshimath for dealing with this emergency.

RAMESWARAM : The Hindu Makkal Katchi (HMK) has kick-started a controversy by linking Kerala floods to women’s entry into Sabarimala temple. They also offered a special prayer at the Ramanathaswamy temple, Rameswaram for the relief of Keralities. The party’s district president Prabhakaran stated that the opinion of the leaders of various political parties and the court supporting the entry of women into Sabarimala temple were the reason for the present situation prevailing in Kerala.

Prabhakaran also urged Kerala government to pass a resolution in the legislative assembly against women’s entry to the temple and update it to the Supreme Court. “We believe that Kerala would not have faced such a devastating situation, if it would have supported the ban on women’s entry into Sabarimala temple as per Devaswom board’s decision,” Prabhakaran added.

Terming the act of Hindu Makkal Katchi functionaries as irrational, Kasinathadurai, the district secretary of CPI (M) said, “Since the functionaries basically follow the ideology of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), they were supporting patriarchal form of society and are opposing the women’s entry into Sabarimala temple. “Whatever happened in Kerala is a natural disaster and it has nothing to do with women’s entry into a temple,” he added.",2018-08-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['hindu', 'situation', 'kerala', 'entry', 'sabarimala', 'flood', 'temple', 'prabhakaran', 'makkal', 'katchi', 'womens', 'express', 'indian', 'supporting']",India,news article,English
873,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Former city manager Tommy Turney passes away - Runnels County Register,https://www.runnelscountyregister.com/story/news/2021/03/29/former-ballinger-city-manager-passes-away/7044490002/,"Former city manager Tommy Turney passes away

Former Ballinger city manager Tommy Turney passed away unexpectedly on March 24. Turney was 50 years old.

Turney, originally from San Angelo, graduated from Angelo State University with a bachelor's degree. After graduation, Turney worked overseas for oil companies in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Iraq for approximately 20 years before coming to Ballinger. After he was fired as city manager, Turney worked as a corrections officer at the Runnels County jail. He was still employed at the jail at the time of his death. Jail captain Kimberly Dunn released a statement on social media regarding Turney's passing:

""It's with a saddened heart, that the Runnels County Jail says goodbye to Officer Tommy Turney. For both, staff and inmates alike, the emotions associated with spending time in the jail are often negative due to the nature of the environment. Tommy’s fun sense of humor, calm demeanor, and encouraging words brought light into our world. It’s a true blessing when God sends someone, like Tommy, into our lives who can lift our spirits on a daily basis. Tommy will be truly missed. Please join the Runnels County Jail family in extending our deepest condolences to the Tommy Turney family.""

Turney was hired as Ballinger city manager in August of 2018. While his first few months were relatively quiet, he did make repairs around the city, particularly to the groan and shudder evoking ""13th street dip,"" as locals referred to it. He also had workers clear out the creek bed along the street to help with flood control.

Turney also hired a collections agency to collect outstanding utility bills and municipal court fines. He also applied for grants to improve the city streets. The grant was eventually awarded to Ballinger, bringing in $275,000 for street repairs.

Turney hired a painter to 'beautify Ballinger,"" by painting murals around the city. He spoke with local business owners to get their permission to paint murals on the sides of their buildings. He also conducted the first city-wide cleanup in 3 years. He conducted the first capital assets inventory since 2006. He worked with TXDoT to help make repairs at the export. The agreement would have TXDoT paying 50% of the cost, ""even down to the cost of a light bulb,"" Turney said at the time. Turney also worked with the probation office to provide probationers to help clean up the city while they work off their community service hours.

In addition to the changes he made throughout the city, Turney also weathered several storms. The biggest issue he inherited was looking for money from 3 CDs cashed out by the city in 2016. He tackled that by bringing in an accountant to track down how the money was spent and to get the city’s books in order. The 3 CDs totaled $360,000. There was also the matter of a $225,000 grant reimbursement the city received, bringing the total to $585,000. No accusations of wrong-doing were made, but Turney got help from the Texas Ranger Shea, who investigated the case, ultimately not filing any charges. Eventually, Turney would determine that the money had gone into the general fund and was spent without accurate tracking. An auditor was brought in and said that the money was used to keep the city ""in the black."" Once that money was spent, the city had no reserves and their credit rating dropped. The money was spent prior to Turney being hired. He helped coordinate the work to find answers for the citizens of Ballinger.

Trouble would pop up when several local business owners accused Turney of ""making the city go broke."" According to the books, and the auditor, the city was broke before Turney arrived. He nevertheless shouldered responsibility for not fine-tuning the budget and, ultimately, kept his job.

The next salvo of criticism came from several city employees who accused Turney of HR violations. The employees contacted the mayor and a council member to have meetings with them to discuss Turney's use of foul language. The employees then wrote letters to the council. The council meetings, originally attended by only a handful of citizens, were now standing room only as over 100 people would come to the meetings. People spoke on Turney's behalf while a few of the employees openly addressed the council with their grievances. One employee even went so far as to say that he had secretly tape recorded private conversations with Turney. The meeting resulted in the council stating that they would find HR classes for Turney to attend. A vote on Turney's employment was taken with all 5 council members voting in favor of him keeping his job.

In November of 2019, Dawni Seymore was elected mayor, defeating former mayor Sam Mallory by 3 votes. Kristi Goetz also won a council seat, defeating Eloyed Fuentes. Concerns soon arose when city councilman Rick Morrish said that Ballinger had not paid Abilene per an agreement. The city was allegedly $90,000 behind in their payments with Abilene threatening to cancel the deal. Morrish and the council felt that it could jeopardize the long-term deal for Ballinger. Turney was dismissed in a 3-2 vote (Yea: Goetz, Seymore, Morrish. Nay: Jason Gore and Bob McDaniel). The vote to dismiss Turney caused Gore and McDaniel to walk out of the meeting and resign from their positions in protest.

Turney didn't miss a step after leaving the city. He soon went to work for the Runnels County Sheriff's office as a jailer. Turney's wife, Carrie Turney, had attended a regional police academy and been hired as a police officer in Winters. The family was in the process of moving from Ballinger to Winters when Turney died.

While city did not release a statement regarding Turney's service to the community and his death, former councilman Bob McDaniel commented about it, ""It doesn't bother me one bit to say that I loved Tommy Turney. He was a gentle soul who truly loved people, his family, and he had a special place in his heart for Ballinger and he was a dreamer. During my years serving on the Ballinger City Council, I served under five city managers and not one had the love of community and it's residents that Tommy had. From day one he launched himself into a campaign of showcasing Ballinger. The downtown fountain, the scout hut, the city park, the mural, and on and on, he had some degree of ownership in them all. He and I would get in the suburban and he'd talk about his wish list, an acre of bluebonnets behind city hall, a walking trail along Elm creek. I even went out and bought a canoe because he wanted to map out a plan for a trail along the creek from the park to the Colorado River. The night Tommy was terminated as manager, he said his goodbye to Jason and walked over to me, coffee cup in hand, and said ""I love you Bob, thanks for supporting me."" Those words I will forever cherish. Farewell old friend. There will come a day when we meet again.""",2021-03-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['away', 'council', 'jail', 'tommy', 'manager', 'ballinger', 'money', 'city', 'hired', 'passes', 'turney', 'turneys']",India,news article,English
2,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"More Chinese on the Coast, Less Fish in the Sea - Scientific American",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-chinese-on-the-coast-less-fish-in-the-sea/,"China's booming economic growth is helping to degrade the country's coastal marine ecosystem at an alarming rate, despite the total population remaining steady, according to a new study.

A joint Chinese and American research team analyzed five decades of data from Chinese government records and found that the country's coastal marine ecosystem has steadily degraded to an almost irreversible point since 1978—the year the Chinese government introduced sweeping reform to industrialize the country's economy.

While China's population has held steady through that time, the economic growth has driven people from the country's interior farmland to the coast, and the combination of industrialization and a swelling coastal population is taking its toll on the marine environment, according to the researchers.

Qiang He, a marine ecologist from Beijing Normal University, led the research while a visiting scholar in Mark Bertness' lab at Brown University. He has studied coastal change in China for the best part of a decade and is first author on a study describing the research, published today in the journal Scientific Reports.

""Our paper shows that economic growth, not population growth, is major cause of China's coastal ecosystem changes,"" he concluded.

More people on the coast, less fish in the sea

And these ecosystem changes may only get worse, threatening the 28,000 different marine species that live along the coast as well as China's 1.3 billion people—half of whom live on the industrialized coast.

Before 1978, the diversity and size of China's fish species were steady, but since the economic reforms took place, both have been steadily decreasing. Coral cover in the South China Sea has crashed to 15 percent of pre-1978 levels, according to the study, and red tides—algal blooms that turn coastal waters a deep, biblical red and can be debilitating and fatal to marine life—have increased from around 10 each year before 1980 to between 70 and 120 each year since.

China's coastal gross domestic product growth and population movements mirror this coastal degradation. Between 1950 and the 1978 reforms, China's coastal GDP grew annually by around $2.2 billion. Between 1978 and 2010, China's coastal GDP increased by over two orders of magnitude with the country's coastal GDP contribution rising from 50 percent of the total to 60 percent. China's coastal population also increased from 260 million in 1954 to 400 million in 1978, and to 590 million in 2010.

During that time, China has been fueling its industrial and economic growth partly through massive development of its coastline. Mariculture and fishing activities have expanded to support local populations, pollution levels have increased, and miles of coastlines have been developed and filled in with mud to build larger and busier ports.

""The coastal degradation has been just phenomenal,"" said Mark Bertness, a marine ecologist at Brown who supervised the study. ""The message here is without some kind of regulation on this, some kind of conservation, they're going to burn out the resource base.""

""All of that stuff is going to be gone, and it's going to be gone in very short order,"" he added.

A 'red flag' for developing countries

China has been gaining attention internationally recently for its aggressive efforts to decarbonize its economy. Record-breaking levels of smog in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai over the winter spurred the government to declare a ""war on pollution,"" investing heavily in renewable energy and technology to clean up its fossil fuel power plants. The country is also close to launching a nationwide carbon market (Greenwire, March 5).

Yet while air quality issues in China have been highly publicized, the study says it has been at the expense of water quality and the degradation of marine ecosystems. Coastal cities like Shenzhen and Fujian are not as populated and are more removed from the public eye, he added.

""The air pollution is very intense, it's very serious in the major cities like Beijing and Shanghai,"" he said. ""But in coastal cities, populations are ... not as high as in those cities.""

There has been a fair amount of research in China on coastal pollution, but Bertness said this is the first study to show that Chinese economic development is accelerating the country's coastal degradation.

China is also one of several nations pulling themselves out of the Third World this century through rapid industrialization. India, Brazil and other developing nations are following a similar trajectory, and Bertness said those countries should also keep an eye on how their industrial and economic development is effecting their coastal marine ecosystems.

""This should be a red flag for all of the developing countries, especially the Asian developing countries,"" Bertness said. ""The nice thing about China was that there was this line in the sand—1978—when everything absolutely changed. But in reality, in a lot of Third World countries, the change has been almost as dramatic.""

A 'mega-star' is born

Bertness was also proud of the work Qiang He did on the study. The young Chinese scientist—who gained the nickname ""Q,"" after the James Bond scientist, while working at Bertness' lab—conceptualized the study almost by himself. But it took some work, Bertness said.

""His first few months in my lab were really kind of trying, because I was trying to get him to think creatively and get him to think of new different things to do,"" Bertness said. ""One of things I stressed with him is if you really want to do something big in China, you want to do something no one in China has done yet.""

After a few months of fruitlessly pitching research ideas to Bertness, Qiang came into his office one day and said he wanted to look into the effect of the 1978 economic reforms on marine environments in China.

""I looked at him and said, 'Yes, that's exactly what you need to do,'"" Bertness recalled.

Bertness predicted that He, who is now a postdoctoral research associate at the Duke University Marine Laboratory, is going to be a ""mega-star"" in marine conservation and ecology in China.

""It was an amazing process watching him go through this metamorphosis,"" Bertness said. ""This was really kind of a coming of age scientifically and creatively for Qiang.""

724,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Historic floods are ravaging Canada - Popular Science,https://www.popsci.com/canada-flooding/,"“You know I’ve often said in Canada that our greatest attribute, in terms of the weather, is that the weather hits and runs,” said David Phillips, the senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada (the agency tasked with implementing the Canadian government’s environmental agenda). “It doesn’t stand around and torment you and clobber you and tease you like it does in other latitudes, like in Florida or the Carolinas. A hurricane can stand there for two or three days and then come ashore, go back out and then come back in again. It just absolutely wears you down, because it doesn’t go away.”

In Canada, even terrible weather knows it’s impolite to overstay. But this week’s rains, which inundated the residents of Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec with a catastrophic deluge of water, were nigh unCanadian.

“That storm just crawled up to Canada and then it just stayed there like an unwanted house guest. It wouldn’t leave,” said Phillips. “And it just rained, and rained, and then more rain. In Ottawa [Canada’s capital], over three days there were three hours where it didn’t rain. We’ve never seen weather like that before.”

The malingering storms caused historic flooding—Canada’s public safety minister Ralph Goodale called it the worst flooding in fifty years. Ottawa, which normally receives around 3.2 inches of rain in the entire month of May, was drenched with 4.42 inches in just the first ten days of this month. Similarly, Montreal—which ordinarily gets 2.29 inches of rain in May—has already seen 2.6 inches. It’s not surprising that the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers are beginning to overrun their banks, breaking retaining dikes and flooding communities. Thousands have been evacuated, and over the weekend the city of Montreal declared a state of emergency.

Phillips says that the recent rains weren’t the underlying cause of the flooding. They were more of a precipitating event.

“It’s been really wet since the first of January,” said Phillips. “Over the first 125 days of this year we’ve never seen wetter conditions in those areas.”

The areas that are currently flooding received more than the usual amount of snow this winter (though the snowfall was not record shattering). Montreal received 15 percent more snow than normal, while the areas around Ottawa saw around 30 percent more snow than normal. That’s exactly a major problem—this is, after all Canada, one of the snowiest nations on Earth. But then the weather did something weird: it got warm.

This year the Earth experienced the second warmest February on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It was the second warmest February for the United States (and the nation’s sixth warmest winter on record). Given that Canada is both located on Earth and 75 percent of Canadians reside within 100 miles of our border, our weather patterns and Canadian’s weather aren’t wholly unaligned. In fact, that storm that barreled up to Canada hit New York and New England first. On February 23 of this year, Ottawa—home to the world’s largest naturally frozen skating rink—set a heat record of 54F, dwarfing the normal high of around 9F. Montreal, known for its ‘underground city’ or network of tunnels to help residents move around without having to deal with its winter weather, was just about as warm.

A fairly warm February was followed by a weirdly cold March. “That delayed a lot of the melt,” said Bob Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Weather Underground. “And then April was not only relatively warm, but quite wet as well, which produced a double whammy. Snow melted and rain fell on top of that melting snow. You had precipitation from both sources.”

The warming Arctic, along with warmer waters and a shifting jet stream, are altering the conditions which can create a storm. In April, Montreal received 4.6 inches of precipitation, or 50 percent more rain than usual; Ottawa received 155 percent more rain than normal. And it’s not just southeast Canada that’s experiencing unusual rain. April was the second wettest April on record for the United States. Arkansas, like our neighbors to the north, is in the midst of historic floods.

The April rains and melt, “filled all of the nooks and crannies,” said Phillips. “The ground is like a sponge, and it took all of that melt water and absorbed it and there wasn’t any room left in the soil for when those spring rains came.”

And those May storms, said Phillips, “were lined up there like jumbo jets on the airport tarmac. One coming after the other out of Texas, picking up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, from the Atlantic Ocean, they were sopping wet storms, and they arrived and they hit an area that had been vulnerable because of their brothers and cousins that had come in the previous five months.”

Given the sheer scale of the weather, one might be tempted to lay all the blame to climate change. Phillips says it’s likely a factor, but he notes that infrastructure matters too.

“The same old weather would have a different effect now than it had twenty, thirty, forty years ago,” said Phillips. “It doesn’t matter how dry Toronto or Ottawa or New York City are. That rain drop becomes a flood drop when it falls, because that rain is falling on impervious surfaces. What has changed is the surfaces on which that rain falls, because it falls in built up areas. We don’t have green infrastructure anymore, we don’t have park lands that could absorb the water.”

But Phillip also notes that the weather is changing, and that climate change likely has a role. Though he’s quick to note the difference between a changing climate and changing weather.

“Climate change doesn’t cause the weather, it doesn’t cause rain,” said Phillips. “You’re going to get hurricanes, tornadoes, sandstorms, windstorms, floods without climate change. We always have. What makes climate change different is that it gives storms a different personality or character. It changes the intensity, the duration, the frequency of it. It doesn’t give you typhoons in Saskatoon or sandstorms in Detroit—but the statistics of weather change.”

To put that in context, it helps to lay out what factors aligned to cause this flooding. If the winter snowfall had been less, if the spring had not been unusually warm and wet, if the rains had kept on moving, Western Ontario and Eastern Quebec would be in a much drier situation right now. If—and it’s too soon to have data on this —climate change increased the likelihood of each of those occurrences, climate change would not have caused the floods. But it would have made the flood-perfect weather more likely to occur.

It’s too soon for a proper attribution study, but Phillips says that the fingerprints, or the patterns of the weather, are in line with changes that Canadians have been seeing in the weather in recent years. The storms that hit Canada, like this one, seem to have lost their hit and run characteristic and are sticking around longer, and dumping more water.

“What we’ve seen over recent years, more than the fact that we’re squeezing more precipitation over the air masses, we’re seeing that storms are hanging out longer, they’re squeezing misery out longer,” said Phillips.

It’s a pattern in keeping with the predictions of what Canada will look like under climate change. “The intergovernmental panel on climate change predictions for later this century, if greenhouse gasses continue to accumulate and the eEarth continues to warm, is for Canada generally to get wetter,” said Henson.",2017-05-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['snow', 'ottawa', 'change', 'doesnt', 'weather', 'floods', 'canada', 'ravaging', 'storms', 'rain', 'climate', 'historic', 'phillips']",Canada,news article,English
939,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Qatar LNG Plans To Flood World Market  gCaptain - gcaptain.com - gcaptain.com,https://gcaptain.com/qatar-lng-world-market-exports/,"By Anna Shiryaevskaya (Bloomberg) The worlds top exporter of liquefied natural gas is ramping up production dramatically and undercutting competitors in a bid to squeeze them out the market.

Qatar is dropping prices and pushing ahead with a $29 billion project to boost its exports of the fuel by more than 50%, stymieing the prospects of new plants elsewhere. Its also established a trading team to compete in the nascent spot market and pushing into Asia more aggressively, according to people familiar with the matter.

The strategy marks a shift for Qatar, which has barely raised production in the past five years and traditionally prioritized prices over market share. Increased competition, especially from the U.S. and Australia, has forced the Persian Gulf state to become more nimble and attract buyers in Asia, a hot spot for gas demand.

The global transition to renewable energy is adding to the countrys sense of urgency. While LNG was until recently touted as a bridge from coal and oil to the likes of solar and wind power, its falling out of favor with some governments as they step up efforts to slow climate change.

Qatars expansion plan is so huge that there are questions on the need for other supply options, said Julien Hoarau, head of EnergyScan, the analytics unit of the French utility Engie SA. Its still the number one, but the U.S. has never been so close, so Qatar needed to move if it wanted to keep its leading position.

The U.S. came close to overtaking Qatars monthly exports for the first time in April, while Australia has been neck-in-neck with the Middle Eastern nation for the last year, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. As Gulf Coast projects develop, the U.S. is slated to briefly become the worlds top supplier by 2024, before Qatar regains that status later in the decade, according to BloombergNEF.

Several factors are playing into Qatars hands. China, one of the fastest growing LNG markets, has been reluctant to import more from the U.S. or Australia due to trade and geopolitical tensions.

But Qatars main advantage is that it has the worlds lowest production costs thanks to an abundance of easy-to-extract gas, most of it contained in the giant North Field that extends into Iran.

Bonds Coming

Qatars state energy company, which may soon sell up to $10 billion of bonds to fund the gas expansion, said the project will be viable even with oil at $20 a barrel, 70% less than current levels. LNG contracts are typically linked to oil.

Thats enabling Qatar Petroleum to set pricing below what other exporters can manage, according to traders. The firm has sold LNG in recent months at around 10% of Brent crude prices, including to China and Pakistan, whereas it used to set the level at 15%.

Nobody can compete with Qatari costs, said Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies. They can do whatever they like and everybody will have to respond the way they can. And, especially when the market is in surplus and prices are low, that will impact the competitions profits.

QP executives have jetted across Asia over the past few months to ink export deals. Their efforts led in March to a 10-year contract with Beijing-based Sinopec, signed at 10%-10.19% of Brent.

Qatars Ministry of Energy and QP didnt respond to requests for comment.

A few years ago, demand for LNG was projected to rise steeply over the coming decades. Gas emits less carbon dioxide than most other fossil fuels when its burned, while renewable-energy projects were still too expensive to power electricity grids, factories and transport on a mass scale.

But solar and wind technology is improving faster than expected, helped in part by massive government green-spending programs triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

Were Not Afraid

Even as Qatar seeks to make the most of its assets, there are obstacles to it reaching total domination. Many buyers want a diverse group of suppliers. Russias Yamal LNG project and the planned Arctic LNG 2 plant, led by Novatek PJSC, are among those that will remain competitive as Qatar ramps up exports, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc.

The biggest U.S. LNG exporter, Cheniere Energy Inc., said its unperturbed by Qatars moves. Some importers are attracted by American firms offering more flexible delivery terms and pricing thats not tied to oil, which has soared almost 30% this year.

Were not afraid, Chenieres Chief Commercial Officer Anatol Feygin told investors this month. Were part of a sort of diversification of the supply and contracting structure along with Qatar Petroleum and our friends at Novatek.

Yet U.S. projects are among those most likely to struggle. At least 10, five of them in Texas and four in Louisiana, probably wont secure enough financing to be completed, according to analysis from BloombergNEF.

Feedstock costs are part of the problem. American companies have to buy gas at around $2.50 per million British thermal units, way above Qatars wellhead prices of $0.30 or lower.

New suppliers in the U.S. need spot LNG prices to be at least $7.80 per million Btu in Asia and $6.80 in Europe, said David Thomas, an independent adviser and former head of LNG at Vitol, the worlds largest independent oil trader. For comparison, Asian rates have averaged about $6.80 over the last five years. The economics for producers in Australia and Africa are similar, Thomas said.

The lack of new supply from other countries will benefit Qatar, Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi, who is also chief executive officer of QP, said in an interview with Bloomberg in February. Our expansion is very timely, he said.

The Qatari strategy appears to be maintaining its global market share and also maximizing sales, before the gas market starts to shrink, OIESs Stern said. It is a competitive and strategic rush. They recognize LNG demand will eventually decline as the world moves forward in the energy transition.

Description of the disaster

On 12 December 2019, Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), launched a DREF operation in response to landslide events which occurred following prolonged rainfall from 29 November and 3 December 2019 the districts of Mbale and Bududa in Eastern Region of Uganda. These landslides affected 380 households (1,900 people). These landslides occurred in the broader context of extensive flooding across the whole of Uganda, which started in October and continued throughout December 2019.

During the assessments, URCS working with government (district and National teams such as the DDMCs) rescued and provided temporary shelters as well as psychosocial support to the affected and most vulnerable persons using resources at hand. Indeed, within the same period, Uganda had experienced another major flood and landslide in the Western region of Bundibugyo with 4,436HH 30,919 individuals (14,873Males and 16,046 Females) affected with 2,450 of those displaced and living in the two camps of Simuliki and Bubukwanga camps. As such, the NS extended the scope of the response to provide WASH assistance to the families affected in this district, which allowed URCS to reach 37,603 people (approx. 7,520 HH) through this DREF operation.",2021-03-01 08:00:00+00:00,"['mdrug043', 'landslides', 'urcs', 'red', 'final', 'operation', 'report', 'support', 'dref', 'response', 'region', 'occurred', 'affected', 'uganda']",Uganda,news article,English

In 2020, flooding has affected 2.7 million people in 18 countries in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact has been particularly severe, and the number of people affected is more than double last years, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains have gradually subsided in parts of West Africa, recent flooding have occurred in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This year 197,000 houses were reported destroyed in thirteen countries of the region. 422,000 hectares of farmland were affected by floods, which resulted in the destruction of crops and fields, threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions were already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities have led the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organizations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO has supported the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million.

Thoroughly brushing its teeth before indulging in a sleepy yawn, these pictures of a bleary eyed orangutan bear an uncanny resemblance to the morning routines of many human beings.

Siswi was captured demonstrating impeccable oral hygiene in Tanjung Puting National Park in Borneo, Indonesia.

'I thought these primates were so much like us,' he said.

'They are so intelligent and so observant of human behaviour.

'We saw Siswi brushing her teeth with a toothbrush and the toothpaste made her yawn,' he said.

Mr Freund, who said orangutans live semi-wild in the jungles of Central Kalimantan in Indonesia, said the creatures learn to mimic the mannerisms of tourists that flock to the region to catch a glimpse of the mighty apes.

'Tourists visit these remote places in river boats and as much as we ogle at them, they learn and imitate our behaviours in the most uncanny manner,' he said.

The region has been hit by extreme cyclones, flooding and drought in recent months and scientists say it is warming much faster than other parts of the world.

Cyclone Idai smashed into Mozambique in March, killing more than 1,300 people. Villages were washed away and cities inundated, while farmers saw their crops and livestock destroyed. The cyclone one of the biggest on record is estimated to have caused more than $2 billion worth of damage across the region.

A month later, Mozambique was hit by another storm, Cyclone Kenneth, killing dozens more people. ""Never before has this country been hit by two cyclones in the same season,"" says Gabriella Waaijman, the global humanitarian director of Save the Children.

Waaijman says 2019 will be remembered as the year that the climate crisis devastated parts of eastern and southern Africa adding that at least 33 million people in the region face emergency levels of food insecurity, with about 16 million of them children.

""The link to climate change is actually the compounding effect of emergency after emergency after emergency,"" Waaijman says, adding, ""So the ability for people to recover from a shock, like a drought or a flood at the moment even, is getting less and less and less. And therefore their livelihoods are slowly but surely being eroded and literally washed away.""

A 2015 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows temperatures rising in southern Africa at twice the global rate. Save the Children says leaders of industrialized nations must commit to bigger cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and greater support for those most affected by climate change.

642,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Blue Nile records highest water level in 100 years: Sudan - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/blue-nile-records-highest-water-level-100-years-sudan/,"The Ministry of Water Resources, Irrigation and Electricity in Sudan announced that the Blue Nile, the main river of the Nile, recorded the highest level of water in the last 100 years, surpassing the flood in 1946. The levels of the White Nile and Blue Nile was reported at 17.14 meters in Khartoum, a record high due to heavy rain in Ethiopia.

The ministry warned, in a statement on Monday evening, of serious floods over the next two days, flooding large areas of Khartoum and 12 other states in the north and center of the country.

Water level showed an increase above the annual average in the Blue Nile, due to rain and floods during the past few days, Director of the Nile Forecast Center of the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, Eman Sayed, confirmed.

The benefit to Sudan from the rainwater is limited, she added, the flat Sudanese terrain prevents water from reaching the riverbed.

The heavy rainfall in Sudan has caused severe flooding in some areas, Sayed said, pointing out that this weather change will increase water in Lake Nasser in Egypt in the coming few days.

According to Sayed, 85 percent of water flowing into the Egyptian Nile comes from the Ethiopian plateau during this season, beginning the first of August and ending in October, .

So far, the flooding is within the average rate, despite heavy clouds above the Ethiopian plateau. The flood will show its semi-final results next month, she sxplained.

Although the Nile recorded its highest rise at the confluence of the Blue and White rivers in Sudan, the floods will not have an impact on the High Dam in Egypt, sources said.

The home-buying season is in full swing in North America — and flood season is still on.

After overflowing rivers ravaged communities in Newfoundland and British Columbia, the Town of Banff, Alta., received its own flood alert on Tuesday. And flash flooding turned the streets of Maryland’s historic Ellicott City into rapids on Sunday.

So how can homebuyers reduce the risk that the biggest investment of their lives will at some point end up under water?

You wouldn’t necessarily know it from the headlines. With extreme weather events now happening with alarming frequency, flooding is becoming increasingly common, even for homes that are nowhere close to waterways. And a basement flooded by sewer backup after a torrential downpour wouldn’t make the news.

Flooding has overtaken fire as the No. 1 cause of home insurance payouts, with claims for flooded basements averaging $43,000 in major cities. And yet, there isn’t much in Canada that would help homebuyers assess that risk, says Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

Home inspectors aren’t trained to spot flood risks

A home inspection, for example, will likely tell you little about whether you should waterproof the basement or regrade the perimeter of your future home so that the water flows away from the foundations.

“Home inspectors receive virtually zero training on flood risk assessment,” Feltmate told Global News.

And the process of changing that is just getting underway. Feltmate’s own Intact Centre is developing a flood-risk crash course for home inspectors that will be rolled out in Ontario this September and throughout Canada at the beginning of next year.

Municipal flood plain maps are usually outdated

Large municipalities and conservation authorities across Canada generally have maps that prospective homebuyers can ask to see to check whether a property lies in a known floodplain.

But those drawings are often 25 to 30 years old and woefully out of date, Feltmate said.

The Trudeau government just released guidelines to harmonize flood maps across Canada last year.

Homesellers don’t necessarily have to tell you about past flooding

Don’t think your homeseller will let you know about past floods. Often, the onus of finding that out lies squarely with the homebuyer.

Story continues below advertisement

Editor’s note: The following sentence has been modified to reflect the fact that homesellers have an obligation to disclose latent defects.

In general, homesellers have an obligation to disclose so-called latent defects, including those that “wouldn’t be readily identifiable by a reasonable person doing an inspection of the property,” said Michael Abrams, an Ottawa-based lawyer at Kelly Santini.

“If [a home] floods every spring and [homebuyers] are looking at the property in July, it might not be readily apparent that there is a flooding issue. But if the seller is aware of it and it happens on a regular basis, then that’s something they’d have an obligation to disclose,” Abrams said.

And homesellers can’t lie if you ask them direct questions, he added.

“There’s a duty of good faith that exists that you have to provide complete and truthful answers to those questions.”

READ MORE: Here’s how much climate change can cost homeowners in damages

But homeowners don’t have to volunteer information about properties that are located in a known floodplain or an instance of flooding, whether it was from overland water seeping in through doors and windows or old city regurgitating sewage into the basement.

Story continues below advertisement

Those, at least, are the common-law principles that apply throughout Canada, Abrams said. Each province has its own regulations on the matter, and private law in Quebec is governed by French-inspired civil law.

What homebuyers can do

Canada is catching up when it comes to flood insurance, with a growing number of insurers now providing both sewer-backup and overland insurance, which are generally treated as additional coverage.

But buying flood insurance is no substitute for doing your due diligence before signing on the dotted line. A growing number of homes throughout Canada are becoming uninsurable due to repeated instances of flooding, Feltmate said. And even a single instance of water seeping through your basement drains could lead to drastically higher insurance premiums or denial of further coverage, as Global News has previously reported.

Your best bet? Asking pointed questions of homesellers and their neighbours.

“Spend time in the community,” Feltmate said. The extra legwork could really pay off in the long term.

The flooding led to heavy traffic jams, with some Egyptians taking to Twitter to highlight how long car journeys were taking them.

Traffic also led to several EgyptAir flights being delayed, as passengers were unable to get to the airport in time. Aerial images on Tuesday evening highlighted the extent of the standstill.

Air passengers who made it to the airport were faced with further flooding inside the terminal. Some tourists responded by sitting on top of their suitcases to wheel themselves around the airport.

Some have used this episode to criticise the government for poor infrastructure, and for focusing resources on building a new capital.

561,Drought Sri Lanka,"'Wave,' by Sonali Deraniyagala - San Francisco Chronicle",https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Wave-by-Sonali-Deraniyagala-4358632.php,"By Sonali Deraniyagala

(Knopf; 228 pages; $24)

In December 2004, when some of the places I had visited and loved in Sri Lanka were hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami, I watched from afar in horror. Hundreds of thousands of people died. Among the casualties: Sonali Deraniyagala's two children, her husband and her parents.

Deraniyagala's new book, ""Wave,"" is, most profoundly, an answer to the question of how one can hold on to the knowledge of a world that preceded disaster. Deraniyagala has to get to that world by remembering, but in the immediate aftermath of her loss, she can hardly bear to think of her spirited Sri Lankan-English sons, Vikram and Malli, or her fun-loving English husband, Stephen Lissenburgh.

In the book' opening scenes, Deraniyagala is vacationing with her family in Yala, a national park in her native Sri Lanka, when the sea approaches, foaming suspiciously. She flees her hotel, running with one child on either side of her, her husband just behind, passing her parents' room with no time to warn them. When the four of them leap into a jeep with some others, the vehicle speeds away from the sea, but not fast enough. It overturns. Deraniyagala survives by clinging to a branch. She emerges from the water, but the rest of her family vanishes.

Before her is an apocalyptic version of her family's beloved Yala. ""I saw then the toppled trees everywhere,"" she writes. ""I could make those out, trees on the ground with their roots sticking up. What is this, a swamp? I was in an immense bog-land. Everything was one color, brown, reaching far. This didn't look like Yala, where the ground is dry and cracked and covered in green shrub. What is this knocked-down world? The end of time?""

In the water's wake, she sits in shock, avoiding the evidence that her family might be permanently gone. As time passes, she drinks, pops pills and researches ways to kill herself. She fights not to re-enter a world in which the absence of her family will be obvious; then she battles to keep their home unchanged. Their faces alternatively blur and sharpen as she strategizes. How best to hold them? At a distance? Or as close as she can? Which will make things more tolerable?

The book shifts between Colombo and London, and then Colombo, London and New York (where Deraniyagala is now a research scholar at Columbia), and ultimately to other destinations as she travels through pain with friends and family at her side. While most sections are marked with the years of their present action - Deraniyagala's temporal distance from the wave - most of the time that action takes the form of remembrance. She narrates how spaces, people and objects trigger her memory, and investigates through what devices she can contend with her new consciousness - a consciousness in which she feels not only responsible for the deaths of her family, but also surrounded by their irrepressible spirit.

One of the simple beauties of Deraniyagala's prose is her drift between tenses. She remembers her remembering, and then gives us her mind moving, in the present tense, to an image of one of her loved ones. They are with her still: her costume-wearing youngest, Malli; her food-loving husband, Stephen; her bird-watching oldest, Vikram. Each springs to vivid life through the particular window of her mourning.

Sometimes these images knock her to the ground, but in other moments, she cannot help but return to their family's shared appreciation of the beautiful world around them. She lets them rejoin her. ""Maybe it is not so overwhelming after all, to dissolve the divide between now and then,"" she writes.

As the book progresses, both Deraniyagala and the prose itself begin to re-engage with the natural world, and with the sensory pleasures in which her boys had reveled: rare and beautiful birds, forbidden sweets, prawn curry, hot bagels, landscapes, cricket. The story opens up, and the narrative travels from the interior of her mourning to its exterior.

Many of the most moving passages find her traveling through time and space: the family's untouched London home, years later; whale-watching; sub-arctic Sweden. Descriptions of place are often stunning in their beauty. She imagines how they would have loved a certain elaborate spiderweb, and in that sub-Arctic's ""deserted shores,"" offers us a glimpse of ""a lake of ice, surrounded by naked birches sheathed in frozen fog, each branch glowing like a stag's antlers in velvet in that mellow light.""

The beauty they would have loved burns the truth of her life to its simplest vision, something beyond pain: ""Immersed in that endless white, I knew I was their mother, my horror dormant, or not that relevant even.""

Although for much of the book, we are privileged to be with her as she conjures and re-conjures her joyous family, what emerges from this wizardry most clearly is, of course, Deraniyagala herself - carrying within her present life another gorgeously remembered one.",2013-03-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['loved', 'deraniyagala', 'husband', 'world', 'book', 'wave', 'sri', 'present', 'london', 'yala', 'sonali', 'family']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Flash floods triggered by heavy rains killed 15 people and damaged scores of houses in Pakistan's scenic northwestern Swat Valley, a spokesman said Wednesday, as rescuers assisted residents in the port city of Karachi where last week's rains wreaked havoc that killed dozens.

The latest floods-related fatalities were reported from the Swat region, a popular tourist destination where landslides overnight blocked a key mountain road, stranding scores of tourists who were being evacuated, said Taimur Khan, spokesman for a disaster management agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy monsoon rains hit parts of Pakistan last month, triggering flash floods in the country's financial capital of Karachi and elsewhere in southern Sindh province, killing at least 47 people there. Since June, when rains began lashing Pakistan, at least 176 people have been killed across the country, according to the national disaster management agency.

Last week, Karachi's many neighborhoods were flooded and water is still being pump out from submerged streets.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was expected to visit Karachi to meet with residents and get a briefing about damages caused by the monsoon rains, which came as authorities have been trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 296,000 people and killed 6,318 since February.

Pakistan reported 18 more deaths on Wednesday from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning. The monsoon season runs from July through September.",2020-09-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['rains', 'swat', 'triggered', 'flash', 'pakistan', 'monsoon', 'rain', 'killed', 'karachi', '15', 'floods', 'nw', 'scores', 'kill']",Pakistan,news article,English

CAIRO – 15 June 2018: In the era of King Djoser, King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Neterkhet and founder of the Third Dynasty in the Old Kingdom, a shortage of the Nile flood in 2,700 BC led to a seven-year famine, leaving Egypt in a state of extreme distress. The king was perplexed as grains were insufficient, seeds dried up, people robbed each other, and temples and shrines closed. Looking for an end to his people’s suffering, the king consulted his architect and prime minister, Imhotep, commanding him to dig for a solution in the old sacred texts. Obeying the king’s order, Imhotep headed to a temple in the ancient city of Ain Shams (Old Heliopolis), where he discovered that the solution could be found in the city of Yebu (Aswan or Elephantine), the source of the Nile.Imhotep, the architect of the Djoser pyramid in Saqqara, traveled to Yebu, where he visited the Temple of Khnum and saw the granite, precious stones, minerals, and building stones. Khnum, the god of fertility, was believed to have created mankind from clay.After his state visit to Yebu, Imhotep updated king Djoser on his journey. On the day following his meeting with Imhetop, Khnum, came to the king in his dream, promising to end the famine and to allow the Nile to flow again if Djoser restores the temple of Khnum. Consequently, Djoser executed Khnum's wishes, allocating the revenue of the area from Elephantine to Khnum temple. Shortly afterwards, the famine and people’s suffering came to an end.The famine story had been engraved on a granite stone in 250 BC during the era of Ptolemy V on the Sehel Island, Aswan. The Stela, which is 2.5 meters in height and 3 meters in width, includes 42 columns of hieroglyphic texts read from right to left. The Stela had a natural horizontal fissure when the Ptolemies engraved the story on it. Above the inscriptions, there were drawings depicting King Djsoer’s offerings to the triad of the Elephantine deities (Khnum, Anuket, and Satis), which were worshipped in Aswan during the Old Kingdom.The stone was discovered in 1889 by American Egyptologist Charles Edwin Wilbour, according to his notes preserved in Brooklyn Museum Archives. Wilbour tried to translate the inscriptions on the Stela, but he only managed to recognize when the story was engraved on the stone. The engravings were deciphered for the first time by German Egyptologist Heinrich Brugsch in 1891 and it took 62 years for the mission to be completed. The texts had to be translated and revised by four other Egyptologists. The complete translation was later published in a book penned by Miriam Lichtheim, titled “Ancient Egyptian Literature: A Book of Readings”.Perhaps, the story was previously documented on papyrus and reformulated on stone in the Ptolemy era, General Director of Aswan Antiquities Ahmed Saleh told Egypt Today.,Some Egyptologists, including Saleh, think that the story of the Khnum famine is a fictional story invented during the era of Ptolemy V to consolidate Khnum’s priesthood and perpetuate the idea that Khnum has the upper hand, thereby, ensuring his control over Egypt. The same theory is backed by Lichtheim in her book “Foundations of Atlantis, Ancient Astronauts and Other Alternatives.”“The Stela demonstrates a religious conflict between Khnum priests and goddess Isis’ clergymen,” Saleh explains, adding that another story on a famine engraved in the Philae temple states that Isis, a goddess of ancient Egypt, is the source of the Nile water.During the Ptolemaic era, Isis was worshipped all over Egypt. With the revenues from land plots extending from Aswan Dam to the city of Mahraqqa, southern Aswan, were allocated for Isis’ Philae Temple priests. Khnum’s clergymen were angry for not having the upper hand in Egypt; thus, it is believed that the story of the famine is just a fictional tale invented by the jealous priests, according to Saleh.“Such conflict could be the reason behind the creation of the famine story engraved on the Stela as it would empower them to religiously take control of Egypt,” he said.At Isis’ Temple of Philae, another story on a famine was engraved on granite. Isis’ story was engraved in the era of Ptolemy VI (186–145 BC), Saleh explained. “Each party (Khnum priests and Isis’ clergymen) wanted to bestow their favors on Egypt,” and to have the revenues of the 12-mile-long area between Aswan dam and Elephantine, Saleh confirmed.At the end of the story, according to the inscription of the Famine Stela in Sehel Island, the Khnum priests were honored by the revenues.Egypt depended on the Nile flood water, and was exposed to several famines. However, in Minya, Upper Egypt, another inscription was engraved in the tomb of Amenemhat, from the 12th Dynasty during the era of Senusret I, in Beni Hasan Cemetery; it talks about a just king, whose era had never seen a famine, Head of Minya Antiquities, Gamal Samastawy, told Egypt Today.Many people believe that this story is related to Prophet Joseph's story of the seven-year starvation in Quran and the Old Testament. However, Saleh said that the two stories are not necessarily connected.“There are no historical facts that prove the famine story is related to the divine one,” Saleh said, continuing that that number seven in Sehel’s Famine Stela does not necessarily mean “seven years” but could merely be a symbol of perfection and completion.Stela of Famine engravings have been affected by erosion. “Some inscriptions were scratched due to erosion, rains and winds,” Saleh pointed out. “These inscriptions were restored in 2015 by the Egyptian archeological mission,” he added, noting that the Ministry of Antiquities plans to build a tent over the Stela to protect it from the rains.Sehel Island, where the Stela exists, is considered by the Egyptologists as a piece of Pharaonic diary of 550 stones engraved by ancient Egyptian kings, rulers, pilgrims, travellers, and patients.“The Sehel Island is a book of memories. Whenever a king or priest passed by the island, he wrote his memory like ‘I am…son of…my mother is…’. The area has 550 engraved memories dating from the prehistoric period to Roman Greek era,” Saleh said.The engraved stories also served as a way of documenting tasks. “Any state official who was sent to get gold from the South used to engrave his mission on the stone,” Saleh continues.Sehel was a place of worshipping the Goddess Anuket, one of the Elephantine triad; the stones could be classified into two categories: royal engravings and inscriptions by individuals.Most engravings include the depiction of the triad, where travelers or patients asked for success in life or treatment from an illness.The stones also include one of the most important engravings that prove that Senusret III (1878 BC to 1839 BC) decreed to dig and expand a canal in the western side of the Sehel Island, for his warships and to serve as a maritime trade passage.",2018-07-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['egypt', 'pharaonic', 'famine', 'piece', 'era', 'saleh', 'stela', 'khnum', 'king', 'island', 'engraved', 'aswan', 'diary']",Egypt,news article,English

Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel is designed to be a flagship including all the five Sheraton signature experiences. Provided to China Daily

The visit of the Real Madrid soccer team to the Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel confirmed its status as a flagship hotel. Li Wenfang reports.

The hotel market in Guangzhou, Guangdong province is booming after the city hosted the 2010 Asian Games. It has become one of the biggest inbound and outbound tourist cities in China, says James Greig, general manager of the recently unveiled Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel.

""With the tightened relationship with Hong Kong and Macao, Guangzhou's future is promising in the hospitality business. The city will become more and more important in South China, even the whole of China,"" Greig says.

Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel is one of the four hotels in the Starwood hotel group that operates in Guangzhou, with 1,518 rooms in total. The other three are The Westin Pazhou, Four Points by Sheraton Guangzhou, Dongpu and The Westin Guangzhou.

Greig says three more hotels are in the pipeline: Sheraton Huadu Resort, Aloft Guangzhou University Park and W Guangzhou.

Sheraton Guangzhou, the first Sheraton brand operating in the Guangzhou market, is the newest five star hotel located in Teem Mall, the premium shopping mall and Fortune 500 company office tower complex in the epicenter of the Guangzhou central business district.

Owned by GDH Limited, the hotel is designed to be a flagship Sheraton hotel. It includes all the five Sheraton signature experiences, that is Link@Sheraton, a comfortable place to work, play or simply relax with high-speed Internet access 24 hours, Shine Spa, SweetSleeper Bed, Sheraton Lounge and Sheraton Fitness.

The hotel boasts over 1,300 square meters of meeting space, and state-of-the-art audio and video facilities. It runs four restaurants and a bar, including authentic Cantonese dishes at the YUE Chinese Restaurant and regional home-style Italian fare at Bene Italian Kitchen.

Greig says: ""We tried to recruit as many local associates as we could to present local culture. The YUE restaurant, with its traditional Cantonese flavors, fits this market.

""You can feel the Cantonese style in our lobby. We put a feng shui art piece in the lobby, which features water, fire, metal, wood and earth (the five elements). Also, we use ancient gold coins' shape to decorate our window on the third floor.""

Greig recalls the exciting moment when the Real Madrid soccer team arrived as the hotel's first VIP group after it was opened in July.

""When Real Madrid was staying at our hotel, we needed to cope with both the team as well as the fans. For the team, we needed to make sure it had the appropriate food, as requested. They all had a comfortable stay in the hotel, which was not disturbed by fans.

""Also, we needed to make sure daily operations were on the right track. On the other hand, we needed to cope with the thousands of fans and ensure their safety in and outside the hotel,"" he says.

""During those days, although our team worked over 12 hours a day, we felt satisfied that the Real Madrid team gave the hotel a high recommendation and they all had a nice stay in Guangzhou.""

The Sheraton hotel chain includes more than 400 hotels in 72 countries and regions. It recently completed a $6 billion global revitalization and is now in the midst of a $5 billion global expansion over the coming three years.

Sheraton is owned by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc, one of the leading hotel and leisure companies in the world with 1,051 properties in 100 countries and regions with 145,000 employees at its owned and managed properties.
