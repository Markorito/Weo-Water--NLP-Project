More than 10,000 people who were displaced by the recent floods in Kasese District face starvation amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Kasese District Covid-19 taskforce is facing a hard time enforcing the Ministry of Health and Presidential directives aimed at stemming the spread of the pandemic in the 27 camps.

Kasese District was on May 7 and 22 hit by floods when five rivers; Lhubiriha, Mubuku, Nyamwamba, Nyamughasana and Sebwe burst their banks and affected communities in seventeen sub-counties as well as Bulembia and Nyamwamba Divisions in Kasese Municipality.

Speaking to Daily Monitor in an interview at the weekend, Mr Joshua Kisembo Masereka, the Kasese Deputy Resident District Commissioner, said the state of people living in camps scattered across various sub-counties is appalling.

“Those living in camps are traumatised and are faced with emotional and mental stress emanating from the losses they registered at an individual level,” he said.

The camps housing stranded people include; Kanyangeya, Nkaiga and Kiraro primary schools having the highest number of people concentrated in one place.

When *Daily Monitor *visited one of the camps at Kiraro Primary School, no one was seen wearing a facemask.\ Despite presence of a hand washing facility that the taskforce have improvised, no one was seen washing hands.

Mr Peter Mutooro, the camp chairperson, said they have failed to enforce the directives against Covid-19 because they are facing hunger.

""Because of Covid-19, we have started decongesting families to the nearby churches and schools so that they reduce on the numbers,"" said Mr Mutooro.

Ms Harriet Kabugho, who chairs the committee overseeing affairs for girls within the camp, said their rights as girls were being violated every day. She explained that five of her friends have been sexually harassed by the boys within the same camp.

""We do not have bathrooms, we use the same latrines and we might contract sexually transmitted diseases,"" Ms Kabugho said.

The coordinator for Centre for Gender Quality, a non-governmental organisation based in Kasese town, Ms Jolly Mbambu, advised that people who are living in camps need to be resettled.

""This will not be the first time government is resettling flood victims. It was properly done during the Bududa landslides saga,"" Ms Mbambu said.

Damage

A tentative impact assessment by the district disaster committee that was presented to the State Minister for Disaster Preparedness, Mr Musa Ecweru, in May indicates that a total of 123,800 people, most of them women and children from more than 24,760 households have been directly affected by the floods.

The most affected areas include Kilembe, Karambi, Bugoye, Maliba, Mpondwe Lhubiriha Town Council, Karusandara, Kyarumba, Mubuku Town Council and the three divisions of Kasese Municipality.",2020-06-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['living', 'town', 'starvation', 'mr', 'victims', 'district', 'covid19', '10000', 'kasese', 'affected', 'camps', 'uganda', 'ms', 'washing', 'face', 'flood']",Uganda,news article,English
53,DR-2014-000109-CHN,'Coke didn't treat Nestea like tea!' Nestle Waters boss suggests soda giant had half-hearted approach - BeverageDaily.com,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2014/08/07/Coke-didn-t-treat-Nestea-like-tea!-Nestle-Waters-CEO-on-brand-rebirth,"Euromonitor senior beverages analyst Hope Lee wrote in a company blog post Monday that despite Nestea’s global status, “it appears to be a neglected brand, lost in Nestle’s vast portfolio”.​

The brand was withdrawn from China in May this year and was subject to a further US sales decline in 2013 – where it faces tough competition from Lipton and Arizona.

Although Nestle took back production and distribution from Coca-Cola this year, Lee warned that “when an FMCG brand does not shine in both the US and China, it is at risk of losing its important to its parent company”.​

“From an overall soft drinks perspective, Nestle has no specific plan as to how to revitalise Nestea although its Nestea Zero variant appears to be doing well in Canada, its largest market,”​ she said.

‘We can compete aggressively against Coke and Pepsi’​

However, at a June 4 investor seminar not previously reported, Nestle Waters USA boss Tim Brown (below) described tea as a form of flavored water and insisted: “Tea is our great opportunity in flavored water”.​

“The first thing we’re going to do that Coke didn’t do is treat Nestea like tea,”​ he said. “Coke managed Nestea as a line extension of soft drinks. And if you look at the taste profiles, calories, etc., it really wasn’t much of a tea drink.""​

“We reformulated this year and took 40% of the calories out, and we have taste preference of 70:30 versus our closest competitor. We’ve also changed the packaging, graphics, and advertising,”​ Brown added.

“Traditionally, as we drove water against both Coke and Pepsi, we think we can bring tea with our route to market and compete aggressively against them. I don’t think that Coke in the US had a lot of heart for the brand, and the results showed in the past few years. We’re going to put a lot into it and we’re very optimistic.”​

Brown said Nestle was seeing “extremely strong growth in Nestea this year”​ and has big plans to grow it in the future, ""given the brands synergies with its system from a production and route to market standpoint”.​

Nestle H1 2014 results see profits down​

More broadly, Brown said Nestle Waters plans to premiumise its high volume, low-margin waters business, building a single-serve portfolio with RTD teas (Nestea), sparkling fruit beverages (Poland Spring) and imported waters (San Pellegrino, Perrier).

Today the world’s largest food company reported sales of CHF 42.981bn ($47.33bn) up 4.7% in organic terms, but net profit fell from CHF 5.1bn to CHF 4.6bn. CEO Paul Bulcke hailed “solid, broad-based organic growth and pricing in what is still a very volatile pricing environment”.​

Nestle reported sales of CHF €3.7bn for Nestle Waters business alone with 6.1% organic growth and a 10.4% operating profit margin (+0.8%) due to ‘leveraging growth’ and cost cuts.

No.1 global bottled water brand Nestle Pure Life drove growth in emerging markets such as China, Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan, while in developed markets regional brands grew – Levissima in Italy, Buxton in the UK, Hepar in France and US mega brand Poland Spring and Deer Park in the US.

“Specifically in North America we saw an acceleration of our growth versus last year – it was driven mainly by strong volume across US retail thanks to our regional spring waters and our international brands Perrier and San Pellegrino,”​ Nestle CFO Wan Ling Martello told analysts this morning.",2014-08-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['spring', 'waters', 'halfhearted', 'nestea', 'growth', 'didnt', 'giant', 'brand', 'suggests', 'treat', 'chf', 'water', 'coke', 'soda', 'nestle', 'tea']",China,news article,English

A severe drought hit the Horn of Africa in 2011. Credit: Oli Scarff/Getty Images

The Horn of Africa is growing drier, threatening food security for millions of people — and this change is driven by global warming, according to an analysis published on 9 October in Science Advances1. The finding casts doubt on projections suggesting that the region will become wetter as global temperatures rise.

Jessica Tierney, a molecular palaeoclimatologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and her colleagues extracted regional temperature and precipitation records from deep-sea sediment cores drilled from the Arabian Sea. They show that twentieth-century drying in the region is unusual in the context of nearly 2,000 years of rainfall, and that it is linked with recent warming trends.

“You have to conclude there has been an anthropogenic contribution to the decline in rainfall,” says Chris Funk, a research geographer at the University of California, Santa Barbara. That contradicts prior studies2 that have associated the drying trend with the natural variability of Pacific Ocean surface temperatures.

Pirates at sea

Understanding past climate change in the Horn of Africa is difficult. Instrumental records and natural records of climate are rare — there are no permanent lake basins and scarcely any trees in the area.

So to reconstruct these historical patterns, co-author Peter deMenocal, a palaeoclimatologist at the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York, sailed with a team to the Gulf of Aden. The team drilled into the sea floor and collected cores from a depth of 869 metres.

The journey was perilous. The team embarked in early 2001, just before piracy, terrorism and political unrest made the region dangerous for scientific work. The ship operated without radio, lights or radar along the coast of Somalia and Yemen, and received updates on pirate attacks by fax.

Winds transport large quantities of dust from the region into the gulf, depositing about 32 centimetres of sediment every 1,000 years. Tiny fossilized organisms and other material trapped in these layers provide a detailed account of past climates, allowing researchers to reconstruct conditions in five-year increments from 1850 t​o ​​2000, and every 10 years prior to 1850. “It’s an enormously high sedimentation rate. A lot of mud per unit time gives great records,” says deMenocal.

Leaf history

Back in the lab, Tierney deciphered changes in the region’s temperature and rainfall from ad 100 to 2000. To reconstruct past sea-surface temperatures, she and her colleagues looked to tiny marine microorganisms — types of archaea — that alter the chemical structure of their membranes as the water temperatures cool or warm.

The team deduced information about aridity using the chemical composition of leaf waxes from terrestrial plants, which mix with dust and become trapped in sediment. “Plants are kind of a rain gauge. The waxes that they make record drought stress on land,” says Tierney.

Rain that falls during dry periods is rich in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. Leaf waxes that contain higher levels of deuterium thus signal dry spells.

Tierney found that deuterium levels decreased during the Little Ice Age (1450–1800), the wettest period of the past 2,000 years in the region. But they rose sharply during the twentieth century, in step with local sea-surface temperatures — a sign of aridity. “It has been this dry before, but the rate of change is unusual,” says Tierney. Short bouts of dryness appear in the record around ad 700 and 900, but this aridity is more variable than the steady increase in dryness observed through the twentieth century.

“The relationship seems to have held up quite robustly,” says Funk.

Dry prospects

East Africa has experienced spring droughts in 8 of the past 16 years3, which have contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths and widespread food insecurity. Yet global climate models project a wetter East Africa by 2100.

The region has two rainy seasons, agriculturally important “long rains” from March to May, and “short rains” from September to November. Global climate models suggest that the short rains will become more intense as an atmospheric pattern over the Indian and Pacific oceans, called the Walker circulation, becomes weaker in response to global warming.

But these models have overestimated the impact of the Walker circulation on the short rains and underestimate the changes during the long-rain season, says Tierney. Others say that the Walker circulation may become stronger.

For now, regional models and observations may do a better job of predicting the impact of global warming on rainfall in the region. One such modelling study projects increased aridity by mid-century, and the subsequent collapse of some of East Africa’s crop-growing seasons4.

“We can’t assume the Horn will get wetter — the palaeoclimate data certainly don’t suggest that,” says Tierney. “We need to work harder to understand what the long rains are going to do.”

1022,FL-2016-000114-EGY,More than a million people in India flood relief camps - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/more-than-a-million-people-in-india-flood-relief-camps/,"More than one million people have packed relief camps to escape devastating monsoon floods that have killed more than 410 people in India’s southwestern state of Kerala, officials said Tuesday.

About 50,000 homes have been destroyed, according to one Kerala legislator, and people are flocking to the camps as the scale of the desolation is revealed by receding waters.

A total of 1,028,000 people were now recorded in about 3,200 relief camps across the state, a state government spokesman told AFP.

Six more bodies were found Monday, he added, taking the toll to more than 410 since the monsoon started in June.

At Chengannur, one of the worst-hit towns, more than 60 centimetres (two feet) of water still blocked many roads as more rain fell Tuesday.

Army teams said several thousand people in the town remained in homes inundated by 10 days of torrential downpours that have battered the state.

Rescue teams in Chengannur on Tuesday finally reached the house of retired army officer K.G. Pillai, who said up to 2.4 metres (eight feet) of water had engulfed the house where his family had lived since 1952.

“In the past there has never been more than one foot of floods and people are not used to this,” he said.

Many roads and homes around Pillai’s house remained inaccessible.

“Around 26 people moved into the first floor of our home” to take refuge from the floods, he said.

A senior army officer involved in the rescue operation in Chengannur said authorities believed most of the people left in town did not want to be evacuated and were instead seeking food and water.

“We received a distress call late yesterday to rescue a disabled child and will be going in today on boats to check if there are others who need assistance,” he said.

Relief efforts

Thousands of army, navy and air force personnel have fanned out across the state to help those stranded in remote and hilly areas.

Dozens of helicopters and even drones have been dropping food, medicine and water to cut-off villages.

Tens of thousands of people in Chengannur and surrounding towns and villages are relying on community kitchens for meals, after water from hilly districts in Kerala’s north poured down into lowland regions.

“People have lost all or most of their belongings in the last few days,” the officer said.

Shashi Tharoor, a deputy from Kerala and former UN official, estimated that 50,000 houses had been destroyed. He said he would seek possible UN assistance in relief efforts during a trip to Geneva this week.

Millions of dollars in donations have poured into the state from the rest of India and abroad since the extent of the devastation became known.

231,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Indonesia's historic shift to an urban economy - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/indonesias-historic-shift-to-an-urban-economy/a-19345723,"Indonesia is experiencing a major and rapid structural change, from a predominantly rural and farm-based economy to an urban services-based economy, concluded a recent World Bank report titled Indonesia's Urban Story.

Cities in Indonesia are expanding at a rate of 4.1 percent per year, the report stated. It also estimated that by 2025, in less than 10 years, about 68 percent of the Southeast Asian nation's population would be living in urban areas.

The country's urbanization is among the fastest in the world, with the size of its urban land increasing by around 1,100 square kilometers between 2000 and 2010 – second only to China.

Urbanization, many economists argue, promotes economic growth and boosts incomes. ""Cities increase formal employment and productivity - these gains can strengthen Indonesia's ability to generate and share prosperity,"" said the WB study.

However, such masses of people moving from villages to cities present not only opportunities but also a multitude of challenges such as growing congestion and worsening pollution levels.

Infrastructure deficit

A deficit in urban infrastructure is constraining Indonesia's cities, the report noted. ""The quality of urban infrastructure is poor in Indonesia, and access to basic services, such as clean water, sanitation, electricity and transportation, has remained generally limited and not well distributed.""

The study revealed that only 48 percent of urban households now have access to safe water, compared to 50 percent over a decade ago. Meanwhile, sewerage coverage exists in just 11 of the nation's 98 cities and only two percent of city dwellers have access to centralized sanitation systems.

Indonesia has a severe infrastructure problem and the cities are already stretched, says Paul Rowland, a Jakarta-based independent political analyst.

""Housing is already at a premium as land prices have skyrocketed in the past decade and government cannot keep up with the demand for housing in what are already some of the world's most densely populated urban areas,"" he told DW.

""Urban sprawl and unregulated development in the suburban areas of Jakarta and Bandung have also resulted in landslides and more downstream flooding,"" Rowland added.

Underinvestment

The country's weak urban infrastructure is an outcome of decades of underinvestment, experts say, stressing that insufficient investments leave many communities vulnerable to poverty.

While Indonesia's economy expanded by an average of 5.8 percent in the mid to late 2000s, its infrastructure stock rose by just three percent. In contrast, China's spending on infrastructure over the past decade amounted to around 10 percent of its economic output.

""The lack of infrastructure capital is clearly a major constraint, especially in large metropolitan cities, which are stagnating while small cities lack in their delivery of basic services,"" says Sumedh Deorukhkar, Asia economist at BBVA Research.

Recognizing the need to respond to the nation's infrastructure deficit, the Indonesian government has ramped up its spending in recent months.

""The government over the past year has announced a spate of measures aimed at enhancing consumer purchasing power as well as boosting investment activity and industrial competitiveness,"" Deorukhkar noted.

Managing the process

But despite the acceleration in infrastructure spending, Indonesia still needs to plan and implement major medium-term urban infrastructure development to cope with the rapid increase in projected urban populations, says Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific Chief Economist at IHS Global Insight.

This will require sustained medium-term infrastructure development for urban water supply and sanitation, affordable housing, power generation, ports, airports and urban public transportation systems, he told DW. ""The development of modern smart city infrastructure and building of advanced urban townships will help to accelerate industrial development and inward foreign investment by multinationals.""

This is particularly important to deal with the challenge of promoting industrialization and creating enough jobs in urban areas to absorb the fast-growing numbers of workers.

If Indonesia is successful in industrializing its economy and boosting industrial output for both the fast-growing domestic consumer market and for exports, this will result in strong migration flows of rural workers into cities, Biswas said. ""Indonesia's future industrialization and urbanization will occur in tandem.""

A failure to effectively plan and manage the process of urbanization would lead to tremendous economic and social troubles, warn experts. The problems include sprawling urban slums, high rates of unemployment, poverty and crime.

Political impact

Besides decrepit infrastructure, issues related to land acquisition, access to formal credit facilities and rigid labor laws also dampen the positive impact generated from urbanization, analyst Deorukhkar said.

Rowland believes increasing urbanization has had an impact on politics in the country's urban areas. He says, in the past few years, voters have elected reformers to head Indonesia's three largest cities and they are making a difference by improving services and beginning to tackle longstanding issues like traffic, flooding and pollution.

""With increasing urbanization, it is to be hoped that the identity and crony politics of the past will begin to lose sway.""",2016-06-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['areas', 'indonesias', 'urbanization', 'urban', 'indonesia', 'cities', 'economy', 'shift', 'past', 'historic', 'development', 'infrastructure']",India,news article,English

CAIRO - 11 September 2019: Today marks the Egyptian year 6261, the beginning of the first Egyptian and international calendar in human history.



A solar calendar developed by the ancient Egyptians to divide the year into 13 months. It depends on the sun cycle. The Egyptian calendar is one of the first calendars known to mankind.



The ancient Egyptians then discovered the lunar year and divided it for seasons, months, days and hours. They were able to distinguish between a simple year and a leap, an astronomical miracle at the time.



The Coptic calendar, or the ""Martyrs' Calendar,"" relies mainly on the ancient Egyptian calendar. It is called the solar calendar. It is an arithmetic system the ancient Egyptians established for the division of the year. The year they created consists of 13 months.



The calendar was calculated based on the sun cycle, and is one of the first calendars known to mankind and the most accurate in terms of climate conditions and agriculture during the year, where the Egyptian farmer has been relying on it to determine the seasons of agriculture and crop yielding for thousands of years.



The Egyptian calendar contributed to the development of different calendars of ancient civilizations, whether they were solar or lunar. Although thousands of years have passed since the beginning of the ancient Egyptian calendar, which relied on the Nile flood in determining the beginning of the year, it is also the current calendar that regulates agriculture in Egypt in modern times.



The researchers believe that the Egyptian calendar was founded by the ancient Egyptians and the calculations are conducted according to the rotation of the sun, dividing the year into thirteen months.



Despite the series of changes that have affected it later, it is the most accurate calendar so far because of the weather conditions as well as the different seasons of agriculture.



According to the Egyptian researcher Joseph Mamdouh Tawfik, the ancient Egyptian calendar is highly accurate and was a miracle of its time. However, it is not exactly in line with the current Gregorian calendar used around the world.

958,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Mozambique: Humanitarian Dashboard (30 November 2016) - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-humanitarian-dashboard-30-november-2016,"Situation Overview

The current response plan provides food assistance for approximately 1.2 million people across all seven drought-affected provinces from October 2016 through March 2017. The total funds received as of the end of November for drought response amount to US$ 121 million out of US$ 179,1 million required to ensure assistance till March 2017, leaving a funding gap of 32%. Furthermore, the revised strategic response plan (SRP) includes a flood component estimated to cost US$ 32 million to respond possible related emergency according to the contingency plan 2016/2017 scenarios.

Land preparation and planting are underway in southern and central areas where normal to above-normal rainfall is expected. Green food will become available in the South in February, followed by the harvest in March. To this end it is crucial to accelerate the seeds distribution to affected population pereferably by end of December 2016. According to the Crop and Early Warning Unit (DCAP) from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA), as of mid-October, land preparation in the southern region has reached 70 percent of the total planned area, while in the central and northern regions land preparation had reached 50 percent of the total planned area.

The Government of Mozambique, together with the food security cluster members, provided seeds to drought-affected households beginning of August. Additional distributions are planned to be held in December providing access to seeds, hence, good prospects for the agricultural season. The extent to which the informal seed network will meet farmer’s needs is undetermined.Moreover, FEWS NET estimates that between October and December, nearly 1.8 million people will likely face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. Needs may peak at nearly 2.3 million by the end of March 2017, including potentially flood-affected persons. Volumes of staple foods and commodities are adequately supplied in most monitored markets although the food prices are still relatively high. CHEMO is piloting electronic voucher for food assistance targeting 13,007 households in Tete and Sofala provinces with e-vouchers. To date, 10,378 households have been registered and the problems encountered with the roll-out of e-vouchers include few certified vendors, the illiteracy of the beneficiaries and the poor road network (especially during the rainy season).

The general level of acute malnutrition will likely deteriorate slightly during the lean period, and in some drought-affected areas, global acute malnutrition (GAM) prevalence may go above 10 percent through the end of February 2017. Other factors that could impact GAM prevalence include the possibility of flooding and displacement due to conflict, which could disrupt access to health services. The increased incidence of seasonal diseases, such as diarrhea and malaria, overall poor access to water and sanitation, and low nutrition rehabilitation program coverage also impact people’s vulnerability.

The negative impacts of the ongoing political-military tension are affecting efforts to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to those in need in affected areas. The government recognizes that 2,938 persons have been displaced in Manica and are being accommodated in camps. From 28.11-04.12 it was carried out a joint assessment (Government and HCT) to Manica province to understand what the needs are and the HCT is at the moment developing a response plan to assist the IDPs.

Recent rainfall has not improved either surface or groundwater availability. In all river basins, water levels remain below alert levels. The Pequenos Limbobos dam is at 15% of storage capacity. The water authorities (ARA Sul) are considering limiting the use of water for irrigation so as to ensure the domestic water supplies of Maputo, Matola and Boane municipalities.",2016-11-30 08:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'response', 'plan', 'humanitarian', 'seeds', 'end', '30', 'assistance', 'food', 'dashboard', 'million', 'total', '2017', '2016', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English

Father Varghese Velickakam, convener of a network of voluntary agencies called the Inter-Agency Group, said it was coordinating the state’s relief efforts with those of national and international agencies.

Assam’s Health Services Department has also been asked to address urgent medical issues arising from the floods.

Father Velickakam said the Church’s social service group, Caritas India, had begun planning through its diocesan units to ensure the immediate supply of drinkable water aside from other immediate and long-term assistance in the provision of food and life essentials.

“There is a dire need for temporary shelters with basic sanitation facilities for those on embankments and roadsides,” the priest said. “We are also planning to take concrete measures to protect vulnerable groups, particularly children and women, who are taking shelter in camps and other safe places.”

Allen Brooks, spokesman of the Assam Christian Forum, told ucanews.com that Catholic bishops in all 14 dioceses of Assam had instructed parishes to open their institutions such as schools and hostels to shelter and help the flood victims.

“Church groups are also offering voluntary work to district officials so that we can work in tandem with the state and help in all possible ways,” Brooks said.

Kaziranga National Park, which hosts two-thirds of the world’s great one-horned rhinoceroses, has been marooned and 17 animals have died, according to initial reports.

The Assam state government says 15 National Disaster Response Force teams comprising 380 personnel have been deployed to rescue people from flood-affected areas.

Floods have become an annual feature in Assam, the largest of India’s northeastern states. Its topography and meteorological factors such as exposure to high rainfall make it prone to floods.

British charity Oxfam, in a detailed report on last year’s Assam floods, estimated that more than three million hectares of land in Assam was prone to floods, of which roughly one million hectares was directly affected every year.

The social, economic and ecological costs from successive floods are huge, says the report, added that Assam had already suffered irreversible land erosion.

“Since 1954, erosion of over 0.42 million hectares of land has happened, which is a whopping 7.1 percent of the state’s landmass,” the report said. “Southern Assam has borne the maximum brunt of erosion, which has swept away several villages and small towns.”",2019-07-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['groups', 'land', 'join', 'flood', 'states', 'hectares', 'state', 'northeastern', 'assam', 'help', 'floods', 'million', 'national', 'report', 'church', 'rush', 'victims']",India,news article,English

For many years, Rothschildâ??s giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) have lived on a peninsula in the lake. The lake's water levels had been slowly rising over time, but in 2020, torrential rains caused severe flooding, covering a stretch of the giraffesâ?? peninsula and turning the end into a muddy, shrinking island. Nine giraffes became stranded with limited resources available for survival. Planning the complex rescue mission took 15 months to coordinate and implement.

Now, the last two individualsâ??a mother and a calf, named Ngarikoni and Noelleâ??stuck on a remote part of the land mass have been safely transported to the mainland.

When the giraffes reached the shore, they galloped out onto the 4,400-acre Ruko Wildlife Sanctuary, where conservation groups involved in the project hope to support a growing population of the endangered subspecies.

When the giraffes first became stranded on the island, Ruko wildlife rangers began delivering food for them, per Gizmodo. But they soon realized the need for a more sustainable long-term solution. The flood became severe last year, damaging businesses and homes along the shore of the lake, and one giraffe, named Asiwa, became separated from the rest of herd when flooding bisected the island once again.

Convincing a 14-foot-tall animal to get on a boat is no small feat, however. First, the team needed to develop a vessel fit for the task. The result, a barge that is kept afloat by 60 empty drums, decked-out with reinforced walls and pulled by a motorboat, was named the â??GiRaft.â?

To guide the animals to the raft, the team first had to sedate them, and then quickly apply a reversal drug. (When a giraffe is tranquilized and falls to the ground, it is in danger of choking on its own saliva, or being harmed by a change of blood pressure to its brain.) During the brief period when a giraffe is sedated, the team covers its face with a blindfold and sets up guide ropes around its shoulders. Then when the giraffe is able to walk, the team guides it to the raft.

When the rescue brought Asiwa to the raft, â??she was incredible,â? said Oâ??Connor to CNNâ??s Ami Vitale in December. â??She's a very, very tough girl. â?¦ Once we got her onto a more open space where there was an established track, she just walked straight onto the barge. Sometimes it looked like someone was walking a puppy on a Sunday afternoon. It was amazing.â?

Rescue workers accompanied the GiRaft on its one-mile journey to shore by standing on the steel beams or boating alongside in kayaks and canoes.

As Mindy Weisberger reports for Live Science, the Rothschildâ??s giraffe has lost about 80 percent of its population in the last 30 years, making it one of the most imperiled giraffe subspecies. Out of a population of less than 3,000 animals, 800 live in Kenya. Now that the once-stranded giraffes are on the mainland, the conservation groups hope to relocate other giraffes of the same subspecies to the wildlife sanctuary to support a healthy, genetically diverse population.",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['lake', 'task', 'giraffe', 'population', 'shore', 'island', 'rescued', 'disappearing', 'team', 'kenya', 'named', 'giraffes', 'wildlife']",Kenya,news article,English

diplomatic enclave

ISLAMABAD - Sri Lankan national day was celebrated at a local hotel to mark the country’s 71st anniversary of the Independence in Islamabad.

The event was hosted by the high commissioner of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Srilanka Noordeen Mohamed Shaheid.

Sri Lankan national day, has been celebrated annually on 4th February to commemorate independence from British rule in 1948. Since then Sri Lanka is heading toward progress, development and is on the path of rapid economic growth.

A great number of people including ambassadors, diplomats, politicians, government official ,businessmen and civilians have attended the event.

Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Sahibzada Mehboob Sultan participated as the Chief Guest while Former Secretary Ministry of Foreign Affairs Jalil Abbas Jailani and Brig (R) Mohammad Bashir wali were the guests of honour.

The Ambassador of Turkmenistan and Dean of Diplomatic Corps Atadjan Movlamov, High Commissioner of Bangladesh Tarik Ahsan, The ambassador of Nepal , Sewa Lamsal, the ambassador of Afghanistan Shukrullah Atif Mashal , ambassador of Maldives Ahmed Saleem, Economic affair Director General, Ministry of Sri Lanka Saroja Sirisena, Rabel Sadozai, Honorary Consul designate in Peshawar Nazimjaved Khan, Honorary consul designate in Lahore RamatullahJ aved, Vice-president CGSS Major General (R) Hafiz Masroor Ahmed were also sitting on the stage.

The military personnel of Pakistan were also present on the occasion which depicts that Sri lanka gives value and respect to Pakistani capable and disciplined armed forces. The chief guest Mehboob sultan lit the lamp and started the event. National anthems of Pakistan and Sri Lanka were played and a cake was also cut by the notables.

The number of participants was great therefore, the hall and the corridor became insufficient to cater the guests which were invited at the reception .The high commissioner of sri lanka and his spouse were receiving the guests in a very gentle manner along with the military attaché and their spouses .

Cultural dances made the event more fascinating and mesmerising. The guests were amazed by the Performance of the Troupe who especially came all the way from Sri Lanka to perform on this auspicious occasion. The performances successfully portrayed Sri Lanka’s culture, traditions and lifestyle.

Sri Lankan classical dance is famous all around the world. There are three main styles of Sri Lanka dance which differ in their styles of body-movements, in the costumes worn by the performers and in the shape and size of the drums used to provide the rhythmic sound.

The Kandyan is the dance of the hill country. It is also known as Uda Rata Natum. The low country dances (Ruhunu ) of the southern plains is known as Pahatha Rata Natum , the third is Sabaragamuwa Natum. The main distinguishing feature between Kandyan and Saharagamu and Ruhunu is that Ruhunu dancers wear masks.

Raban dance is a very popular folk dance in Sri Lanka which is performed by using a specific drum known as “Raban. Performers of Wadigapatuna Dance from the Southern part of Sri Lanka highlighted the ritual known as ‘Suniam Maduwa’, seeking protection from the evil effects of adverse planetary positions. Other performances included MagulBera with Puja dance, Mask dance combination, Peacock dance (MayuraNatuma) and Kala and Pathuru folk dance.

Sahibzada Mehboob Sultan delivered a thought provoking speech in his speech extended sincerest wishes and warm felicitations to the Government and people of Sri Lanka on behalf of the Government of Pakistan. He said that Pakistan not only deeply appreciates but also values its brotherly relations with Sri Lanka that have been nurtured over decades and are characterised by the elements of cordiality, mutual support and common interests.

He further said that relationship with Sri Lanka has stood the test of time. Pakistan has always supported the Sri Lanka in testing times, be it drought or its war against terrorism, and Sri Lanka has also reciprocated the goodwill. He also recalled, Sri Lankan cricket team visit to Pakistan which led to the revival of Cricket on our home grounds. He said our people to people contacts materialised in the form of the love of cricket, educational scholarships, cultural exchanges and tourism.

He said that Pakistan hold Vesak Festival every year and hands over Holy relics from Taxila museum to Sri Lanka for exposition in Sri Lanka during the Vessk Festival. He invited the Sri Lankan people, majority having Buddhism as religious affiliation, to explore Pakistan – the home to Buddhist civilisation.

In educational sector, he said that Pakistan encourages Sri Lankan students to study in Pakistan and offered to develop a “Knowledge Corridor” for Sri Lankan students. Under corridor Pakistan would be offering 1,000 scholarships to students from Sri Lanka over a period of 5 years.

He further informed that the 5th round of Foreign Secretary-level bilateral political consultations was held in October 2017 and The 6th Round of bilateral political consultations is due and we look forward to holding it at an early date this year.

He said, we would also like to elevate trade and investment ties with Sri Lanka to an Optimum potential under the framework of bilateral Free Trade Agreement.

He admired that the resilience of the people of Sri Lankan in the face of challenges presented by nature as well as posed by other circumstances. We have always stood by our Sri Lankan friends and will“do so in the time to come, he added.

The relationship between Pakistan and Sri lanka is a based on mutual friendship and cooperation at the honour of need. Pakistan army has played a very vital role in making and maintaining this relationship. It is also worth mentioning that Sri Lanka was the first country in the world which had the free trade agreement with Pakistan.

The appointment of Noordeen Mohamed Shaheid as The High Commissioner to Pakistan is a new development in the Pakistan and Sri lankan ties as Noordeen Mohammed Shaheid is the first ever Muslim high commissioner who is being appointed to Pakistan by the Sri lankan Government .He is a modest man and the way he organised his first reception in Islamabad it shows his potential and abilities to further strengthen the relations. He is keen to involve the top business leaders to encourage the existing bilateral relations and is willing to make a difference in his tenure.

He made a short speech in which he said that Sri lanka and Pakistan are two brother in south Asia region and our relations are always very good and cordial. He said Sri Lanka held Pakistan in high esteem for its support in eliminating terrorism and strengthening other areas of cooperation. he also admired the services of former Foreign Secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani and zameer Akramfor timely providing assistance and supporting the resolution of Sri Lanka in United Nation Human rights Council.

A short video clip to elaborate the beauty and the significance of the worthy Island of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Srilanka were also played.

1535,FL-2021-000030-IDN,AI conferences use AI to assign papers to reviewers - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/ai-conferences-use-ai-assign-papers-reviewers,"AI conferences use AI to assign papers to reviewers

Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers are hoping to use the tools of their discipline to solve a growing problem: how to identify and choose reviewers who can knowledgeably vet the rising flood of papers submitted to large computer science conferences.

In most scientific fields, journals act as the main venues of peer review and publication, and editors have time to assign papers to appropriate reviewers using professional judgment. But in computer science, finding reviewers is often by necessity a more rushed affair: Most manuscripts are submitted all at once for annual conferences, leaving some organizers only a week or so to assign thousands of papers to a pool of thousands of reviewers.

This system is under strain: In the past 5 years, submissions to large AI conferences have more than quadrupled, leaving organizers scrambling to keep up. One example of the workload crush: The annual AI Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)—the discipline’s largest—received more than 9000 submissions for its December 2020 event, 40% more than the previous year. Organizers had to assign 31,000 reviews to about 7000 reviewers. “It is extremely tiring and stressful,” says Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, general chair of this year’s NeurIPS. “A board member called this a herculean effort, and it really is!”

Fortunately, they had help from AI. Organizers used existing software, called the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS), to help assign papers to reviewers. TPMS, which is also used at other conferences, calculates the affinity between submitted papers and reviewers’ expertise by comparing the text in submissions and reviewers’ papers. The sifting is part of a matching system in which reviewers also bid on papers they want to review.

But newer AI software could improve on that approach. One newer affinity-measuring system, developed by the paper-reviewing platform OpenReview, uses a neural network—a machine learning algorithm inspired by the brain’s wiring—to analyze paper titles and abstracts, creating a richer representation of their content. Several computer science conferences, including NeurIPS, will begin to use it this year in combination with TPMS, say Melisa Bok and Haw-Shiuan Chang, computer scientists at OpenReview and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

AI conference organizers hope that by improving the quality of the matches, they will improve the quality of the resulting peer reviews and the conferences’ published literature. A 2014 study suggests there’s room for progress: As a test, 10% of papers submitted to NeurIPS that year were reviewed by two sets of reviewers. Of papers accepted by one group, the other group accepted only 57%. Many factors could explain the discrepancy, but one possibility is that at least one panel for each paper lacked sufficient relevant expertise to evaluate it.

To promote good matches, Ivan Stelmakh, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, developed an algorithm called PeerReview4All. Typically, a matching system maximizes the average affinity between papers and reviewers, even if it means some papers get really well matched reviewers and others unfairly get poorly matched reviewers. PeerReview4All instead maximizes the quality of the least good match, with an eye toward avoiding poor matches and increasing fairness.

Last year, Stelmakh experimented with using PeerReview4All at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), and reported results in February at another, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) conference. The method improved fairness significantly without harming average match quality, he concluded. OpenReview has also begun to offer a system aimed at increasing fairness, called FairFlow. NeurIPS will try at least one of these this year, says Alina Beygelzimer, a computer scientist at Yahoo and the NeurIPS 2021 senior program chair. “NeurIPS has a long history of experimentation.”

These systems all match a known set of papers to a known set of reviewers. But as the field grows, it will need to recruit, evaluate, and train new reviewers, conference organizers say. A recent experiment led by Stelmakh explored one way, which did not rely on AI, to ease those tasks. At last year’s ICML, he and collaborators used emails and word of mouth to invite students and recent graduates to review unpublished papers collected from colleagues; 134 agreed. Based on evaluations of those reviews, the team invited 52 to join the ICML reviewer pool and assigned them a senior researcher who acted as a mentor. In the end, the novice’s ICML reviews were at least as good as those of seasoned reviewers, as judged by metareviewers, Stelmakh reported at the AAAI meeting. He says organizers could potentially scale up the process to recruit hundreds of reviewers without too much burden. “There was a lot of enthusiasm from candidate reviewers” who participated in the experiment, Stelmakh says.

Matching systems that use affinity to measure reviewer expertise also let prospective reviewers bid on papers to review, and some recent work has attempted to address potential bias in this approach. Researchers have heard tales of bidders picking only their friends’ papers, essentially hacking the algorithm. A preprint posted on the arXiv server in February describes a countermeasure that uses machine learning to filter out suspicious bids. On a simulated data set, it reduced manipulation–even when potential cheaters knew how the system operated—without reducing match quality. Another algorithm, presented at NeurIPS last year, limits any one reviewer’s chance of being assigned a manuscript by enough to make it unlikely that multiple friends of an author bidding on it will all be assigned; researchers demonstrated the method’s effectiveness in reducing manipulation using a combination of simulated bids and real data from a previous conference.

One problem with the tools is that it’s difficult to evaluate how much they outperform alternative methods in real-world settings. Hard evidence would require controlled trials, but there have been none, says Laurent Charlin, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal. In part, that’s because many of these tools are new.

As they evolve, methods like these could also one day help journal editors outside computer science find peer reviewers—but so far uptake has been limited, says Charlin, who led the development of the TPMS affinity-measuring tool about 10 years ago. (Meagan Phelan, a spokesperson for AAAS, which publishes the Science family of journals, says they do not use AI in assigning peer reviewers.)

But in AI, Charlin says, “We are quite comfortable as a field with some level of automation. We have no reason not to use our own tools.”

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Vietnam and local peoples generosity. Luu Thi Phuong , 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children, she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.I give my thanks to the UNDP , the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDPs 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam, she said.However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last years floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life, he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, ( Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households, said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing. At least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or collapsed./.",2021-05-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'receive', 'storms', 'nam', 'quang', 'residents', 'undp', 'nams', 'central', 'support', 'house', 'houses', 'safe']",Vietnam,news article,English

I had an uncle who studied dendrochronology – tree rings, basically. It wasn't until years after he died that it occurred to me how much his perspective on living, and on dying, seemed to have been shaped by years of handling such palpable evidence of time passing. Not the spectacle of canyons carved by glaciers or the eye-popping surprise of fossilized bones, but the way each tree out of millions had been marked by each year out of millions. You could look at the rings and tell when the climate was good, when there was a drought, when there was a fire. Even if the outside of a tree was unremarkable, inside was its whole life, constructed bit by bit.

Richard Linklater's Boyhood persuasively argues that we're pretty much the same way. We are not built in a series of climactic and closely attended spectacles, but layer by layer, bit by bit, each year or even each day wrapping around the last one.

Despite its simplicity, it's an extraordinarily difficult idea for film to capture, because by its nature, film is compressed. Individual scenes often stand for more than themselves, but films tend to find people at inflection points, so that they tell stories in the manner of following the path of a stream by hopping from stone to stone. Linklater's film is more like walking right through water up to your knees. People eat, talk, take pictures, laugh, get angry, screw up. They change, they don't change, they start things, they end things. People come and go, gain and lose weight, grow and cut their hair.

Boyhood has gotten a lot of attention for how it was filmed: over 12 years, with the same actors – including Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and the remarkable Ellar Coltrane – returning each year to film a piece of the story of Mason (Coltrane), who grows up from 5 to 18 with his steady but struggling single mother (Arquette), his flaky and sometimes present father (Hawke), and an older sister (Lorelai Linklater). While it's certainly fun to watch over the film's nearly three-hour running time as Mason grows from a big-eyed little boy to a shaggy kid to a skinny adolescent to a magnetic college student, if that were the point of the movie, it would be selling a sensation that television has offered for decades. You can see children grow into adults on an all-day marathon of Little House On The Prairie, or by looking up the right clips from General Hospital.

It's not the method itself, but the purpose to which it's being put, that matters. There is no turn in the movie, no sudden tragedy or massive surprise that abruptly assigns meaning to the small moments that came before. It's not a sealed system where every setup has a payoff. These pieces of this family's life are there for their own sake, specifically because as Mason finally steps into adulthood, it is as the sum of all those small things, which in the aggregate take up more space on film and in his life than the few outbreaks of overt drama. In fact, the film opens with a shot of Mason lying on his back and looking up at the sky, and later, there's a shot of another boy his age lying in almost exactly the same pose. It's a jarring reminder that this story is not being told because there is only one that is anything like it. It is being told because it's one story out of millions, and all these kids are growing, bit by bit.

The film is far from unplotted or aimless; Linklater is constructing this narrative to get at elusive aspects of the one story that just about everyone experiences, albeit in hugely different ways. This is how we, as children, grow up. This is how we, as adults, help build kids: layer by layer, each day over the next, leaving them with marks of good years and bad years, droughts and fires. That's its purpose: to represent on film the basic mechanism of constructing new humans.

Linklater has always had a curiosity about the parts of life that happen in between the scenes that often show up in movies – he's always been a mortar guy more than a brick guy. While the Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight movies, for example, eventually became a long story about a real relationship, Before Sunrise itself was literally about what happens on the way from one place to another.

The same is true of his approach to looking at childhood. There are moments in Boyhood in which you know that the adults in Mason's life aren't paying all that much attention to what's happening, when perhaps they don't think there's much going on at all. But you look at him, and he is slowing everything down in his mind. He's studying, being taught at the moments when they're not trying to teach him.

And even when they are trying to teach him – as in a charming and funny scene when Mason's dad tries to give a self-consciously un-self-conscious lesson in birth control – his eyes are bright and focused, sizing up his father, learning something, but not necessarily what's meant. We know intellectually that this happens, and it's been repeated in proverbs and by Stephen Sondheim, but kids really do pay attention to everything — that's the terrifying and awe-inspiring thing about them. Mason's attention animates his entire story: more often than not, the big changes in his life are signaled not by their actual arrival but by a shot of him at the moment when he sees them approaching.

It's a movie that gets so many tiny things right: the way Olivia's frustration with her kids' unreliable dad gives way over time to a patient, resigned sense that he could be worse, the way patterns repeat even for people consciously straining to break out of them, the way the kids forgive and forgive and forgive the shortcomings of their parents and only get angry when they forget to anticipate disappointment and it finds them anyway. People you'd like to be able to help, you can't. People you promise to see again, you don't. And those seemingly petty veracities are what make the big things matter. Most of the major life events in the story – breakups, births, hookups – happen offscreen. Mason's mom, Olivia, is having a remarkable and complex life over these 12 years that we only see in bits, and Arquette's performance often has to suggest her exhaustion over breakfast or convey the pain she feels in the moments when she's most trying to skip over it with her kids.

There's a stubborn and fair ambiguity to the portrayal of these parents whose life's work, in a sense, makes up the bulk of the film. They are neither great parents nor disastrous parents, but they are parents who successfully produce a couple of functional, thoughtful adults. Mason is, in the end, the sum of all that work, plus his own tendency to grow in unexpected directions, plus the influences his parents couldn't control. He's not a new person and not a completed person; he's a person who carries evidence of a childhood not graded on performance but marked with growth by the day and year in changing climates. And in the film's last shot, he's still wrapping new days around the old ones.",2014-08-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['rings', 'tree', 'things', 'life', 'shot', 'way', 'boyhood', 'parents', 'mason', 'kids', 'film', 'hes']",China,news article,English
1218,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"Poor flood-risk maps, or none at all, are keeping Canadian communities in flood-prone areas - The Globe and Mail",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-poor-flood-risk-maps-or-none-at-all-are-keeping-canadian-communities/,"Open this photo in gallery Tim Coochey indicates the height of the floodwaters that damaged the basement of his Montreal-area home. Mr. Coochey's was one of the many homes damaged during the flooding of May, 2017. Dario Ayala/The Globe and Mail

Tim Coochey had no idea how much water was coming his way. As the St. Lawrence River swelled in May, 2017, the resident of the Montreal borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro assumed the home he’d bought a quarter-century earlier was safe; after all, the river was more than 250 metres away, and the neighbourhood’s drainage infrastructure had been upgraded considerably since the last notable flooding, in the 1970s.

But as the river rose, storm sewers began working in reverse. His street flooded. Mr. Coochey watched in shock as his driveway, which slopes toward his house, filled with water in a matter of minutes and spilled over the makeshift barricade in front of the garage door. He told his family to abandon the house.

“I didn’t even know it was a flood zone,” Mr. Coochey said. “Only now am I finding out that my particular street was basically swamp, which they backfilled. And then they built houses on it.”

Those floods could have played out differently had Mr. Coochey, his neighbours and their civic officials better understood the situation with the help of flood-risk maps.

Flood maps – cartographic depictions of areas that are likely to flood under certain conditions – are invaluable sources of information for homeowners and civic officials. In the United States, England and France, one can enter a postal code into a government website and quickly assess a property’s susceptibility to flooding. Had Mr. Coochey possessed such information, he could have taken steps to protect his property – or never purchased the home in the first place. Various studies have determined that every dollar spent on flood prevention is worth many times that amount in property replacement costs.

Yet the vast majority of Canadians do not have easy access to such maps. Partly due to government cutbacks – and the reluctance of municipalities to discourage development – all too often the best many homeowners can do is visit a local government office and dust off a decades-old relic intended for engineers or hydrologists.

Professor Jason Thistlethwaite and colleagues at the University of Waterloo recently completed a study of almost 700 Canadian flood maps. “The results are not impressive,” he said. Many were old, few had been digitized and most were not publicly accessible.

And for as many as a third of Canadians living in flood-prone areas, there are no flood maps to consult. Mr. Coochey is one of them. The Globe and Mail asked his municipal government for flood maps of his neighbourhood. The municipality said such a request would “disrupt the flow of work of the borough office,” but promised to respond within a month. When it did respond, two months later, it said it didn’t have any such maps.

Little wonder, then, that rising floodwaters catch so many Canadians off guard. According to a 2016 estimate by analytics firm LexisNexis Risk Solutions, there are 8.6 million residential addresses in Canada. More than a fifth of those – 1.8 million – are susceptible to flooding. By another estimate, as much as 10 per cent of Canada’s population lives in high-risk flood zones. However alarming that may seem, the bigger problem is that nearly all of those at risk don’t know it. A 2017 survey of 2,300 homeowners by the University of Waterloo found that just 6 per cent of respondents realized they lived in designated flood-risk areas.

That ignorance often leads to bad decisions. Without flood maps, prospective home buyers may unwittingly purchase at-risk homes. And they may fail to take protective measures, such as installing sump pumps, regrading their properties or purchasing the right kind of insurance.

This week’s floods in Quebec and New Brunswick are the latest reminder of what happens when communities fail to account for the risks as they grow. Entire neighbourhoods may be developed in harm’s way, resulting in extensive damage and financial loss for homeowners, insurers and government disaster-assistance programs.

The federal government is well aware of the situation. “Canada lacks effective flood hazard maps, which are considered essential risk assessment tools,” according to a 2017 report published by Public Safety Canada. But remedying the situation would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and might take a decade. And few governments in Canada seem willing to accept the challenge.

A flood of forgetfulness

While maps cannot guarantee better flood management, they are a crucial start. Canada has largely forgotten how to draft them. The irony is that we were once considered a world leader.

In 1975, Environment Canada introduced the Flood Damage Reduction Program (FDRP). Organized as a series of deals between Ottawa and provincial and territorial governments, its cornerstone was producing flood-risk maps for urban areas. All provinces and territories participated except Prince Edward Island and Yukon.

Ottawa’s motives were not entirely altruistic. A few years earlier it had introduced the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements, a cost-sharing program with provinces for mopping up after natural disasters. The scheme had been stung by a series of costly flood claims. Ottawa’s goal with the new program was to wash its hands of people who insisted on building in high-risk areas. In the hopes that they would inform better land-use planning, the new maps were to be widely disseminated.

By most accounts, the effort paid off. A report by the Government of Saskatchewan found that participating communities such as Regina and the town of Lumsden, in the Qu’Appelle River valley, had used that information to take a variety of flood-prevention measures, from diking to regulating land use in floodplains, that “greatly aided” them later. Had Lumsden not constructed its dikes in the late 1970s, the report estimated, it would have suffered $140-million in property damage during the serious floods of 2011; instead, it suffered “minimum” damage.

The FDRP wasn’t an unqualified success. Some communities continued making bad decisions; one study found that development continued in defined floodplain areas in Montreal, for instance. “The information may have been there, but there was no teeth or enforcement,” Prof. Thistlethwaite said.

Nonetheless, almost 1,000 communities were mapped and their floodplains identified. One 1995 assessment published in the Canadian Water Resources Journal concluded the FDRP had been “extremely successful in identifying urban flood risk areas across Canada and in redirecting damage-prone development away from flood risk areas.”

So highly regarded was the program, University of Western Ontario geography professor Dan Shrubsole said, that countries in Europe and the Caribbean requested Environment Canada’s assistance in mapping their own floodplains.

But then the FDRP fell victim to budget cuts, and the federal government eventually cancelled it in 1996. Provinces were left to their own devices. Wealthier provinces, including Alberta and Ontario, continued mapping, albeit no longer to common standards. Activity in the Maritimes, meanwhile, ceased almost completely.

Today, Canada is among a minority of members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that lack a national floodplain mapping program. Many communities continue to rely on FDRP-era maps. MMM Group, a consultancy hired a few years ago to assess the situation, found that half the maps still in use are between 18 and 40 years old.

Considered cutting-edge in their day, the FDRP maps have not aged well. Most of them feature a single line delineating the area affected by a specified regulatory flood level. (Actual flooding risk is, of course, more nuanced.) And many maps were of such coarse resolution that they are of little use to property owners seeking to understand the risk of flooding on their properties.

An even bigger problem is that many of Canada’s flood maps have outlived their usefulness. With a changing climate, relying on decades-old data and assumptions about rainfall and storm surge is a dangerous proposition. Changing landscapes must also be taken into account. When loggers, wildfires or pine beetles destroy large swaths of forest, more water tends to run off into rivers more quickly. Meanwhile, far away from watercourses, increased development and the destruction of wetlands can fundamentally alter where water goes after heavy rainfalls.

Blind in British Columbia

Neil Peters, a water resource engineer, witnessed Canada’s increasing blindness to flood risks. When he was hired by the B.C. government in 1987, the province had already paid for dozens of flood maps out of pocket and had about 45 people working full time on flood management. It joined the FDRP and mapped a total of 89 areas prior to its cancellation.

But British Columbia’s flood-mapping expertise was already in gradual decline. After the FDRP’s demise, the province downloaded most of the responsibility for flood mapping and management to municipalities, including decisions regarding development on floodplains. Tamsin Lyle, principal at Ebbwater Consulting, said the province henceforth contributed very little funding or expertise to flood-mapping efforts. “The municipal governments were pretty much left on their own,” she said.

The problem is that municipalities have powerful disincentives for regulating floodplain development. After all, they rely on property taxes for revenue and face “a lot of pressure from developers and others to promote development of the city,” said John Pomeroy, a geography professor at the University of Saskatchewan. “And where do people want to live? Humans want to be on the water.”

What’s more, floodplain maps are costly to produce; according to a 2017 report by the B.C. Real Estate Association, communities in the province struggled “to find funding sources for floodplain mapping projects.”

The result of B.C.'s decision was predictable. “There was very little mapping done” by B.C.'s municipalities after the FDRP’s cancellation, Ms. Lyle said. Surveying the state of the province’s flood maps in 2015, Ebbwater found that the median age was 26 years.

More alarmingly, much of the populous Lower Fraser Valley still hadn’t been mapped or was served by maps dating from the 1960s. Ebbwater estimated that more than 300,000 people live on the floodplain in Delta, Coquitlam and particularly Richmond. According to a report published this year by the province’s Auditor-General, the Lower Mainland is expected to flood more often; owing partly to the changing climate, flood levels previously expected just once every 500 years may now be expected every 50 years.

By the time Mr. Peters retired in 2016, B.C. had just eight full-time-equivalent professionals working in flood management, down from 45 three decades earlier. Asked how much development had taken place on B.C.'s floodplains, he said it had clearly happened but he couldn’t quantify it. “I really don’t have a good handle on that. I don’t think anybody does.”

The price of ignorance

While Ottawa successfully downloaded responsibility for flood mapping to lower levels of government, it still had to pay for much of the resulting bad decisions.

Payments from the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements, now administered by Public Safety Canada, are triggered when damages exceed certain thresholds per capita of population, rising to as much as 90 per cent of costs. The more expensive the disaster, the more Ottawa pays. Canada’s flood-mapping dark age coincided with skyrocketing payments for flood damage – of a magnitude far greater than what prompted the FDRP in the first place.

There’s every reason to believe damages will continue to escalate. In 2016 the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimated that the DFAA could expect to pay out an average of $673-million for flooding alone during each of the following five years.

It’s difficult to quantify how much of the mounting costs can be attributed to bad planning decisions, because the evidence is mostly anecdotal. Prof. Thistlethwaite points to a 2013 storm in Toronto that caused widespread power outages “mainly because they had transformers in low-lying areas that flood.” But other factors are also driving up the damage costs, including a changing climate and the fact Canadians have more valuable belongings – everything from big-screen TVs to luxury cars – than in the past.

Asked to hazard a guess, Mr. Pomeroy estimated the federal government saved between $40-million and $60-million by cancelling the FDRP. “But I think it’s cost us billions since then,” he said.

Stung by these rising costs, governments are once again seeking to download responsibility – this time directly to homeowners. In 2015, insurance for overland flooding became available to Canadian homeowners. Daniel Henstra, an associate professor in the University of Waterloo’s political science department, said both Ottawa and some provinces are eager to withdraw eligibility for disaster assistance from areas where that insurance is now offered. Indeed, this week Quebec Premier François Legault proposed capping assistance to homes that flood repeatedly.

The problem, according to Prof. Henstra, is that most Canadians can’t assess the likelihood their property will wind up under water. “If governments are going to start cutting off people’s eligibility for disaster assistance, they’d better make that risk knowable,” he said. ""And right now, it’s not.”

The insurance industry, on the other hand, is quickly amassing property-level risk data. A few years ago, the Insurance Bureau of Canada hired LexisNexis Risk Solutions and JBA Risk Management to create a national flood-risk model. JBA collected data on snow cover, rainfall, historical river levels, land cover, terrain and flooding across Canada to produce its own flood models and maps. LexisNexis used that to build a software product underwriters can use to decide whether to offer flooding insurance to homeowners and at what price. While imperfect, the insurance industry’s data are far superior to what’s available to the Canadian public – and the quality continues to improve.

Moving toward renewed national flood mapping

Ottawa has in recent years made tentative steps toward addressing the problem. Public Safety Canada took a hesitant early step by introducing its new guidelines for floodplain mapping. And in 2015 it introduced the National Disaster Mitigation Program, a $200-million five-year initiative intended to fund some flood mapping and flood-risk assessments.

Ms. Lyle of Ebbwater said the federal program prompted a recent uptick in flood mapping activity in B.C. But the maps she’s seen often don’t meet existing guidelines, which she already regards as weak. And one legacy of the FDRP’s dissolution is a dearth of professionals with adequate experience and training. She’s afraid much of the new funding will be wasted. ""There’s a lot of very poor mapping being done,” she said.

Prof. Henstra and Prof. Thistlethwaite recently published a paper urging the federal government to follow Australia’s example by creating a national repository of Canada’s existing flood maps. But that’s just a stopgap measure: Canada’s longer-term objective, they argue, should be to map all of Canada using modern techniques and uniform standards – all with a view to reducing risk.

Thanks to technological advances, modern flood maps can accomplish much more than their predecessors. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can produce high-resolution elevation data that can be used to simulate a multitude of different flooding scenarios. Using modern geographical information systems (GIS), it’s now relatively straightforward to combine flood-hazard information with inventories of buildings and other infrastructure, allowing users to understand what’s at risk.

Digital maps can be published online as interactive tools, maximizing their reach and usefulness. Residents of England, for example, can obtain detailed information about their flood risk on this national website.

Catching up to Canada’s peers would not be cheap. A 2014 estimate by the MMM Group estimated each square kilometre of floodplain mapped to modern standards would cost between $7,500 (for rural areas) and $10,500 (for cities). After mapping additional floodplains for which maps are not available, the national tab would come to $365-million. It could take as long as a decade.

But that should be weighed against the costs Canadians have already paid – and will continue to pay – for not knowing where floodwaters will go.

It’s a price Mr. Coochey knows all too well. He spent almost two years and tens of thousands of dollars repairing his basement on evenings and weekends. With Pierrefonds at risk of flooding again, he and his neighbours hauled truckload after truckload of sandbags over the weekend to his street to erect new barriers. He’s watching river-level data and video footage of upstream dams nervously.

There still aren’t any flood maps for his neighbourhood, although he believes new ones are being drawn up. But they didn’t arrive soon enough for the neighbours who moved into a townhouse across the street a few months ago.

“When we started fixing up for the floods, they come up and they say, ‘What the hell is going on?’ We’re going, ‘Well, we’re preparing for another flood,’ ” he said.

""They go, ‘Another flood. What flood?’ ”

210,FF-2012-000189-IDN,South Sudan: UNHCR warns that hepatitis E risk is growing - UNHCR,https://www.unhcr.org/509cedcd9.html,"With funding depleted for our operations in South Sudan, UNHCR is warning today that capacity to contain an outbreak of hepatitis E among the refugee population is increasingly stretched. The risks will grow if, as currently anticipated, we see fresh inflows of refugees from South Kordofan and Blue Nile states in neighbouring Sudan.

Due to insecurity and worsening humanitarian conditions in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, we expect thousands of new refugees to cross in the next weeks, as soon as roads become passable after the rainy season.

UNHCR and partners (Solidarités International, Goal, Oxfam, IOM, IMC, Medair and MSF together with the national health authorities) are already fighting an outbreak of Hepatitis E in Upper Nile and Unity states, two regions where the disease is endemic and where 175,000 Sudanese refugees are settled.

We have seen 1,050 cases of Hepatitis E in the refugee camps, a virus contracted and spread through consuming contaminated food and water. The disease damages the liver and can be fatal. To date, 26 refugees have died in camps in Upper Nile. This is 10 more deaths since mid-September.

The risk of infection is high in densely populated settings such as refugee camps. This is further exacerbated in the rainy season due to flooding and poor sanitation. Women and small children are the most vulnerable.

Early diagnosis is also crucial for the survival of patients. We are working with the US Centers for Disease Control which has sent six staff to test water and blood samples and conduct house-to-house interviews on hygiene practices.

To counter the spread of the disease among the 175,000 Sudanese refugees already in South Sudan, we are promoting better hygiene practices through hundreds of trained community workers. In all camps this community outreach exercise includes active case finding. We have also been working to improve the supply of clean water in the camps, as well as upgrade latrine stances, and provide more hand washing-stations and soap.

These measures have helped to slow the spread of the disease. However, we are struggling to meet the minimum humanitarian standards such as the provision of 15 to 20 litres of safe drinking water per refugee per day or building enough latrines so that each unit is shared by no more than 20 refugees.

The south Sudan operation is seriously underfunded. UNHCR needs a minimum of US$20 million until the end of the year to keep up basic lifesaving activities. Of our revised appeal for $186 million, only 40 per cent has been received so far. International NGOs also need additional funding beyond that amount to ensure that all activities can be carried out as needed.

But on Wednesday afternoon the airport announced that it had to cancel all operations till Saturday.“The operational area has been fully flooded. There is no choice but to cancel operations and the whether forecast shows that it will be raining heavily for the next two to three days. All operations have been suspended till Saturday as a precautionary step,” said ACK Nair, Airport Director, Cial.Though Cial has been using four large pumps to clear the water from the operational area until now, Nair said the water level at the airport has gone beyond the capacity of the pumps.He said that in the meanwhile, his team will be working hard revive airport operations before Saturday.Earlier at 4am Wednesday airport officials said that airport arrival operations will be suspend till 7am.

603,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,What ever happened to Eric Cantona? The Man Utd legend who traded Kung-fu kicks for movie stardom - Goal Ireland,https://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/what-ever-happened-to-eric-cantona/c6ud564rlvgw1wgmh0kpyl1qx,"What ever happened to Eric Cantona? The Man Utd legend who traded Kung-fu kicks for movie stardom

The French genius quit football almost 20 years ago, and has become a star of the big screen since calling time on his career at Old Trafford

When a press conference related to Eric Cantona was called by Manchester United in May 1997 it was the common consensus that a new contract was to be announced. The Frenchman’s retirement just a few days before his 31st birthday stunned United supporters all across the world.

Even Sir Alex Ferguson didn’t want to believe the star No.7 was done with football, telling Cantona in a letter three months later: “When we re-started training, I kept waiting for you to turn up as normal but I think that was in hope not realism and I knew when we met at Mottram your time at Manchester United was over.”

Man Utd should look to sign Tielemans

He had been the beating heart of a United side who had ended a 26-year title drought and gone on to collect four Premier League trophies in five seasons. Despite the kung-fu kick on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons which saw him banned for eight months in 1995, his time at Old Trafford had been overwhelmingly positive thanks to his brash flair-filled style, his artistic arrogance, enviable skill set and mesmeric leadership.

At the time it felt like such a shame. Here was one of the most talented and captivating footballers of many a generation abandoning the game at an early age. Moreover, he was not quitting to become a manager or to play a different role within football, but was waving goodbye to the sport entirely.

Having already played a couple of cameo roles in an independent French film and a TV drama, he would quickly become an adept supporting actor in the film world, most notably in the 1998 film Elizabeth with Cate Blanchett and future Doctor Who lead Christopher Eccleston. Later, he would be the main subject of the excellent Ken Loach drama ‘Looking For Eric’ in which a Manchester United fan looks to draw inspiration from Cantona in dealing with serious issues in his family life.

In total he has appeared in more than 20 movies since his retirement, most recently playing the male lead in a Croatian fantasy drama called Anka in which he meets up with a young girl fleeing from a difficult home life.

Over the past 12 months he has also been catching the eye in a series of Eurosport TV advertisements, acting as the ‘Commissioner of Football’ in which he passes sentence on the latest headlines and controversies in the game.

Marcelo blasts Ronaldo envy

From the mimicking of Oscars errors and the application to become England manager to commenting on French politicians and labelling Lionel Messi a “poor man’s Justin Bieber”, Cantona has offered a refreshingly unique take on the modern game with his periodic missives. Since his retirement from football almost 20 years ago, his direct involvement in the game has been limited - so long as we’re not counting a brief foray into beach soccer.

Beyond his acting career Cantona has also dabbled with photography, explaining in 2009: “I like to be fascinated by the people I photograph. Sometimes I don’t admire people but I’m interested about their lives. I’d like to do [photograph] a dictator, I don’t like them, but I’m interested about them.”

He has become known for his views on French politics, speaking out on both president Francois Hollande and former prime minister and current presidential nominee Francois Fillon during his TV soapbox skits. He has also shown his hand at film-making with a series of TV documentaries aired in his home country.

A tour of public speaking engagements in early 2017 courted some controversy when tickets worth up to £1,000 a head were sold for an evening with Cantona which turned into a glorified auction with only 45 minutes of pre-planned questions for the star of the show. Fans were also asked to take no pictures or videos despite the costly outlay, and some booed when left waiting over an hour for Cantona to take the stage.

It was one of Cantona’s rare forays into the public arena, but perhaps it is no great surprise that he has largely stepped away from the everyday spotlight since his retirement considering his persona back in his dressing-room days.

“Cantona led by his presence more than anything else, his charisma,” said United midfielder Roy Keane. “A captain doesn’t have to be loud; Eric rarely said a word.” Former Marseille team-mate Chris Waddle added: “I found Eric a nice lad. He used to come in on his Harley Davidson and he was fine, quiet.”

He has had the odd flirtation with football since 1997, with his appearances in benefit games at Old Trafford and beyond supplemented with an ill-fated spell as director of soccer at New York Cosmos. In 2011, he appeared in an advert puffing on a cigar and announcing “We are back” as Pele’s former club relaunched their brand ahead of a 2013 return, but in 2014 he was fired after receiving a police caution for assaulting a photographer in London. He would later file a law suit against the club over almost $1 million in unpaid salary.

The quiet guy with the loud temperament left one hell of an impression on United fans, who still sing his name to this day as they continue to reminisce about one of the greatest players ever to play for their club. Eric, though, does not share their love for looking back at the past.

“I don’t know where my medals are. No shirt, nothing,” he told the BBC in 2011. “I played for France 45 times, we had two shirts for every game, so that’s 90 shirts… I don’t have even one. I don’t want to have something that keeps me in memories like a prison. It was a strong time, the adrenaline was great. But you can feel very quickly like a prisoner of your past.

“I prefer to be free and think about tomorrow. I want to look forward, to have new ambitions, new goals, new passions.”

What will tomorrow bring for the nomadic post-footballing Eric Cantona? Whether film, tv, photography, cinema, poetry, beach soccer or a completely new passion, there is one thing for certain about the future according to the man himself.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguyễn Thái Hợp celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vượt Lũ Cộng Đồng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguyễn Thái Hợp, the bishop of Hà Tĩnh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghĩa, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Nguồn Nậy River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tĩnh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguyễn Thái Hợp, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghĩa, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Đồn.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguyễn Thái Hợp who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.",2021-03-31 07:00:00+00:00,"['centre', 'victims', 'hà', 'build', 'bishop', 'tiên', 'local', 'hợp', 'house', 'nguyễn', 'catholics', 'flood', 'thái', 'tĩnh', 'paul', 'work', 'community']",India,news article,English

CAIRO – 1 May 2018: The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation announced establishing 28 water dams and 16 artificial lakes to face the dangers of flooding and control its consequences, according to an official statement by Minster Mohamed Abdel-Ati on Monday, April 30.



It was added in the statement that the ministry has finished several projects with a cost of up to LE 1.7 billion ($96.3 million); however, other projects are still under construction with a total cost of LE 4.6 billion.



The established projects were announced to be in the governorates of South Sinai, Red Sea, Matrouh, Beni Suef, Asyut, Aswan, Sohag and Luxor.



Egypt’s weather is usually stable, as cases of heavy rains and flooding are not witnessed often; however, in recent years, heavy rains have caused severe problems for many Egyptians, damaging buildings, houses, cars and even agricultural land. The government has promised to find solutions to the problem.



On April 26, Egypt’s government apologized for the consequences of the heavy rain that flooded various governorates’ streets over the previous two days.



Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said during the Cabinet’s weekly meeting on Thursday, April 26 that the government feels truly sorry for the effects of the flood that affected citizens’ properties, houses and cars.



President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi also said that the government will intensify its efforts to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents.



“I fully understand the state of suffering that hit some Egyptians as a result of the sudden and unusual rainfall during the last two days; I assure you that the state’s authorities will intensify their efforts to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents,” President Sisi wrote on his official Twitter account Thursday morning.



Even though the Egyptian Meteorological Authority had warned of unstable weather from the beginning of the week, officials failed to take sensible precautionary measures or provide assistance after the torrential rain hit several parts of Cairo and Giza hard.



Rainfall throughout the capital caused some buildings, houses and bridges to collapse; other governorates, such as Suez, Ain Sokhna and Ismailia, were also affected.



Many people have taken to social media and television stations to pour their wrath on the provincial officials, emergency departments and officials in charge of drainage facilities, accusing them of failure and calling for interrogations.



Users on social media sites sarcastically shared photos of drains as great inventions that hope to reach Egypt soon, asking, “Where have the drains gone?”



Residents of the New Cairo got the lion’s share of the damage. Videos and photos went viral online, showing streets of the Fifth Settlement and El Shorouk City flooded, where water levels rose to over one meter, submerging vehicles in the flooded streets.

Photo by: Sara Jerving / Devex

MAPUTO, Mozambique — Maria Andrade knelt over and picked up the vine of a sweet potato plant growing in her favorite greenhouse in the International Potato Center’s research and development lab in Maputo, Mozambique.

“The leaves are beautiful, aren’t they?” she asked.

Andrade is principal scientist at the International Potato Center, a CGIAR research center, and a leading orange-fleshed sweet potato breeder in Africa.

“If I could see every house giving orange-fleshed sweet potatoes to their children, helping to solve vitamin deficiencies, I will die very happy, because I served my purpose.” — Maria Andrade, principal scientist, International Potato Center

The greenhouse is full of drought-resistant strains of sweet potatoes her team bred in collaboration with Mozambique’s government. They’ve sent these varieties across Africa to help farmers deal with the climate change-fueled droughts that have increased in frequency in recent years, according to Andrade.

Small signs stuck in the mud under the plants read names including Alisha, Esther, Caelan, and Erica. Andrade names her varieties after women and girls that promote the spread of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes across Africa. Only one man has made the cut.

“Other men get jealous and say I should name my breeds after them. But I tell them: ‘You are not worthy!’” she said, laughing.

You could call Andrade a sweet potato fanatic. She always wears orange — orange shawls, orange hats, orange dresses. She’s built her life around the promotion of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes in Africa, earning her the nickname “Senhora Polpa Alaranjada,” or “orange flesh lady” in Portuguese.

In 2016, she was co-recipient of the World Food Prize for her contributions to global nutrition for her breeding programs. Two other members of her team, Jan Low of the U.S. and Robert Mwanga of Uganda, also won the prize.

The three were honored for “developing the single most successful example of micronutrient and vitamin biofortification — the orange-fleshed sweet potato.” Andrade and Mwanga have bred orange-fleshed sweet potatoes rich in beta carotene and Low developed nutrition studies and programs to encourage people across the African continent to produce and consume this biofortified crop.

Q&A: The future of food is biofortified, says plant breeding pioneer Speaking to Devex ahead of his retirement as HarvestPlus CEO last month, Howarth Bouis explained why biofortification is such a promising nutrition intervention and the challenges that remain to achieve scale.

The breeding of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes has been particularly successful because there are a lot of varieties of the crop that can be used in cross-breeding. The International Potato Center has sped up the breeding process — producing new varieties in four years rather than eight — which has made the new varieties available faster in more countries than other biofortified crops, Low explained.

The team’s enthusiasm around this crop is rooted in the conviction that a transition from the commonly consumed white-fleshed sweet potato to the orange-fleshed sweet potato could drastically reduce deficiencies in vitamin A across Africa.

A 2005 study conducted in South Africa monitored school children that consumed orange-fleshed sweet potatoes for 53 days, compared to those who ate white-fleshed sweet potatoes. Those who ate orange-fleshed sweet potatoes had significant improvements in the vitamin A levels stored in their livers over those who didn’t, increasing from 78% to 87%.

“All sweet potatoes, both white and orange, are very nutritious — they have vitamin B and vitamin C. But the orange-fleshed one has one more thing, which is beta carotene,” Andrade said. “When people consume beta carotene, the body changes it to vitamin A.”

Vitamin A deficiency can weaken immune systems, increase mortality, and limit growth. It is also the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness.

Globally, about 250 million preschool-aged children are vitamin A deficient and an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 of these children become blind every year, half of which die within a year of becoming blind. Vitamin A is especially an issue in Africa and Southeast Asia.

In addition to beta carotene, Andrade’s team is breeding varieties of sweet potatoes to increase iron levels.

Still, despite advances in breeding leading to sweet potatoes with higher levels of beta carotene, there are also the hurdles of getting the new varieties to the farmers’ fields and people’s plates.

Introduction in Mozambique

Andrade, a native of Cape Verde, was recruited in 1996 to Mozambique to work for the Southern Africa Root Crop Research Network, led by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture and International Potato Center, to focus on improving the yield of cassava and sweet potatoes, as well as pest and disease resistance. At the time, farmers in the country produced only white-fleshed sweet potatoes.

Andrade had just finished a doctorate at North Carolina State University, where her research focused on orange-fleshed sweet potatoes. In attempts to decrease high levels of vitamin A deficiency in Mozambique, in 1997, her team began to import orange-fleshed varieties high in beta carotene from countries including the United States and Peru. The plant is native to the Americas. They then began to test clones of the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and released nine varieties in Mozambique.

Improving Nutrition Explore Devex’s dedicated news section with regular, editorially independent coverage of the challenges, solutions, and innovations in nutrition, with financial support from our partner DSM.

When flooding hit Mozambique in 2000, it wiped out sweet potato crops across the southern part of the country. In response, the International Potato Center team distributed orange-fleshed sweet potato vines to 121,000 families, accompanied by a marketing campaign to encourage its consumption.

In 2005, a severe drought wiped out some varieties of sweet potatoes in Mozambique, which prompted the development of a national breeding program to focus on drought-tolerant varieties. In 2011, the first batch of 15 drought-tolerant varieties were released.

""Sweet potato is a smart agricultural crop,” said Tawanda Muzhingi, a Nairobi-based food scientist at the International Potato Center. “It doesn't need a lot of water, it doesn't need a lot of inputs, it has a short growing cycle, within three to four months you can have a harvest. In these areas that are prone to droughts, I think orange-flesh sweet potatoes can be a good security food crop.”

The work continues, with efforts to improve the levels of drought-tolerance by cross-breeding varieties of local drought-tolerant, white-fleshed sweet potatoes with imported orange-fleshed sweet potatoes.

Increasing iron and appealing to consumers

Through its breeding, the International Potato Center team has increased the levels of beta carotene by over 100%.

In addition to vitamin A, Andrade’s team is working to increase the iron content in sweet potatoes. Iron deficiency in children can impact their growth and development.

“Contrary to beans, sweet potatoes have very high levels of vitamin C, which can improve the iron intake. Also, the inhibitor of iron absorption, which exists in beans, does not exist in sweet potatoes,” Andrade explained.

The team bred a clone orange-fleshed sweet potato with high levels of iron. This is now part of a feeding trial in Malawi that is testing for bioavailability, which checks whether the body can actually absorb the iron. Results are expected in the next few months, Andrade said.

Some of the sweet potatoes they’ve bred are purple-fleshed, which is a source of anthocyanin, which has antioxidant effects.

But even with advances in nutritional content, breeders struggle with making sure the taste and texture meets consumption demands. The white-fleshed sweet potato, commonly consumed across the African continent, is much drier and less sweet than the orange-fleshed varieties popular in places like the U.S.

“For Africa, they want it drier because they use it as a staple, to function like bread for breakfast,” Andrade said.

As you increase levels of beta carotene, the dryness is reduced, she said. The key to breeding the orange-fleshed varieties is increasing the nutritional value, while also creating a variety that is dry enough.

Drought-tolerant breeding efforts in Mozambique are linked with a network of breeding programs across the continent. In West Africa, the focus is on breeding for desired taste and texture, and in East and Central Africa, the focus is on breeding for disease and pest tolerance.

Beyond Africa

Is it time to take 'more of a gamble' to scale nutrition interventions? While some groups focus on nutrition-specific interventions, others believe a multisectoral approach is the best way to achieve scale. Devex asks nutrition experts what the future looks like to get on track to meet SDG 2.

The Peru-based International Potato Center and its partners have developed and disseminated more than 130 orange-fleshed sweet potato varieties across Africa and Asia, reaching 5 million households. Beyond its breeding centers in Africa, a center is under construction in Bangladesh, which will coordinate the release of orange-flesh sweet potato varieties in parts of Asia, with a focus on Bangladesh and India.

Sweet potato consumption is not widespread in Bangladesh. The biggest challenges in this setting are convincing the government to prioritize sweet potato as a national crop because it is not seen as a commercial crop that could bring foreign currency from international trade. The crop is also bulky and perishable, which reduces its shelf-life, and sweet potatoes are considered a ""poor man's crop,"" Muzhingi said.

But recently things have started to change, according to Simon Heck, program leader at the International Potato Center in Kenya. In Bangladesh, there's been an overreliance on rice that has resulted in nutritional deficiencies and oversupply, making it hard to produce profitably.

Because of this, the government of Bangladesh is prioritizing diversification away from rice. The sweet potato has been selected for support, which includes government funds for research and dissemination.

Some of the main rice producing areas have also been badly impacted by an increasing salinity of soil and water due to rising sea levels.

""There is great urgency in finding alternative crops that can tolerate higher levels of salinity — and sweet potato is very well adapted to that environment,"" Heck said.

Farmers’ access

While breeding efforts have been successful, there are still challenges in ensuring the sustainability of its consumption.

The latest batch of drought-resistant seeds from Andrade’s team will be released at the end of August. Adequate funding is necessary to encourage the widespread use of these new varieties, she said.

As part of the efforts to get new varieties to farmers, the International Potato Center led a six-year “Scaling Up Sweetpotato through Agriculture and Nutrition” project in South Asia and Africa, including Mozambique, with 20 partner organizations, that ended this year.

How to better integrate gender equality and nutrition Women are disproportionately affected by malnutrition. Experts explain how to integrate a gender transformative approach when tackling malnutrition.

Through the project, 2.3 million households with children under the age of 5 were provided with planting material to produce orange-fleshed sweet potatoes. Almost a quarter of these households started producing orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, according to the International Potato Center. Of these families, about 70% still produced orange-fleshed sweet potatoes a year after receiving planting materials.

The project’s ongoing work aims to reach at least 6.5 million consumers with orange-fleshed sweet potatoes over the next three years, focusing on Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda.

One challenge is making sure that there are markets for orange-fleshed sweet potatoes.

Farmers are faced with a dilemma when deciding what to grow, Muzhingi said. They can grow orange-fleshed sweet potatoes to improve their household’s nutrition, but then they often can’t sell their surplus because there is no market. Or they can grow a cash-crop, like sugar cane, which they can sell, he said. The key to leading farmers toward orange-fleshed sweet potatoes is creating commercial markets for farmers to sell their surplus.

In Kenya, for example, the International Potato Center worked with the supermarket chain Tuskys to develop a bread that substitutes half of the wheat flour for orange-fleshed sweet potato puree. This created a market for smallholder farmers to sell their surplus. In Mozambique, because of smaller markets and fewer processing companies, the success of these efforts have been limited.

Another challenge is the sustainability of programs working to promote the production and consumption of these crops.

One of the main programs in Mozambique, the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded “Viable Sweetpotato Technologies in Africa” Mozambique project, under the U.S. “Feed the Future” initiative, was working to get orange-fleshed sweet potatoes into the hands of farmers. The program promoted the consumption of orange-fleshed sweet potato varieties in communities in Mozambique through increasing access to planting material, nutrition education, and market development, with a focus on families with children under 5 and women of reproductive age. The program reached nearly 74,000 households.

The $12.3 million program was expected to run from 2014 through 2021. But late last year, project implementers were informed the project was cut because of funding shortages. It stopped operations in June.

According to a USAID official, the decision to shut down the program was because the agency ""revisited strategic opportunities for future agricultural investments.""

This move follows significant decreases in U.S. agricultural development assistance and emergency food aid to Mozambique in recent years. In fiscal year 2014, $21 million in agricultural development funding was allocated and in fiscal year 2018, $6.8 million was allocated, which is a 68% cut, according to U.S. government budget requests and Food for Peace fact sheets.

Mozambique was also removed, along with eight other countries, from the list of Feed the Future’s “focus” countries, which meant it was no longer a target for higher U.S. investments in agricultural development and market access programs.

These USAID cuts could affect the spread of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes in Mozambique, Andrade said, stunting efforts to grow markets and develop products. Other agencies have not yet stepped up to fill in this gap, she said.

“USAID has been our greatest support over the years and all off sudden, to remove the support — we felt unprepared for such change,” she said.

Despite these challenges, in Mozambique, about 31% of all sweet potatoes grown in Mozambique are now orange-fleshed, according to Andrade, which she considers a great success.

""We've had significant success in Mozambique,” Muzhingi said. “If you go to northern Mozambique, you find orange-fleshed sweet potato sold in the market, households growing them, government programs using them, and NGOs promoting them as an effective strategy for the alleviation of vitamin A deficiency.

“It’s no longer a [International Potato Center]-only initiative. It’s embedded in the government’s national strategies towards malnutrition.”

Other countries that have been particularly successful with adopting the orange-fleshed sweet potato include Rwanda and Kenya, he added.

“This is a mission. We call it a revolution,” Andrade said. “If I could see every house giving orange-fleshed sweet potatoes to their children, helping to solve vitamin deficiencies, I will die very happy, because I served my purpose.”

“I have a feeling that one day this will happen. But we still have a lot of work to do.”

That raised the death toll from 24, reported earlier by the Moroccan news agency MAP.

Local authorities said firefighters and emergency workers rescued 10 people from the factory, in the basement of a residential villa. Rescuers searched for others who might have been trapped in the sudden flooding.

The total number of laborers at the site wasn’t immediately known. An investigation was opened.

A shaken unidentified woman who emerged from the flooded basement told TanjaNews, a local site, that no one was prepared for the deadly deluge.

“There was nothing to worry about. We were working as usual,” the woman said. “And then because it was raining, as you can see … the water started entering, a little water, even my shoes didn’t get wet. But suddenly …” She couldn’t finish her sentence.

To meet growing international demand, numerous factories in Morocco, notably in Casablanca and Tangier, rely on unregulated shadow factories to speed up production and meet deadlines. Factories subcontract to such illegal units to better compete with cheaper Chinese and Turkish products.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, Apr 24 2017 (IPS) - Keen to tap its natural resources as a way to boost its struggling economy, Guyana struck a multi-million-dollar deal with Norway in 2009.

Under the deal, Norway agreed to pay up to 250 million dollars over five years, if Guyana, a Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country in South America, maintained a low deforestation rate.

""It is a plant, it does photosynthesis, but it happens to be the fastest growing plant in the world so the absorption of CO2 by bamboo forests is quite significant.” --Dr. Hans Friederich



It was the first time a developed country, conscious of its own carbon-dioxide emissions, had paid a developing country to keep its trees in the ground.

The initiative was developed by the United Nations and called REDD+ (for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus conservation).

The main aim was to allow for carbon sequestration – the process involved in carbon capture and the long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Trees are thirsty for the potent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, soaking it up during photosynthesis and storing it in their roots, branches and leaves. Each year, forests around the world absorb nearly 40 percent of all the carbon dioxide produced globally from fossil-fuel emissions. But deforestation increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as trees are burned or start to decompose.

Most of the other Caribbean countries do not have the vast forests present in Guyana, but one expert believes there is still a huge potential to sequester carbon.

While the bamboo plant can be found in abundance in several Caribbean countries, the director of the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR), Dr. Hans Friederich, said its importance and the possible role it could play in dealing with climate change have been missed by many of these countries.

“Bamboo and rattan, to a lesser extent, have been in a way forgotten as mechanisms that can help countries both with mitigation of climate change and with adaptation. And I think, certainly for the Caribbean, for Jamaica, both aspects are important,” Friederich told IPS.

“Mitigation, because carbon is sequestered by bamboo. It is a plant, it does photosynthesis, but it happens to be the fastest growing plant in the world so the absorption of CO2 by bamboo forests is quite significant.”

“The stems are thin but, over a period of time, the total sink of CO2 from a bamboo forest is actually more than the average from other forests. We’ve tried this, we’ve tested this and we’ve measured this in China and that’s certainly the case over there,” he added.

As far as adaptation is concerned, Friederich said bamboo also has a key role to play.

“For example, helping local communities deal with the effects of climate change in relation to erosion control, in relation to providing income in times when maybe other sources of income are no longer there or have been affected through floods or droughts or other environmental catastrophes,” the INBAR official explained.

“So, bamboo really is something that should be included in the overall discussion about climate change mitigation and adaptation.”

INBAR has facilitated a trip to China for a group of Jamaicans, to show them how the Chinese are using bamboo as a source of energy, as a charcoal source – to replicate that intelligence and that experience in Jamaica and help the island develop a bamboo industry.

In 2014, the Jamaica Bureau of Standards announced the country would embark on the large-scale production of bamboo for the construction of low-cost houses and value-added products such as furniture and charcoal for the export market.

The bureau also facilitated training exercises for people to be employed in the industry, and announced plans to set up three bamboo factories across the island.

The agency said it would also offer incentives for people to grow, preserve and harvest the bamboo plant for its various uses.

The following year, the bureau and the Small Business Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) collaborated to establish the country’s first ever Bamboo Industry Association (BIA).

The BIA’s mandate is to engage and heighten awareness among owners of properties with bamboo, about the potential economic values to be derived from the plant, of which there are more than 65,000 hectares of growing across the island.

“We believe in changing the nation…so we are here to make an impactful difference in the lives of the average citizen of this country,” SBAJ President Hugh Johnson said.

It seems the importance of bamboo might be slowly catching on in the Caribbean and elsewhere.

“Does it connect? It depends really with whom. I think our members, we now have 41 states that are part of the network of Inbar – they recognize it. And more and more do we get requests to help countries think about ways that we can develop the industry,” Friederich said.

“But beyond the people that understand bamboo there is still a lot of awareness raising to be done . . . to make people understand the opportunities and the benefits.

“The nice thing about bamboo is that the start of the production chain, the start of the value chain is something that basically involves unskilled, poor people. So, it is really a way to address Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number one – poverty reduction and bringing people out of real bad conditions. Therefore, that is something that we are working our members to see how we can support local communities with activities that basically promote that,” he added.

INBAR is an intergovernmental organisation established in 1997 by treaty deposited with the United Nations and hosted in Beijing, China.

Friederich said reactions from the producing countries have been very positive.

“From the international community, equally, I think those working in forestry like the Food and Agriculture Organisation, they definitely see the opportunities,” he said.

“From the investment community, maybe less so. I think the banks and individual investors are still wondering what the return on investment is, but we do have some very interesting private sector reactions and there are some exciting things going on around the world. So, in general, I think the message is getting through,” Friederich added.",2017-04-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['forests', 'climate', 'traction', 'carbon', 'country', 'countries', 'savior', 'caribbean', 'bamboo', 'friederich', 'gaining', 'jamaica', 'plant', 'think']",Ghana,news article,English
1923,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Scores feared dead as floods wreak havoc - The Standard,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001412908/scores-feared-dead-as-floods-wreak-havoc,"At least 11 people reportedly drowned and property worth millions of shillings destroyed in Machakos and Nairobi counties following heavy rains.

The heaviest death toll was recorded in Machakos where six people were swept away by raging waters in three separate incidents on Thursday night.

The first incident occurred at Itunduimuni seasonal river in Masinga location, where three people were swept away as they tried to cross the flooded river.

Among them was a mother and her baby who were riding on a motorcycle when they were swept away by flood waters.

A witness, Duncan Mutuku, told the police that he was going home at around 10pm when he saw a boda boda rider carrying a woman and a baby being swept away by raging waters while trying to cross the surging river.

In another incident, Nzukini Assistant Chief reported that a man had been swept away by freak floods as he attempted to cross a seasonal stream near Kwa Katiku at around 7.30pm Thursday night.

At the same time, raging floods disrupted businesses in Nairobi, claiming at least five lives in Kibra and Mukuru slums. The rains also damaged infrastructure in some parts of the city.

The floods were experienced on Thursday night when torrential rains drenched Nairobi, leaving behind a trail of destruction in Nairobi West, South C, and Dam estate.

In Nyanza, more than 2,200 families in Nyatike, Migori County were affected by floods following heavy rains. At Kakelo Kakoth Location, some 300 homes were submerged in water, forcing locals to flee for safety.

In Lower Karapolo, 60 households have been marooned by floods while West Kanyuor location has 99 households affected by the raging waters. According to Lower Central Kadem Chief Philip Orwa, areas around Kuja River such as Lwanda were also flooded, negatively affecting turnout in schools.

In Siaya, the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) warned motorists against crossing Goye causeway after Lake Victoria waters overflowed.

According to KeNHA, the situation was caused by the increased rainfall in Nyanza, which has affected sections of the Lake Victoria Basin.

(Photo: Reuters)

Pakistan has been reeling under floods for the past three months, leading to the loss of hundreds of lives. However, leave alone its neighbours or the rest of the world, even people in Pakistan are hardly talking about it.

The first indications of the worsening flood situation were noticed when a recently established UK-based NGO called Muslim Aid started collecting funds for Pakistanis.

Latest satellite images from Sentinel were accessed by India Today OSINT team and compared with three-month-old images to understand the extent of flood damage in Pakistan.

These are false colour images taken using a combination of infrared and visible light that clearly distinguishes between land, which appears bright green, and water that appears black.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan has been providing situation reports that have been ignored by most government ministries. The latest NDMA report indicates 400 deaths and damages to over 2 lakh houses.

While damage to infrastructure is maximum in Sindh province, the highest deaths have been reported from Sindh and Punjab. More than 6 lakh acres of crops have suffered damage in Mirpur Khas and Dadu districts alone. The next few days are crucial as yet another spate of rains is expected by NDMA.

(Photo: India Today)

The satellite images, when compared to previous years data, indicate that no action has been taken by Pakistan to either resettle victims or alleviate threats since the deadly 2010 floods.

The administration has made no effort to train the rivers properly. River banks havent been lined and bridges across the Indus are under danger of getting washed away. Road approaches stall water overflowing the riverside, thus, endangering the complete bridge infrastructure. The Dadu Moro Bridge is a classic example of this type of possible future damage that can be assessed from satellite imagery.

(Photo: India Today)

The Indus River is clearly not trained at the bridge site with either retainer walls or embankments, thus, overflowing the divergent guide banks. The next large gush of flood waters will certainly damage this bridges western side severely.

Large areas in Jacobabad, including parts of Shahbaz Air Base, are also under water. Shahbaz is one of the most important air bases of Pakistan Air Force. It has fighter and transporter jets along with a huge ammunition depot. In the last decade, Pakistan suffered severe floods in 2007 and 2010 when damage to property was almost $40-$50 billion.

(Photo: India Today)

In 2010, the air base supposedly suffered the worst damage in PAF history when most of the ammunition, including air-to-surface missiles, had come under water.

Recent satellite images indicate that although water released from Guddu Barrage had entered the area, it did not cross the retainer wall constructed by PAF on the northern side of the air base.",2020-09-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['months', 'air', 'pakistan', 'satellite', 'water', 'damage', 'images', 'bridge', 'extent', 'flood', 'india', 'suffered']",Pakistan,news article,English
775,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Ancient Incan agriculture revived due to climate change - Public Radio International PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-09-09/ancient-incan-agriculture-revived-due-climate-change,"Story from PRI's The World. Listen to audio above for full report.

To get to some of Peru's most remote Andean communities, you head out over pockmarked dirt roads from a small town already 10,000 feet up. Up – up – up — past llamas and alpacas and sheep and cows. The vegetation thins out and the air becomes even thinner. Your lungs clamor for oxygen and you're offered coca leaves to help adjust to the altitude.

And then, after four hypnotic hours, you've arrived – at a patch of sparse farmland near the town of Pomacocha, at 13,000 feet an outpost at pretty much the upper limits of agriculture.

For centuries, Pomacocha's thousand or so residents have grown corn in the fertile valleys below the town and potatoes on slopes that push against the sky above, fed by seasonal rains and glacial streams.

But climate change is hitting the high Andes hard. Temperature and precipitation swings are becoming more extreme, the glaciers are shrinking fast, and a tough place to farm is becoming even tougher.

So to help them deal with an uncertain future, residents are looking back in time—to before the arrival of Europeans.

From a field of brown soil, Pomacocha resident Mariano Ccaccya unearths a small, pink potato—a huaña, one of the first to be grown here in decades. The huaña is the native potato in this part of Peru, but Ccaccya says it had fallen out of favor in recent decades and was about to disappear.

Huaña are bitter, Ccaccya says, and it takes a lot of work to make them palatable. But he says there are good reasons to grow them in times of increasing uncertainty.

Ccaccya, who's the local head of a nonprofit group that's leading an effort to revive ancient Andean crops, says huañas can be stored for two or three years, more than four times as long as most other potatoes. Ccaccya's colleague Adripino Jayo says huañas also resist frost, hail, extreme rain and drought.

""It's very, very strong,"" Jayo says. ""Now that we're in the crisis of climate change, it's worth recovering these potatoes.""

Others think so too. Jayo and Ccaccya's organization, Cusichaca Andina, recently won a grant from the World Bank to further its efforts to promote a variety of resilient ancient Andean crops, including quinoa, amaranth, and different types of potatoes and squashes.

But changing what's grown here is only part of the plan. Cusichaca Andina is also looking to the past to try to change how crops are grown.

On a steep slope in a valley about two hours from the potato fields, Jayo pulls away a stand of brush to reveal an overgrown rock wall. He says the stones are part of a long-abandoned system of agricultural terraces, built into Peru's mountains by the Incas more than 500 years ago.

Terraces like these once blanketed thousands of square miles of the Andes, and were described in the 17th century book The Royal Commentaries of the Incas, by Garcilaso de la Vega.

""They built level terraces on the mountains and hillsides, wherever the soil was good,"" De la Vega wrote. ""And these are to be seen today in Cusco and in the whole of Peru.""

Just a small fraction of the terraces are still used today. After the European conquest, Spanish crops and agricultural systems largely displaced traditional ones.

But here in Pomacocha, old terraces are being restored, and new ones are being built.

Ccaccya says they have a lot of benefits. The terraces help channel water for irrigation while avoiding erosion. They can hold water for months, which is crucial in a place with only intermittent access to water. And plants grown on them are more productive, he says.

Cusichaca Andina is also working on reviving another ancient technology for holding and transporting scarce water—Incan irrigation systems that Garcilaso de la Vega called ""extraordinary.""

""The Cisterns, or Conservatories, were about twelve foot deep, in channels made of hewn stone,"" de la Vega wrote, ""and rammed in with earth so hard, that no water could pass between… But the Spaniards little regarded the convenience of these works, but rather out of a scornful and disdaining humor, have suffered them unto ruin, beyond all recovery.""

Centuries later, the digging and hammering of a handful of men near Pomacocha suggests that the ruin of the Incan irrigation channels was perhaps not quite beyond all recovery. The workers are chiseling and lining up stones along a long-abandoned canal once used to divert water from a nearby spring.

""It's always been here,"" Jayo says, pointing at the stone canal. ""It's probably from pre-Incan times, but it's still useful for irrigation, with a little help.""

Cusichaca Andina and other groups in the Andes have recovered these and other ancient agricultural treasures through a combination of archaeology and exploring local traditions. And they're teaching communities throughout the Peruvian high Andes how to rebuild and use them, along with other ancient agricultural techniques.

It's all part of an effort to increase the resilience and food security.

But the leaders of Cusichaca Andina realize they can only make a small dent in a vast need. Jayo says the Peruvian government has a big role to play as well.

""We see the difficulties in the national context,"" Jayo says. He says the group wants politicians in Lima to apply what it's doing across all of the Andes.

So far national politicians haven't picked up that slack.

But the work here may have relevance to mountainous regions beyond Peru. For instance Cusichaca Andina's founder, British archaeologist Ann Kendall, recently traveled to China. The world's largest country faces huge challenges from climate change and water shortages. And it also happens to have its own system of ancient mountain terraces that Kendall thinks may just be waiting to be revived.

1261,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"Quebecers urged to stay alert as more than 3,100 homes flooded across province - CTV News",https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/quebecers-urged-to-stay-alert-as-more-than-3-100-homes-flooded-across-province-1.4391198,"MONTREAL -- Warm temperatures and melting snow continued to threaten homes and businesses across Quebec Tuesday, forcing flood-weary Quebecers to remain on alert.

About 2,800 homes had been struck by flooding as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Public Security officials. Urgence Quebec said more than 1,400 people have been forced out of their homes across the province and some 2,100 properties remain isolated because of washed out roads or landslides.

Authorities said they expected water levels to peak by Wednesday. But flooding risks remain high across southern Quebec, particularly the corridor between the Outaouais area west of Montreal and the Beauce region south of Quebec City.

Public Security Minister Genevieve Guilbault visited Sainte-Marie, Que, in the Beauce area, and met with several mayors of towns affected by the overflowing Chaudiere River.

Several hundred people left their homes in that town and nearly 1,000 residences and commercial buildings were flooded. Last week, Beauceville, just down river, saw its downtown core overrun with water, hitting 230 homes and businesses.

""As you can see, the downtown of Sainte-Marie was badly hit by flooding in the last few days, as well as the Beauce region in general,"" Guilbault said. ""It's a very sad situation and our thoughts are with citizens who've been affected or will be in the coming days.""

About 350 kilometres west of Sainte-Marie, right by the border with Ontario, the mayor of Rigaud said he's warning residents to be prepared to play the long game. ""It's going to be drawn out over several weeks before this is all over,"" said Hans Gruenwald Jr. ""We wish it will be shorter, but that's what it is.""

Rigaud fire chief Daniel Boyer told reporters the rain over the next few days could be telling.

""With the rain that's coming, so far, I think it'll get a little worse,"" Boyer said. He said experts, however, no longer believe the water will rise to historic 2017 levels. ""Is it going to get worse? I hope not, but our job is to get ready for the worst.""

The United States has disbursed more than $95 million to support the response to the South Sudan humanitarian emergency.

US Humanitarian Assistance for the South Sudan Crisis spokesperson Ned Price said the funding will provide critical protection, economic opportunity, shelter, essential healthcare, emergency food assistance, safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services to some of the nearly four million South Sudanese refugees and internally displaced people in South Sudan.

The funds will also support refugees and host communities in Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said.

“This announcement includes nearly $53 million through the US Agency for International Development and nearly $43 million from the US Department of State,” Mr Price said in a statement.

“The fund brings the total US humanitarian assistance to more than $482 million in Fiscal Year 2021.”

Flooding, political violence, and lack of effective governance in recent years have ruined livelihoods, displaced additional South Sudanese, and heightened food insecurity, raising the likelihood of famine conditions in parts of the country. Covid-19 and ongoing subnational conflict have further compounded the situation.

The urgent humanitarian need calls for sustained and coordinated donor support to the underfunded UN 2021 South Sudan Regional Refugee Response Plan.

In the statement, the US called on donors and the South Sudanese government to work with the UN and international community to support the humanitarian response in South Sudan.

“Humanitarian assistance will not solve the conflict, but it is vital to keeping civilians alive.

1828,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Vanessa Nakate: 'Many people are not yet aware of the dangers of climate change' - DW (English),https://www.dw.com/en/fridays-for-future-uganda-climate-change-africa-activism-food-security-water/a-54732304,"From Uganda and in her early 20s, Vanessa Nakate started protesting against climate inaction outside the Ugandan government gates in 2019. She's on a mission to raise awareness about the issue within Africa and internationally because she has seen the impacts of climate change already on her own community.

DW: When you started Fridays for Future activism in Uganda, you were very much alone right at the beginning. At what point did you think, 'OK, I should continue this or I'm going to give up'?

Vanessa Nakate: I just felt like I had to continue striking, especially because I was still doing it by myself. But then as time went on, more and more people started to get involved in different parts of the country doing the climate strikes. And also in the entire African continent, more activists started coming up and doing the climate strikes and demanding action. And to me, that is enough of a motivation to keep me doing activism, knowing that I am not doing it alone, and that there are millions of young people from different parts of the world striking and demanding climate action.

How does climate activism in your country differ from what it looks like in Europe? We're used to seeing big Fridays For Future strikes here, but what does it look like in Uganda?

Well, of course there is a big difference between the activism in Uganda and in Europe. This is mainly because of two things.

One is awareness. Many people are not yet aware of the dangers. They don't have the facts. They don't have the clear science about what is happening when it comes to the climate crisis.

And then the other thing is freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is not the same as we see it is in Europe and it's also harder for students here to walk out of school and do the climate strikes.

If I want to do climate strikes with students, I have to go in the schools because many of them, they have a fear of walking out of school. Just walking out would subject you to either suspension or expulsion.

Also getting permits for marches every Friday is very hard, especially if you don't have a strong organization that is behind you, that is supporting you. So activism in my country — or probably in any other African country — is different because of such restrictions.

With that in mind, how do you get people motivated to go on strikes?

By sharing on social media. That is — mainly on Twitter and Facebook — I would share my strikes every Friday and many people would ask questions about what I was doing and why I was doing that.

The other way is going into schools and requesting principals, director of schools to talk to students on Friday so that I get to discuss with them the challenges that our planet faces and their role in securing a better future.

One other way, we've been doing community reach-outs where we go to local communities and do cleanups, because most of these people, they don't have access maybe to a television. They don't watch the news. They don't know the challenges that the world is facing. So through these local reach-outs or doing cleanups, we get to speak to them, we get to explain to them how they can protect the planet, what they can do for our home, because all of us have a responsibility to play.

The Global Strike 4 Climate in Uganda's capital Kampala in 2019

Climate change is obviously a difficult thing to explain to anybody in the world. But for you, what are the main issues locally that you are dealing with?

I have clearly seen the danger that climate change places on people's lives and the danger is mainly an issue of food scarcity and water scarcity for people.

A large percentage of the people in Uganda are heavily dependent on agriculture as a source of survival, and that is mainly the people in the rural communities. It also affects those in the urban centers because they get food from the rural communities. It also brings about other problems of seeing more street children on the streets of Kampala. This is because many of them, they're trying to run away from their lands. They're trying to find a better way of survival.

Also, availability of access to clean water for the people, because when it floods, that means the water will still be contaminated. It's submerged even toilets, not just the farms, it also submerged drainage. That means any water source that the community was relying on was also contaminated by the dirt from the toilets. So you find that, even in the flood there is a water scarcity.

You, as well as I guess your colleagues one could call them from Europe, have a whole set of different agendas regarding what issues are important within Europe, as opposed to what is important across Africa or Asia. Has it ever been difficult working with them?

No. I believe in a way, yes, the demands are different, the urgency is different — when it comes to Europe, it isn't as urgent as it is in Africa with the climate crisis. So in Europe, you find that most of the activists, they are mainly targeting the politicians and the leaders in making decisions that will ensure that different parts of the world are protected, that will ensure that the Earth is protected.

I personally may not have reach to the leaders who determine the existence of the fossil fuel industry, who determine whether we are going to transition to a more sustainable future. Most of those leaders, they have so much influence as well in some of the countries on the African continent. So I feel like if they're able to reach out to those leaders in the European Parliament and put pressure on them to take the decisions that would save our planet, that also helps me out, that also helps the people of my country.

As you point out, places across Africa, whether it's the Sahel, whether it's the coastal areas, they have much more to lose than what we see in Europe. But for you, how does this make you feel when you can see that Africans are actually in a more dangerous position than the Europeans are, but that Africans have so little influence on that?

As a climate activist, of course, I understand that we have tried so much to ask for representation of every activist on the world stage, in discussions. But it is one thing to see that representation, but it's another thing for that representation to carry the same weight.

The weight of influence — it is not the same. The question is: Will they listen to what I will say? Will they find it important if I say it? What if I say the same thing today and no one pays attention to it and another activist from Europe says the same thing and it's given much attention?

What's your message to people across Africa about climate? No pressure.

For the people of Africa, no one is going to fight for you when it comes to the climate crisis.

If Africa experiences issues with the climate crisis, many times, we first look out for international media to talk about it. But now we need African media.

We can only save our continent if we work together. And unfortunately, it's not something that we are seeing right now.

Recently, you've actually been tweeting in German to try and get the message across. What made you do this?

Well, I did that because I was really angry and disturbed by the fact that Germany chose to push coal to 2038. I feel like that helps them and that doesn't help communities that are already being affected by the climate crisis. I feel like 2038 is too late. It's unnecessary and very dangerous for communities that are already facing devastating impacts of climate change.

So tweeting in German was a message to Germany, to the entire world. It was a message saying: 'I am watching you, as an activist. We are watching you and the decisions that you are making, they are not good for us. They are not good for our future. You have to reconsider and understand that we have no time left.'

427,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Who's afraid of COVID-19? Somalia's battle with the virus - The New Humanitarian,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/analysis/2021/5/5/whos-afraid-of-covid-19-somalias-battle-with-virus,"NAIROBI

With one of the weakest health systems in the world and a government in turmoil, Somalia is struggling with a new wave of coronavirus infections that will likely lead to a surge in unrecorded and unrecognised deaths, health officials and aid workers warn.

Officially, there have been more than 14,000 confirmed cases and over 720 fatalities, but “this is the tip of the iceberg,” Mohamed Mohamud Ali Fuje, chief medical adviser to the government’s COVID-19 National Task Force, told The New Humanitarian.

Somalia has a poor testing rate. Just 156,000 tests have been performed in a country of more than 15 million people, so gauging the severity of the outbreak through official data is extremely unreliable, while information on any new variants is almost non-existent.

The lack of healthcare coverage and an absence of documentation means “the actual death toll is much higher than the figures reported,” said Fuje. Most sick people are cared for at home, and the dead are typically buried according to Islamic tradition within 24 hours.

Even if patients do make it to hospital, the lack of equipment – including oxygen – means “there's almost a zero chance of surviving if one develops COVID-19 complications,"" a UN health worker in the southwestern city of Kismayo – who asked not to be named as they weren’t authorised to speak to the media – told The New Humanitarian.

Somalia received 300,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in March and has reportedly inoculated close to 120,000 people with the first jab of a two-shot rollout. But the vaccines delivered so far cover under 0.5 percent of the population.

That means the wearing of masks and social distancing remain vital, but such measures are only being very loosely adhered to. “Nobody wears a mask, let alone socially distance,” said Mogadishu-based freelance journalist and filmmaker Abdirahman Ahmed Aden. “They don’t take COVID seriously; they don’t see it as a risk.”

In the first COVID-19 wave, from April to June last year, healthcare and funeral workers reported anecdotal evidence of an unprecedented spike in fatalities, especially in the capital, Mogadishu: The number of graves dug in the city jumped by at least fourfold.

The second wave, beginning in February this year, has been even more severe. According to the official data, more people have died in the past three months than during the entire March to December period in 2020.

“In this second wave, I estimate Kismayo [alone] lost around 300 people between March and mid-April,” the UN health worker said. “Gravediggers in Kismayo were overwhelmed – so much so that [bulldozers] were being used to dig graves.""

The surge in COVID-19 cases comes as the country is in political gridlock, grappling with an electoral impasse. Delayed elections cannot happen because of a bitter stand-off between President Mohamed Abdullahi “Farmajo'' and the opposition on how to hold the polls. Armed groups loyal to opposition leaders occupy parts of Mogadishu.

“People are much more concerned by the political crisis in the country than COVID,” Aden told The New Humanitarian.

Fragile and disaster prone

Somalia has struggled with three decades of armed conflict, recurring climate shocks, and – as a result – ever-deepening levels of poverty and vulnerability.

When the pandemic hit last year, the country was already grappling with floods that had forced more than half a million people from their homes, plus the largest locust invasion for a quarter of a century that threatened the coming harvest and pasture land.

It now faces a drought emergency, with a second consecutive season of failed rains predicted. “The unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and already dire humanitarian situation in the country, [means] many lives are at stake,” humanitarian affairs minister Khadija Diriye said in a press release at the end of April.

Humanitarian action – from responding to the six million people currently in need of assistance, to mounting a coordinated COVID-19 response – is complicated by the country’s fragility and limited administrative capacity.

The internationally recognised federal government in Mogadishu is weak and its authority and edicts barely reach beyond the capital.

There are five semi-autonomous federal member states, whose relationships with Mogadishu range from ambivalent to bad. Somaliland in the northwest has declared its unilateral independence, while the violent jihadist group al-Shabab controls most of the rural hinterland, several towns, and major supply routes in the south and the centre of the country.

Al-Shabab initially ridiculed the COVID-19 threat, but has since done a U-turn and accepted the danger. It has, however, refused access to health teams to territory it controls and has urged people to reject the AstraZeneca vaccine as dangerous.

The risks of such a policy extend beyond Somalia. A large untreated reservoir of COVID-19, where variants could potentially mutate, would be not only a regional threat but possibly a global one as well.

Aid agency dependent

The federal government’s COVID-19 task force comprises government line ministries, donors, UN agencies, and NGOs. The states have created similar structures, but coordination is haphazard.

“Even the states deemed friendly to Mogadishu did not coordinate smoothly with the federal government,” Zakaria Yusuf, Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group, told The New Humanitarian. At both federal and state level, ""the capacity of government institutions… is weak”, he added.

As with all humanitarian crises in Somalia, the COVID-19 response has largely fallen to the international aid community, which is bunkered in the heavily guarded “green zone” around the airport. Grounded by insecurity and the risk of spreading the virus, aid agency staff provide planning, logistics, and expertise, but are reliant on national civil society partners to do much of the work outside.

UN agencies have provided funding and assisted the federal government and regional authorities to procure diagnostic kits and other medical supplies, which are transported around the country on humanitarian flights.

Three molecular COVID-19 testing labs have been established by the World Health Organization in Mogadishu, Garowe, and Hargeisa. The WHO also covers the operational costs, as well as providing salary support to 11 technicians. There is also one private lab in Mogadishu.

No new lockdown

Aware of the almost non-existent testing and tracing capacity, the initial response to the first wave of the pandemic by the federal government and some states was a lockdown. International and domestic flights were prohibited, schools and universities were shut, and dusk-to-dawn curfews imposed – measures that punished everyone, from the urban poor to business owners.

This time around, the authorities have been more lax, and markets, mosques, and even football stadiums have remained open. Aside from the public health messages carried by the public media – or daubed on walls – life has continued relatively normally.

covid-mogadishu-beware.jpg Abdirahman Ahmed Aden/TNH “Beware COVID-19” – graffiti in the Ceelgaab district of Mogadishu. The government has mounted public information campaigns warning of the threat of the virus, on the radio and in print.

“People wouldn’t obey the rules anymore anyway,” said Aden, the filmmaker. “At the beginning of the year, when the government said it would fine people that didn’t wear face masks, people would pull up their masks when they saw police. Now, no one bothers.”

A new lockdown in Mogadishu would be unpopular, reflecting badly on a government struggling for political support. Most people depend on a daily wage, with no welfare safety nets to fall back on.

In Mogadishu alone, more than 800,000 displaced people live in over 700 overcrowded camps and unofficial sites scattered across the city. These long-term refugees from the countryside, escaping drought and conflict, are largely unassisted and lack even basic services – including water, key to the most rudimentary COVID-19 protection measures.

“At the beginning of the year, when the government said it would fine people that didn’t wear face masks, people would pull up their masks when they saw police. Now, no one bothers.”

While the health risks of the virus aren’t immediately apparent to a lot of people, the economic effects of the pandemic have been keenly felt. The World Bank projected that COVID-19 would cut growth by 2.5 percent last year, after earlier forecasting the economy would grow by 3.2 percent.

Somalia is estimated to receive approximately $1.3 billion to $2 billion per year in remittances from its large diaspora community. The transfers are normally a lifeline for close to 30 percent of the population. But remittances fell sharply in 2020 and could decrease again this year if the global economic recovery is not as robust as hoped.

Weak and dependent, the Somali government seems to have few resources other than persuasion to battle the virus.

“From the beginning, we understood the limited capacity of our Somalia institutions,” said Fuje, the chief medical adviser. As a result, “we decided to focus on awareness campaigns to sensitise the people and limit spread.”

But these efforts don’t appear to be working, and the lesson being learnt around the world at the moment – from Brazil to India to Turkey – is that if you don’t do enough to contain a virus that can mutate so rapidly, new waves are often worse than previous peaks.

1908,FL-2017-000120-VNM,Why nations rush to help India - The Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2021/0428/Why-nations-rush-to-help-India,"Now the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, India has received extraordinary offers of aid from other countries. Even archrival Pakistan made a goodwill gesture to help relieve its neighbors unprecedented health crisis. Some aid is being given for political or strategic reasons. After all, the worlds largest democracy, with 1.3 billion people and the fifth-largest economy, is difficult to ignore. Yet look closer and youll see another motive at work: an appreciation for Indias past generosity.

As for its aid, the U.S. says it is simply being grateful. Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need, President Joe Biden said in a tweet (India also sent aid after Hurricane Katrina in 2005).

Since the coronavirus crisis began last year, India has assisted more than 100 vulnerable countries with supplies and training. Its open heart has opened the hearts of others. Its time for the world to extend aid & support to India, tweeted Volkan Bozkir, president of the United Nations General Assembl. For his part, Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said the U.N. was extremely grateful to India.

It was not always thus for India.

Only in the past two decades has it warmed up to being one of the worlds donor countries, helping mitigate the impact of foreign disasters and health emergencies. The more it has seen itself as a major power, the more India has embraced a moral obligation to assist other countries, especially as a first responder in food supplies, evacuations, and equipment.

Indian officials cite a spiritual basis for such aid in a Hindu term, daan, translated as charity without motive. In a speech in mid-April, the external affairs minister of India, Dr. S. Jaishankar, said, Even before the pandemic, India has been providing humanitarian assistance, disaster resistance to all. We have demonstrated in a practical manner, our belief that the world is a family.

Perhaps the turning point for India was its response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Its navy sent relief to coastal states hit by the tragedy, such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka. In 2015, it launched a large aid effort to Nepal after an earthquake. It has also assisted Iran during a locust attack, sent food supplies to South Sudan, and given flood relief to Cambodia and Vietnam.

Like other major donor nations, India sometimes withholds aid for strategic reasons or dispenses it as a display of soft power. But says Dr. Jaishankar, We work ... on facing disasters together.

No wonder so many countries now want to assist India. It has graciously accepted much of the aid, with little regard for whether it comes from friend or foe. Such giving is more than a type of mutual-aid society. When done out of gratitude, it also points to a greater good available to all, with no expectation of reciprocity or credit.",2021-04-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['worlds', 'nations', 'united', 'india', 'aid', 'supplies', 'work', 'world', 'pandemic', 'rush', 'countries', 'sent', 'help']",Vietnam,news article,English

973,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Tropical Cyclone Idai Destroyed More Than $1B of Southern Africa Infrastructure: UN - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2019/03/26/521672.htm,"A cyclone that tore across southern Africa this month may have destroyed more than $1 billion of infrastructure, the United Nations said, as the death toll from the storm climbed to more than 700.

After devastating Mozambique’s port city of Beira, Tropical Cyclone Idai damaged roads, bridges and dams as it moved toward eastern Zimbabwe. More than 100,000 houses were partially or completely destroyed, according to the UN. It also ruined more than 500,000 hectares of crops, just as farmers in the region were preparing to harvest their corn after a drought.

“We probably have lost about a billion dollars in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Malawi in terms of resources,” UN Economic Commission for Africa Executive Secretary Vera Songwe said in a statement. “In particular the Beira port, the signature port of Mozambique, is essentially today almost a thing of the past because of Cyclone Idai.”

‘Inland Ocean’

The UN World Food Programme last week raised the crisis classification for Mozambique to its highest level, which it said put the disaster on a par with the humanitarian crises in war-ravaged Syria and Yemen. Satellite imagery of flooding in central Mozambique showed an “inland ocean” the size of Luxembourg, the WFP said.

Before Idai struck, Mozambique had been battered by a sovereign debt crisis, with growth slowing to 3.3 percent last year — the weakest pace since 2000, when the country suffered similar flooding that killed 800 people. The latest storm may deliver a further blow to the economy, according to NKC African Economics.

“The effects of Cyclone Idai on the Mozambican economy will be severe,” said Pieter du Preez, an analyst at Paarl, South Africa-based NKC. “We expect food-price inflation to rise sharply as Mozambican authorities import food with an already weakened currency.”

In a country where almost half the population lives in poverty, the storm has hit ordinary citizens the hardest.

Tree Refuge

Rosa João, a 41-year-old Mozambican, spent two days desperately clinging to branches up a tall tree with her neighbors as she awaited rescue from the floods in Buzi, west of Beira. Below her, floodwaters reached as high as five meters (16 feet) and as she watched bodies float by.

“The hardest moment was to see the bodies float in the murky waters of the rains,” she said after Indian naval officers saved her by boat. “The current of the waters was so strong that we thought it would pull up the the tree by its roots.”

João had nothing to eat for nearly four days while waiting for rescuers, she said in an interview in Beira. Her house in Buzi was swept away, with everything in it.

As disaster relief workers shift their focus from search and rescue, fears are growing over the potential outbreak of waterborne diseases like cholera and malaria, Jane Sweeny, a spokeswoman for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, said by phone from Beira.

Once the waters have receded, tens of thousands of people like João will need to rebuild their homes and wait for the next planting season that starts at the end of the year.

1255,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Flood insurance difficult to obtain for homeowners at repeated risk - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/flood-insurance-difficult-to-obtain-for-homeowners-at-repeated-risk-1.4409568,"More Canadians have flood insurance than ever, but homeowners at repeated risk still face the most difficulty obtaining coverage, according to lobbyists.

Insurance for “overland flooding,” from rising water levels rather than sewer backups or roof seepage, has only been offered by insurers across the country since 2015. Now, about a third of Canadians have it, according to Craig Stewart of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

But homeowners in high-risk flood zones who may require repeated claims have limited options.

“Presently there really is not affordable high-risk insurance available for those that are going to be at repeated risk of flooding,” said Stewart in an interview with CTV’s Your Morning. Stewart, who leads a task force of insurers, realtors and local governments, presented recommendations to ministers earlier this year on how to protect high-risk homeowners.

“For those that are at repeated risk, we are recommending to governments that they take a hard look at strategic retreat, getting those people out of harm’s way,” he said.

Any official final solution based off the task force recommendations is likely a year away, he added. Until then, homeowners facing repeated risk of flooding have few options, as their needs would have to be subsidized by taxpayers or other policy holders, he said.

Some homeowners in that group have taken “drastic” measures to avoid risk, he said, such as putting their homes on stilts. Stewart recommends it.

According to a 2017 report by the Munk School of Global Affairs, flood-related losses have surpassed fire and theft as the primary source of property insurance claims. Despite increasing claims, a lot of Canadians aren’t even aware they live in a floodplain until they get flooded, said Stewart.

Speaking when the 2021 flood outlook was presented in Abuja, Nze said states have maintained a carefree attitude towards flood warnings over the years.

Last year, the minister sent a letter to all the state governors in Nigeria and informed them in detail of what to expect, yet not too many states are doing something about it, he said.

Nze urged state governors to use the same energy for political activities when tackling environmental challenges such as flooding.

He said: It could be avoided or eliminated. The tempo of political activities they exhibited during the elections should be replicated in tackling this disturbing issue of flooding in the states.

LGA councillors should be able to domesticate this information in their own locations but this doesnt happen.

Once the disaster occurs, they are quick to cry to high heavens, but in terms of reducing the impact of flooding before it occurs, they dont seem to be doing much.

The NIHSA DG also warned that going by historical data, there are indications that 121 LGAs in 27 states and the federal capital territory (FCT) are likely to experience flooding this year.",2021-05-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['political', 'rallies', 'flooding', 'tackling', 'occurs', 'states', 'nze', 'nigeria', 'governors', 'state', 'nihsa', 'treat', 'seriousness']",Nigeria,news article,English

People Flee as Lakes Flood

Thousands have left their livelihoods and homes as severe flooding threatens their safety. The flooding was caused by unusually heavy rain that lasted for months. Advocates say that the situation would not have been as destructive if there had been no illegal deforestation in the area.

The flooding lakes include Lake Bogoria and Lake Baringo. Before, their distance from each other was 12.5 miles or 20 kilometers. The flooding has grown too close to one another that people fear each will contaminate the other, resulting in even more threats to livelihoods and wildlife.

The Great Rift Valley's Lake System in Kenya

The Lake System of Kenya that is part of the African Great Rift Valley is a relatively shallow system and interlinked lakes. These are Lake Nakuru, Lake Elementaita, and Lake Bogoria.

The area comprises 32,034 hectares and is the habitat of 13 threatened species of birds. This system has some of the world's most diverse diversities of avian species; it is also the Lesser Flamingo's most crucial forage area. It is also a significant breeding and nesting site for the species of great white pelicans.

The area also has significant mammalian fauna, the most important of which is the Rothschild's giraffe, black rhino, greater kudu, cheetah, wild dogs, and lions.

It is also famous as a study site for major ecological processes.

Lake Baringo

Meanwhile, Lake Baringo is also located in Kenya in the west-central region. It is located 975 meters or 3,200 feet above sea level. Its area is 129 km2 or 50 mi2, with a length of 18 kilometers, a width of 8 kilometers, and a depth averaging 5 meters.

It is a freshwater lake without any visible outlet; instead, it seeps into the lavas on its north side. Biodiversity is also abundant in the lake, including various crocodiles and hippopotamuses. It is vital for the livelihood of the Njamus/Njemps and Kamasya groups, who utilize it to harvest tilapia fish, herd their livestock, and plant crops.



Kenya Lake System

Meanwhile, the Kenya lake system has three alkaline lakes on the Great Rift Valley's floor. It has high biodiversity, including a hundred migratory bird species, including the Black-Necked Grebe, Pied Avocet, African Spoonbill, Gull Billed Tern, Little Grebe, Black Winged Stilt, Yellow-Billed Stork, and Grey-Headed Gull. It is part of the critical Eurasian-African avian migratory flyway where billions travel back and forth their breeding grounds in the north and their wintering areas in the south.



Managing and Protecting the Lake System

This area has legal protection, updated management plans, as well as adequate hands-on management. Sustaining this management system is essential in addressing various issues. Management includes management of catchment level development and threats, particularly on groundwater, forest cover, and surface pollution. And participatory and intersectoral governance, especially regarding environmental impact assessment and creating better ecological connectivity among the system's various parts.

All of these delicate components are currently being threatened by the flooding, which can merge Baringo and Bogoria lakes.

1220,FL-2019-000179-CAN,New Brunswick will keep flooding. We have to adapt - Toronto Star,https://projects.thestar.com/climate-change-canada/new-brunswick,"Flooding routinely costs Canadians more than any other natural disaster in terms of property damage. Costs have skyrocketed in recent years. Average insured losses across the country from water-related severe weather events, which include flooding, were $143 million per year between 1983 and 2008, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada. Since 2009 the annual average has increased to $595 million, which doesn’t account for uninsured losses.

Pomeroy said he would like to see Canada put more resources into flood forecasting and prediction by creating a federal flood forecasting system. Currently flood forecasting is done by the provinces. “We’re the only G7 country without a national flood model,” he said, adding that we could “tremendously reduce” the damage from floods with more sophisticated forecasting.

Although the water levels for this year’s flood in New Brunswick were nearly as high as last year, residents were more prepared thanks to earlier warnings and the still-fresh memories of last year’s havoc. But being ready for the flood didn’t stop it from coming.

Figures have not been released on the extent of property damage this year, but at least 1,425 people voluntarily evacuated, according to the New Brunswick Red Cross. The floods also forced dozens of road closures, including a section of the Trans-Canada Highway, which was closed for more than a week.

New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs said during this year’s flood that his province must adapt because “the flooding is going to keep happening.” He has talked about trying to get people out of flood zones and mused about building a spillway in Saint John to mitigate what he called the “Reversing Falls pinch,” where the river is forced through its narrowest passage before flowing into the Bay of Fundy.



“The (question) is how quickly has (climate change) ramped up based on human activity and how quickly has it ramped up based on global change.” —Blaine Higgs, New Brunswick premier

But Higgs, whose government has only been in power since November, has been criticized for his lack of urgency and action on dealing with the root causes of climate change. He is part of the coalition of conservative premiers opposing the federal carbon tax, and in a recent exchange in Question Period he seemed to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that human activity is the driver of climate change. “We’ve seen a climate change activity that has ramped up in the last number of years. I don’t think anyone is going to deny that,” he said in response to an opposition question asking if he believed there was a climate emergency. “The (question) is how quickly has that ramped up based on human activity and how quickly has it ramped up based on global change.”

Higgs’ office did not respond to questions from the Star asking him to clarify what he meant by “global change.”

Higgs adopted the climate change action plan produced by the previous Liberal government under Brian Gallant, and his office says the government continues to work toward implementing that plan. New Brunswick has reduced its emissions by 28 per cent since 2005, largely due to the closing of outdated coal and oil-fired power plants and restructuring in the forestry sector. The province said it’s on track to meet its goal of a 30-per-cent reduction by 2030.

David Coon, New Brunswick’s Green Party leader, said Higgs has focused more on fighting the carbon tax than on fighting climate change, but he hopes the severity of recent floods will inspire more action. “We’ve squandered a lot of time and now we’re suffering the consequences.”

It was still early days in this year’s flood when Greg MacCallum, the director of New Brunswick’s Emergency Measures Organization, issued a stern warning. If you’re thinking of evacuating, he said, you probably should. “This is the time.”

Bruce and Marian Langhus were already comfortably settled into the Days Inn hotel in Oromocto, home to many flood refugees this year. The Langhuses, both retired geologists, moved into the hotel a couple of days before MacCallum’s warning, when the water rose uncomfortably high at their riverfront home and business, The Lang House Bed & Breakfast, in the village of Gagetown, about 40 km downriver from Maugerville.

Like Markus Harvey, the Langhuses are trying to live with the flood. They bought their 139-year-old house in 2015 as part of their retirement plans and didn’t want those plans derailed by a little water. Or a lot of water, as was the case last year when more than a foot filled their main floor. When the water receded, the whole floor had to be gutted and redone. But they figured it would be foolish to simply rebuild what they had before.

“We both had the feeling that last year was the new normal,” Bruce says over coffee at the Days Inn. “We knew it was going to happen again.”",2019-06-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['adapt', 'change', 'water', 'brunswick', 'ramped', 'higgs', 'flood', 'climate', 'days', 'flooding', 'question', 'quickly']",Canada,news article,English

Two water treatment plants of Delhi Jal Board (DJB) were operating at a reduced capacity. Raghav Chadha, vice-chairperson of Delhi Jal Board, on Sunday, had advised citizens to use water judiciously as the supply will remain affected.

Delhi government officials said that Chadha will also visit Bhagirathi Water Treatment Plant on Monday to take stock of the situation and also check its preparedness to deal with the situation.

In a series of tweets on Sunday, Chadha said that turbidity in raw water collected from Delhi’s Upper Ganga Canal had increased to an “unprecedented level of 8,000 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) because of the recent Uttarakhand floods.”

In the aftermath of #UttarakhandDisaster, turbidity in raw water fetched by Delhi from Upper Ganga Canal has increased to unprecedented levels (8000 NTU).

“Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi water treatment plants are currently operating at reduced capacity due to the increased turbidity in water,” he said.

Turbidity is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. Turbidity is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). High turbidity can be caused by debris, silt, mud, algae, plant pieces, melting glaciers, sawdust, wood ashes or chemicals in the water.

“The Delhi Jal Board urges citizens to use water judiciously. Water tankers inadequate numbers are being deployed and all possible efforts being made to reduce turbidity,” he tweeted.

Government officials said that as an interim measure, coagulants are being added in the water to help treat it. They said that the water quality should return to normal on Monday.

Coagulants are substances that help particles in liquid clump together and form clots which can then be filtered out easily.

Officials said that the two treatment plants were affected on Sunday night and water production capacity had to be reduced to 20% at Sonia Vihar Water Treatment Plant and 90% at Bhagirathi.

A glacier broke in the Tapovan-Reni area of Chamoli district last Sunday, which led to massive flooding in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers and damaged houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project.

The rescue and search operations were briefly halted at NTPC’s Tapovan hydel project on Thursday afternoon after police in Uttarakhand issued an alert over rising water levels in the Alaknanda river and its tributary Dhauliganga, officials said. As rescue operations continued for the ninth day at Tapovan Tunnel in Chamoli’s Joshimath, so far 53 bodies have been retrieved, the State Disaster Response Force was quoted as saying by ANI.

The Uttarakhand Police has said the Alaknanda river at Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal is now flowing at a normal level and no alert has been issued by the district administration in this regard, according to ANI.

Right now the Senate has 24 Republicans, 2 Democrats who caucus with the Republicans and 23 other Democrats. Mr. Steyer has not said what he will spend in the districts, but his previous pattern indicates it will be hundreds of thousands of dollars for each candidate — a huge amount for a Washington State race.

In 2013, Mr. Steyer’s group spent $275,000 in Washington to help ensure the election of four pro-environment candidates to the local council in Whatcom County, where candidates normally spend less than $25,000 for a single race. As a result, prospects are now dim for council approval of a proposed $600 million port in Whatcom near the border with British Columbia, which, if constructed, would facilitate the shipment of 48 million tons of coal annually to Asia from Montana and Wyoming.

The port would be a lifeline for the states’ coal producers, who anticipate the shutdown of American coal-fired power plants because of emissions limits proposed by the Obama administration and hope to send their coal via rail to the proposed Washington port. But Mr. Inslee and Mr. Steyer see them as a climate disaster in the making.

Mr. Steyer’s money has not always bought results. In 2013 his group also spent $250,000 in a special election to try to oust Jan Angel, a Republican House member who opposes Mr. Inslee’s climate plans, and was running for a state Senate seat last fall. But Ms. Angel raised money throughout the state and won the election.

“Thank God that the people of my district were smart enough not to be purchased,” Ms. Angel said. “When you have people with deep pockets like Tom Steyer coming in and trying to trash candidates, spending this kind of money, it’s a sad day for our democracy.”

Others are equally outraged. “It’s ridiculous that money coming from outside the state is trying to influence our votes,” said Rick Tjoelker, an auto mechanic in Lynden, Wash., who bristled at Mr. Inslee’s climate campaign.",2014-08-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['policy', 'die', 'climate', 'money', 'senate', 'candidates', 'mr', 'port', 'goes', 'inslees', 'steyer', 'oysters', 'washington', 'proposed', 'state', 'stump']",China,news article,English

The flood projections show varying severity across parts of the country.

In summary, the 2021 AFO forecast indicates that 302 local government areas (LGAs) in 36 states including the FCT will fall within the moderate probable flood risk areas.

It is expected from the forecast that 121 LGAs in 28 states will fall within the highly probable risk areas.

The states surrounding Rivers Niger and Benue are, without doubt, going to experience severe flooding.

Floods come with attendant health risks through the contamination of potable water sources. The 2021 flooding will be exacerbated by the continuing ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The minister noted that the 2012 flood which brought massive destruction of lives and property across the country necessitated the creation of a proper mechanism to prepare Nigerians to confront a reoccurrence.

In September 2018, heavy rains were experienced in Nigeria which caused severe flooding in 129 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of 12 States which affected 2,321,592 people, based on the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) situation report. An estimated 722,741 people were internally displaced, and 351,236 people had immediate humanitarian needs in food; shelter; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and health.

On 17 September, the NEMA declared a state of emergency in four of the worst-affected states (Niger, Kogi, Anambra and Delta), where thousands of communities had been forced to evacuate from submerged settlements and seek refuge in temporary Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps. As the Niger River continued to flow above danger level, and additional dams were released, a state of emergency also was declared in five more states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Taraba, Kebbi and Adamawa) on 11 October 2018. The flooding situation exceeded thresholds of local capacity to respond to the people in need.

The floods resulted in rapid population displacement, destruction of shelters, extensive losses to livelihoods and the local economy, in addition to high rates of water-borne diseases among the affected population and their host communities. Internally Displaced Persons staying with host communities were particularly susceptible to cholera and other water-borne diseases due to the poor access to potable water, hygiene infrastructure and medical care in those locations. These challenges also impacted displaced people in IDP camps, who similarly lacked access to basic water and sanitation services.

Upon the request of Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), IFRC launched an Emergency Appeal in October 2018 for 5.4 million Swiss francs to support 300,000 flood-affected people in the areas of focus of shelter and non-food items, livelihoods and basic needs; health; WASH; and protection, gender and inclusion (PGI) for 9 months. The objective was to provide lifesaving and recovery interventions in 6 out of the over 18 states in Nigeria affected by flooding. The intervention focused on 6 states identified during the multi-sector needs assessment as those in most need of assistance, namely Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Niger, Rivers and Bayelsa.

The initial plan was to have the affected population supported in an IDP camp setup (schools and health facilities).

However, the flood-affected population moved out of the camps earlier than expected. The government also aimed to vacate the schools that were used to host the IDPs to be vacated to avoid the disruption of the resuming of classes in January 2019. As a result, these changes affected the geographical context of the operation as the flood-affected population dispersed to different Local Government Areas (LGAs) and villages.

The operation had to strategize to ensure planned activities were to be held in their current location. Even though all affected families returned to their communities after the acute phase, the flooding resulted in long-term impacts, including a cholera outbreak in December when IDPs returned to their communities. The devastating loss to livelihoods and trauma of displacement also created psychosocial needs within the affected population.",2020-04-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['states', 'communities', 'n', 'nigeria', 'plan', 'needs', 'report', 'local', 'flood', 'population', 'emergency', 'mdrng025', 'water', 'flooding', 'final', 'displaced', 'response', 'appeal', 'affected']",Nigeria,news article,English

786,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Frank McCourt is offered $1.2 billion for Dodgers - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-xpm-2011-sep-01-la-sp-dodgers-mccourt-sale-20110902-story.html,"In an international twist in the Dodgers’ ownership saga, Frank McCourt has been offered $1.2 billion to sell the team to a group indirectly financed by the government of China.

The bid is headed by Los Angeles Marathon founder Bill Burke, according to a letter sent to McCourt on Tuesday. The letter was disclosed to The Times by two people familiar with its content but not authorized to discuss it publicly.

The proposed sale price would set a record for a Major League Baseball team. However, the bid was received with skepticism within MLB, where executives wondered whether the proposal might be used by McCourt to stir negotiations with other potential buyers or to persuade a Bankruptcy Court judge to keep McCourt in charge of the team.

“There are questions within the sports industry about whether this is a genuine offer,” said one industry consultant who works extensively with MLB and other professional sports leagues.

Advertisement

The offer was unsolicited, according to a person who had spoken with McCourt’s representatives but was not authorized to discuss the conversation.

It is uncertain whether the embattled Dodgers owner is receptive to the offer. McCourt has said that he had no interest in selling the Dodgers and that he intended to remain the owner after the team emerges from bankruptcy protection.

Steve Sugerman, a spokesman for McCourt, declined to comment on whether McCourt had received the letter and whether he would consider selling the team.

In a brief telephone interview, Burke declined to discuss the bid. “I have no comment at this time,” he said.

Forbes magazine estimates the Dodgers’ worth at $800 million. McCourt bought the Dodgers for $430 million in 2004, and the team and related entities carry debts of “over $550 million,” according to a June 20 letter sent to McCourt from MLB Commissioner Bud Selig.

The bid terms proposed by the Burke group call for an all-cash payment to buy the Dodgers, all real estate related to the team and the team’s media rights, according to the letter. Attorneys for McCourt have said he could try to keep Dodger Stadium and the surrounding parking lots even if he sold the team.

The offer would expire in 21 days, according to the letter, with the goal of closing a deal within 90 days, subject to the approvals of MLB and the Bankruptcy Court.

The letter did not say whether the bid would be subject to the approval of Jamie McCourt, the ex-wife of Frank McCourt, who claims half-ownership of the team. But Jamie McCourt probably would endorse a deal since she had asked the judge overseeing the couple’s divorce to order the Dodgers sold, a request that was then withdrawn in deference to the Bankruptcy Court.

The bid was presented on behalf of the Burke group by Signal Capital Management of New York. The firm has offices in Beijing, according to its website. Shane Rodgers, its chairman and chief executive officer, said in an email that the firm would not comment “on any potential or proposed transactions.”

The letter did not specify who would finance the Burke bid, other than to say the money would come from “certain state-owned investment institutions of the People’s Republic of China” and unidentified American investors. Foreign investment is not necessarily an obstacle to MLB ownership; the Seattle Mariners’ ownership group includes a significant Japanese presence.

McCourt has spoken with at least two other groups about a sale of some portion of the Dodgers and could use the $1.2 billion as a minimum value in those discussions, said a person familiar with them but not authorized to talk about them publicly.

McCourt also could cite the offer in Bankruptcy Court to counter MLB claims he has irreparably mismanaged the team.

Advertisement

It is uncertain whether sale discussions with any group might explain why McCourt’s attorneys have yet to pursue the cable television rights sale that they said would be the key to getting the Dodgers out of Bankruptcy Court.

Bruce Bennett, the Dodgers’ lead bankruptcy attorney, had promised to move forward on the issue at an Aug. 16 court hearing but did not do so. Fox Sports has threatened to sue for damages if the Dodgers void the two years remaining on the current cable contract to pursue a new one.

McCourt has discussed the sale of at least a partial share of the Dodgers with at least two other groups, said a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. It is unlikely Selig would sanction any deal that did not include an exit path for McCourt, but McCourt has signaled his intent to challenge Selig’s authority in court.

The record sale price for a major league franchise is $845 million, set two years ago when the Ricketts family bought the Chicago Cubs from Tribune Co., publisher of The Times.

That deal included the team, Wrigley Field and a 25% stake in a cable sports channel. The Burke group proposes paying almost half again as much for the Dodgers, their stadium and a chance to start a cable sports channel or negotiate a new cable television contact.

Despite the Forbes estimate, the team could be worth from $900 million to $1.1 billion, said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd, a Chicago-based sports industry consulting firm.

But with Fox at risk of losing the Dodgers to rival Time Warner’s fledgling Lakers channel, the bidding on the TV rights could be so robust that the team itself could fetch $1.2 billion or more in “a full-fledged auction” in Bankruptcy Court, said a prominent sports investment banker, who declined to be identified because he could represent potential bidders for the Dodgers.

Burke sold the Los Angeles Marathon in 2004, building the race into one of the largest in the United States but jousting with city officials in various financial skirmishes, including disputes over reimbursement for city services and ownership of the L.A. Marathon name. Burke is the husband of retired Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.

1024,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Flash Flooding: Is Egypt Really Prepared? - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online,https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/311488/Egypt/Politics-/Flash-Flooding-Is-Egypt-Really-Prepared-.aspx,"In 2015, seven lives were lost in Alexadria to flash flooding. However, official reports covering that period had expected little to no rain. In the following years various promises were made to prevent an incident of this sort from occurring again.

Yet, in the wake of global increases in the effects of climate change, Mahmoud Shahin – the Head of Meteorological Authority's Analysis Center – two weeks ago warned that Egypt ought to expect a flood season around the 22 September.

Meanwhile, the question of our preparedness for dealing with the consequences of climate shifts remains unanswered. Whilst previous floods have resulted in lost lives, damage to private and public property, power cuts, closing of roads, road accidents and public outrage, Shahin cautions that the highest amount of rainfall of 2018 could be this autumn.

While official reports failed to predict the 2015 Alexandria flash flood, according to a statement on the official website of the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, they assert their reliance on a precise warning system through the monitoring of weather patterns all in an effort to ensure preparedness for heavy rainfall and flash floods.

In response to the loss of twenty-six lives across three governorates in 2016, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi promised to improve drainage networks within the span of one year. By December 2017, he issued a statement assuring that these improvements have taken place. In contrast, in another call for improvements, necessary after the flash flooding earlier in 2018 that affected many cities including Cairo, former Prime Minister Sherif Ismail called for precautions to be taken in all governorates to ensure the prevention of flash floods.

In a statement to Masrawy last week engineer Abd El-Latif Khaled, head of the irrigation department, said that for the past two months a systematic maintenance and clearance of waterways had taken place, including 117 artificial water passages. He added that the ministry ensures its preparedness for this flash flood season through dams and man-made lakes, robust equipment and established outlines for the direct coordination between governorates.

Mohamed Faheem, the Executive Manager of the Information Center of Climate Change, said to Al-Ahram Online that the effects of global warming are not merely confined to rainfall. The summer is expected to get longer and hotter, in which it is predicted to exceed 50% of the year. Meanwhile the winter is expected to get shorter and colder. He elaborated that the changes are obvious and accumulative, and that they are expected to have exponential impact on agricultural production.

Faheem, who anticipates rainfall throughout the southeast of Egypt to start around 7 September, states that preparedness for flash floods also varies by terrain: the desert has the largest capacity for storing excess rain but the facilities are lacking, agricultural land should be using the water for rationed irrigation, and urban areas are in desperate need for drainage channels as well as possibly filtering and draining water into canals and rivers.

""2-3 billion meter cubed of rainfall is expected to fall this winter throughout Egypt. If we had the facilities to store this water, which we don't, we could plant a million acres in the desert"", Faheem says.

He asserts water levels of rivers and canals should be reduced to allow for expected increases in water levels. He added that sewers are currently too overloaded to drain rain water.

On September 1, Saint Catherine in South Sinai had unanticipated rain which surprisingly caused no damage. The rain provided water for irrigation and formed ponds and lakes between valleys, aiding wildlife. The lack of damage was attributed by many to be due to the precautions taken by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. On the other hand, Faheem stated that it was not a flash flood, as due to the nature of the terrain, the rain was successfully stored. He attributed the lack of damages to the nature of the terrain and lack of built infrastructure.

Faheem sums up, ""We are not ready for the next rain season and cities are expected to suffer severe damages due to the lack of separate drainage channels, thus the rain is expected to overload sewer channels.""

Globally, there is growing significant alarm over these changing conditions caused by climate change. Most recently, typhoon Jebi caused severe damage in Japan forcing the closure of Kansai Airport, near Osaka.

On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a speech at the UN Headquarters that ""runaway climate change"" is an imminent probability if the current attitude to climate change remains till 2020. Runaway climate change is a theoretically anticipated point in which the accumulative effects of climate change would create an irreversible loop of extreme heat, wildfires, storms and floods. This point is suggested by some scientists to be the cause of the inhabitability of Venus.

In the midst of different definitions of what constitutes preparedness for adverse weather, and conflicting views on climate change and ways in which to potentially deal with it, the only certainty is that increasing rainfall and colder winter ought to be expected.

1272,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Governments look to buyouts for flood victims - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/repeated-rebuild-in-floodplain-1.5118331,"As the Ottawa River begins to recede after bursting its banks for the second time in two years, politicians are beginning to ask whether it makes sense to allow residents to rebuild in flood-prone areas.

""The federal government and the provinces and municipalities need to think through very carefully how we prevent ourselves from simply doing the same old thing over and over and over again, and expecting a different result,"" Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters earlier this week after touring flooded areas of Ottawa and Clarence-Rockland.

Federal and provincial ministers responsible for emergency management have been discussing the growing cost of natural disasters, and how to build infrastructure to better withstand extreme weather, Goodale said.

Quebec's premier has also opened the discussion about offering homeowners financial incentives to move.

François Legault said his government would compensate homeowners in neighbourhoods such as Pointe-Gatineau up to $100,000 for flood damage, but $200,000 to move to higher, dryer ground.

Could the federal government offer similar incentives?

""We're not taking anything off the table at this stage,"" Goodale said.

Should people be allowed to build on flood plains? CBC News Ottawa 1:02 Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says all levels of government are responsible for managing flood plains, though Mayor Jim Watson said the City of Ottawa couldn't afford to offer buyouts to residents. 1:02

The case for buyouts

Buyouts should be ""an essential part of the toolkit"" for managing flood risk, according to Daniel Henstra, a political science professor at the University of Waterloo who studies climate change adaptation and emergency management policies.

""The upfront cost of a buyout program, although high, is undoubtedly less than the long-term costs of repeatedly rebuilding properties in high-risk areas when we know they're going to flood again,"" Henstra told Ottawa Morning.

Henstra said the voluntary buyout Quebec is offering is a good start.

""For many people ... the offer probably won't be enough to cover their mortgage. But I do suspect that many who have been flooded multiple times would jump at the opportunity.""

'At some point, it's a little bit too much' CBC News Ottawa 1:06 Mayor Jim Watson and Coun. Eli El-Chantiry say some residents of west Ottawa communities hit hard by two floods and a tornado in the last two years are thinking of leaving the area. 1:06

Alberta offered similar voluntary buyouts after the extensive flooding in 2013, and Henstra said about one-third of eligible homeowners took the province up on the offer.

For those unwilling to leave, Henstra said governments will need to have ""tough conversations"" about the conditions under which they're allowed to stay.

City can't afford buyouts, mayor says

But Mayor Jim Watson said the City of Ottawa couldn't afford similar buyouts.

""We wouldn't have the financial means to do it at the city level with property tax dollars,"" Watson said.

We're human. I keep saying my community is the most resilient, but at some point it's a little bit too much. - Coun . Eli El-Chantiry

Instead, Watson said such a buyout would have to come from the Ontario government.

""If this is going to happen every couple of years, it's extremely stressful on the families and it's very expensive for governments,"" Watson said while surveying the flood damage in Fitzroy Harbour earlier this week.

John Yakabuski, the MPP for Renfew–Nipissing–Pembroke, said those discussions will happen.

""I think there will be a good opportunity when this disaster has been dealt with,"" Yakabuski told Ottawa Morning.

Local rules

In Ottawa, developers aren't allowed to build within the boundaries of a one-in-100-year flood plain, which are mapped by local conservation authorities.

The story is different for existing homes, which would typically have to be rebuilt on the same footprint, in the same location. Residents affected by the 2017 floods were given special permission to rebuild in such a way that their homes would be safer from future flooding.

Now, after the second flood in two years and last fall's destructive tornadoes, some west end homeowners are wondering if they should bother trying again.

Their councillor, Eli El-Chantiry, said some residents have had enough.

""Sometimes it'll get to people. We're human. I keep saying my community is the most resilient, but at some point it's a little bit too much.""",2019-05-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['ottawa', 'look', 'governments', 'residents', 'safety', 'minister', 'mayor', 'buyouts', 'flood', 'watson', 'victims', 'goodale', 'ralph', 'jim']",Canada,news article,English
172,Drought Sri Lanka,The world has a surplus of food. So why can’t we eliminate hunger? - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/the-world-has-a-surplus-of-food-so-why-cant-we-eliminate-hunger/article34709360/,"Never has there been so much food in the world. Farmers have grown far more this past year than all seven billion of us could possibly consume, so mountains of surplus foodstuffs are piling up in dozens of countries, including Canada. And the price of that food is falling fast.

Yet there is hunger. Not in many years have so many been at risk of starvation: For the first time since 2011, the United Nations is using the word ""famine"" to describe the looming situation in half a dozen countries. On Tuesday, the UN warned that a million people in the Horn of Africa, Yemen and parts of Nigeria are ""on the brink of famine"" and 20 million live in areas where harvests have failed and malnutrition is on the rise.

How can both these things be true? Somehow, the Reuters news wire service carried these two headlines on Tuesday, within hours of each other: ""Grains piled on runways, parking lots, fields amid global glut"" and ""Risk of mass starvation rising rapidly in Africa, Yemen.""

Story continues below advertisement

Starvation does not happen because of a shortage of food. And starvation does not happen because there are too many people. There is plenty enough food for all the world's people – in fact, with a little effort, we could double the amount produced. Governments are paying farmers to cut back their harvests, as we have run out of storage space.

Nor does starvation happen in 2017 because food is too expensive. That was the case 10 years ago, when soaring commodity prices sent food costs rising after four decades of declining to their lowest share of household budgets in history. In response to those high prices, investment flooded into agriculture, and land under cultivation expanded greatly. Now, those lands have produced an almost unprecedented three-year sequence of strong harvests, and the world is awash in food.

One consequence is that food prices have finally started falling back to historic lows. In March, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization announced that global food prices had fallen 2.8 per cent in a month: vegetable oils by 6.2 per cent, milk by 2.3 per cent (the only product experiencing a price rise was meat).

The world currently has a third more rice and wheat in storage than it is expected to consume, sell or turn into fuel in 2017. The combined world surplus of wheat, corn, rice and soya recently passed 670 million tonnes, or enough to feed all of China for a year.

Why didn't someone just ship some of that surplus food to Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria and South Sudan? That, after all, is what usually happens when drought or emergencies cause crops to fail. Sri Lanka, for example, is also experiencing a drought this year – its worst water shortage in four decades, one that has wiped out the entire year's rice crop. Yet nobody in rice-dependent Sri Lanka is starving: The government simply spent $350-million to import enough rice to make up to for the losses. This hurt the Sri Lankan currency, but the economy has kept growing and people are eating.

That is what happens when drought strikes countries that are at peace: They import more food. None of the African and Middle Eastern countries facing famine this year are at peace. And in many cases, the famine has nothing to do with drought or crop failure: In northeastern Nigeria, the war with Boko Haram has prevented farmers from cultivating crops; if the fighting causes them to miss the May-June planting season, seven million will be at risk of starvation.

In Somalia, the al-Shabab militant group continues to block food aid and the organizations that deliver it, and disrupts or sells food shipments for its own needs. In South Sudan, the government and security forces have blocked humanitarian aid, putting its horrendous civil war ahead of the lives of its people.

In 2017, only war and extremism prevent people from eating. It should be a priority for every developed-country government to break the barriers and give these people a share of our global food hoard to get through this crisis. They then need to develop the capacity to connect their countries back to agricultural markets. Most of the famine victims are the children of farmers; their death would be the world's most preventable, and heartbreaking, catastrophe.",2017-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['cant', 'million', 'farmers', 'world', 'surplus', 'countries', 'starvation', 'hunger', 'food', 'eliminate', 'drought', 'famine', 'prices', 'rice']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

GUWAHATI: With 22 embankments already breached in this year’s second spate of floods, the State Water Resources Department is gearing up to tackle the situation for the remaining portion of the monsoon season. Official sources said that 29 embankments were breached during the last year.

The original budgetary allocation for the department during 2019-20 is Rs 125 crore under Flood Management Programme (FMP). However, considering the damage that have already taken place, the Department has drawn up an additional estimate of Rs 80.24 crore for the financial year 2019-20 under FMP wherein works are undertaken for repair and strengthening of the existing embankments. Of the estimated amount, while Rs 63.63 crore has been earmarked for the Brahmaputra valley, Rs 16.61 crore is for the Barak valley.

On Tuesday morning itself, the CC Bund at Number 2 Borghuli area in Kaliabor Legislative Assembly Constituency got breached due to erosion by the Brahmaputra. Though water did not flow through it as the water level of the river was below the height of the bund yet there is all the likelihood of water surging in through the almost 50 metre breached portion once the water level rises. Water Resources Minister Keshab Mahanta visited the site and took stock of the situation during the day.

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has already asked the departments concerned to submit their estimates of additional fund requirement for taking up various flood-damage repair related works to be placed for Supplementary Demands during the forthcoming Assembly session from July 26.

Alexandria Governor Mohamed al-Sharif said that these heavy rains have strained the capacity of the city’s dilapidated sewage network and its pumping stations.

He called on all sewage network officials, neighborhood heads and all concerned parties to continue sucking out water and stationing vacuum trucks in places exposed to heavy flooding.

Alexandria governorate officials called on citizens to exercise caution, follow safety instructions, and limit movement in cars until Monday to allow vacuum trucks to move easily.

It appealed to citizens to avoid driving at speeds exceeding 60 km and to maintain a greater safety distance than usual.

Warnings were also issued not to stand under dilapidated balconies and avoid all open areas, metal objects, fences and railways during lightning strikes.

Eman Shaker, the Egyptian Meteorological Authority’s (EMA) Director of Remote Sensing, warned on Friday of heavy rains on the northern coasts for Saturday and Sunday.

Shaker told Al-Masry Al-Youm that there are moderate to heavy rains are expected for the northern coasts, which include Salloum, Alexandria, Rashid, Sidi Abdel Rahman, Dabaa, Matrouh, Fayoum and Sidi Barani.

Rains will be intermittent but continuous throughout the two days, she said, potentially causing water to pool and flood.

Heavy rainfall caused overflow of the Tajan River, in northern province of Mazandaran, forcing people to evacuate the area in central parts of city of Sari.

Reports from state-run media indicate that roads leading to 70 villages in Golestan and more than 200 in Mazandaran have been flooded. 20 villages in Golestan have been evacuated.

According to the Mazandaran Crisis Management Department, the floods affected about 200 villages in the province, causing damage to 1,500 homes in urban areas and 30 to 50% of homes in rural areas. In addition, dozens of communication bridges were destroyed or damaged in neighborhoods and villages.

The head of Iran’s Crisis Management Organization reported that 40 villages in Golestan province still have no electricity.

According to Mojtaba Jamali, the Director General of the Golestan Province Crisis Management, the town of Agh Ghola in Golestan was facing the most severe problems.

Two people died after a landslide in Golestan in the past few days, Jamali announced.

Previously the minister of energy had reported that 360 villages in Golestan province and 193 villages in Mazandaran province had lost electricity.

Golestan Crisis Management Department announced on Thursday that “currently over 10 villages in this province are under water.

Videos of the recent floods show how the locals are providing help for each other when regime officials are refusing to do so.

According to the state-run Khabar Online Website, Iran floods have significantly increased in the past year with 552 cases taking place in the course of just 4 years.

The reason behind Iran’s increasing floods is the deforestation of more 30% of the northern forests, the destruction of vegetation in pastures and fields, the lack of levees, and flood walls in flood areas, the lack of river dredging, the unnatural gathering of heavy sediments behind dams, broken dams, the unconventional building of villas in agricultural land which is mostly carried out by those affiliated with the government, and the construction on river banks and river areas.

Deforestation is carried out in full by the government with “33% of forests in Iran having been destroyed”, according to state-run media. That means that the 18 million hectares of Iran’s forests have shrunk to just 12.4 million.

Last October Iran floods which hit the three provinces of Northern Khorasan, Mazandaran and Gilan provinces killed eight people.

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. I wasnt sad, Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tays land. Thats what I had to do. He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldnt be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasnt wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them, landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a soft levee girding the riverbank. She doesnt view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and youve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made. Daos mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, a very sensitive and fragile area where hard solutions [to erosion] wont work, said Dao, who has studied the regions ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land, Dao says. Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down. As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Daos words, by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tays riverbank is like a pillow that doesnt stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Daos green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses  a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, people arent afraid of flooding, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. We have learnt to live with the floods, he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive, he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yens fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the islands west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the citys famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes arent simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi Ans recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground. Dr Dao Ngo bought her own land in Triem Tay village to do her conservation work. Credit:Yen Duong Now the ecological component is extremely important. In the past it was culture, now its ecology, Hoi Ans vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local governments development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. Of course, it is difficult and it will take time, says Hung. Perhaps we wont succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation. As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemics wake, Hung doesnt want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the citys revenue. Weve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, therell be less to worry about.

Ecology-based development, in Hungs words, also means preserving the citys forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. If we achieve that, well be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals life will definitely be improved. Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. You dont see erosion here, but build-up [of land], said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. Ive never seen these trees die because of flooding, said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the rivers mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huongs family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as a fortune on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river. Le Thi Huong, 59, a mangrove palm farmer, in her home made from the palms in Cam Thanh commune. Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; thats why they protect it, Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tays sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi Ans toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

He added in statements to TEN channel, Sunday that by the end of September, we can determine the size and type of this-year-flood, as its likely to be above the average compared to previous years.

He noted that Aswan High Dam project protects Egypt from flooding, describing it as “buffer against Nile floods”.

On August 31, the permanent committee to Nile River Revenue Regulatory Committee affiliated with Egypt’s Irrigation Ministry said that the flood of Nile River this year likely to be higher than the average

The initial indicators were based on the incoming Revenue during August; however, it is still too early to make a final judgment on the type and size of this year’s flood, pending the months of September and October; the Committee said.

According to an official statement issued by the Ministry of Irrigation, the River Revenue Regulatory Committee reviewed the position of the Nile flood, and the measures taken by the Nile Water Affairs Sector and the Ministry's Planning Sector Forecasting Center, including monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the flood situation, and the quantities of water expected to arrive until the end of the current water year 2021-2022.

From January until the end of March 2017, 276,238 children, under the age of five years, have been screened for acute malnutrition, of which 19,151 children with severe acute malnutrition were admitted to nutrition treatment programmes.

UNICEF, in partnership with CARE, has built 26 Tarp-a-tents as temporary learning spaces (TLS) benefiting 2,600 children affected by Tropical Cyclone Dineo which made landfall in Inhambane.

In March, UNICEF received a contribution of US $400,173 from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support the education interventions impacted by Cyclone Dineo.

The Governments of Ireland and Italy contributed a combined total of US $426,912 to support cyclone recovery interventions in the sectors of health, water and sanitation and education in Inhambane.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The seasonal year 2016/2017 was atypical for Mozambique. It was characterized by an El Niño-induced drought, floods in some parts of the southern and central regions of the country, a cyclone making landfall in Inhambane, conflict driven internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Manica and Sofala, and cholera outbreaks throughout the country. All of these issues required coordinated multi-sectoral interventions with strong leadership from UNICEF. Although officially the emergency season in Mozambique (October-to March), ended in March and coincided with the rainy/cyclone season, there are still clear humanitarian and recovery needs to be addressed, particularly in the context of IDPs, Education, Health and WASH.

The cholera outbreak in Maputo, Nampula and Tete provinces is practically under control. There are however reports of an increased influx of returnees from Malawi and Zimbabwe into Tete and Manica provinces. In response, UNICEF is participating jointly in an IOM-led displacement tracking matrix (DTM) exercise in Manica to monitor the implementation progress of UNICEF supported interventions to IDPs and to assess evolving needs.",2017-05-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'children', 'education', 'cyclone', 'humanitarian', 'affected', 'health', 'unicef', 'report', 'situation', 'interventions', 'targeted', 'idps', 'manica', '2017']",Mozambique,news article,English

622,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,The startup CEO accused of firing employees before their stock option vest admits: 'I can be hard edged' - Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/startup-ceo-accused-scandalously-firing-001141080.html,"Tanium Orion Hindawi

Orion Hindawi, the CEO of Tanium, has just posted an open letter after news stories broke this week that accused him of a litany of bad behavior.

In one story, employees alleged that he had fired some people before their stock options vested in an attempt to keep his controlling interest in the company from being diminished (a charge the company denies). They also accused him of mocking and insulting people and spreading sex or drug rumors about current and former staffers, according to the report from Bloomberg.

At least 10 senior executives have left or been fired from the richly-valued security startup since the summer, the Wall Street Journal reported.

On top of that, the WSJ uncovered that Tanium had been giving prospective customers a view into a hospital's live network while not fully protecting the identity of the hospital, a situation the company admits to.

The hospital also told Business Insider that it was unaware that the company was accessing parts of its live network and showing it to Titanium prospects and that it is now ""investigating."" That kind of thing, as you might imagine, would be a major no-no for a security vendor to do, if it proves true. The reason companies buy security software is to protect themselves from unauthorized prying eyes.

In the open letter, Tanium admits that it did use the hospital's live network in product demos, as well as other customers' networks, but says it can only do so if it has been granted explicit permission including the technology for remote access.

As for accusations of brutish behavior, Hindawi took a lesson from PR crises 101 by including a come-clean section in his letter where he explained himself, admitting he ""can be hard-edged"" and that the company can be ""a stressful environment.""

Here's the heart of that section (emphasis ours):

I also want to say there are some things they got right about their portrayal of Tanium. We see the mission of protecting and serving our customers as nearly sacred, and to that end it is absolutely true that we’ve built a culture that is highly demanding and mission oriented, and that we expect our employees to drive themselves hard with that same commitment to the mission that we have. When taken to an extreme, that drive can make for a stressful environment, which we are working to balance and prevent. It is true that I personally can be hard-edged, and that I’ve had to apologize to people at Tanium when I’ve gotten too sharp at times. It is true that we fire people when they don’t meet our ethical or performance standards, and we understand that from the outside that may raise questions about the number of people leaving.

Story continues

Tanium was founded by Hindawi and his father a decade ago. It came to prominence after raising $287 million of venture investment at a valuation of $3.7 billion. Much of that came from the VC powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz after urging from former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, an adviser for Andreessen Horowitz. Sinofsky once called Tanium's technology ""magic.""

Here's the full open letter from Hindawi addressed to the company's customers.

I can imagine that many of you are getting tired of waking up to the bad Tanium press stories hitting your inbox in the last week. Most of you know our company well, and reading these stories can be disturbing to all of us. Unfortunately, it’s not always effective to use the press directly to set facts straight in circumstances like this. That said, I don’t think they’re painting an accurate picture of our company, so I’m reaching out directly to all of you to give our side of this.

First, I would like to directly address the question we’re being asked, which is whether we have used customers’ environments for demos. Tanium is an on-premises deployed platform. Unless you explicitly provide it to us (which the vast majority of our customers never should or would) we do not have access to your on-premises installation of Tanium, and won’t ask for it unless we’re helping support you and only for that purpose. We do have a few customers who have agreed for us to use their environments for external demos, and have provided that access to us. Since 2015, we’ve insisted that before a customer is willing to let us demo from their environment, regardless of the access they offer us, we document that in writing and agree on what data we can show to ensure there isn’t any confusion. Other than the few customers who have signed those documents and provided us remote access to their Tanium platforms, we do not — and in fact cannot — demonstrate customer environments with Tanium.

That said, we take responsibility for mistakes in the use of this particular customer’s demo environment. We should have done better anonymizing that customer’s data. While viewers didn’t connect the demo environment to that customer for years, and we do not believe we ever put our customer at risk with the data we showed. Looking at those demos, we see there are easy things we should have done to obscure and anonymize further.

More generally, I also want to say there are some things they got right about their portrayal of Tanium. We see the mission of protecting and serving our customers as nearly sacred, and to that end it is absolutely true that we’ve built a culture that is highly demanding and mission oriented, and that we expect our employees to drive themselves hard with that same commitment to the mission that we have. When taken to an extreme, that drive can make for a stressful environment, which we are working to balance and prevent. It is true that I personally can be hard-edged, and that I’ve had to apologize to people at Tanium when I’ve gotten too sharp at times. It is true that we fire people when they don’t meet our ethical or performance standards, and we understand that from the outside that may raise questions about the number of people leaving. And it is true that as we’ve grown, we haven’t matured processes in some areas as quickly as we’ve added people, which is something we’re working hard to build faster. These are in fact all things we need to work on, and we’re doing so every day.

What is not true is that we have a toxic culture. Mission-oriented, hard-charging, disciplined, even intense, but not toxic. We do not belittle each other at work, and it is completely untrue that we fire people to save a few shares of stock. David and I are proud that many of the best people we worked with at BigFix chose to come work with us at Tanium, that many of them have done well for themselves and their families through these companies, and that they find fulfillment and joy in Tanium. I hope that I get to continue working with many of the people at Tanium for the rest of my career. That doesn’t happen if we’re stingy or cruel.

We don’t know when this news cycle is going to end and unfortunately we can’t control whether the press is wrong in the way it paints our company. That said, we can choose to learn what we can from these stories, then channel that learning and our commitment and passion for Tanium’s mission into great products and services for you. David and I are personally deeply committed to that mission, and we believe our whole team is even more motivated after these attacks on our character and company. To that end, I’d encourage you to reach out to the people you trust most at Tanium and get their view on our company and where we’re going.

It’s an honor to be a vendor and partner you trust, and we will work to earn that every day. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out directly to me.

Budalangi, Kenya â?? Leonida Oloo's worst nightmare came back to haunt her again the night of April 28, when the Nzoia River spilled over its banks in the middle of the night and engulfed the surrounding communities. ""It was shocking. I can't believe I'm still alive,"" said the 81-year-old grandmother, who lives in this remote area of western Kenya near the border with Uganda. ""I was woken up by loud screams from neighbors around midnight. I forced myself off the bed and stepped into a pool of water. Within minutes, water had risen to my neck as I shouted for help."" Oloo was luckily saved in time by local boatmen who raced through thick fog using boats and canoes to find her and other stranded neighbors. On that night, the flood left dozens of people dead and thousands homeless in several villages. ""I really thank those youths who saved my life. I have lost loved ones and friends to floods,"" said Oloo, recalling how two of her adopted children died in flooding 18 years ago that also claimed the lives of three of her cousins. Flooding happens regularly in this region, and she has lost many friends and family members over the years. She is now among families taking refuge at St. Cajetan's Catholic Church Sirimba in Budalangi and facing a bleak future even as the nation steps up efforts to contain locusts and the threat of COVID-19.

Global Sisters Report found families the day after the flooding crowded inside a church and classrooms without face masks or the ability to practice social distancing. There were shortages of health care services, tents, latrines and sanitation facilities. Children slept on mats spread out on the cobblestones while several women clutched crying babies, trying to calm them. Many said they hadn't eaten anything for days. Religious sisters are among those who've moved swiftly to provide relief measures. Within a week, the sisters were helping to distribute some food, clothes, mattresses and beddings to some of the flood victims. They are also providing the residents with soaps, hand sanitizers, masks and encouraging social distancing. Sr. Litty Thattil, a nurse at a local hospital in Budalangi, said residents living in the church compound are also suffering from malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia. The heavy rainfalls have caused most latrines to overflow, which creates the potential for a cholera outbreak and other waterborne diseases, she said.

""We have so many problems here,"" said Thattil, a member of Missionary Sisters of St. Ann, Luzern. ""Many people, especially children, are sick because of dirty water and congestions in the camps. They have not enough food, mosquito nets and blankets. People are also scared of getting coronavirus because social distancing is impossible due to overcrowding."" The troubles here are mirrored in many other parts of the country, where floods and landslides have wreaked havoc, destroying homes, roads and crops. In parts of central and northern Kenya, several homes, schools, parishes and convents have been submerged in water following days of heavy rainfall. In April, several priests and nuns had to be evacuated to safer zones after floods submerged their residential areas. The East African country has so far lost nearly 250 lives due to floods and confirmed more than 1,962 cases of COVID-19 with 63 related deaths. Locust swarms have also wiped out crops across the country, where millions of people already struggle to obtain healthy food. The government has advised those living in floodplains and landslide-prone areas to be more cautious and move to higher ground, warning that more heavy rainfall is expected in parts of western, central and the coastal region of the country. But the government hasn't offered any permanent resettlement plans for those affected by floods and unusually rainy weather. Those moving often take shelter in various schools and churches.

""I'm calling on the government to help those affected by floods especially during this time the country is battling the coronavirus pandemic."" â?? Bishop John Oballa Owaa, Ngong Diocese, Nairobi, Kenya Tweet this

At a news conference in Nairobi on May 13, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa said, ""Kenyans who have lost their lives due to floods are now 237. That is a very high number compared to those Kenyans who have lost their lives to COVID-19. With rains going on and our dams filling [up], it means more people will be affected. We are urging people in flood-prone areas, mudslide-prone areas to move to safer grounds."" The Ministry of Devolution supports Kenya's 47 counties through policy formulation and shares the function of disaster risk management between the national and county governments. The Catholic Church is urging the government to allocate resources to support more than 800,000 Kenyans affected by floods in various parts of the country. ""I'm calling on the government to help those affected by floods especially during this time the country is battling the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Bishop John Oballa Owaa of Ngong Diocese in Nairobi, Kenya, in an interview. ""We are also asking the public to move to safer grounds to avert loss of lives and properties."" Sisters, who have been distributing relief items to families affected by COVID-19 restrictions and food shortages caused by locusts destroying crops are appealing for humanitarian support in regions where landslides and floods have displaced thousands. Many feel overwhelmed by the rising numbers of flood victims that are straining already stretched resources. ""We are actually appealing to the government and well wishers to assist us with medical supplies, humanitarian relief and other assistance to help children and expectant mothers,"" said Thattil, noting that they have been forced to use their own money to assist the affected families. ""People here require medicines, and they don't have money to pay for it. We are running out of medical supplies because the demand is high, and we don't have money to buy more.""

Sr. Miriam Jagogo, a regional superior of the Franciscan Sisters of St. Anna in the region of Siaya in western Kenya, said they have decided to start contributions among sisters from their various communities to pool together resources and help those families affected by floods. So far, they have distributed food, mattresses, blankets, clothes, sanitary towels, grains and other items to more than 200 families affected by floods around Kisumu, a port city in western Kenya.The sisters are struggling to raise resources to help the families, many appealing to donors to help families displaced by flooding caused by heavy rains and backflow from Lake Victoria. ""We would really want to reach out and assist many more families, but we have no constant supply to give continuously unless we get help elsewhere,"" said Jagogo. ""I urge the government and well wishers to come out and help these families. They really need our help especially during this period of COVID-19."" Kenya continues to impose wide-ranging and stringent measuresâ??including the national curfew and cessation of movements in the counties of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi and Manderaâ??to deal with the pandemic.

The issues extend beyond Kenya and affect much of the East African region. Heavy rains and floods during the month of May have killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes. The East African countries have also been hit by a locust invasion and are bracing for the effects of COVID-19. At least 65 people have died in Rwanda after landslides caused by heavy rains damaged houses and washed away bridges especially in the mountainous north-west of the country. In southern Somalia, more than 30 people have died in the flash floods that have affected thousands, according to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Sweeping floods in western Uganda have killed dozens of people and displaced thousands. Speaking to GSR in a telephone interview, Victor Bwire, a resident of Budalangi which has suffered from perennial flooding during rainy seasons, observed that the government needed to build dikes to help end perennial flooding that has killed hundreds of residents. ""The government is not really doing enough to deal with perennial flooding in the region,"" said Bwire, who is also an environmental journalist and the deputy chief executive officer at the Media Council of Kenya. ""The government needs to replace the current dikes, which are now old and weak, and also deepen the region where the backflows occurs so that the water can flow well into the lake. This will prevent future flooding."" While urging the government to set aside permanent resettlement schemes to help people during floods, Bwire said human activities are one of the main causes of backflows and increased water levels. ""The lake is actually overused. People use the lake for all kinds of activities. They wash clothes and take baths in the lake. Materials that are not supposed to be in the lake make it dirty and are usually deposited at the banks of the lake, and as a result when it starts to rain the water cannot flow well into the lake and so it is forced back to the land leading to excess flooding,"" he said. For now, Oloo and other residents living in various camps across the country say little is being done to address their plight and cried for more help. ""We are at risk of dying from coronavirus, hunger, cholera or malaria,"" said Oloo. ""The government should not concentrate on fighting COVID-19 and forget about us. We are going to die.""",2020-06-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['lake', 'africa', 'displaces', 'country', 'help', 'western', 'affected', 'thousands', 'families', 'east', 'kenya', 'flooding', 'sisters', 'relief', 'floods', 'offer']",Kenya,news article,English
1523,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Bulls Run As Liquidity Floods Market - Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bulls-run-as-liquidity-floods-market-200570266,"As liquidity floods the market, the bulls continue to run the market. However, was the recent consolidation enough to reset market exuberance?

Over the last few weeks, I discussed the weekly “sell signals.” Such suggested upside would be somewhat limited for markets near-term. However, that flood of liquidity also limited the downside. Such has indeed been the case, as volatile markets made little headway since February, but dips continue to get bought.

SPX Daily Chart

With “stimmy” checks hitting bank accounts, “retail trading” stocks should get a boost as former gamblers and “pandemic lock-ins” return to Robinhood.

Furthermore, the surge in liquidity from the CARES Act last March is now working its way back into the economy as well. Those Treasury balances are getting drawn down to fund expenditures such as extended unemployment benefits.

Treasury Cash Balance

Unsurprisingly, all this liquidity is finding its way into the markets.

Monthly Mutual Fund And ETF Equity Fund Flow

Such has pushed equity allocations to nearly “Dot.com” level highs.

Equity Allocations

In other words, the bulls see “no risk” in being invested in “risk” assets.

Stock Buybacks Return With A Vengence

As I noted in “Powell’s Easy Money Promise,” stock buybacks have returned with a vengeance.

“No, this is not the argument which I debunked previously. Following the pandemic, corporations drew down credit lines and hoarded cash due to economic uncertainty. Now, with expectations of recovery, corporations are once again beginning to deploy that cash.”

Total Investment By Each Category Of US MMF

As I said then, while the mainstream media hope is all this cash will be flowing back into the economy, the reality is that it will primarily go to stock buybacks. Again, while not necessarily bad, it is the “least best” use of the company’s cash. Instead of expanding production, increasing sales, acquiring competitors, or making capital investments, the money gets used for a one-time boost to earnings on a per-share basis.

This past week, share buybacks hit a new record.

Corporate Buybacks

Not surprisingly, the most prominent players in buybacks are the ones that need to subsidize their earnings the most to beat estimates; technology and financials.

Buybacks By Sector



Net Purchases

While share buybacks primarily are for the benefit of corporate insiders “cashing out,” it does have the effect of supporting asset prices as well. when stocks were hitting records amid record share repurchases:

“What is clear, is that the misuse, and abuse, of share buybacks to manipulate earnings and reward insiders has become problematic. As John Authers recently pointed out: ‘For much of the last decade, companies buying their own shares have accounted for all net purchases. The total amount of stock bought back by companies since the 2008 crisis even exceeds the Federal Reserve’s spending on buying bonds over the same period as part of quantitative easing. Both pushed up asset prices.’ In other words, between the Federal Reserve injecting a massive amount of liquidity into the financial markets, and corporations buying back their own shares, there have been effectively no other real buyers in the market.”

Cumulative Net Purchases Of US Corporate Equities

I bring this up for two reasons:

The buybacks ARE SUPPORTIVE of asset prices in the short-term; and, We just had to “bailout” these companies because they couldn’t weather an economic downturn as they have spent years piling into debt and buying back shares.

While Janet Yellen is okay with the buybacks, as she thinks the banks are healthier now, why doesn’t anyone ask the question:

“If banks are so healthy, why do they need a constant monetary stimulus to remain in business and a bailout every time the economy declines?”

It doesn’t sound very healthy to me. But for now, there is only one headline that matters:

Headline



The Risk Of “No Risk”

The problem of assuming there is “no risk” is that it leads to “investor complacency.” As discussed in “Willful Blindness:”

“Willful blindness, also known as willful ignorance or contrived ignorance, is a term used in law. Being ‘willfully blind’ describes a situation where a person seeks to avoid civil or criminal liability for a wrongful act by keeping themselves unaware of the facts that would render them liable or implicated. The phrase ‘willful blindness’ also means any situation in which people avoid facts to absolve themselves of their liability. ‘Investors regularly dismiss the ‘facts’ which run contrary to their current opinion. In behavioral investing terms this is As markets rise, investors take on exceedingly more risk with the full knowledge that such actions will have a negative consequence. However, that ‘negative consequence’ is dismissed by the ‘fear of missing out,’ or rather F.O.M.O. As ‘greed’ overtakes ‘fear,’ investors become emboldened as rising markets reinforce their convictions. When the negative consequence occurs, instead of taking responsibility, they blame the media, Wall Street, or their advisor.”

This currently where we are in the markets today.

As discussed, with investors fully allocated, the risk remains that markets are trading at near-record extensions of longer-term means. The monthly chart below shows the current deviation from the long-term mean. Two things to note:

The market is exceptionally overbought longer-term; and,

The negative divergence in relative strength is highly concerning.

SPX Monthly Chart

It is generally near market peaks when investors are the most complacent about risk. While I certainly agree in the shorter-term, the liquidity flood has mitigated downside risk; it only exacerbates longer-term consequences.

Another Surge Coming

Currently, investors are very exuberant about markets, although they can get more so.

BofA Bull & Bear Indicator History

With the flood of stimulus into the market, another surge higher would not be a surprise. Such would correspond both with the peak of liquidity inflows and the peak in earnings and economic growth expectations. From a technical perspective, this also aligns with the weekly “money flow” index, turning positive. Typically, these weekly “buy” signals last roughly two to three months before reversing.

S&P 500-Buy Signal Weekly Chart

Note the blue vertical dashed lines below. Those lines are the weekly “buy” and “sell” signals overlaid on the daily chart. The blue boxes show where the daily and weekly sell signals converged previously.

S&P 500- Daily Chart

When both indicators align on “sell signals,” blue boxes, market volatility rises markedly. However, markets tend to increase when both indicators align with “buy signals.”

With both “buy” signals close to aligning, I would not be surprised to see markets make another advance higher near term. However, focusing back on longer-term market dynamics, the deviation from the longer-term mean is extreme.

Reversions always occur when least expected, and always for a reason “no one sees coming.”

Buy Now, Sell Later

With markets still in the “seasonally strong” period of the year, lots of liquidity, and plenty of exuberance, this is not a time to be “bearish” on markets.

We are using recent weaknesses to add to positions we took profits in recently, such as energy and financials. We will also add to beaten-up “growth” names that have strong earnings trajectories and strong fundamentals.

It should be evident that an honest assessment of uncertainty leads to better decisions.

The problem with “Eternal Bullishness” and “Willful Blindness” is that the failure to embrace uncertainty increases risk, and ultimately loss.

We must be able to recognize and be responsive to changes in underlying market dynamics. If they change for the worse, we must be aware of the portfolio model’s inherent risk. The reality is that we can’t control outcomes. The most we can do is influence the probability of specific outcomes.

Focusing on risk not only removes “willful blindness” from the process, but it is also essential to capital preservation and investment success over time.

In other words, “buy now,” just don’t forget to “sell” later.",2021-03-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['markets', 'risk', 'signals', 'willful', 'buybacks', 'sell', 'market', 'weekly', 'investors', 'liquidity', 'run', 'bulls', 'floods']",India,news article,English

CAIRO – 28 September 2018: Egyptian Minister of Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Ati traveled to Kampala, Uganda on Sept. 26 to attend the closing of the Averting Flood Risks Project’s first phase in Kasese, Uganda.



The minister stated that he is pleased to be in the brotherly country and to attend the closing of the project’s phase one which was finalized in Feb. 2018.



The Egyptian minister was welcomed by the Ugandan Minister of Water and Environment Sam Cheptoris on Wednesday, Sept. 26. Wednesday’s meetings revolved around technical cooperation activities between Egypt's Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation and Uganda's Ministry of Water and Environment.



During the meeting in the Ugandan Ministry of Water, Abdel Ati referred to Kasese’s tragic history with floods, as it was subjected to many raging floods in the past 20 years, which come as a result of severe landslides in mountainous regions in the direction of residential areas, farms, Livestock and poultry, causing huge material and human losses.



Uganda sought Egypt’s assistance to limit the floods’ averts, which received immediate response from the Egyptian side. The ministry started to execute a project to protect the country’s citizens and properties within the framework of the technical cooperation between both countries.



A group of the Egyptian ministry’s experts were sent in a mission to examine the area and collect the required data to implement an urgent project to secure the country against flood dangers. The mission identified some high priority areas in grave danger.



A memorandum of understanding for the project was signed by both ministries in April 2016 in order for the project to be executed in several phases. The first phase was assigned to El-Mokawloon El-Arab (Arab contractors), one of the biggest Egyptian companies operating in Uganda and it officially started in March 13, 2017 and ended in Feb 2018, the minister of irrigation stated.



Ugandan Minister of Water and Environment Cheptoris expressed his pleasure with the technical cooperation between Egypt and Uganda in the fields of irrigation and water resources. He also commended the major technical expertise in the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources as they managed to put the floods’ water into use instead of being wasted, and causing losses.



Additionally, Cheptoris expressed the gratitude of Kasese’s citizens for the Egyptian government’s support to implement the project.



The Egyptian minister will visit the project’s location in Kases on Sept. 27; he will be accompanied by the Ugandan minister and the technical and guiding committees for the collaborative water projects between Egypt and Uganda to present the results of the committees’ meetings.



Abdel Ati stressed that these meetings come in the light of the standing collaboration between Egypt and Uganda to pursue the progress in the dual projects between both countries in the fields of irrigation and water resources.



This collaboration is represented in the memorandum of understanding signed in Jan. 2010 between both ministries to execute a number of vital projects worth $ 4.5 million. These projects include 75 boreholes in different areas in Uganda to provide drinking water, which were finalized in Dec. 2016.



Moreover, huge mechanical machines were exported to Uganda to be used in establishing the projects, especially the project of water containment dams to use rain water in providing drinking water for citizens, the containment dams' contract was signed with a Ugandan company in August 2017 and will be implemented soon.



Head of Nile Water Section Ahmed Bahaa el-Din stated that Egypt is always a source of technical assistance and expertise for Uganda. He added that this is obvious in the three developmental projects; The Egyptian-Ugandan Project to Resist Sea Grass, Controlling Sea Grass in Kyoga and Albert Lakes’ Project and the third project includes building five tanks to reserve rain water, building several boreholes and training Ugandan workers in the fields of water resources and irrigation.",2018-09-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['min', 'egyptian', 'water', 'collaboration', 'uganda', 'technical', 'projects', 'irrigation', 'ministry', 'nile', 'countries', 'results', 'basin', 'project', 'ugandan', 'yields', 'minister']",Egypt,news article,English

In Zaragoza, a company called Chocoter uses local cherries and other fruits to produce a product with added value and available all year round: chocolate coated fruits.





""We work with cherries, oranges, apples, apricots, peaches, plums and pears,"" explains José Caro, and these are all grown in Spain. ""We buy the fruits already confectioned and whole from local suppliers, although we supervise the confectionery to make sure that the quality and the calibres are good. We are then in charge of chopping them and coating them in chocolate.""

Without preservatives

Caro explains the process. ""The fruits are introduced into sulphur dioxide to stop the ripening; then, glucose and sugar are added. By doing this, we can guarantee that they will be suitable for consumption for at least a year without using any preservatives other than sugar. Lastly, the cherries are macerated in alcohol for two months more so that they acquire the liqueur taste that we want; the rest of fruits retain their natural flavour.

For Chocoter, quality is the most important aspect, so they always use Spanish fruits, so they don't have to store them for too long, and dark chocolate with a cocoa content of between 55% and 60%.





10% for the United States

Chocoter sells most of its products in the domestic market and doesn't export them to many countries, although it does sell a large volume to its largest export market: the United States. ""We make 10% of our total turnover from sales to the United States, mainly of chocolate coated oranges. We also have secondary markets, such as the United Arab Emirates, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Italy, although we don't sell a lot in central Europe,"" affirms the entrepreneur.

Chocoter is the leader of this segment in Spain, and although its competitors are mainly the most famous chocolate brands, the latter's products do not really have much to do with Chocoter's. ""They offer liquor pralines, rather than cherries coated in chocolate. On the other hand, here in the area of ​​Aragon, there are also manufacturers of polvorones and shortbread, although their products are of a different quality to ours and they focus mainly in the Christmas season. There are only two or three manufacturers like us producing all year round.""





Tourism and own consumption

This product is aimed at different types of consumers, so the company offers them in different presentations. ""Our most important market at any time of the year is tourism. There are usually sales of the well-known Aragón fruit baskets (with miniature replicas of the traditional wooden boxes used in fruit picking), which are very typical and we try to be in all service areas, airports and important transit locations. Then, during the Christmas campaign, great quantities of our products are also sold for own consumption.""

However, these products are not very successful in supermarkets, since they are usually placed on the shelves with candy and other sweets, so consumers mix them up with more expensive confectionary. They are usually better sold in specialty and gourmet food stores, nut stores or pastry shops.





Third generation

The company Chocoter has been devoted to coating in chocolate since the 50's, when José Caro's grandfather started developing this product, so he is already part of the third generation which has followed the family tradition. The company always works with a specific variety of cherry, the Napoleon, which is cultivated in Aragon, as well as with Salustiana oranges.

The start-up plans to enter new markets by June 2021, including the United States, Canada and Great Britain.

Uganda is one of the largest banana producers in the world. “After harvesting, banana stems are usually thrown away as waste. We have developed technologies for extracting the banana fibre and applying it to the production of high-quality banana fibre textiles and handicrafts,” says TexFad.

An asset for environmental preservation

In addition to mats for the home, the young Ugandan company also offers eco-friendly hair extensions, especially for women. “These beauty accessories are 100% natural. Once used, the extensions can be safely disposed of in nature. They will later become manure, thus helping to heal the soil,” explains Kimani Muturi, the founder of TexFad. He believes that in the coming years, banana fibres could, to some extent, be used to make paper products such as banknotes.

To date, the Ugandan start-up has 23 employees. Green Bio Energy, a French company based in the Ugandan capital Kampala, developed a technique in 2011 to replace charcoal with environmentally friendly charcoal made from banana tree waste . This fuel comes in the form of small cylinders stored in large boxes like pallets bretons. The innovation has given Uganda a breakthrough in the fight against deforestation and air pollution. Green Bio Energy has a factory in the capital Kampala, capable of producing two tonnes of green charcoal per day.

1811,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Drowned land: hunger stalks South Sudan's flooded villages - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/mar/19/drowned-land-hunger-stalks-south-sudans-flooded-villages,"After the unprecedented floods last summer, the people of Old Fangak, a small town in northern South Sudan, should be planting now. But the flood water has not receded, the people are still marooned and now they are facing severe hunger.

Unusually heavy rains began last July, and the White Nile burst its banks, destroyed all the crops and encroached on farms and villages, affecting Jonglei and other states, leaving people to scramble for a few strips of dry land.

Fields are still submerged, mud homes and stiff sticks of dead maize are slowly collapsing into the water, entire villages have been abandoned and large areas turned into swamps. Of the 62 villages served by Old Fangak’s central market, 45 are devastated by the flooded river.

The July harvest would have fed the local people through to this spring but all the crops were lost. Families sleep in abandoned schools or in the open on scraps of higher land. There is no question of migrating to dry areas as the flood extends for miles and at least Old Fangak is secluded from the constant conflict that besets much of the rest of the country.

‘Nothing. I couldn’t rescue any of my crops. All were destroyed.’ Nyayua Thang, 62, at Wangchot primary school. She hasn’t eaten in days

The UN says that about 1.6 million people have been affected by the floods in a country where already at least 7.5 million people need assistance. A recent report by the Integrated food security Phase Classification, (IPC), an initiative by 15 organisations to tackle malnutrition, estimates that 6.4 million people, about half the population, will face acute food insecurity in 2021, and for half of them their lack of food will be an emergency.

Some people in South Sudan, such as those from Old Fangak, are partially or completely cut off from humanitarian aid. Access to the town is difficult in normal times, but the detritus of the floods has blocked the airstrip, which was cleared from the bush, and boat access from the river.

Data from South Sudan suggests that more erratic and unpredictable weather patterns are now the norm.

The floods were caused by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), also known as the “Indian El Niño, a weather pattern discovered only in 1999. The strongest IOD to strike east Africa in 61 years happened in 2019. So when the rains arrived in 2020 in South Sudan, the water from the previous year had not yet receded, resulting in more devastating floods. This year’s rainfall could further worsen the situation, making the resultant hunger catastrophic.

‘We always feel weak during the day because of the mosquito bites during the night.’ Nyapata Thiel in the classroom that has become a shelter for many in the community

“People will die of hunger. Everyone in Old Fangak is lacking food and lost what they cultivated. Hunger is the one that will kill people,” says Peter Kak, a fisherman and grandfather of five who lives on a grass island with his son Samuel. The two men stayed behind after sending the rest of the family to higher ground. Here, they fish every day.

“Flooding, conflict, Covid-19 and poverty make the situation here dire,” says Sulaiman Sesay, of Action Against Hunger, one of the few aid organisations active in this area of South Sudan. “The world needs to know that people are suffering in this way.”

The socioeconomic measures adopted in response to the pandemic have affected already critical hunger situations in vulnerable places such as South Sudan. A joint report by the World Food Programme and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that threatening global hunger levels seem to be reaching new highs.

A family works together as night falls to remove flood water from their land

In Old Fangak people grew sorghum, a cereal that is easy to cultivate. Now they can eat only water lilies and fish. But not everyone has fishing nets and for those who do the catches are rarely enough to satisfy the appetite.

“There’s not enough sorghum, so we have to resort to the water lily,” explains Samuel Gai. The flowers have to be collected in great numbers to grind and make a small amount of cereal.

Despite the severity of the floods, the people of Old Fangak refuse to give up. In the face of rising waters, hunger and isolation from the rest of the country, the community shows extraordinary resilience.

“We cooperate,” says Joseph Martin, a villager helping to repair the constantly collapsing airstrip dyke. “The women take the water out with buckets and we put the mud on the dykes to prevent water leaking in. They do their part and we do our part.

“When there is work, men and women work together and they cooperate. Some of the people come and work even without us asking them … this is how we do it, if there is work to save the town, we work together,.”

Moving water by the bucketload all day takes a huge toll on hungry people. “Because of this water, I’ve lost weight. We are doing this alone, all day and night throwing water over the dyke. Nobody comes to help us. We are all exhausted,” says Nyayen Chuol, who works on the dyke with her elderly mother.

Samuel Yong in the makeshift shelter he made on a grass mound to escape the rising water

Where dykes have already been breached many people move on to neighbours’ homes and start again, helping to keep other dykes strong.

“I’m worried all the time. At night I’m trying to stay awake with a fire so I can burn a bit of grass and go check if the dyke is leaking or about to break. Every night. I’m so worried I can’t even sleep thinking that if I fall asleep the dyke could break and I can drown,” says Nyayang Kich, who had to abandon her flooded home for the higher ground of her neighbour.

The water sitting stagnant is compromising health too, leading to a spike in malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

“The climate has changed from the years when I was young because we have never experienced floods like this before. What we are experiencing now is horrible. We are suffering from hunger and we didn’t before. The climate has changed. For old people it’s horrible. It’s hard moving in this water; we don’t know where to sleep or what to eat. We are in God’s hands,” says 83-year-old Mary Nyamat.",2021-03-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['south', 'hunger', 'villages', 'food', 'work', 'night', 'land', 'drowned', 'old', 'sudans', 'flooded', 'floods', 'sudan', 'water', 'fangak', 'stalks']",Uganda,news article,English

Authorities closed schools and universities in the greater Cairo area Wednesday and companies saw only skeletal staff show up at work. Authorities said later that schools would reopen Thursday. Adel el-Ghadban, governor of the Mediterranean province of Port Said, said schools would be closed across the province Thursday because of continued bad weather there.

The mayhem raised questions about Cairo’s ability to deal with such heavy rains as the city’s infrastructure and sewage and drainage systems have suffered from years of poor maintenance.

People took to social media to criticize the government’s lack of preparedness. Cairo, a city of some 20 million people, has been left for decades in neglect and decay, particularly its overcrowded neighborhoods.

Hashtags like “#Egypt is sinking” were trending on social media, attracting many videos and pictures of the most affected areas in Cairo and elsewhere.

Five deaths occurred in the Nile Delta provinces of Sharqia, Gharbia and Kafr el-Sheikh, according to the Interior Ministry. Three of the victims, including two children, were electrocuted. The other two victims died falling from the rooftops of their flooded homes.

Local authorities in northern Sinai also reported two deaths. Moataz Taher, head of the el-Hassana municipality, said in a statement that a 47-year-old farmer and his 13-year-old daughter died early Wednesday in the flooding.

In the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, the heavy rain caused a three-story building to collapse Wednesday, killing a 7-year-old child and injuring her 19-year-old brother, according to the city’s civil protection authority.

In Cairo, the eastern suburb of Nasr City was hit the hardest, but so was Heliopolis, located near Cairo’s international airport. The government said the two suburbs had received at least 650,000 cubic meters cubic feet of precipitation in just 90 minutes on Tuesday, overwhelming the city’s sewage and drain systems.

Trucks fanned out across Cairo to drain water from flooded areas. A key highway connecting Cairo to other provinces was closed, the state-run al-Ahram daily reported.

EgyptAir said it had delayed some fights on Tuesday because passengers were stuck on the roads and unable to get to the airport. A part of the old Cairo airport terminal which has been under renovation was also flooded, with footage on social media showing rainwater pouring into the hallway.

The Civil Aviation Ministry said that terminal was only being used by a private carrier for one or two flights a day and shared photos of it after it was cleaned up.",2019-10-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['day', 'heavy', 'flooded', 'egypt', 'including', 'chaotic', 'media', 'schools', 'closed', 'social', 'rains', 'flooding', 'sewage', 'dead', 'cairo', 'province']",Egypt,news article,English
1580,FL-2021-000038-KEN,"Here's what we know about Kim Potter, the officer who fatally shot Daunte Wright - KRDO",https://krdo.com/news/national-world/2021/04/14/heres-what-we-know-about-kim-potter-the-officer-who-fatally-shot-daunte-wright/,"National-World

The fatal shooting of a 20-year-old Black man named Daunte Wright by a White police officer outside Minneapolis has prompted protests and clashes with law enforcement.

Wright was killed by Officer Kim Potter during a routine traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, according to police.

Potter has been charged with second-degree manslaughter, according to a news release from Washington County Attorney Pete Orput’s office.

The shooting and the demonstrations occurred about 10 miles from the Minneapolis courtroom where former officer Derek Chauvin is on trial in the death of George Floyd last year.

The killing Sunday was at least the third high-profile death of a Black man during a police encounter in the Minneapolis area in the past five years, after the shooting of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights in 2016 and the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last May.

Here is what we know about Potter:

Former chief: Shooting was accidental

Former Police Chief Tim Gannon, who submitted his resignation Tuesday, said the portion of body-worn camera footage released Monday led him to believe the shooting was accidental and that the officer’s actions before the shooting were consistent with the department’s training on Tasers.

Gannon said “the officer had the intention to deploy their Taser, but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet.” The fatal shooting appeared to be “an accidental discharge,” he said.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension examined Potter’s duty belt and found her handgun is holstered on the right side of her belt, while the Taser is on the left side, according to a news release from Orput’s office.

Citing a criminal complaint, the release said the Taser is yellow with a black grip and is set in a straight-draw position, “meaning Potter would have to use her left hand to pull the Taser out of its holster.”

She is a 26-year police veteran

Potter, 48, was with the Brooklyn Center Police Department for 26 years, according to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. She joined the department in 1995, according to the Star Tribune newspaper in Minneapolis.

She served as the police union’s president in 2019, had been on the department’s negotiation team and worked as field training officer, the Tribune reported.

She was placed on administrative leave after Sunday’s shooting.

The BCA said additional personnel information is not public under state law during the investigation of the shooting.

A county attorney’s report states this was not Potter’s first time dealing with the aftermath of a police officer shooting someone. In 2019, police fatally shot a man who was threatening his grandfather with a knife and hammer. The use of deadly force by police in that incident was ruled lawful, the report states.

In accordance with Brooklyn Center Police Department policies, Potter — who not present at the time of the shooting — gave instructions to the two officers involved in the shooting to get into different police cars, turn off their body cameras and not speak to each other.

Potter was not accused of any wrongdoing in this instance.

She submitted a resignation letter

Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott told CNN on Tuesday that Potter submitted a letter of resignation.

In a letter to Elliott, acting City Manager Reggie Edwards and then Gannon, Potter wrote that she “loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability.”

Elliott said Potter decided on her own to resign. “We did not ask her to resign. That was a decision she made,” he said.

At a news conference by Elliott, people in the room voiced concerns that Potter resigned and was not fired. The mayor said he has “not accepted her resignation” and that his office is continuing to review the matter.

“We’re doing our internal process to make sure that we are being accountable to the steps that we need to take,” Elliott told reporters.

Potter is still entitled to benefits following her resignation, though it is not clear what those benefits are, Edwards said Wednesday.

Potter attorney also represents officer in Floyd case

Earl Gray, a St. Paul-based attorney, told CNN he is representing Potter.

Gray is also the attorney for Thomas Lane, one of the four officers involved in Floyd’s death who faces criminal charges. He was also a defense attorney for Jeronimo Yanez, the former St. Anthony, Minnesota, police officer who was found not guilty of second-degree manslaughter for the fatal shooting of Castile.

Gray on Monday said he had no further comment on the shooting.",2021-04-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['according', 'resignation', 'minnesota', 'fatally', 'kim', 'daunte', 'elliott', 'attorney', 'wright', 'minneapolis', 'know', 'heres', 'shooting', 'officer', 'potter', 'shot', 'taser']",Kenya,news article,English
1745,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"Surging glacier creates lake, floods Pakistan valley - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1563034,"Danger of another flood as water continues to flow from the lake in Hunza valley in northern Pakistan.

""A loud rumble echoed and water started trickling down with soil and rocks. Villagers immediately left their homes and fled to safety,"" recounted Manzoor Hussain. Hussain lives in Hassanabad, a village in the Hunza valley high in the Hindu Kush Himalayas in northern Pakistan.

It was siesta time on May 30 when the rumbling started. ""It was not the first time, so people in the village knew what was happening. They were aware of glacial lake outburst floods [GLOFs]. They thought it was a GLOF at the Shishper glacier,"" said Hussain.

In fact, a lake near the Machuhar glacier had burst its banks, causing a flood that submerged farms, the local power plant and part of the Karakoram Highway. Most residents had to sleep in tents afterwards.

Was this a GLOF, where the failure of an unstable natural dam releases meltwater from a glacier? The question is complicated by the Karakoram Anomaly, which describes the advance of glaciers in the region in contrast to the retreat of other glaciers in the Himalayas and globally. Expert opinion is divided.

Zaheer Uddin Babar, the focal person for GLOFs in the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, said, ""We cant interlink the recent incident with a GLOF. Satellite images received from SUPARCO [Pakistans Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission] are not indicating any glacial lake. It may be the water spilled out from a lake on the surface of the Machuhar glacier. The water flow was as low as 3,000 cusecs [cubic feet per second] only."" In some parts of the Hindu Kush Himalayas, water flow after a GLOF has been recorded at around 100,000 cusecs.

The villagers thought the May 30 incident was a GLOF because they had experienced one with a water flow of 7,000 cusecs in 2019, when a 1.5 kilometre-wide lake burst its banks. That time, a large section of the Karakoram Highway, a bridge, two power plants, some offices, over 100 houses, the water supply pumphouse and most farms were submerged.

Shishper is a surging, or advancing, glacier. It formed around the beginning of the twentieth century, when what was then the Hassanabad glacier in the north of the Hunza valley split into two. Machuhar is the other glacier formed by this split. Like the overwhelming majority of glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas, Machuhar is receding due to the warming caused by climate change. There are over 15,000 glaciers in this tallest and youngest mountain range of the world, which stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar. The number keeps changing as receding glaciers split into two or more.

The surge of one glacier while its neighbour melts is creating a strange situation. Babar said Shishper has been surging quickly; it moved forward two kilometres in 2018-19, though there has been no indication of a surge since November 2019. But the earlier surge blocked the drainage route of the Machuhar glacier. As a result, a lake has formed at the snout, or mouth, of the Machuhar glacier, and is getting bigger as climate change gathers pace and the rate of melt increases.

Blocking the water flowing down from the Machuhar glacier also means blocking this water supply to the Hunza River, a tributary of the transboundary Indus River.

There are other glacier pairs in the same situation. Zahid Hussain, a field manager in a GLOF project, said, ""Yune glacier in Bagrot valley is also extending and it has already blocked the waters of Gurgo glacier. A huge cavity has opened up on the hillside, at the intersection of the two glaciers. There is a lake forming, which can burst its banks and can create a disaster any time.""

Muhammad Riaz, director-general of Pakistan Meteorological Department, told The Third Pole, ""There are more than 3,000 glacial lakes in the Karakoram ranges and 34-36 of them have been declared to be of high GLOF potential.""

The danger of a surging glacier

""But the glacier surge is a larger menace than GLOF,"" said Sher Mohammad, a glacier specialist at the regional International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, with its headquarters in Kathmandu. ""There are more than 200 glaciers identified in the Karakoram range with surging or surge-like history and these glaciers cover more than 40% (7,700 square kilometres) of the total glacier area in the Karakoram.""

""The exact reason for some glaciers surging in the Karakoram is still unclear,"" he added. ""It has no linear correlation with snowfall anomalies and thermal changes. However, extreme weather and climate change probably affect surges and surge dynamics, such as intensification, enhance melting, creating crevasses on glacier surfaces and changing the glacier volume.""

Asif Khan, an expert on climate change and an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes sixth assessment report, said, ""Surging is a short-lived event, when a glacier moves 10 to 100 times faster than its normal velocity.""

Mohammad said the flooding on May 30 was probably triggered by a rise in temperature, causing significant glacier melt and increasing the size of the lake. Meteorological data shows a significant temperature rise in the Hunza area in late May. In the first half of June, water was still flowing down the hillside and being blocked by debris, posing a potential risk of another flood.

There was a significant temperature rise in the Hunza area in late May, which probably triggered the flooding.  Photo by Manzoor Hussain

Shaukat Ali, a climate expert at the Islamabad-based Global Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC), said, ""Surge is a phenomenon that can also be caused by extreme events of precipitation. The Karakoram Anomaly may cause surging and advancing of the Shishper glacier. Our research at GCISC shows that Gupis, Drosh, Chitral and Gilgit are the future hotspots of the highest increase in average temperature in the 21st century.""

Ali pointed out that this could lead to significant changes in future water availability in Pakistan, which is dependent almost totally on the Indus basin for irrigation and other uses. Pakistans agriculture sector contributes around 22% of Pakistans GDP, and over 45% of the countrys workforce is engaged in agriculture, directly or indirectly.

A higher glacier melting rate can also trigger GLOFs and floods downstream, leading to more infrastructure and economic losses, Ali added.

988,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Sirius and the Flooding of the Nile: this week on the Storyteller's Night Sky - Interlochen,https://www.interlochenpublicradio.org/news/2019-08-26/sirius-and-the-flooding-of-the-nile-this-week-on-the-storytellers-night-sky,"Every year in August, the constellation Orion returns to northern hemisphere skies at dawn, bearing with him the brightest star in our sky after the Sun ~ the star Sirius.

Sirius played a significant role in every aspect of Ancient Egypt culture, a role that carried on well into the 20th century, because its heliacal rising in mid-August each year was the signal from the natural world that the mighty river Nile was about to flood. At the heliacal rising of Sirius, people would move off the flood plain to make way for the river, which would rise up to 46 feet in some places!

The ‘heliacal rising’ is the first appearance of a bright star in the morning sky, before sunrise. It’s a word that derives from Helios, the Greek God of the Sun who bore the Sun through the sky in his golden chariot.

The Ancient Egyptian Sun God was Ra, who was credited with the creation of all forms of life.

In Ancient Egyptian culture there were two calendars for measuring the cycle of the year: the solar calendar of Ra; and the calendar used for measuring the return of Sirius. The year itself was divided into three seasons, based on the rhythmic return of Sirius.

There is no appreciable rain fall in Egypt, and this, coupled with population growth and technological advances, eventually led to the building of the Aswan Dam, which opened in 1970, causing the annual flood cycle of the Nile to come to an end.

The Aswan High Dam was opened in 1970, and centuries of Nile River flooding ceased.

Still, Sirius continues to rise, and ceremonies celebrating the annual flood still occur, which is understandable, given that the dam is not quite 50 years old, but the cultural life inspired by the Nile’s annual flooding has existed through all ages of recorded history, and was rooted in the stars.",2019-08-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'heliacal', 'rising', 'night', 'storytellers', 'star', 'nile', 'flooding', 'dam', 'week', 'sirius', 'river', 'annual', 'sky']",Egypt,news article,English
1999,FL-2017-000067-BRA,London Court Will Reconsider $6.9B Suit Against BHP Over 2015 Brazil Dam Collapse - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2021/05/07/613058.htm,"LONDON – London’s Court of Appeal will hear a request to revive a 5 billion pound ($6.95 billion) lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining group BHP over a 2015 dam failure in Brazil, a court order showed.

Judge Nicholas Underhill has agreed to an oral hearing that could help to overturn a previous Court of Appeal decision which denied a 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group permission to appeal against a judgment to strike out the landmark case.

“I am satisfied that, exceptionally, an oral hearing is appropriate in this case,” the judge said in the order, which was signed on May 4 and seen by Reuters on Thursday.

No further details were immediately available.

The order comes less than two months after the Court of Appeal refused permission for a lawsuit over Brazil’s worst environmental disaster to proceed in English courts.

The Court of Appeal said in March it agreed with a lower court that the case was an abuse of process, that claimants could – and were – making reparation claims in Brazil and that the lawsuit would be “irredeemably unmanageable.”

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

Samarco has since filed for bankruptcy protection.

PGMBM, the law firm representing the Brazilian claimants, said it had been contacted by many clients to “express their gratitude in respect of the consideration being given by the Court of Appeal to their application.”

BHP, the world’s largest miner by market value, said it was aware of the application.

“Previous (court) rulings … have supported our position that the civil claim proceedings were unnecessary as they duplicated matters already covered by the existing and ongoing work of the Renova Foundation and are, or have been, the subject of ongoing legal proceedings in Brazil,” a BHP spokesman said.

The Renova Foundation is a redress scheme established in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale.

The case is the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

The Brahmaputra River, one of the largest rivers in the world which flows from Tibet into India and then into Bangladesh, burst its banks in Assam over the weekend, inundating more than 2,000 villages, and it was still raining on Monday.

“Two people have died in separate incidents of drowning in the past 24 hours and more than one million people have been affected, with the flood situation turning critical by the hour,” a state government flood bulletin said.

Torrential rain hit at least 23 of Assam’s 33 districts and the federal water resources body said water levels in the Brahmaputra were expected to rise, with more rain forecast over the next three days.

“The flood situation remains extremely grave with several embankments breached,” Assam Water Resources Minister Keshab Mahanta told Reuters.

Most of the Kaziranga National Park, home to the rare one-horned rhino, was under water, authorities said.

Assam, famous for its tea plantations, is hit by seasonal flooding each year, forcing state and federal governments to spend millions of rupees on flood control.

Paramilitary personnel were deployed across the state for rescue operations and to ensure people maintain social distance in makeshift shelter camps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, authorities said.

The recent rains remind me of how poor our drainage system is. All you have to do is look at the roads every time it rains to know there is something fundamentally wrong with our infrastructure. And the most ridiculous thing about all this is that it has been happening since time immemorial. It is as if we are supposed to learn to live with the floods and normalise them. I have never travelled to other countries so I don’t know whether it is the same case elsewhere.

Do rain floods paralyse movement from one place to another in other countries too or is it just us? Do people have to be carried from one side of the road to another, do cars “drown” in mini rivers? And for those countries that have managed to solve this problem, how did they do it? Can we learn from them? What role can we all play in trying to create a clean and flood-free country?

I know for sure that if we followed a well-organised garbage dumping system, we would not have to deal with the consequences of a clogged drainage system. I also know that if we stopped settling in water catchment areas, we wouldn’t mess up the eco-system and the water would follow a natural drainage flow. What I don’t know is why we don’t do these things and yet continue to cry foul.

Every so often we wake up to huge factories built in what we all know to be swampy areas and yet we say nothing.

I wonder who we think will speak up for us. We have abused our environment way too much to expect any favours from nature.

There’s a song by the Swedish pop group, Ace of Bace titled, Everytime it rains. The chorus of that song says, “Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces. So many memories the rain releases, I feel you, I taste you. I cannot forget. Every time it rains, I get wet”.

Well, here is a Ugandan rendition of those lines. “Every time it rains, Uganda falls to pieces. So much sewage and dirt and all manner of garbage the rain releases. We smell it, we are even doused in it, every time it rains.

Seriously though, we must do something about our drainage system and put an end to this man-made mess.

Environment Canada has issued heavy rainfall warnings and special weather statements — with a mess of rain, sleet, snow and ice pellets possible across a wide section of the flood zones starting Tuesday night and continuing Wednesday.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said at a news conference in Ottawa Tuesday that there are now 2,600 Canadian Forces personnel deployed across the three provinces, with more on standby. He said about 1,000 of those are in Quebec.

Another 1,500 have been authorized to be sent to Ontario to help with historic flooding along the Ottawa River and in central Ontario cottage country towns like Bracebridge and Muskoka Lakes.

Annual flooding in the Kashechewan First Nation in northern Ontario remains a concern. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the vast majority of the 1,600 evacuations in Ontario are from that region, with the remainder mostly from the Ottawa area.

Late Tuesday, the transport minister announced additional navigational restrictions in flooded areas. Marc Garneau also urged people to stay off all flooded waterways in Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick — including those not currently subject to restrictions — to prevent environmental damage.

While many in these areas have been deploying sandbags to help cope with the flooding, researchers and consultants say they aren't necessarily the best solution.

They say the sacks can be effective in flash floods or other situations where they won't be in contact with water for too long, but sandbags lose their effectiveness as soon as they become saturated with water, meaning they have limited impact during prolonged floods.

Here are the latest developments in each affected region.

Ottawa

Mayor Jim Watson pleaded Tuesday for more people to help with flood-prevention efforts, as water levels are expected to peak in Ottawa-Gatineau on Wednesday.

Some communities along the Ottawa River are already seeing waters higher than they saw in the 2017 flood.

In Constance Bay, to the west, 150 homeowners have been urged to voluntarily evacuate their homes as floodwaters rise around them. Power is being shut off to part of the community on Tuesday evening, said Pierre Poirier, the city's head of emergency management.

Approximately one million sandbags are standing between the Ottawa River and residences and businesses in Ottawa, and more are in place across the river in Gatineau, Que.

But they may not be up to the task of holding back the water, which in Ottawa-Gatineau could rise 50 centimetres above 2017 flood levels. Municipal officials in Ottawa don't expect to be near cleanup mode until the Victoria Day long weekend.

Watch aerial footage of the flooded Ottawa River:

Drone footage shows Ottawa River flooding CBC News 1:52 CBC News captured aerial footage of the effects of recent flooding in Gatineau, Que. 1:52

Goodale also flagged another source of concern.

""The water level now in Lake Ontario is just to about its maximum normal run off,"" he said. ""All of that obviously has to flow east. Combining with the flow coming down the Ottawa [River], that presents significant potential issues in relation to Montreal and places further downstream.""

The weather could also make things difficult for those working to shore up properties against the floodwaters on Wednesday. Ottawa-Gatineau and areas to the west as far as Algonquin Park on the Ontario side of the river are expected to get two to five centimetres of snow, mixed with ice pellets, then 15 to 25 mm of rain.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday these extreme weather events will happen more often, and the government is fighting climate change and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada predicts the record flooding will push losses for homeowners from extreme weather to more than $1 billion this year.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in light of record flooding this spring, the federal government is talking with the provinces about investments in disaster mitigation and prevention efforts.

Increasingly, communities are looking at relocating people living in high-risk areas instead of paying year after year to help them rebuild.

Quebec

Officials partially lifted an evacuation order in Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Que., on Tuesday, allowing hundreds of residents — but not all — to return to their homes.

The evacuation order was put in place after floodwaters breached a dike Saturday and forced about 6,000 to flee.

Residents who do return home, however, will not have access to potable water or electricity.

Mayor Sonia Paulus said they ""will need to present identification and receive clearance before returning home.""

The order excludes a section of Sainte-Marthe that remains submerged. It's unclear when residents in the hardest hit areas might be able to go home.

One resident kayaked through her home and shared emotional video:

This video of Valérie Deslauriers kayaking through her flooded home was posted on Facebook. Montreal 0:19 Deslauriers lives in Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Que. A natural dike holding back the Lake of Two Mountains was breached this weekend. 0:19

The island of Montreal and Laval remain in states of emergency, a measure giving authorities the power to seize property and force evacuations, while officials in Quebec say the data available suggests the risk of flooding on several rivers across the province remains high.

An additional 34 local states of emergency are still in effect around the province.

The province reported over 6,400 flooded homes, a further 3,500 surrounded by water and more than 10,000 evacuees — most of them from Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac.

New Brunswick

The St. John River from Fredericton to Saint John is still above flooding levels, but emergency officials said the river system is expected to recede to near or below flood stage before the week ends.

The entire river basin is steadily declining, according to Greg MacCallum, director of the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization (EMO).

EMO is now turning its focus to cleanup measures. Residents, however, are warned to avoid contact with floodwater, which can contain sewage and other waste.

The Trans-Canada Highway remains closed between Oromocto and River Glade, N.B., but the province's Department of Transportation and Infrastructure said it could reopen this week.

This is the second year in a row the major highway has closed due to flooding.

Despite the turn in events, strong winds in the forecast remain a concern.

New Brunswick power crews have been inspecting downed lines:

Sajjan visited the Saint John area yesterday to view the activities of military personnel helping in the response effort.

He says if the impact of climate change disasters continues to worsen, he may have to increase the number of Canadian Forces personnel available.

Goodale said 9,200 residences and cottages have been affected by the flooding in New Brunswick, along with another 7,000 buildings.

Kashechewan First Nation

First Nations leaders called on the Ontario and federal governments Monday to help relocate the community of Kashechewan as it deals with annual flooding — a problem one said would have already been solved if it involved a non-Indigenous population.

Community members rallied on Parliament Hill on Tuesday.

The northern Ontario community of 2,500 first flooded in 1976 and has been evacuated annually for the past several years while it waits for the federal government to fulfil its promises to move residents to a permanent new location.

""Both levels of government — Ontario and Canada — has allowed this to be normalized,"" said Nishnawbe Aski Nation Deputy Grand Chief Derek Fox. ""I believe personally that if these were non-native, non-First Nations people, action would have happened a lot sooner. I sincerely believe that.""

Central Ontario cottage country

The mayor of Bracebridge said he's hoping tomorrow's weather forecast doesn't play out as expected. Environment Canada issued a rainfall warning for the swath of central Ontario that's been struggling to cope with flooding in recent days.

Mayor Graydon Smith said 25 to 30 mm could fall on Bracebridge tomorrow, with the possibility of a little more rain on Thursday. Smith says an additional 60 military personnel are coming to the region today to help with flood conditions, making a total of 160 soldiers in the area.

Flood risk maps could be an essential tool for helping Canadians avoid buying houses in flood-prone areas – or building them there in the first place.

But too often they are of poor quality, and what information is presented is hard to interpret, an expert charges.

Jason Thistlethwaite, who teaches climate change risk management at the University of Waterloo, studied flood maps across Canada and was disturbed by what he found.

“We looked at over 300 that exist in high-risk areas,” he explains. “We asked a simple question: Would an average property owner be able to look at this map and understand the risk to their property, or to a property they were considering purchasing?

“We found that Canada’s flood maps are low-quality, and they will not help with the decision-making that a property owner will have to make to protect their property from flooding. They’re designed for land use planners, they’re designed for engineers. They’re not designed to help an individual understand the flood risk.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""We found that Canada's flood maps are low-quality, and they will not help with the decision-making that a property owner will have to make to protect their property from flooding.

Local governments are caught in a difficult bind, he explains. Part of their job is stopping homes from being built in flood plains — but the more development happens, the more money comes in.

“For municipalities, it’s actually very difficult to limit development in these areas, given the benefits associated with increased property tax revenue.”

Properties near water are seen as more desirable — and bring in more tax revenue — until the day the water rises, he says.

Some flood-prone areas were developed generations ago, often when a community grew up around a water-powered mill. But some were built on much more recently.

In Quebec, over 3,000 homes are flooded and another 2,300 cut off by floods. Parts of New Brunswick downstream from Fredericton on the St. John River are also afflicted, as are the Muskoka and Ottawa areas in Ontario.

Nationally, over 1,500 troops are deployed to flooded areas in the three provinces.

Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Ontario Premier Doug Ford both blamed the floods’ destructiveness on climate change.

But Thistlethwaite says this mostly misses the point.

“Climate change is a factor, but it’s nowhere near as big a factor as the neglect of governments to enforce effective land use, restricting development, giving information to the public so that they know, when they’re buying a property, whether or not it’s in a flood plain and aging infrastructure.”

Story continues below advertisement

Goodale said Friday that federal money is available to help local governments do better flood mapping, and he’s “surprised” it hasn’t been applied for more often.

Better maps would “help prepare province and municipalities to know what happens if you get five inches of precipitation, if you get 10 inches of precipitation, if you get 15 inches of precipitation, what happens to the rivers, the creeks, the drains,” he said.

Flood maps in Britain and the United States are easily accessible and easy to understand, Thistlethwaite says.

“For the most part, Canadians are in the dark when it comes to the exposure of their big investment in their property to flood risk.”

In the long run, he argues, governments that allowed development need to offer to help people leave houses that never should have been built in the first place.

“Governments need to take responsibility for this. The property owner did not know they were buying in a high-risk area, so how is it contingent on them to take the liability, and the cost of the devaluation of their property? That’s where you need governments to come in and say, ‘We’d be willing to buy out your property.”

However, a controversy in Quebec illustrates some of the practical problems. The province has offered to buy out some flood-prone homeowners for up to $200,000, but affected residents say that’s far too little money.

This year has so far seen the region devastated by the triple menace of the coronavirus, floods and locusts.

Kenyaâ??s budgetary allocations for the 2020/21 financial year have included funds towards overcoming these natural calamities. Kenya has allocated Ksh48 billion ($480 million) to agriculture, and an additional Ksh4.3 billion ($43 million) from the World Bank has been set aside to combat the spread of the desert locust.

â??We are dealing with a triple menace of coronavirus, locusts and floods, which has made it difficult to focus on other sectors,â? said Ukur Yatani, Kenyaâ??s Treasury Cabinet Secretary in an interview on Wednesday.

In his budget presentation last week, Mr Yatani said the money allocated would address the challenges posed by locusts and floods.

â??We have released a stimulus package to deal with the specific effects of the locusts and floods that devastated many counties,â? he said.

In the face of the locust attack, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) increased the amount of money it has asked of partners from $76 million to $153 million between January and December 2020.

While a mere fraction of the amount was spent nearly two decades ago, today FAO is short by $42 million. Kenyaâ??s allocation is $21.4 million.

â??The fight against locusts received Ksh4.3 billion ($43 million) from the World Bank. We have another Ksh1.5 billion ($15 million) from the e-subsidy. This is through the e-voucher,â? said Hamadi Boga, Principal Secretary in the State Department for Crop Development and Agriculture Research.

FAO has warned that Turkana in northern Kenya is now the epicentre of desert locust control measures, with the highest number of hopper band sites reported.

â??It is important for Turkana to intensify control measures to ensure that the desert locusts do not mature and continue to compound the threat to Kenyaâ??s and East Africaâ??s food security,â? said Dr Tobias Takavarasha, FAO Representative to Kenya.",2020-06-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['virus', 'fight', 'budgets', 'kenyas', 'locusts', 'agriculture', 'million', 'desert', 'fao', 'kenya', 'yatani', 'billion', 'floods']",Kenya,news article,English

Domestic violence surge in SA during pandemic

Newly released police data has revealed a surge in domestic violence assaults during South Australia’s COVID-19 lockdowns and periods of heightened restrictions.

According to the South Australian Police figures, there were 9,526 domestic violence assaults reported to police in 2020 compared to 8,587 in 2019 — an increase of 11 per cent.

There was a particularly pronounced spike in the six months South Australians were encouraged to stay inside from March to August, with an additional 440 reports of DV assaults compared to the same period in 2019.

White Ribbon Australia executive director Brad Chilcott said the figures should compel the South Australian Government to treat the situation as an emergency and immediately put more resources into housing for women and safety services.

The rise in incidents matches similar spikes around the country and globally.

A survey by the Australian Institute of Criminology in 2020 revealed almost 10% of Australian women in a relationship had experienced domestic violence during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, with two-thirds of those women reporting the attacks started or became worse during this period.

The United Nations has declared the global surge in violence against women a “shadow pandemic”.

People who feel concerned should contact the 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) phone number, DV Crisis Line on 1800 800 098, or contact SAPOL through 131 444 or Triple 000 if it is an emergency.

Ardern to reveal bubble opening on Tuesday

After months of planning, abandoned deadlines, dashed hopes and lingering doubts, the time may finally have come for the trans-Tasman travel bubble.

On Tuesday, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s cabinet is expected to sign off on an opening date for quarantine-free travel from Australia.

For separated families and tourism-reliant industries, pre-COVID travel rules can’t come soon enough.

Ms Ardern has walked away from two previous deadlines to create the bubble.

Last month, under pressure from her political opponents, Ms Ardern pledged to give a new start date on April 6.

Government officials have been tinkering with plans, including regulations for airports, airlines, how to contact trace Kiwis while overseas, and response protocols to Australian outbreaks.

One of the conditions of the plan is a separation of airports into ‘green zones’ for quarantine-free flights and ‘red zones’ for flights carrying passengers from countries with COVID in the community.

Airport executives say they ll be ready from mid-April, and health officials are due to inspect Auckland Airport this week with a view to clearing the country’s biggest airport for takeoff.

The NZ Herald reports Air New Zealand is planning on adding additional quarantine-free flights from Auckland to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane from next week.

The national carrier hopes to fly from NZ’s three other international airports, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown, when the bubble is announced.

Most Australian states have allowed Kiwis to visit without the need for a fortnight of hotel quarantine for months.

Australian couple freed in Myanmar

An Australian couple has been freed from house arrest in Myanmar and allowed to leave the country without charge.

Business consultants Christa Avery and her husband Matthew O’Kane were refused permission to leave Myanmar last month when they were about to board a flight home.

The country has been in turmoil since a military coup on February 1 that ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

“I am, of course, incredibly relieved to have been released and to be on my way home with my husband Matt,” Avery said in a statement.

“Even though I knew that I had done nothing wrong, it was very stressful being held under house arrest for 2 weeks.”

Another Australian, Sean Turnell, an economic adviser to Suu Kyi, has been detained since shortly after the army seized power and is in prison.

“I hope that even if Sean cannot be released very soon, he can, at least, be moved to house arrest for his physical, mental and emotional wellbeing,” Avery said.

Authorities have said Turnell is under investigation, but no charge has been announced against him.

A lawyer for Suu Kyi said last week that he understood Turnell faced charges under the Official Secrets Act, but no charges have been confirmed.

More than 2500 people have been detained since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group.

Thousands of protesters again took to the streets over the weekend, with demonstrators inscribing messages of protest on Easter eggs.

Messages including “Spring Revolution”, “We must win” and “Get out MAH” – referring to junta leader Min Aung Hlaing – were seen on eggs held in the air by protesters in photographs on social media on Sunday.

SA coronavirus patient in critical condition

A man rushed from hotel quarantine to the Royal Adelaide Hospital on the weekend is in critical condition.

The ill expatriate in his 40s, who is believed to have the South African strain of COVID-19, reported difficulty breathing and was moved to the hospital on Saturday.

He is understood to be the first COVID-19 patient in the hospital’s intensive care unit since May.

Australian Medical Association (AMA) South Australia president Chris Moy told the ABC he felt for the family of the man.

“My thoughts go out to the individual and their family — they’d be very, very worried at the moment. For them, COVID and the serious complications of COVID are real,” he said.

He warned that the increased infectivity of new strains such as the South African variant meant there was a higher risk of the virus “escaping” from controlled settings, and that South Australians should not get complacent about restrictions even as the vaccine is rolled out.

According to figures released on Sunday, 145 vaccinations were administered across the state the previous day.

South Australia reported a new case in hotel quarantine on Sunday in a young girl returned from overseas.

“She is considered an old infection but has been added to our case numbers as she has not been diagnosed and counted overseas,” SA Health said.

Labor wants new vaccine rollout timetable

Labor is demanding the Morrison government provide a new set of target dates for the vaccine rollout, saying it has made a mess of the timetable so far.

But Health Minister Greg Hunt insists as the domestic supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine from CSL ramps up, so will the vaccine program, although he is vague on the precise timetable.

The daily rate of vaccinations is increasing with over 79,000 completed on Thursday, compared with 55,000 on Monday last week.

But that brought the total number of Australians vaccinated to just 841,855, well short of the four million by the end of March once promised by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

“The Morrison Government is making a mess of this vaccine rollout and Australians expect and deserve clearer answers on when they are going to get the vaccine,” Labor’s health spokesman Mark Butler told reporters in Adelaide on Sunday.

He said just 14 per cent of those in aged care have received their two doses of the vaccine, when that program was also supposed to be finished last week.

“Australians want to know when their loved ones who might be in aged care facilities are going to get vaccinated because they know they are the most vulnerable people in our community,” Mr Butler said.

Mr Hunt defended the progress made so far and is confident that everyone that wants to get vaccinated will have their first dose by October.

He said there were three initial targets – to start the 1a Pfizer vaccinations in late February, to commence the 1a AstraZeneca rollout in in early March and to begin the 1b program on March 22.

“The principal three targets in terms of those commencement dates started exactly as we intended and then the other major goal for Australia is the end of October for all first doses,” Mr Hunt told reporters in Melbourne.

NSW boat explosion leaves four critical

A boat has exploded on the Hawkesbury River north of Sydney, leaving four people fighting for life with critical burns.

Eight people suffered burns and smoke inhalation in the explosion at Brooklyn near Danger Island on Sunday afternoon.

NSW Ambulance confirmed four of those on board were critically injured in the Easter Sunday incident that drew at least a dozen emergency crews.

They were taken to Royal North Shore Hospital under police escort.

Another two patients were transferred to Westmead Hospital in a serious condition, while the remaining two others were treated at the scene.

Fire and Rescue NSW said firefighters were tasked with driving ambulances to allow paramedics to treat patients in transit because of the seriousness of their injuries.

The vessel has sunk in shallow water with a slow fuel leak, with hazardous materials experts called in to contain it.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.

Pope slams weapons spending in Easter message

Pope Francis has urged countries in his Easter message to quicken distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly to the world’s poor, and called armed conflict and military spending during a pandemic “scandalous”.

Coronavirus has meant this has been the second year in a row that Easter papal services have been attended by small gatherings at a secondary altar of St Peter’s Basilica, instead of by crowds in the church or in the square outside.

After saying Mass on Sunday, Francis read his “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message, in which he traditionally reviews world problems and appeals for peace.

“The pandemic is still spreading, while the social and economic crisis remains severe, especially for the poor. Nonetheless – and this is scandalous – armed conflicts have not ended and military arsenals are being strengthened,” he said.

Francis, who would usually have given the address to up to 100,000 people in St Peter’s Square, spoke to fewer than 200 in the church while the message was broadcast to tens of millions around the world.

The square was empty except for a few police officers enforcing a strict three-day national lockdown.

Facebook data on over 500m accounts found

Details from more than 500 million Facebook users have been found available on a website for hackers.

The information appears to be several years old, but it is another example of the vast amount of information collected by Facebook and other social media sites, and the limits to how secure that information is.

The availability of the data set was first reported by Business Insider. According to that publication, it has information from 106 countries including phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, and email addresses.

Facebook has been grappling with data security issues for years. In 2018, the social media giant disabled a feature that allowed users to search for one another via phone number following revelations that the political firm Cambridge Analytica had accessed information on up to 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge or consent.

In December 2019, a Ukrainian security researcher reported finding a database with the names, phone numbers and unique user IDs of more than 267 million Facebook users – nearly all US-based – on the open internet. It is unclear if the current data dump is related to this database.

Deadly floods, landslides in Indonesia

Flash floods unleashed by torrential rains have killed 41 people on the Indonesian island of Flores, the disaster management agency BNPB says, and at least three more were reported killed in neighbouring East Timor.

At least 49 families were hit on Flores, in the east of Indonesia’s sprawling archipelago, Raditya Jati, a BNPB spokesman said in a statement on Sunday.

“Dozens of houses were buried in mud in Lamanele village… residents’ houses washed away by the flood,” Raditya said, referring to the eastern part of Flores.

On Adonara island to the east of Flores, a bridge collapsed and rescuers were battling heavy rain, strong wind and waves, he added.

In East Timor, a two-year-old child was among at least three people killed in a landslide on the outskirts of the capital, Dili, a Reuters witness said, although there was no official toll of casualties or deaths.

“Heavy rains and overflowing water have drowned people’s homes and have also claimed the lives of several victims,” East Timor deputy prime minister Jose Reis said in a statement.

Power supplies were cut and the presidential palace was flooded as heavy rain and strong winds have lashed Dili since late on Saturday.

Outrage over ‘secret restaurants’ in Paris

France is in an uproar over a television report about secret meals in luxury restaurants in breach of COVID-19 restrictions – and now the authorities have become involved.

The report by channel M6 shows, for one thing, a secret high-end restaurant in Paris open despite the coronavirus measures.

“I have eaten this week in two or three restaurants that are so-called illegal restaurants with a number of ministers,” a man introduced as an organiser of a secret party says in the report.

The Paris prosecutor’s office launched an investigation on Sunday.

“The aim of the investigation is to verify whether parties were organised in violation of health regulations and to determine who the organisers and participants may have been,” it said.

Restaurants in France were closed at the end of October because of the pandemic.

“People who come here take off their masks,” says an unrecognisable staff member.

“Once you are through the door here, there is no COVID.”

The coronavirus situation in France is extremely tense, with new nationwide restrictions only coming into force at the weekend.

SA with edge over Victoria in Shield clash

Victoria were all start but not much finish as they struggled to match South Australia’s first innings 333 in their Sheffield Shield clash.

At stumps on day two at St Kilda’s Junction Oval, Victoria were 7-201 with Sam Harper (25) and Mitchell Perry (4) the not out batsmen.

Much like the Redbacks, the Victorian batsmen largely failed to go on with the job after solid enough starts.

Things started poorly when Travis Dean lasted just two balls, dismissed lbw to the retiring Chadd Sayers (1-22) for a duck.

Marcus Harris (42) and Peter Handscomb (26) kept the score ticking over before falling to Travis Head and David Grant respectively.

Despite a handy 60 from James Seymour, the Bushrangers mostly struggled from there as they slipped from 3-161.

Earlier, spinner Sam Kerber (55) hung in for a bright half century for the Redbacks to help bolster their total.

He was one of seven batsmen to score 25 or more for SA.

The reliable Head had top-scored with 76.

619,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,New York City FC halts slide with road win over hapless Philadelphia Union - Goal USA,https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/philadelphia-union-new-york-city-fc-mls/fzqdseg2sjfy12kwxk4x3rx25,"NYCFC halts slide with road win over hapless Union

The Philadelphia Union pushed their winless slide to six games, 14 dating back to 2016, as their attack stagnated yet again in Friday's loss to NYCFC.

CHESTER, Pa. — As soon as the final whistle blew on Friday night to signal the end of the Philadelphia Union's latest failed attempt at winning a match, the boos immediately began raining down at Talen Energy Stadium. You couldn't really blame Union supporters. Not after a loss that stretched their team's winless rut to 14 total matches spread over two seasons and eight months.

David Villa's floating shot from more than 50 yards away provided a fitting end to New York City FC's 2-0 road victory over the Union on a night when NYCFC was clearly the better team, created the better chances, and outplayed a Union side that once again lacked attacking punch.

WATCH: David Villa scores 50-yd goal

This has become the trend for a Union side that has struggled for answers in the final third, an issue that returned on Friday night even after coach Jim Curtin shook up his lineup. Curtin turned to Roland Alberg in the playmaking role he was expected to fill when the season began. Concerns about Alberg's fitness kept him from starting prior to Friday, but Curtin gave him a start to see if he could spark a Union attack that had managed just five goals in its first five matches.

Alberg failed to provide a spark, and offered little to the attack before being replaced by rookie Adam Najem in the 72hd minute. Instead of showing Curtin why he deserved to be in the lineup, Alberg did more to show Union fans why Curtin had kept him out of the starting lineup to start the season.

However, Alberg was by no means the one to blame for Philadelphia's lackluster display. It was a group effort, or rather a group lack of quality, particularly in the attacking half of the field, where wingers Chris Pontius and Ilsinho put a lot of defensive work into pressuring NYCFC's offense, but couldn't muster much in the attack.

NYCFC stuck with most of the same starters it has had all season, save for a shift at right back, where Ethan White returned to the lineup in place of Felix Brillant, whose defensive blunder led to D.C. United's winning goal last week. The NYCFC front six controlled play for stretches, and created good chances, only to be thwarted by bad finishing or Andre Blake's acrobatics.

Blake was the lone bright spot on the night for the Union. The Jamaican shot stopper kept the Union in the match with a series of top-shelf saves. Blake delivered the save of the night in the 22nd minute when he denied a Jack McInerney blast from 20 yards that kept the visitors off the scoreboard and helped keep the pro-Union crowd from turning on its struggling team. Blake delivered once again just eight minutes later, stretching to deny a Maxi Moralez blast immediately after Richie Marquez stopped a Villa shot with a sliding chest block that replays showed to be a handball — something that didn't go unnoticed by NYCFC, which protested vehemently at the no-call.

The Union had their share of luck in the first. Not only in the form of the missed penalty call on Marquez's handball, but also on a sliding tackle from behind by rookie Jack Elliott on Villa that drew a yellow card, but could easily have been a red.

The home side couldn't turn that good luck into an advantage though and watched as NYCFC took control of the match through healthy stretches of possession and sharper passing than the Union could string together.

Jack Harrison's 52nd minute goal gave NYCFC the lead, and control of the match. Curtin tried to counter with attacking substitutions such as Najem, Jay Simpson and Fabian Herbers, but none led to any serious testing of the NYCFC goalkeeper Sean Johnson.

Curtin's team didn't lack for hustle, but what the Union lacked in abundance was creativity. Only Haris Medunjanin really offered anything in the way of consistently effective passes. Medunjanin showed why he is among the league leaders in chances created, with his ability to break defensive lines with his pinpoint long passes from deep in midfield, but those passes were too often wasted by bad touches, poor runs and weak follow-up passes.

NYCFC grew sharper as the game went on, no doubt settling into a comfort zone when it became clear the Union weren't going to pose much of a threat in the second half. The visitors appeared content to return to New York with a 1-0 victory before Villa's prayer of a shot from near the center circle, which Blake couldn't race back in time to keep out. The goal summed up the Union night so perfectly. Blake had been their lone bright spot, but even he was left to hang his head in shame as the final whistle blew and disgusted Union fans voiced their outrage.

The Union return to Talen Energy Stadium next week to take on equally-struggling Montreal, in a match Philadelphia must win if this season is going to be turned around before it falls into nightmare territory.

34,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"New Flying Reptile Found in ""Unprecedented"" Pterosaur Boneyard - National Geographic",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/140813-pterosaur-dinosaurs-science-animals-new-species,"Nearly 50 skeletons of a new species of ancient flying reptile have been unearthed in southern Brazil, an ""absolutely unprecedented"" discovery, one expert says.

Varying ages of the newfound species, dubbed Caiuajara dobruskii, fill the rare boneyard, which was once part of a desert lake in the late Cretaceous period, about 100 million to 66 million years ago. With a wingspan of up to 7.7 feet (2.35 meters) C. dobruskii had a head that was shaped differently from those of other pterosaurs, including a bony protrusion in front of its eyes. (See ""New Golden Age for Pterosaurs, Flying Reptiles of the Dinosaur Era."")

The discovery offers the ""best evidence ever uncovered"" that the extinct dinosaur-era animals, called pterosaurs, may have lived in colonies, said study author Alexander Kellner, a paleontologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

It also offers a new window into how the animals—the first vertebrates to fly—developed into adults.

Finding such an intact fossil site is unusual—though pterosaurs were found on every continent, their fragile wing bones do not preserve well. What's more, most pterosaur remains have been found near what was once oceans or lagoons, not desert.

""To be honest with you, when they first told me they had pterosaur bones, I was going, 'Yeah, sure,'"" Kellner said. But once he confirmed the bones, he was thrilled. (See ""Toothy Texas Pterosaur Discovered; Soared Over Dallas."")

""To find part of what could be part of a [pterosaur] population is really splendid,"" he said.

Flamingo-Like Reptiles?

Caiuajara dobruskii gets the second half of its name from Alexandre Dobruski and João Dobruski, the local father and son who first noticed odd bones poking out of the ground near Cruzeiro do Oeste (map) in 1971. But it wasn't until a few years ago that paleontologists began excavating the site and found the incredible jumble of skeletons.

It's unknown why or how the 47 pterosaurs died, but it's possible a desert storm or a drought caused their untimely ends, Kellner said.

To Mark Witton, author of the 2013 book Pterosaurs, the ""gem"" of the new research is finding so many pterosaurs in one place from the same species.

For instance, the number of animals found together suggests that C. dobruskii lived in groups, like flamingos, which may have flocked to the inland lake as an oasis in the otherwise dry landscape, said Witton, who was not involved in the research.

What's more, the new research, published August 13 in the journal PLOS ONE, allows scientists to chart the development of a pterosaur from youth to adulthood, providing ""a really detailed, step-by-step representation of actual fossils and how it changes,"" Witton said. (See ""Pterosaur 'Runway' Found; Shows Birdlike Landing Style."")

Historically, scientists have only been able to piece together how pterosaurs developed and lived based on skeleton fragments.

Independent Youth

Already, the new study hints that young pterosaurs were not highly dependent on their parents.

That's because juvenile pterosaurs found in the boneyard seemed to be miniature versions of adults—for instance, the young sported the adult signature crests on their heads.

Being so well developed, this means the young could also probably fly from birth, noted James Clark, a biologist at George Washington University's Columbian College of Arts and Sciences in Washington, D.C., who was also not involved in the new study.

It's ""really rare to get that kind of assemblage and growth series—you don't see that in that same extent in other collections"" of pterosaur fossils, Clark said.

Such independence is typical of some modern reptiles, such as crocodiles, which are born looking like tiny grown-ups, Witton added. (See ""Meet Kryptodrakon: Oldest Known Pterodactyl Found in China."")

""This is really going to give us so much information about how these animals grow, what their population structures were like—so much data for us to look at,"" Witton said.

And experts seem confident more fossils await. Said Witton: ""I'm sure this is not the last we've heard of this site.""

 Short - range forecasts up to 31 th October, marking the end of the season shows continued favorable seasonal conditions in most of the region except some localized pockets of moderate dryness. It is thus likely that the rainy season will be abnormally late particularly in the Sahel region.

 Early October, the end of the rainy season in the Sahel, West Africa has been characterized by mostly adequate and well-distributed rains: this results in average to above-average seasonal rainfall The Sahel region benefited the most from very good conditions with well above-average seasonal rains, while belowaverage rainfall spread over the southernmost part of the region across the Gulf of Guinea. The cumulative heavy rainfall recorded from mid-August to September resulted in flooding, that have affected about 760,000 people in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal with at least 111 fatalities.

 As a result of increase in rainfall since late July and wetter conditions in August and September: a pattern of strongly above-average vegetation emerged during September and October in all of the Sahel. Agricultural areas benefitted from very good seasonal conditions. Good production prospects are certain this year in the region (in biomass and crops production). As a result of good seasonal performance in mid-October water resources remain at a good level. Overall they have reached their highest level throughout the West African region.

 Across the Sahel, harvest has started for main season millet and sorghum crops in southern Mali, Burkina Faso, southern Niger, and eastern Senegal. Meanwhile favourable harvesting of main season crops reached completion in Liberia, Cte dIvoire, southern Ghana, southern Togo, Benin, and central Cameroon, while crops are still developing in Guinea, northern Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, and northern Nigeria under generally favourable conditions.

2063,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil mining flood could devastate environment for years - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-damburst-environment-idUSKCN0T40PY20151115,"RIO DOCE, Brazil (Reuters) - The collapse of two dams at a Brazilian mine has cut off drinking water for quarter of a million people and saturated waterways downstream with dense orange sediment that could wreck the ecosystem for years to come.

General view from above of a dam owned by Vale SA and BHP Billiton Ltd that burst, in Mariana, Brazil, November 10, 2015. REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes

Nine people were killed, 19 are still listed as missing and 500 people were displaced from their homes when the dams burst at an iron ore mine in southeastern Brazil on Nov. 5.

The sheer volume of water disgorged by the dams and laden with mineral waste across nearly 500 km is staggering: 60 million cubic meters, the equivalent of 25,000 Olympic swimming pools or the volume carried by about 187 oil tankers.

President Dilma Rousseff compared the damage to the 2010 oil spill by BP PLC in the Gulf of Mexico and Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira called it an “environmental catastrophe.”

Scientists say the sediment, which may contain chemicals used by the mine to reduce iron ore impurities, could alter the course of streams as they harden, reduce oxygen levels in the water and diminish the fertility of riverbanks and farmland where floodwater passed.

Samarco Mineração SA, a joint venture between mining giants Vale SA and BHP Billiton and owner of the mine, has repeatedly said the mud is not toxic.

But biologists and environmental experts disagree. Local authorities have ordered families rescued from the flood to wash thoroughly and dispose of clothes that came in contact with the mud.

“It’s already clear wildlife is being killed by this mud,” said Klemens Laschesfki, professor of geosciences at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. “To say the mud is not a health risk is overly simplistic.”

As the heavy mud hardens, Laschesfki says, it will make farming difficult. And so much silt will settle along the bottom of the Rio Doce and the tributaries that carried the mud there that the very course of watershed could change.

“Many regions will never be the same,” he says.

Researchers are testing the river water and results should be published over the coming weeks, giving a better idea of the contents of the mining waste.

One cause for concern is that compounds known as ether amines could have been used at the mine to separate silica from the iron ore, in order to produce a better quality product.

According to mining industry research and scientific literature published in recent years, the compounds are commonly used at Brazilian mines, including Samarco’s.

At least some of the compounds, according to the website of Air Products, a company that produces them, “are not readily biodegradable and have high toxicity to aquatic organisms.” They can also raise PH levels to a point that is environmentally harmful.

“There will be serious problems using the water from the river now,” says Pedro Antonio Molinas, a water resources engineer and mining industry consultant familiar with the region.

Samarco did not respond to questions about whether it used the compounds or whether they were in the so-called tailings pond whose contents burst through the broken dams.

‘SWEET RIVER’

The disaster is the latest assault on the Rio Doce, or “Sweet River”, one of the main routes connecting mineral-rich Minas Gerais state with the Atlantic Ocean.

Once lined with thick rainforest and populated by indigenous tribes, the waterway has long suffered because of ravenous demand for the minerals nearby.

So synonymous is it with the mining industry that Vale, which means “valley” in Portuguese, refers to the land through which the river runs. Before a name change in 2007, the miner was formally known as the Vale of the Rio Doce Company.

Its banks now barren, and bed full of silt, the river grew prone to flooding with heavy rains that over the years devastated communities along its more than 800 km course.

More recently it was plagued by drought.

On Thursday, the river running a reddish brown, farmhands moved livestock away from its banks, afraid to let cattle drink the water. At a picnic table, Nilo Candido da Silva, 74, said he never saw devastation on this scale during a life spent by the river.

“I don’t think I’ll ever see it go back to normal,” said Silva, gazing at thick mud and shredded trees where last week the river rose but now just a brown trickle flows. A fish lay dead in the mud.

As the mud flows toward the ocean, environmentalists fear its impact on the coast too.

“Who had the brilliant idea of opening the dams along the river?” asked marine biologist Andre Ruschi in a Facebook post, referring to the decision by authorities to open dams along the Rio Doce to allow the surge to dissipate and proceed toward the ocean.

The mouth of the Rio Doce is a nesting area for endangered sea turtles, an animal sensitive to chemical changes in the water. The beaches are expected to turn a deep red.

“It’s a huge shock for nature,” said Professor David Zee, an expert in oceanography and the environment at the State University in Rio de Janeiro.",2015-11-15 08:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'brazil', 'flood', 'environment', 'river', 'mud', 'devastate', 'doce', 'dams', 'vale', 'used', 'compounds', 'mining', 'rio']",Brazil,news article,English

The recent, devastating floods highlight the fragility of the country's natural environment. Deforestation, expanded farming, timber harvesting, and hydroelectric dams are the main culprits. In four years, 7,300 hectares of forest have been lost. So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built with another 450 on their way.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews)  Recent floods in Vietnam caused by typhoons and tropical storms have had a devastating impact in terms of lost human lives, environmental damage, and economic dislocations, highlighting the fragility of the Asian country's environment.

Frequent and violent weather events worry both environmentalists and the affected communities more and more.

According to Vietnams Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, the main factor is deforestation and the conversion of entire forests to farmland, timber harvesting, and the large dam and hydroelectric plant construction.

Among the most affected areas are the central coastal region and the central Highlands, scene of the recent devastations.

The General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control estimates that some 7,300 hectares of forest land were lost between 2016 and 2019, with an annual average of 1,800.

At the current rate of deforestation, if nothing is done to slow this down, the risk of floods and landslides will increase considerably, along with periods of drought and loss of mangroves.

Environmentalists and experts note that the life and survival of Highland communities are closely linked to local forests.

From the central part of the country to the Mekong River Delta in the south, forests play a leading role in regulating local ecosystems, biodiversity, water resources, and the climate of much of the country.

For Prof Nguy?n Ng?c Lung, forests are key to blocking winds, limiting soil erosion and containing the devastating force of storms. In addition, tree roots absorb excess water.

Deforestation contributes to climate change, global warming, drought, rising water levels, pollution, and famine.

In view of the situation, the General Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control is sounding the alarm, noting that the country has recently had to face between 10 and 15 floods.

The blame goes to extensive legal and illegal deforestation to expand farmland, harvest timber or build crucial hydro-electric plants to meet the countrys energy needs.

So far, about 800 large, medium and small plants have been built and another 450 are in the planning phase with further devastating impact on the environment.

Some see these plants as ""water bombs"" ready to strike at the population. Their effects are visible in many parts of the country, including Da Lat, a city that is located about 1,500 metres above sea level and a major tourist destination, with its almost year-round cool and temperate climate.

Since 2012, the city has been hit by flooding with increasing frequency, to the extent that today, when rain is intense, many parts of the city and Lam Dong province ""end up submerged by water"".

Large-scale devastation

The sudden flood in the middle of the day in the Dhauli Ganga, Rishi Ganga and Alaknanda rivers — all intricately linked tributaries of the Ganga — triggered widespread panic and large-scale devastation in the high mountain areas.

Responding to the statement by Guterres, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador T S Tirumurti, said: “Deeply appreciate the sentiments expressed by UN Secretary General”.

Lull season may have saved many lives in Uttarakhand

Earlier in the day, President of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir said that he is closely following the situation in Uttarakhand.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has said that seven bodies have been recovered while at least 125 people are missing.

The glacier burst led to a rise in water levels in the river Rishiganga, which washed away the Rishiganga small hydro project of 13.2 MW.

1512,FL-2021-000030-IDN,New promise of forecasting meteotsunamis: Photographer's images aid research of rare Great Lakes wave - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/04/210401151245.htm,"On the afternoon of April 13, 2018, a large wave of water surged across Lake Michigan and flooded the shores of the picturesque beach town of Ludington, Michigan, damaging homes and boat docks, and flooding intake pipes. Thanks to a local citizen's photos and other data, NOAA scientists reconstructed the event in models and determined this was the first ever documented meteotsunami in the Great Lakes caused by an atmospheric inertia-gravity wave.

An atmospheric inertia-gravity wave is a wave of air that can run from 6 to 60 miles long that is created when a mass of stable air is displaced by an air mass with significantly different pressure. This sets in motion a wave of air with rising and falling pressure that can influence the water below, as it synchronizes with water movement on the lake's surface like two singers harmonizing.

""That meteotsunami was hands down off the chart awesome,"" said Debbie Maglothin of Ludington who took photos of the event. ""The water in between the breakwaters didn't go down like the water on the outside of them, so it created waterfalls that cascaded over the breakwaters. Had this event occurred during summer it could have washed people right off the breakwaters.""

Meteotsunamis generated from this type atmospheric condition are common around the globe, but in the Great Lakes, the few well documented meteotsunamis have been driven by sudden severe thunderstorms where both winds and air pressure changes have played significant roles.

Combining water and weather models

While there are currently no forecast models that effectively predict meteotsunamis in the U.S., new NOAA research based on the Ludington wave demonstrates that existing NOAA numerical weather prediction models and hydrodynamic forecast models may enable scientists to predict these meteotsunami-driving atmospheric waves minutes to hours in advance. The research is published in a special edition of the journal Natural Hazards about meteotsunamis.

""The good news with this type of meteotsunami is that it is easier to predict than ones triggered by thunderstorms,"" said Eric Anderson, an oceanographer at NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory and lead author of the study. ""Our short-range weather models can pick up these atmospheric pressure waves, whereas predicting thunderstorms is more difficult.""

Meteotsunamis are a lesser known category of tsunami. Unlike the more well known tsunami -- such as the catastrophic 2004 Boxing Day tsunami in Indonesia, which was caused by an earthquake on the seafloor, meteotsunamis are caused by weather, in particular some combination of changing air pressure, strong winds and thunderstorm activity.

""Because the lakes are relatively small, meteotsunamis typically need more than a jump in air pressure to drive them,"" said Anderson. ""That's where the thunderstorms and wind come in to give them a push.""

Great Lakes have history of meteotsunamis

Meteotsunamis occur around the world, and are known to occur in the United States primarily on the Great Lakes and along the East and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Meteotsunami waves in the Great Lakes can be particularly insidious because they can bounce off the shoreline and come back again when the skies are clear. They are relatively rare and typically small, the largest producing three to six foot waves, which only occur about once every 10 years.

Predicting these waves in advance would give communities potentially life-saving warnings and would allow residents and businesses to take measures to better protect property. The Ludington meteotsunami resulted in some property damage but no serious injuries. Had the meteotsunami struck in the summer when swimmers, anglers and vacationers flock to the lakeshore beaches, parks and waters, it might have been a different story, as was the case with a meteotsunami that took the lives of eight people in Chicago in June 1954.

""It's a gap in our forecasting,"" said Anderson. ""With this study and other research we are getting closer to being able to predict them in advance.""",2021-04-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['rare', 'promise', 'forecasting', 'images', 'research', 'waves', 'pressure', 'water', 'meteotsunamis', 'wave', 'atmospheric', 'photographers', 'great', 'models', 'air', 'meteotsunami', 'lakes']",India,news article,English
1205,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Rain and melting snow sparks flood alert in eastern Canada - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/4/18/rain-and-melting-snow-sparks-flood-alert-in-eastern-canada,"Quebec flooding could be worse than in 2017 as rapid thaw causes ice jam to give way.

The small Canadian city of Beauceville, located to the east of Quebec City, was assessing major damage on Wednesday after an ice jam broke free in the spring thaw the day before, sending icy water down roads and flooding streets.

The floodwater rose quickly, moving chunks of ice and debris along with it through submerged roads according to the state broadcaster CBC.

Canadian news outlets reported that somewhere between 230 and 300 homes and businesses were flooded and that several dozen people had been displaced from their homes.

Water levels are now starting to drop along the Chaudiere River in Beauceville but the actual clean-up is expected to take many days if not weeks.

Such flooding has not been seen in the area in over a decade, and local meteorologists say that temperatures in the region are expected to stay above freezing. This means that the increased risk of flooding from melting snow is ongoing.

Meanwhile, the city of Rigaud, near the Quebec-Ontario border, is telling residents to pack up and leave their homes over the next 24 hours as Thursday and Friday will bring heavy rains, and the resulting floods could be worse than those in the spring of 2017.

Marie Andree Gagnon, a spokesperson for the municipality on the Ottawa River, west of Montreal, said flooding will peak over the next four days and will worsen quickly once it starts.

Environment Canada, which is part of the environment ministry, said 25 to 50 millimetres of rain is expected to fall in the region over Thursday and Friday, and the still-frozen ground has a limited ability to absorb it. More rain is forecast for the weekend.

Officials in Montreal and Laval are also bracing for flooding that could come by the weekend, as the storm clouds dumping rain near the Ontario border move further east.

Starting on Sunday, areas hit by flooding in 2017 could be in for more of the same. Montreal has not given an estimate of how many residences are at risk of flooding, but it said the same areas as 2017 will be affected.",2019-04-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['snow', 'alert', 'sparks', '2017', 'worse', 'spring', 'canada', 'ice', 'thaw', 'flood', 'rain', 'montreal', 'melting', 'expected', 'eastern', 'city', 'flooding']",Canada,news article,English

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beat/University of North Carolina PressWho doesnt love a book with more than one index entry for possum? Two hundred of them were cooked at an Oklahoma City bash in 1923, along with 5,000 chickens, 10 bears, 500 beef cattle, 5 tons of coffee, etc. These are but some of the many fascinating facts in Adrian Millers new book Black Smoke: African Americans and the United States of Barbecue.Meet One of the First Barbecue Kings: Henry Poppa MillerThe Lost African-American Bartenders who Created the CocktailThe book has 22 recipes (bison skewers, banana pudding, alligator ribs), 16 mini-profiles (such as barbecue king Henry Poppa Miller), and a big mission.In the 1990s, Miller worked as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton in the One America Initiative, which had the goal of fostering dialogue and helping communities reconcile racial divisions. Millers books could be seen as an extension of that experience. His James Beard Award-winning Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time expounded upon the social history of key soul dishesfried chicken, chitlins, yams. In The Presidents Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas, Miller researched the contributions of African Americans who worked in the White House kitchen.So faced with a whitewashed and one-sided representation of barbecue, Miller got to work. While most people agree that barbecue is a result of European influences dovetailing with Native American techniques in Southern kitchens where the cooks were African Americansthat barbecue, in other words, is Blackevidence, by which I mean scholarly evidence, well-researched and reliably sourced, has been vanishingly scant.To find that essential information, Miller turned mostly to newspaper archives.For all my books, the biggest boon has been newspapers, he told me. They were about capturing the daily life of the community, and so you got a lot more flourish and details about what was happening at a particular event.He sifted through the records of the speakers and the attendees at big community barbecueswhich was tough work, since the food was often barely mentioned.Eventually, writers started paying more attention to the details and at a time when African Americans went unnoticed more and more of them started talking to these Black barbecuers.Now, lets just be straight up, Miller said. Part of this was to mock them. So youd have them speaking in plantation dialect. But you saw other writers treating this person as an expert, as an artist and showing some love.Ive struggled on how to tell people this, Miller told me. During the racist times you actually got more details.And by the 1830s, in order to have legit barbecue, it was thought, an African American cook and his crew were necessary and barbecue was understood to be a Black experience. Miller explained a complicated twist in the narrative in words far more polite than I might have chosen: In the 1850s, as theres more and more tension about slavery, you actually find pro-slavery advocates using the plantation barbecue as evidence of their generosity.After the Civil War, a group of African Americans emerged from slavery with a highly specialized and marketable skill. Barbecue culture flourished because African Americans were barbecuing on their own terms. And that shows up with political barbecue, church barbecue and also emancipation barbecues.Barbecue, after all, is perfectly suited to big crowds. You can feed thousands of people, as many as show up, as long as youve got the wood, the space and the meat.But the meat, says Miller, is not as cut-and-dried, so to speak, as one might think.In words sure to bring upon him (if not me, by association) a plague of wonky BBQ commentary, Miller reports that: The regional barbecue styles that we fight about so fiercely today, theyre only about a hundred years old. Before that, barbecue was pretty standardized. It was hardwood coals in a trench, butterflied whole carcasses, flip it and sauce it, cut it up and serve it. Pork was common, of course, but so was lamb and mutton, and the first emancipation barbecue, which took place in Port Royal, South Carolina, was a beef barbecue.Equally fascinating are the unsung regions of barbecue that Miller has championed such as St. Louis, Chicago, and the east side of Texas, where the meat comes with sauce and the sides arent the Germanic salads you find in Central Texas but soul food greens and creole dirty rice.So what happened over the last century? How did we get to a place where white people are thought to own barbecue?At the very time that people are getting interested in barbecue, the non-diverse food media basically said OK, these are the people we think should tell you what barbecue is, and where to get the good stuff. And they just kept putting white dude after white dude out in front.And as he says it, and we talk about the trends that get pushed in barbecue, it becomes obvious, almost to the point of hilarity: the reason the mantra of barbecue became minimal seasoning was because we kept asking white people how to make barbecue. I suggest that I hear an echo of the old joke about how white people dont season their food, and he laughs and agrees.Well just flip that to our advantage, Miller said, and say you dont need to season.This trend is a big part of what brought Miller to write this book. Chronically, theres been so little coverage of African American barbecue culture. Everywhere in the food media, the lack of African American representation just hit me over and over.He wasnt sure, upon setting out on the project, how much he would find, and he feared, in the beginning, that he might be embarking on a record of faded glory. I really thought I was going to be writing an elegy about Black barbecue, he said. But its thriving. Its resilient.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

1292,FL-2020-000038-EGY,More than 30 killed as two trains collide in Egypt - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/03/26/more-than-30-killed-as-two-trains-collide-in-egypt/,"National-World

At least 32 people have been killed and 165 injured after two trains collided in Egypt on Friday, according to government statements.

Seventy-two ambulances were sent to the scene and reinforcement medical teams were sent to the incident in the Tahta district of the Upper Egypt governorate of Sohag from the capital Cairo, the Health Ministry said.

Health Minister Hala Zayed said in a news conference that two planes were dispatched from Cairo with 52 medical teams from various specialties on board to treat the injured.

Images from the scene showed crowds of people gathered around the twisted wreckage of the trains.

The collision happened after an unidentified person pulled an emergency brake, Egypt’s railway authority said in a statement.

The authority said that at 11:42 a.m. local time (5:42 a.m. ET) a train heading from Aswan to Cairo hit the rear of a train heading from Luxor to Alexandria, which was stuck on the railway line after an emergency brake was activated.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said that “whoever has caused the Sohag train accident, will receive the deterrent penalty.”

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly added that any “error or negligence will not be tolerated, and the perpetrator will be held accountable for the accident.”

Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said that the country’s railway facilities have “witnessed decades of neglect, lack of development and maintenance, which is leaving it in a state that led to danger.”

“Control systems operate manually, train cars have run out of date,” he told Egyptian TV, while inspecting the site.

Egypt’s aging railway system has witnessed a deadly accident almost every year for the past 20 years. In 2018, Egypt recorded 2,044 train accidents and in 2017, 1,793 accidents were recorded according to data published by the official statistics agency Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS).

Two years ago, at least 25 people were killed and dozens injured in a fire at Ramses station in central Cairo, the country’s busiest, after a train collided with the platform, causing its fuel tank to explode.

A collision between two trains in Alexandria, Egypt’s second largest city, in August 2017 left more than 40 dead and many more injured.

In 2012, 44 children died after a train crashed into a school bus in Egypt’s Asyut governante.

But the most lethal accident in Egyptian rail history occurred in 2002, when a fire on a passenger train traveling from Cairo south to Luxor killed more than 360 people.",2021-03-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['killed', 'egypt', 'accident', 'train', '30', 'trains', 'railway', 'witnessed', 'egypts', 'minister', 'cairo', 'collide']",Egypt,news article,English
436,DR-2021-000054-SOM,The role of drought and water in conflict - Arab News,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1857386,"The role of drought and water in conflict

The Middle East and many parts of Africa are arid regions with long experience of drought. However, anthropogenic climate change threatens to significantly exacerbate these challenges. In 2017, the World Bank noted that, “while population and economic growth will increase water demands, climate change will be the primary driver for the most pronounced changes in surface water stress across” the Middle East. The UN has projected that temperature increases in the Sahel will be 1.5 times higher than the global average. Multiple studies indicate that the risks of prolonged, severe drought will be higher as the global climate shifts. Climate change is not the only problem: Population growth, economic development, unsustainable agricultural policies, poor infrastructure, and other factors contribute. Nonetheless, climate change will intensify all of these factors.

Increased drought conditions and more variable rainfall patterns will present many challenges to the Middle East and Africa. One of those challenges will be the way that water stress intersects with conflict and violent extremist groups. While there is statistical evidence that climate change increases the risk of conflict, it is often difficult to draw clear causal links between drought and conflict. In any conflict, there are multiple factors that contribute to violence. Drought puts stress on existing fractures in a society and increases the risk of conflict by exacerbating problems such as inequality, unemployment, migration, food shortages and governance failures. Drought diminishes a society’s overall resilience.

Conflict over water in the Middle East and Africa is as old as civilization, but climate change and population growth are compounding age-old problems. In some cases, water shortages lead to direct forms of conflict. Tribes, local communities and even countries can dispute and contest access to water sources. On a national level, upstream states can take steps that threaten downstream states’ basic access to water, leading to disputes that increase the risk of war — reflected in recent concerns about potential conflict between Ethiopia and Egypt.

More often, drought and water shortages contribute to conflict indirectly by weakening societal and governing structures and putting more stress on existing divisions. Drought can increase competition for food and push food prices higher, with destabilizing effects. Water shortages undermine faith in governments, putting strain on societies that are already struggling with weak governance and benefiting insurgent or extremist groups. War can damage water infrastructure — as it has in Yemen and Syria, for example — which puts further pressures on vulnerable populations. These factors contribute to feedback loops that erode a country’s or a community’s stability.

In many cases, prolonged droughts so badly damage agricultural communities that they lead to migration to urban areas, as has happened in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen and Jordan. Such migration from an unusually severe and prolonged drought clearly contributed to the factors behind the Syrian civil war.

Water shortages provide violent extremist organizations with opportunities to expand their influence. Kerry Boyd Anderson

Another negative impact of the increased risk of drought is that water shortages provide violent extremist organizations with opportunities to expand their influence. At the most basic level, there are examples of extremist groups attacking farmers and stealing their food supplies in the midst of drought or famine, as Al-Shabaab reportedly did in Somalia during the 2011 famine. Such actions contribute to humanitarian disaster and conflict cycles.

In other cases, violent extremist organizations take somewhat more sophisticated approaches to exploiting water shortages. They can benefit from a sense that governments are unable to meet people’s basic needs. There are examples from countries such as Iraq and Mali of extremist groups recruiting boys and men who can no longer survive from farming or herding due to severe drought. Daesh used control of limited water resources to charge taxes to fund its operations and try to present itself as a governing authority. Extremist groups have exploited migrants who have been forced to move due to drought and have used control over water resources to reward allies and punish enemies.

Throughout history, many actors have weaponized water, but Daesh took such actions to a new level. Its brief control of the Mosul Dam threatened many communities as well as opposing forces. Both Daesh and Al-Shabaab used water tactically, diverting it to block opposing forces. They have also attempted to use water to reward allies and punish opponents.

The intersections of climate change, drought, and conflict and violent extremism are complex and vary from country to country. Therefore, solutions to these problems must also be both multifaceted and tailored to the specific conditions in a country or locale. Recognizing that there are links between climate change, drought and floods, and conflict and violent extremist groups is an important start.

Solutions could include shaping aid policies and counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies to take water scarcity into account. Ensuring access to water for displaced populations is an important step. Aid programs can help provide farmers with more efficient farming techniques and tools, such as drip irrigation, and can help build infrastructure that wastes less water. All governments should work to mitigate global climate change.

Governments can also take steps to enforce norms against weaponizing water. There are some international agreements, such as Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions, which can be used to hold actors who weaponize water accountable. Military operations should seek to avoid any direct or collateral damage to water infrastructure, thereby reinforcing a norm against weaponizing water and helping prevent conditions that feed into the conflict cycle. Access to water is a basic human need that should not be a part of warfare.

2042,FL-2017-000067-BRA,News Feature: A sea in the Amazon - pnas.org,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/10/e2102396118,"Did the Caribbean sweep into the western Amazon millions of years ago, shaping the region’s rich biodiversity?

A tropical shrub called Chrysobalanus icaco pushes up through Brazil’s white sandy beaches. The plant’s leathery oval leaves and tough silver bark give it the distinct appearance of a mangrove species, adapted to a life buffeted by saltwater. Strangely, though, C. icaco also turns up more than a thousand miles inland, in the forests of the western Amazon. “We find fossil mangroves and associated coastal plants in the middle of the Amazon,” says paleoecologist Carina Hoorn, at the University of Amsterdam in The Netherlands.

New evidence, including geophysical modeling, supports the contentious notion that the Caribbean flooded into the western Amazon during the Miocene. Image credit: Tacio Cordeiro Bicudo (University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil), Victor Sacek (University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil), and Lucy Reading-Ikkanda (artist).

The shrub’s appearance inland with an assemblage of mangrove plants, noted in a 2019 article, is among the latest lines of evidence hinting that the Caribbean Sea flooded into the western Amazon during the Miocene, sometime in the last 10 to 20 million years (1). If it did, the region could have been awash in shallow saltwater for hundreds of thousands of years after the flooding. C. icaco and other plants may have spread into Brazil’s interior by dispersing along this sea’s beaches, before the water retreated and forest reclaimed the land (2).

The prevailing view of the western Amazon during the Miocene is one of a massive wetland, twice the size of Texas, furred with rainforest and streaked with lakes and tributaries. Whether this wetland was ever inundated by seawater remains a matter of some debate amongst geologists, paleontologists, ecologists, biogeographers, and researchers of pollen known as palynologists. All of them are united by the desire to answer a much larger question: How did the Amazon become so species-rich? That question, Hoorn says, is the “overarching motive that brings us all together.”

Several recent studies bolster the case that the Caribbean swept inland. A 2017 analysis of rock cores from Colombia and Brazil, for example, revealed changes in sediments as well as uncovering a fossilized shark tooth and a marine mantis shrimp, consistent with two separate Caribbean flooding periods in the last 20 million years (3). If an inland sea did reach the western Amazon, the changing landscape would have shaped patterns of species dispersal and ultimately diversification. Other lines of evidence, including the occurrence of Amazon River dolphins, sharks, stingrays, and manatees, also suggest that the area was once inundated by saltwater (4).

A series of new geophysical models provide some explanation for how the flooding might have occurred, suggesting a combination of global sea level rise, uplift of the Andes Mountains, and changes in plate tectonics and mantle dynamics. All of these factors would have worked in concert to pull down on the Earth’s crust and form a flooded depression in the continent. To find out whether this really happened, geologists will begin the largest sampling project to date, likely this summer, drilling rock cores from three Brazilian sites in search of definitive evidence.

A Lush History No one really knows what the view would have been, standing on a summit of the Andes Mountains about 20 million years ago. From a peak in modern-day Peru, looking north and east, some researchers imagine they’d have seen a glittering inland ocean, “where you could go from Paraguay to Venezuela in a boat,” says palynologist Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, in Panama City, Panama. Still others picture a landscape of freshwater marshes, he says, with “no marine evidence at all.” For his part, Jaramillo envisions multiple intervals during the Miocene when the ocean surged into the western Amazon, creating a continuous inland sea. Saltwater currents would have poured in from the Caribbean in the north, where they mixed with fresh water pouring down from torrential rains. Flooding periods would have been relatively brief, however. For the majority of the epoch, the ocean receded, leaving a freshwater megawetland of interconnected lakes and snaking channels with a narrow neck to the Caribbean in the north. The salinity would have been low, because the wetland was mostly freshwater, but episodically salty, says paleontologist Frank Wesselingh. He’s spent two decades studying the ancient western Amazon and is now part of the Netherlands’ Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden. Beneath the water’s surface, Wesselingh imagines a carnival of colorful fish, as well as stingrays, manatees, and dolphins. Even typically bland mud snails may have been striking, Wesselingh says, based on evidence of squiggled lines and shell ornamentation on 19-million-year-old aquatic snail fossils in the area (5). “I’d love to go snorkeling,” he says, “but there were also 14-meter-long caimans and 11-meter-long gharials. There were all kinds of not-so-nice creatures that would be a problem for us.” Such swirling visions of mangroves and salty, brackish water are relatively new for the Amazon. When Hoorn began her PhD fieldwork in 1988, collecting sediment and pollen samples in the Colombian, Peruvian, and Brazilian Amazon, the origins of Amazonian biodiversity were hotly debated. Most biologists at the time focused on the region’s more recent history, just the last 2.6 million years, to explain the evolution of biodiversity there. They thought that forest and savannah expanded and contracted between glacial periods, bounded by stable rivers that flowed along the same paths for millennia. Geologist and ornithologist Jürgen Haffer first proposed that theory in 1969, at a time when most biologists thought new species only arose through geographic isolation (6). Haffer assumed a patchwork of isolated refuges of forest and savannah, each an evolutionary haven (7). His ideas dominated the field through the 1980s. But by the time Hoorn came along, cracks had appeared in Haffer’s theory, and disagreements over his views had become “quite personal,” Hoorn recalls. Ultimately, in the early 1990s, a variety of studies refuted Haffer’s view, including work on pollen which revealed a recent history of continuous forest cover rather than patchy tree stands (8). Without patchy forest, a theory of geographic isolation didn’t hold up. Paleoecologists went back to the drawing board to figure out what had driven Amazonian diversification. Although Hoorn was aware of the debate raging all around her, “I felt like I had nothing to do with it,” she says, because her research focused on the Amazon’s much deeper past than the last 2.6 million years. “I lived happily like that,” she says with a chuckle. But in her fieldwork collecting clay and soil samples around the top of South America, Hoorn discovered evidence of fossilized pollen from mangrove trees. She published a seminal study in 1993 suggesting that the pollen was evidence of a megawetland in western Amazonia during the Miocene, 10 to 20 million years ago, which was subject to coastal influence through several periods of marine flooding (9). Shortly after Hoorn finished her doctorate, she took a break from research. Upon her return to Europe in 1999, she was “very surprised” to find that her thesis had exploded across the Amazonian research community. Whereas Hoorn’s Miocene wetland theory has largely been accepted since 1993, according to palynologist Jaramillo, the marine flooding aspect has remained more controversial—in part because of the difficulty of fieldwork in the Amazon, he says. The forest is so dense that geologists tend to travel by riverboat rather than overland, searching for the relatively few exposed rock faces that poke out from under the thick cover of vegetation. Research teams collect sediment samples from the cliffs along the riverbanks. But the cliffs jut out at odd angles, making it difficult to tell whether two outcropping rock faces are the same age based on stratified rock layers alone. Some show evidence of marine influence. Fossilized mollusks and ostracods stud certain cliffs, and oxygen- and carbon-stable isotope ratios in some samples also point to saltwater flooding (10). But not all riverbank sediments tell the same story, and none is unequivocally marine. Even among those that support marine influence, there are seeming contradictions. In a study Wesselingh published in 2006, for instance, he found fossilized saltwater invertebrates alongside freshwater mollusks in the same rocky outcrop. He concluded that the fossils could be different ages. Or, if they were the same age, the saltwater invertebrates could have evolved an unusual tolerance for freshwater (11). Without limestone deposits or fossilized whale skeletons—the kind of material that plainly shows areas once under oceans in other parts of the world—the debate over the Amazon rages on. The Caribbean may have swept south twice during the Miocene, penetrating a landscape dominated by freshwater lakes, swamps, rivers, and rainforest.

Shifting Tides Jaramillo himself was skeptical of an Amazonian sea until about three years ago. Fossil-strewn rock cores changed his mind. Stored in the laboratory of Paleoflora in Bucaramanga, Colombia, each core is a cylinder of shale, clay, and sandstone, drilled out of sites in northern Brazil or Southern Colombia. The Brazilian geological survey and a Colombian oil company had collected them in the 1970s, in search of coal and oil. And although the cores were old and in some cases broken or incomplete, they offered the best available window on the past, Jaramillo says. With a hand lens pressed to his eye, Jaramillo scanned each core, inspecting the many different layers of sediment, deposited one on top of the other over millions of years. Some of the layers were unmistakably river mud, with the kinds of fine-grained sediments, sandstones, and mudstones that tend to accumulate in tributaries today. But two of the layers were more typically marine. Organic peat, algae, and fossil fragments hinted at salty estuarine environments. Under a microscope, the fossils included about 20 different species of dinoflagellates found in Miocene marine deposits worldwide. Two larger fossils, a shark tooth and a marine mantis shrimp, provided further evidence for ocean flooding. Pollen records from the two marine sediment layers suggest that they date to 18 million years ago and 14 million years ago, respectively. “The logical conclusion is the ocean was there,” Jaramillo explains. His 2017 analysis of the cores demonstrated two marine intervals when ocean waters reached the western Amazon, he says, with the incursion likely starting from the Caribbean in the north and flowing south along the foot of the Andes (3). In each case, the water advanced and then retreated over periods as short as half a million years. Jaramillo suspects that a combination of tectonic processes and punctuated global sea level rise flooded a depression in the continent. Geological models published since 2010 suggest such a scenario is possible (12). High-speed video simulations show the uplift of the Andean cordillera over tens of millions of years and, in some cases, the subsequent submersion of western Amazonia. Over a Zoom call from his office at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, geophysicist Victor Sacek screen-shared one such model, which he first developed in 2014. It simulates the surface of South America during the uplift of the Andes, beginning sometime between 30 million and 60 million years ago. The initial model described geological processes at the level of Earth’s crust, such as erosion, sedimentation, and the formation of the Andean Cordillera. In 2019, PhD student Tacio Cordeiro Bicudo updated the model to also approximate processes deep in the Earth, including convection in the mantle below the South American continent. To picture mantle convection, Sacek says, first imagine the western edge of South America colliding with the oceanic Nazca Plate tens of millions of years ago. As the two tectonic plates ground against each other, the lip of South America contracted and thickened into the rising spine of the Andes. Simultaneously, the oceanic Nazca Plate dove under the continent into the softer mantle beneath it. Think of the hard, dense oceanic plate as if it was made of iron, Sacek says, and the mantle as a vat of honey. The heavy iron mass plunging through the honey would create convection that perturbed the liquid’s surface. So, too, did the plate sinking through the mantle, creating a smooth depression in the Earth’s surface far above. When Sacek, Bicudo, and others included these dynamics in their models—published in 2019 and 2020—the simulations put this subsidence right under the western Amazon, forming a huge depression in the continent (13, 14). This hollow could have flooded from the Caribbean, pouring in across an apron-shaped expanse of what is now parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and western Brazil, to form an inland sea between 25 and 17 million years ago. Whether this actually happened is still impossible to say. “With our models we just give scenarios,” Bicudo says. The mantle was certainly in motion beneath the continent at the time, he says. But the size and shape of the depression it created, and whether it ever connected to the ocean, remain unknown. Geodynamicist Nicolas Flament at the University of Wollongong in Australia has also modeled the western Amazon. In one 2015 paper, he combined data on the positions and speed of the tectonic plates and the thickness of the top layer of the mantle, called the lithosphere, to simulate the changing topography of South America attributable to mantle convection over the last 50 million years (15). Flament’s models also predicted a western Amazonian shallow sea during the Miocene. Although he acknowledges that “models are not evidence,” Flament thinks the fact that his tectonic data-based simulations match predictions from the geological record lends further support to marine incursions as plausible—even likely.

Ebb and Flow A sea in the Amazon captures the imagination, but there are still geologists who consider it just that—imaginary. What’s clear in the geological record is that mud, silt, and, in smaller proportion, sand blanketed the region, explains Edgardo Latrubesse, at the Federal University of Goiás in Goiânia, Brazil. The age of those sediments, and how exactly they arrived in the western Amazon, is less clear. Oceans don’t typically transport and deposit sediment into vast inland areas, Latrubesse points out. Rivers, on the other hand, do erode mountains and hills to produce sandy and silty deposits. “To accumulate such a huge amount of sediment, the only way are rivers,” Latrubesse says. Hoorn and Jaramillo, in fact, would agree that although repeated ocean flooding carried some sediments, most did wash in on rivers when the area looked more like a freshwater wetland than a continuous sea. One key point of disagreement: the age of the sediments. Fossil pollen, ostracod, and mollusk assemblages date them to mid-to-late Miocene, which would match the proposed age of the ancient sea. But Latrubesse doesn’t put much stock in pollen-based age estimates; plants, he says, evolve too slowly to provide precise-enough date ranges. And in work published in 2010 analyzing vertebrate fossils from the southwestern Amazon, Latrubesse dated the sediments as far more recent, 6.5 to 9 million years old (16). It makes no sense to debate the existence of an inland sea 20 million years ago, he says, based on evidence from sediments that aren’t even 10 million years old. In other parts of the world, layers of volcanic ash could be used for absolute radiometric dating. But volcanic ash sediments are rare in the western Amazon. Geologists instead rely on comparisons of fossils with the evolutionary record, which is far from an exact science, says palynologist Andrea Kern. She coauthored a 2020 study aiming to resolve the Amazon sediment age debate while working as a postdoc at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. Kern and her collaborators analyzed one Brazilian sediment core from a different site in the same collection that Jaramillo used in his 2017 analysis. In previous studies, pollen and ostracod fossils had dated the rock to the middle Miocene, about 14 million years ago. However, Kern’s 2020 study used grains of the mineral zircon buried in the sediments alongside the fossils (17). Zircon can be radiometrically dated, and Kern’s analysis put the rock’s maximum age at about 11.4 million years. Although the cores in both studies came from sites potentially inundated by marine incursions during the Miocene, most of the pollen and ostracod fauna in the sample Kern analyzed indicated swamps and small lakes transitioning to a river-dominated habitat. She acknowledges, however, that it is just one record from a single site. In a 2017 study, Carlos Jaramillo and coauthors analyzed rock cores from Columbia and Brazil (top) consistent with two separate Caribbean flooding periods in the last 20 million years. Evidence included this marine mantis shrimp (bottom). Image credit: Carlos Jaramillo (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama City, Panama).

Drilling Down “I love this stuff, but it’s so complicated,” says evolutionary biologist John Bates, speaking from the Field Museum in Chicago, IL, where he curates birds. Although geology isn’t his specialty, Bates is keenly interested in the geologic history of the western Amazon. “I want to know what the ramifications were for biology,” he says. An inland sea could help explain how a region that contains a tenth of the world’s known species became such a trove of life. Take, for instance, the sand-colored nighthawk. The bird is only found in the western Amazon, where it nests on sandbanks. There’s no clear behavioral or ecological reason why nighthawks should be tied to creeks and rivers, Bates says. Yet they are, as are scarlet-crowned barbets and a wealth of other birds, endemic to the same waterways. A massive Miocene lake or sea could offer some evolutionary explanation for the birds’ association with a shoreline niche, Bates says. He coauthored a 2018 study comparing the phylogenetic relatedness and geographic distributions of 1,783 passerine species across 19 families of neotropical birds (18). Bates found that bird lineages in the western Amazon are younger and more related, on average, than lineages in surrounding areas. That means the western Amazon has its own evolutionary history, separate from the rest of the continent, he says. A huge body of water would have been such a starkly different habitat from surrounding forests that it could have spurred a unique evolutionary signature among species there. If sand-colored nighthawks evolved around an ancient sea or delta, it may explain why they still live near water today. Plant species, too, could have been affected by marine incursions. Although the Amazonian flora was diverse millions of years before the Miocene, Hoorn notes that saltwater flooding could certainly have altered regional plant biodiversity. Not only would seawater change the chemical composition and fertility of the soil, shaping which plants grew where, but coastal species brought inland by marine incursions could also have been isolated and adapted into new groups. If a seaway enabled new plants and animals to radiate into the west, it could be an overlooked mechanism driving the region’s species richness. Geologists agree that resolving exactly what the Miocene landscape looked like will require better rock samples. The oil and coal industries did not collect cores with multidisciplinary studies in mind; some are contaminated and so can’t be thoroughly analyzed by researchers. They’re also proprietary and only available to a small subset of the scientific community. “I’d say it’s pretty much a slam dunk that there were marine incursions in South America. It’s just all of the details are difficult.” —Christine Bacon Paul Baker, a geologist at Duke University in Durham, NC, will colead the effort, likely starting in June or July, to collect and analyze what researchers believe will be the best sediment samples ever taken from the Amazon. Called the Trans-Amazon Drilling Project, and funded by the National Science Foundation, International Ocean Discovery Program, the São Paulo Research Foundation, and the Smithsonian Institution, the plan includes roughly 50 scientific collaborators from a range of disciplines, including Hoorn and Jaramillo. They will drill 2,000-meter-long sediment cores from three Brazilian sites running east-to-west across the Amazon Basin, following the Amazon River, with the goal of capturing a snapshot of the entire Cenozoic Era, from 66 million years ago to the present (19). Painstakingly collected and carefully stored, these freshly drilled cores will capture even millimeter-scale changes in the sediment layers that could hold evidence of ocean incursion. Continuous rock will give geologists their best shot yet at comprehensively assessing every layer of Miocene sediment for marine evidence. And dating zircon grains in the rock cores will give the most definitive time frame for the sediment to date, based on “by far the best material that’s ever been looked at,” Baker says. “I’d say it’s pretty much a slam dunk that there were marine incursions in South America,” says evolutionary biologist Christine Bacon, co-first author of the 2019 study on C. icaco and other plants’ unusual inland distributions. “It’s just all of the details are difficult,” she says, on the phone from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If there is unequivocal marine evidence, it should turn up in the new cores. “Without continuous rock,” Jaramillo says, “the discussions could go forever.” And that might mean never knowing whether the view from the Andes 20 million years ago included a vast, shimmering inland sea.",2021-03-09 08:00:00+00:00,"['amazon', 'sea', 'miocene', 'sediment', 'western', 'million', 'marine', 'evidence', 'jaramillo', 'feature', 'inland']",Brazil,news article,English
1590,FL-2020-000207-NGA,MATTERS ARISING: 28 states at risk of flooding -- how prepared is Nigeria? - TheCable,https://www.thecable.ng/states-risk-flooding-nigeria-2021,"Uche Igwe will not forget August 26, 2020 in a hurry. It had rained heavily that day in the capital city, Abuja. Trademore Estate in Lugbe, where Igwe runs a cybercafe business, was overrun by rainwater. The force of the flood pulled down the fence of Igwes office complex and destroyed a part of the building. In no time, the property was floating on water.

Igwes business was greatly affected as he lost machines and computers. It took his entire savings and the support of friends and family for him to be able to recover from the event of that day, he tells TheCable.

I lost over two million naira worth of [electronics], my machines were all gone, my computers, everything. We didnt expect such here, he says.

Like Igwe, Victor Essang, a resident of Calabar, Cross River state capital, has also recorded losses to flooding.

First, his family lost a block of flats inherited from their grandparents, and later, his poultry business took a hit in 2016.

Igwe and Essang are just two of the many Nigerians who suffer the consequences of flooding that occurs yearly in different parts of the country during the rainy season.

SEVERE FLOOD PREDICTIONS

During the 2021 flood outlook presentation, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) announced that 28 states, including the FCT, will most likely experience flooding this year.

Similarly, the Nigeria Meteorological Agency, in its 2021 seasonal climate forecast, said the signals monitored by the agency in the last seven years show that things are changing on the climate front and that this year, Nigeria is expected to experience unprecedented heavy downpours.

The information is intended to alert Nigerians, government, relevant agencies and stakeholders of what is to come in order for them to prepare  prevent, mitigate and respond  for severe flooding.

Going by the alert, Igwe says he intends to raise his compound level to prevent rainwater from entering in the event of a flood.

On his part, Essang says he was already apprehensive about the severity of this years rainfall, even before the alert. He tells TheCable that he has relocated his belongings to a safer place.

I have packed out my things to a safe place, I will bring them back when the rain stops. My only prayer is God will not let it bring our house down, he says.

CLIMATE CHANGE A DRIVING FACTOR IN FLOODING

A report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) states that extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global climate change increase the likelihood of floods.

Chukwudi Njoku, a doctoral researcher on climate change at the University of Calabar, says flooding in Nigeria can be linked to both natural and human activities that influence changes in the climate.

When there is high temperature, then there is increased possibility for evaporation  the process where water vapour is taken from the earth surface into the atmosphere  which can trigger much more rainfall, he tells TheCable.

The rising temperature here is a climate change feedback and when evaporation is increased, there is the possibility of more rainfall and when rainfall increases, simultaneously it could trigger flooding.

Research by MOJ Ecology & Environmental Sciences (MOJES) has shown that human activities such as urbanisation, felling of forest trees and burning of fossil fuels, among others, lead to the emission of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.

According to the study, these activities distort the carbon cycle  the process in which carbon atoms move from the atmosphere to the earth and then back into the atmosphere. The activities also initiate climate change processes which involve a variety of changes including higher surface temperatures and changes to the hydrological cycle  the process in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and then back in form of rain.

Njoku believes that these human activities are what increases and make worse the impacts of climate change on humans and their environment.

Such activities like urbanisation which is not properly done in a sustainable manner, for example, people building in floodplains and swampy areas which are supposed to serve as banks for water, thus reducing the ability of the environment to collect and keep excess water, the researcher explains.

Also, the clearing of forest areas for agriculture increases the extent of bare surfaces that would have hitherto collected runoff water and reduced the flow of water.

These human activities are not sustainable and where they are not checked, they only go to increase the susceptibility of the people to flooding which appears to be inevitable at this time considering the increasing temperature and rainfall events.

He advises that people living in flood-prone areas should be relocated and government should put laws in place to deter chaotic urbanisation, create more awareness about the potential increase in flooding events and their dangers, and also ensure that roads and drainages are constructed to accommodate the volume of water from the rain.

HOW IS GOVERNMENT PREPARING?

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), whose responsibility is to manage disasters, tells TheCable that the agency had information about imminent flooding since February through the seasonal climate predictions document made available by NIMET.

Before that presentation by NIHSA, NEMA already had some information about the outlook of the rains and the consequences of the flood. So having the information, the agency had called together experts to analyse the predictions of NIMET and come out with a disaster risk management of the prediction, says Manzo Ezekiel, public relations officer of NEMA.

The secretary will soon convene a meeting of all the state emergency management agencies and relevant organisations that their activities or mandate have something to do with the management of floods.

During that meeting, NEMA is going to communicate to them that this is the information we have and this information is going to cover your area of operation, what and what can you do about it. That is the next line of action that we have. That meeting will take hold very soon.

The PRO said the zonal offices of the agency are already on standby to take the information down to the specific communities that are at risk of flooding.

He said the agency will ensure continuous engagement with Nigerians and create awareness at the federal, state, and local government levels to ensure that flooding does not take Nigerians by surprise.

We are going to tell them that, this year there is a forecast of increased rainfall and this will likely interrupt your stay here, he says.

SPEEDY MITIGATION EFFORTS NEEDED

While government agencies are still at the preparation stage, Igwe wishes they can speed up the process since the country is already in the rainy season.

He believes the annual flood events in his locality is a result of the lack of an adequate drainage system which the government had earlier promised to expand.

I think the major cause is the drainage system. I wish the government could even rush down and do it for us today today today, he says.

Igwe desires the speedy process because, according to him, the relief materials government agencies offer in the aftermath of flooding do not equate to the losses.

When they were sharing their palliatives, I just refused; how can somebody lose about two point something million and you are giving him a pack of Indomie and small 5kg camping gas cylinder?

A rare bout of heavy rainfall, thunder, and lightning has attacked Egypt’s capital and other parts of the country for the second day running, causing flooding and incapacitating the city’s traffic – and its people.

The state news agency, MENA, reported that the authorities were forced to close highways, with parts of Cairo’s ring road being shut. As a result, some travellers had to spend the night in their cars.

Little seems to have been spared the vicious downpour, with videos emerging on social media of water pouring through the ceiling of Point 90 mall in Fifth Settlement, alongside parked cars which were almost completely submerged in water. In addition, buildings, houses, and bridges collapsed reports Egypt Independent and Egypt Today.

New Cairo – the area most badly hit by the rains – saw electrical cables landing in floodwaters, meaning that people were trapped inside their cars.

According to the Ministry of Interior (MoI), the police today had to rescue 24 people – 21 students, their driver, and two supervisors – who were trapped while on a trip to a nature reserve near the city.

Meanwhile, actress Nashwa Mustafa reassured her Facebook audience after having called the police to save her house from flooding.

Egypt’s Meteorological Authority says that the unstable weather is expected to improve across the country, starting on Friday.

Sri Lanka seamers Kasun Rajitha and Vishwa Fernando took three wickets each to bowl out South Africa for 222 on the first day of the second and final Test before the hosts themselves struck back late in the day with the ball.

The tourists were 3-60 at the close, still trailing by 162 runs on a wicket that is providing assistance for the fast bowlers, as well as some turn for the spinners.

Opener Lahiru Thirimanne (25no) and nightwatchman Rajitha (0no) will resume on day two, seeking to take Sri Lanka into the lead as they aim to become the first team from Asia to win a test series in South Africa.

Duanne Olivier (2-25) bowled Oshada Fernando (0) and had Kusal Mendis (16) caught to make early inroads into the Sri Lanka batting, while Kagiso Rabada grabbed the wicket of captain Dimuth Karunaratne (17) as the hosts fought back with the ball.

Having won the toss and elected to bat, it was a disappointing batting display from South Africa again. Their innings was dominated by a brisk 86 from Quinton de Kock and 60 from opener Aiden Markram.

""It was tough up front, the Sri Lanka bowlers didn't give us much to work with,"" Markram said.

""But 222 is less than what we wanted and less than how the pitch played, so we only have ourselves to blame as batsmen. Hopefully we can make the second innings count.""

South Africa were in early trouble at 3-15 as Fernando (3-62) removed Dean Elgar (6) and Hashim Amla (0) in consecutive deliveries.

Temba Bavuma (0) was run out for a second time in three innings as South Africa wobbled, before Markram and captain Faf du Plessis (25) took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled the last ball before lunch.

Markram and debutant allrounder Wiaan Mulder (9) were both trapped lbw by Rajitha (3-67), who then also grabbed the scalp of Keshav Maharaj (0), caught by wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella.

De Kock scored freely as he put on 59 for the eighth wicket with Rabada (22), before being bowled by spinner Dhananjaya de Silva (2-15) and South Africa's innings folded soon after that.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Reports are emerging of Brazilian health workers forced to intubate patients without the aid of sedatives, after weeks of warnings that hospitals and state governments risked running out of critical medicines.

One doctor at the Albert Schweitzer municipal hospital in Rio de Janeiro told the Associated Press that for days health workers diluted sedatives to make their stock last longer. Once it ran out, nurses and doctors had to begin using neuromuscular blockers and tying patients to their beds, the doctor said.

“You relax the muscles and do the procedure easily, but we don’t have sedation,” said the doctor, who agreed to discuss the sensitive situation only if not quoted by name. “Some try to talk, resist. They’re conscious.”

Lack of required medicines is the latest pandemic problem to befall Brazil, which is experiencing a brutal COVID-19 outbreak that has flooded the nation’s intensive care units. The daily death count is averaging about 3,000, accounting for a quarter of deaths globally and making Brazil the epicenter of the pandemic.

“Intubation kits” include anesthetics, sedatives and other medications used to put severely ill patients on ventilators. The press office of Rio city's health secretariat said in an email that occasional shortages at the Albert Schweitzer facility are due to difficulties obtaining supplies on the global market and that “substitutions are made so that there is no damage to the assistance provided.” It didn't comment on the need to tie patients to beds.

The newspaper O Globo on Thursday reported similar ordeals in several other hospitals in the Rio metropolitan region, with people desperately calling other facilities seeking sedatives for their loved ones.

It’s unclear whether the problem seen in Rio remains an isolated case, but others are sounding the alarm about impending shortages.

Sao Paulo state's health secretary, Jean Carlo Gorinchteyn, said at a news conference Wednesday that the situation was dire in the hospitals of Brazil's most-populous state. On Thursday, more than 640 hospitals were on the verge of collapse, with shortages possible within days, officials said.

“We need the federal government's support,” Gorinchteyn said. “This is not a necessity for Sao Paulo; it is a necessity for the whole country.”

His state's health officials sent nine requests for intubation medication to the Health Ministry over the past 40 days, according to a statement Wednesday. Its last delivery was enough to cover just 6% of monthly needs in the state’s public health network, officials told AP.

Federal Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga, who took over the post last month, said Wednesday that a shipment of sedatives was expected to arrive in Brazil “in the next ten days.” It is the result of a contract signed with the Pan American Health Organization.

He said two separate efforts to acquire medications on the international market are underway “to end this day-to-day struggle.”

For many weeks, the ministry has also been facing logistical constraints on getting oxygen delivered to hospitals across the country. Queiroga said it remains ""a daily concern.″

A more contagious coronavirus variant, known as P.1, has been spreading across Brazil this year. It may also be more aggressive than the original strain, and health workers have reported patients requiring far more oxygen than last year.

The private sector has stepped up to help address some of the supply shortfall. A group of seven large companies donated 3.4 million doses of intubation drugs — enough for the management of 500 beds for six weeks — to the Health Ministry.

A first batch of 2.3 million was scheduled to arrive from China late Thursday at Sao Paulo's international airport and would be distributed to states with critical shortages, the ministry said in an emailed response to AP questions about supply bottlenecks.

Last month, the Health Ministry requisitioned intubation medications from laboratories, reportedly as a means to distribute to the neediest hospitals. That has caused others facilities’ stocks to dwindle, said Edson Rogatti, director of an association of more than 2,000 hospitals nationwide.

“If we run out, the health sector will be in chaos,” Rogatti said on Globo News TV.

Shortages aren’t limited to the public sector. Brazil’s private hospital association published a survey Thursday in which nine of 71 institutions reported having supplies for five days or less. About half said they had enough for a week.

Private facilities are looking to import medications from India, but still need regulatory approval, the association told AP.

The city of Itaiopolis in southern Santa Catarina state this week reported shortages of both sedatives and oxygen. Neighboring Rio Grande do Sul state also reported supplies running out.",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['patients', 'drug', 'brazil', 'health', 'makes', 'covid', 'states', 'hospitals', 'state', 'outbreak', 'sedatives', 'shortage', 'rio', 'reported', 'intubation', 'brutal', 'days']",Brazil,news article,English

""In the absence of the payment vouchers, we were unable to authenticate the disbursements. We therefore request management to ensure that the schedule officers refund the amount of GH¢347,014 failure of which they would be surcharged.

According to the 2018 report by the AG, it said Regulation 39 of Financial Administration Regulations, 2004 requires that the head of accounts section of a department shall control the disbursements of funds and ensure that transactions are properly authenticated to show that amounts are due and payable and reject any disbursements that do not meet the requirement.

We observed during our review that the above provision was not fully complied with by the Hospital.

Still with the Kokrle Bu Teaching Hospital, the Auditor General has ordered the management to recover the total amount of GH¢54,157 from Mr James Clifford Oblitey, a staff of the Hospital who was given the amount through a sponsorship package as school fees payment to enable him to pursue a course in BIFM Level 2 Diploma in Facility Management at the College of Central London, United Kingdom (UK) from 2 January 2018 to March 2018.

In the report, the AG said: ""We noted that though Mr Oblitey was not successful in securing the UK entry visa, he failed to return the fees granted him by the hospital's management for the course.

""Though it could be argued that the money was paid to the school, we are of the view that under such circumstance refunds are made to applicants net of administrative charges"", the 2018 report added.

In view of this, the report recommended that the CEO should ensure the recovery of the total amount of GH¢54,157 from Mr James Clifford Oblitey less any administrative charges that must have accrued to the school.",2019-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['oblitey', 'officers', 'ensure', 'management', 'ag', 'korlebu', 'disbursements', 'orders', 'hospital', 'school', 'auditorgeneral', 'ghana', 'mr', 'recover', 'gh347014', 'account', 'report', 'missing', 'payment']",Ghana,news article,English

11,000 households (71,500 people) planned to be assisted by WFP

8,506 households (77 percent of households targeted) assisted by WFP as of 21 September

Highlights

The scale of damage and humanitarian needs caused by the floods have been significantly underreported in local and international media.

WFP started emergency food distributions on 8 September with its partners ACTED and HANDS.

Distributions in Malir (Karachi) and Umerkot districts have been completed. Distributions in Mirpur Khas and Sanghar are expected to be completed by 25 September.

WFP Funding Requirements

US$500,000 is needed to cover the costs of this emergency response and replenish the food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations.

Situation Update

The situation in rural areas is extremely worrying, both in terms of immediate humanitarian needs and longer-term impacts on livelihoods, food security and nutrition. While rains have stopped, many areas remain flooded and stagnant water is posing major health, nutrition and shelter issues.

Thousands of families displaced by the floods are still living by the side of the road, with little chance of returning home for at least another month and no employment opportunities in view given large-scale crop and livestock losses.

On 12 September, Sindh Chief Minister requested additional humanitarian assistance from the UN.

On 17-18 September, the UN Resident Coordinator and WFP Country Director visited a WFP food distribution and a UNICEF Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) distribution in Mirpur Khas district. They met with the Mirpur Khas Commissioner, the Sindh Director General Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the Sindh Chief Secretary, who expressed appreciation for WFPs fast response.

At the request of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), UN and NGO partners are preparing to carry out a multisectoral needs assessment to inform mediumterm recovery needs, covering the 30 mostaffected districts across the country. This new assessment will complement the rapid joint needs assessment carried out during the first week of September.

1003,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Thousands in shelters as Indonesia flood death toll hits 53 - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/thousands-in-shelters-as-indonesia-flood-death-toll-hits-53/,"Tens of thousands of Indonesians were still unable to return to their waterlogged homes Saturday after flooding hit the Jakarta capital region, killing at least 53 people, authorities said.

More than 170,000 people took refuge in shelters across the massive urban conglomeration — home to some 30 million — after whole neighborhoods were submerged.

Torrential rains that started on New Year’s Eve unleashed flash floods and landslides in the region and neighboring Lebak at the south end of Java island.

On Saturday, Indonesia’s disaster agency said the death toll had climbed to 53 with one person still missing.

“We’ve discovered more dead bodies,” said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo.

Officials would be visiting the homeless Saturday in the hardest-hit areas, he added.

Shelters filled up with refugees, including infants, resting on thin mats as food and drinking water ran low.

Some had been reduced to using floodwaters to clean themselves and dishes.

“We badly need clean water in this shelter,” Trima Kanti said from one refuge in Jakarta’s western edges.

“We’re cleaning ourselves in a nearby church but the timing has been limited since it uses an electric generator for power,” the 39-year-old added.

– Debris and cars –

In hard-hit Bekasi, on the eastern outskirts of Jakarta, swampy streets were littered with debris and crushed cars lying on top of each other — with waterline marks reaching as high as the second floors of buildings.

The government said Friday it would start cloud seeding to the west of the capital — inducing rain using chemicals sprayed from planes — to prevent approaching rainfall from pounding the region.

Waters had receded in many areas and power was being restored after being cut off in hundreds of districts.

The health ministry has said it deployed some 11,000 health workers and soldiers to distribute medicine, disinfectant hygiene kits and food in a bid to stave off outbreaks of Hepatitis A, mosquito-borne Dengue fever and other illnesses, including infections linked to contact with dead animals.

Around Jakarta, a family — including a four- and nine-year-old — died of suspected gas poisoning from a portable power generator, while an eight-year-old boy was killed in a landslide.

Others died from drowning or hypothermia, while one 16-year-old boy was electrocuted by a power line.

Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during the rainy season, which started in late November.

But this week’s disaster marked Jakarta’s worst flooding since 2013 when dozens were killed after the city was inundated by monsoon rains.

Urban planning experts said the disaster was partly due to record rainfall.

But Jakarta’s myriad infrastructure problems, including poor drainage and rampant overdevelopment, worsened the situation, they said.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo has announced a plan to move the country’s capital to Borneo island to take pressure off Jakarta, which suffers from some of the world’s worst traffic jams and is fast sinking due to excessive groundwater extraction.

1557,FL-2021-000038-KEN,State of the Global Climate 2020 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/state-global-climate-2020,"2021 is “make or break year” for Climate Action

2021 must be the year for climate action – “the make it or break it year,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres at the launch of WMO’s report on the State of the Global Climate 2020 which highlighted accelerating climate change indicators and worsening impacts.

“This is a frightening report. It needs to be read by all leaders and decision-makers in the world,” Mr Guterres told journalists.

“This report shows that 2020 was also another unprecedented year of extreme weather and climate disasters. The cause is clear. Anthropogenic climate change -- climate disruption caused by human activities, human decisions and human folly,” he said.

Mr Guterres joined WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas in releasing WMO’s trademark report, which includes input from national meteorological services, UN partners and the broader climate and scientific community.

The report is accompanied by a story map showing details of key climate indicators, including record greenhouse gas concentrations, increasing land and ocean temperatures, sea level rise, melting ice and glacier retreat and extreme weather. It also highlights impacts on socio-economic development, migration and displacement, food security and land and marine ecosystems.

“All key climate indicators and associated impact information provided in this report highlight relentless, continuing climate change, an increasing occurrence and intensification of extreme events, and severe losses and damage, affecting people, societies and economies,” said Prof. Taalas.

“It is therefore important to invest in adaptation. One of the most powerful ways to adapt is to invest in early warning services and weather observing networks and hydrological services,” he said.

2020 was one of the three warmest years on record, despite a cooling La Niña event. The global average temperature was about 1.2° Celsius above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) level. The six years since 2015 have been the warmest on record. 2011-2020 was the warmest decade on record.

“Our challenge is clear,” said the UN Secretary-General.

“To avert the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that we must limit global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees of the pre-industrial baseline. That means reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and reaching net zero emissions by 2050,” he said.

“We are way off track.”

Mr Guterres listed a number of concrete advances in the run up to the UN Climate Change negotiations, COP26, in Glasgow this November.

These include:

A global coalition committed to net zero emissions – to cover all countries, cities, regions, businesses and financial institutions.

The next 10 years need to be a decade of transformation, with more ambitious nationally determined contributions and climate plans under the Paris Agreement.

These commitments should be backed up with concrete immediate action. The trillions of dollars spent on COVID-19 recovery must be aligned with the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Subsidies to polluting fossil fuels must be shifted to renewable energy. And developed countries must lead in phasing out coal -- by 2030 in OECD countries, and 2040 elsewhere.

Developed countries also need to deliver on climate finance for the developing world, particularly the promise of $100 billion dollars per year. Half of all climate finance from donors and multilateral and national development banks must flow to resilience and adaptation, from a much lower level of 20 per cent today. Access to these sources of finance must also be made easier for the most vulnerable.

“I count first on developed countries to deliver on climate finance and, as I mentioned, the promised 100 billion dollars a year at the G7 Summit in June. Then, I will urge the G20 countries to take on the greening of the broader financial architecture, to address debt and make climate-related financial disclosure mandatory,” said Mr Guterres.

“This is truly a pivotal year for humanity’s future. This report shows we have no time to waste,” he said.

Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc Thanh.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Vietnam has given $540,000 in immediate support to women and girls in six central provinces affected by flooding.

UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of hygiene items and maternal health equipment. It is also supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services.

The central region has suffered unprecedented flooding from prolonged downpours and successive typhoons since October 6, resulting in at least 230 people dead or missing. Storm Molave hit the region on October 28, reportedly one of the strongest in 20 years.

At least 5.5 million people in the region have been affected, including more than 1.3 million women of reproductive age, over 92,000 of them pregnant mothers, who need uninterrupted services for pregnancy and menstruation, UNFPA said.

According to joint rapid assessment led by UNFPA last week, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programs such as antenatal, delivery, post-natal care and family planning services have been disrupted.

As a result, local women are unable to manage their hygiene properly and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear needed to manage menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and places to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged, the organization explained.

On October 12, a 35-year-old pregnant mother living in Phong Dien District of Thua Thien-Hue Province died on her way to give birth.

She entered labor in the morning, with her husband hiring a boat to take her to a local medical center for delivery. However, the boat was upturned and she was swept away by floodwater.

Her husband and local residents tried to look for her, but failed because of the fast-flowing current. Her body was found in the afternoon.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA representative in Vietnam, said: ""When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousands of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable. Women do not need to die giving birth, and this must hold true even in emergencies.

""While fleeing, people are in need of basic necessities  ranging from food and water to hygienic supplies and medical care.""",2020-11-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'local', 'population', 'water', 'health', 'girls', '540000', 'central', 'region', 'unfpa', 'women', 'fund', 'delivery', 'need', 'earmarks']",Vietnam,news article,English

Mr. Zaki has not publicly addressed the accusations but the prosecutor-general said Monday that he had denied most of them. A prominent television host who said he had spoken with Mr. Zaki’s father, a telecommunications executive, also said that Mr. Zaki rejected the allegations.

The wave of outrage against Mr. Zaki was invigorated by his status as a member of Egypt’s elite.

After graduating from the American International School, one of the most expensive high schools in Cairo, he attended the American University in Cairo starting in 2016, where fellow students say that he quickly gained a reputation for bad behavior toward women.

As a freshman, he was pushed out of the college salsa club after numerous women complained of harassment, said Kareem Elhosseni, who was then vice president of the club.

According to several accounts posted in the past week, Mr. Zaki used numerous ruses to gain women’s phone numbers, sometimes claiming to belong to social clubs that did not exist. He pressured women to provide intimate photos that he later used to coerce them into sex, threatening to send the images to their parents if the women refused.

Or he “attracted their sympathy by claiming he was going through a crisis,” the prosecutor said, then lured them to his home in a gated community where he sexually assaulted them.

One accuser, an 18-year-old woman he met on Tinder, said he seemed like “a decent guy.” But the conversation quickly turned to demands that she come to his house to perform sex acts.

The United Nations Population Fund in Vietnam will provide an additional $800,000 to support women and girls affected by flooding in eight central provinces and cities.

It brings the UNFPA's total support to $1.34 million. In October it had given $540,000.

The support includes setting up mobile and outreach health care clinics and the distribution of dignity kits with essential hygiene items and vital maternal health equipment and supplies.

Between early October and mid-November the central region and parts of the Central Highlands were hit by a succession of storms that brought torrential rains, resulting in severe flooding and landslides.

At least 192 people were killed and 57 others are still listed missing, and losses amounted to VND30 trillion ($1.3 billion), the government said.

Around 5.5 million people have been affected, including over 1.3 million women of reproductive age and more than 92,000 pregnant women, the UNFPA said.

The disaster forced women and girls into shelters without having the time to pack essential supplies, and many lack basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes and underwear that are needed to manage their menstrual periods, it said, adding that access to water and places to wash, dry reusable pads and clothes and dispose of used materials are lacking.

Routine public health programs such as antenatal, child birth, post-natal care, and family planning services have been disrupted.

At least 16 bodies have been recovered after torrential rain caused landslides in western Uganda, the Red Cross has said.

“Our team continues to recover more bodies including some that are trapped by cocoa trees in Bundibugyo hills. It is a very devastating moment,” the humanitarian agency said in a tweet on Sunday.

An aid team has been deployed to search and recover bodies in Bundibugyo district, which was affected by the landslides after days of heavy rainfall.

“We have provided body bags and blankets to manage the dead in a dignified manner before handing them over to families and hospitals,” Irene Nakasita, Red Cross spokeswoman, said.

The East African nation is undergoing its second rainy season, which has reached its peak in most parts of the country. The Uganda National Meteorological Authority has predicted heavy rainfall will continue throughout December.

The heavy rains have caused destructive flooding in several low-lying parts of the country and landslides in the mountainous regions. Destructive wind and hailstorms have ravaged plantations and crops across Uganda.

Our Response action team in Bundibugyo is up and running. So far 16 bodies retrieved.

More than 20 people have been killed as a result of floods and mudslides in the last week in Uganda. The eastern parts of the country have also been suffering floods and landslides around the Mount Elgon region.

In a statement on Friday, Musa Ecweru, Uganda’s minister of state for disaster preparedness, said: “Four people were killed in Bududa district and another four including two children in Sironko district.”

“Over 10,000 people have been displaced in eastern Uganda alone and we are currently reviewing villages’ household registers to establish the number and names of missing persons,” Ecweru said.

The government has now released more than $5.4m for emergency procurement.

These include inflatable boats, tarpaulins, blankets, relief food, drugs for water-borne diseases and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.

The extreme weather has been blamed on the Indian Ocean Dipole – a climate system defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the ocean.

At the moment, the ocean around East Africa is far warmer than usual, resulting in higher evaporation and moist air flowing inwards over the continent as rain: the hallmarks of a “positive” dipole.

Scientists warn that as ocean temperatures rise because of climate change, Indian Ocean dipoles will become more frequent and severe.",2019-12-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['team', 'red', 'dozen', 'landslides', 'cross', 'kills', 'parts', 'bodies', 'country', 'uganda', 'western', 'flooding', 'bundibugyo', 'ocean']",Uganda,news article,English

976,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Mozambique embraces Sendai Framework - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-embraces-sendai-framework,"By Denis McClean

MAPUTO, 10 September, 2019 - Mozambique was congratulated today on aligning its Master Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction with the global plan for reducing disaster losses, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Mami Mizutori, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, said it was encouraging to see such commitment to reducing long-term vulnerability and increasing the resilience of infrastructure to extreme events in Mozambique.

On her first visit to Mozambique, she made the remarks during a meeting with members of the country’s National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction,

“If we cannot mainstream disaster risk reduction across every sector of society then we cannot reach the aims of the Sendai Framework. All of this can only be done if a country takes ownership of its own disaster risk management and this is what I am seeing in this room. The national institute for disaster management, INGC, is a center for coordination with all your ministries and parts of government. We can only push forward levels of prevention with the backing of the country’s political leadership,” she said.

Ms. Mizutori was welcomed to Mozambique by Augusta Maita, Director-General INGC, who outlined the extent of the challenges facing Mozambique from natural hazards which have affected 20 million people over the last 40 years, notably as a result of drought, floods, cyclones and epidemics.

Following the devastation left by tropical depression Desmond in January, Cyclone Idai in March and Cyclone Kenneth, in April, Ms. Maita said many lessons had been learned.

She highlighted the creation of local committees for disaster risk reduction, community-based early warning systems, use of community radio, and short-range forecasts and weather warnings issued by the Meteorological Service and Water Directorate.

Nonetheless, Ms. Maita also pointed to weaknesses which had been exposed by recent disaster events including inadequacy of funding for early warning systems along river basins and room for improvement in coordination mechanisms.

She drew attention to the fact that alongside the loss of 648 lives and the 2.8 million people affected by tropical cyclones this year another 814,000 people were feeling the effects of drought.

In an overview of damage to critical infrastructure, INGC reports stated that the cyclones destroyed or damaged 300,000 homes while also leaving 4,910 classrooms destroyed, 138 health facilities affected, 93,000 hectares of crops lost, and over 1,500 electricity poles damaged.

Ms. Mizutori also met with the media and told journalists that she wanted to support Mozambique’s recovery effort and “to offer our good offices to build back better.” She said that the UN family is with the country on the “difficult and very long journey towards recovery.”",2019-09-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['maita', 'mozambique', 'warning', 'disaster', 'framework', 'affected', 'sendai', 'cyclones', 'mizutori', 'embraces', 'risk', 'reduction', 'ingc']",Mozambique,news article,English
