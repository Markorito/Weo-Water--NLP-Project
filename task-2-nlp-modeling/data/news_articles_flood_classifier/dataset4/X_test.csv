230,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Natural Disasters Have High Negative Impact on Children and Schools in Asia Pacific - The Wire,https://thewire.in/environment/natural-disasters-have-high-negative-impact-on-children-and-schools-in-asia-pacific,"Bangkok: A greater humanitarian focus on schools before, during and after natural disasters will save lives, protect children and benefit communities and countries, Save the Children says in a report due out this week.

The report details the impact on education of earthquakes, floods and storms that struck Nepal, Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vanuatu last year.

The disasters range from large humanitarian crises ‚Äì such as the massive twin quakes in Nepal that killed 8,900 people ‚Äì to the seasonal floods and storms that batter the Asia-Pacific region.

‚ÄúThe earthquake in Nepal had a huge impact on the country and received international media attention,‚Äù said author of the report, Sarah Ireland, by phone from Melbourne.

‚ÄúFloods in Indonesia happen every year, and we often don‚Äôt hear about them,‚Äù she added.

Researchers estimate the lives of 200 million children per year will be severely disrupted by disasters in coming decades.

Here are facts and figures from Save the Children‚Äôs report.

Indonesia

Between January and August 2015, Indonesia experienced 1,160 disasters, including drought, forest fires, volcanic eruptions, landslides and floods.

Also during that period, there were 373 floods, affecting 607,000 people, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Rains in January 2015, submerged roads in Jakarta, and more downpours in February caused further flooding, affecting more than 27,000 people.

The floods affected 351 schools in northern Jakarta. Inaccessible and submerged, some were closed for up to two weeks.

Vanuatu

The Pacific island nation of Vanuatu is home to about 250,000 people, with 64% of the population exposed to natural hazards each year, including storms, floods, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

Cyclone Pam, a category 5 storm in March 2015, triggered floods that destroyed infrastructure, homes and livelihoods, affecting 80% of Vanuatu‚Äôs people and leaving half the population in need of emergency assistance.

More than half of schools were damaged or destroyed, and 34,500 children were affected.

Schools were closed for up to 30 days, and 34 schools were used as evacuation centres.

Nepal

A 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25, 2015, followed by a 7.3 magnitude quake on May 12, 2015, killed 8,900 people, destroyed 605,000 homes and damaged 288,000 more.

About 3.2 million children were affected by the quakes, and of those, 870,000 were left without permanent classrooms.

More than 8,200 public primary and secondary schools were damaged in the quakes.

Nearly 52,200 classrooms were damaged or destroyed.

Myanmar

In June 2015, seasonal rains triggered heavy flooding in parts of Myanmar.

At the end of July, Cyclone Komen brought heavy rains and strong winds, resulting in severe, widespread flooding that affected more than nine million people across 12 of the country‚Äôs 14 states and regions.

From June to October, the floods displaced about 1.7 million people and damaged 4,116 schools.

About 250,000 children could not attend school because of the floods.

Philippines

In 2015, 14 typhoons and tropical storms hit the Philippines.

Between 2007 and 2011, 10.8 million students in the Philippines were impacted by disasters, and 8,472 schools were used as evacuation centres.

Typhoon Koppu, a category 3 storm in mid-October, hit central Luzon, north of Manila, causing widespread floods and landslides.

The typhoon displaced one million people and damaged 803 schools, which were closed an average of two weeks, while 138 schools were used as evacuation centres.

Kerala forest officials today had an unusal mission to accomplish in the flood-hit state-- to save a wild elephant. The elephant was trapped in the middle of the Chalakudi river after dams began to overflow.

Officials in the forest division of Vazhachal persuaded the Dam Safety Authority to shut the gates of the Peringalkuthu dam for five hours to regulate the water flow at the dam in order to save the elephant.

The wild elephant was seen near the Charpa Waterfall, above the popular Athirapally waterfall, in the Thrissur district of Kerala. Water level in the Chalakudi river rose when both the Sholayar and Peringalkuthu dams were opened after reaching full capacity.

""Five hours later, the elephant crossed the river to reach a safe spot,"" an official with the forest division told India Today.

Meanwhile, visitors have been banned from visiting the 25-meter high Athirapally waterfall since the Chalakudi river has been overflowing since August 9.

673,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Romelu Lukaku transfer: Man Utd striker arrives for Inter medical as he nears ‚Ç¨80m Old Trafford exit - Goal.com,https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-arrives-for-inter-medical-as-he-nears-80m-man-utd/78z6fmejd05i14ymhsbo941r1,"Lukaku arrives for Inter medical as he nears ‚Ç¨80m Man Utd exit

The Belgium international has arrived in Milan to complete a switch to the Serie A side after talks with Juventus fell through

Romelu Lukaku has arrived in Milan to undergo a medical with Inter as he prepares to finally complete his move away from Manchester United.

Goal reported earlier on Wednesday that talks between the two sides were ongoing as they sought to reach a deal that would see Lukaku finally link up with Nerazzurri head coach Antonio Conte

The latest comes amid suggestions that the Belgian's relationship with United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has broken down, with the Norwegian having apparently informed the forward that he would be expected to train with the Under-23s until there was some resolution regarding his future.

Conte has tried to sign Lukaku on more than one occasion in the past, having failed to land the ex-Everton man while in charge of Juventus and Chelsea, but it seems he will now finally get his man.

Federico Pastorello, the Belgian's agent,‚Äã initially posted an image on Instagram of he and the striker on a plane heading for Italy to complete the transfer to Inter.

The caption of the post reads: ""Ready to take off .... direction Milan üáÆüáπ !!! Inter ... we are coming.""

And the pair have now arrived in Milan, with Lukaku being greeted by hundreds of Inter fans chanting as name as the Nerazzurri appear all set to beat rivals Juventus to his signature.

Inter will pay a fee that will total ‚Ç¨80 million (¬£74m/$90m) for Lukaku, with United also receiving a set percentage of the striker's next transfer fee as part of the deal.

Reports suggest that his former club Everton could receive as much as ¬£5m due to a sell-on clause of their own in the deal which saw Lukaku arrive at United in 2017 for a ¬£75m ($91m) transfer fee.

The Premier League transfer window closes on Thursday, but Solskjaer is in no rush to sign a replacement for the 26-year-old and, as such, the club are under no pressure to rush a deal through.

After a summer of speculation, that saw Juve enter the race and seek a swap deal involving Paulo Dybala, Inter finally appear to be putting the finishing touches on the deal for Lukaku.

That would leave the Italian club with over a fortnight to integrate their new front man into their squad ahead of their opening Serie A fixture against Lecce on August 26.",2019-08-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['nears', 'trafford', 'utd', 'finally', 'deal', 'juventus', 'transfer', 'complete', 'old', 'striker', 'romelu', 'medical', 'milan', 'man', 'inter', 'united', 'lukaku']",Ghana,news article,English
707,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Late Zaha goal sends Ivory Coast into African Cup quarters - TSN,https://www.tsn.ca/late-zaha-goal-sends-ivory-coast-into-african-cup-quarters-1.1334778,"CAIRO ‚Äî Tunisia knocked Ghana out of the African Cup of Nations in a penalty shootout on Monday, extending the Black Stars' run of pain at the tournament for at least another two years.

The title drought is now 37 years and counting for Ghana, which was eliminated 5-4 in the shootout in Ismailia when striker Caleb Ekuban was the only player to miss.

Goalkeeper Farouk Ben Mustapha was the hero for Tunisia in the last-16 match. He was brought on especially for the shootout and made a match-winning save from Ekuban.

That left Ferjani Sassi to step up and score with the last spot-kick and send Tunisia into a quarterfinal against surprise package Madagascar.

Tunisia was on its way to winning in regulation time after Taha Khenissi scored in the 73rd minute. Ghana snatched a dramatic equalizer two minutes into injury time when Rami Bedoui headed the ball into his own net straight after coming on as a substitute to make it 1-1.

There were no goals in extra time.

Ghana's failure means the star-studded West Africans still haven't won the African Cup since their fourth title in 1982. Ghana has lost three finals since then, including on penalties in 2015.

Tunisia was the last team to seal its spot in the quarters in Egypt.

The quarterfinal lineup is: Senegal vs. Benin, Nigeria vs. South Africa, Ivory Coast vs. Algeria and Tunisia vs. Madagascar.

Earlier, Wilfried Zaha's late goal put Ivory Coast into the last eight with a 1-0 victory over Mali in Suez.

Zaha's winner in the 76th minute saved Ivory Coast, which had been the second-best team for most of the game.

But Zaha took his chance when Mali's players didn't. He ran onto a long pass launched from the back and tucked his shot away after Mali's defence failed to deal with the danger.

Mali had twice as many shots on goal as the Ivorians, dominated the first half and also finished the game strongest. The Malians just couldn't break through.

Ivory Coast was the 2015 champion and is seeking a third title.

The quarterfinals start on Wednesday.

The previous day, the AfDB and the people‚Äôs Bank of China announced the creation of the $2bn Africa Growing Together fund, which is set to begin financing projects before the end of 2014. Diplomats, bankers and finance ministers professed to be more than a little impressed with the free wireless internet access on the conference buses. One delegate glanced at the state-of-the-art submachine guns carried by the omnipresent and unsmiling Rwandan army guards, complete with bulging night-vision scopes, and confessed: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what that model is.

With incumbent Donald Kaberuka heading for the exit at the C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire summit in 2015, it was also time to reflect on his two terms.

However, the majority saluted the manner in which Kaberuka helped Africa weather a financial crisis and the dynamic refocusing of the bank on infrastructure and the private sector.

African policy-makers on a manufacturing mission ‚Äì Hannibal also noticed the emphasis on structural transformation of the continent‚Äôs economy, away from the export of raw materials and towards the development of a functioning manufacturing sector.

Others suggested that Africa need not look far away to meet its financing needs. ‚ÄúIf you add up our pension funds, our lazy banks, the stealing happening through multinational transfer pricing [‚Ä¶] there are around a trillion dollars in funds that could be mobilised for development,‚Äù opined United Nations Economic Commission for Africa executive secretary Carlos Lopes. ‚óè",2014-08-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'development', 'shenzhen', 'guess', 'manufacturing', 'chinas', 'bank', 'model', 'afdb', 'game', 'hannibal', 'reform', 'need']",China,news article,English

Such is the state of the country today that any praise of administrative efforts in the event of a natural disaster may appear as fortuitous to many. Kerala at present faces an extraordinary flood situation with torrential rainfall over the last couple of weeks, major rivers running in spate and hilly areas prone to landslides. However, a vital overlooked aspect has been the stupendous behind-the-scenes efforts by relief workers, police and panchayat officials in getting people to temporary shelter camps. In the villages of Kozhithuruth and Chenapuram in Ernakulam district, people are united in their praise of the relief efforts and the government intervention as river-waters rose swiftly to enter their homes.

In Kozhithuruth, an island surrounded by water on three sides and connected to the mainland through a decaying stone bridge, waters of the Periyar and the Chalakudy rivers had risen with alacrity last week sending its residents into panic mode. One of the low-lying areas sensitive to sudden floods, timing is very crucial here. Islanders, indianexpress.com spoke to, collectively said if not for the valiant efforts of the local administration and volunteer groups, there could have been casualties.

‚ÄúOn Thursday morning, we realised that water was rising very fast, it had entered our front-yards and kept climbing. We were really scared. By afternoon, our local ward members and police officers came to us begging us to lock our homes and leave for the nearby relief camp. I remember Sub-Inspector Shibu sir in particular who literally swam in waist-deep water to rescue all of us,‚Äù said Gowri Dineshan, a resident of the island, on Monday.

Sudden and fast flooding in areas like Kozhithuruth and Chenapuram are interminably linked to the gush of water through the shutters of dams like Peringalkuthu, Sholayar and Idamalayar. Prior warnings are always relayed to the district administrations ahead of opening of shutters. This time too, officials say strict protocol was followed without any space for error. Since the water from the dams always take a minimum of 2-3 hours to reach these areas, local panchayats and district authorities use the time to evacuate those in sensitive areas. In the meantime, the local schools are readied with essential supplies to house those in need.

Shibu EV, the SI in-charge of the Puthenvelikkara police station who led relief efforts within his jurisdiction, is down with a fever at a local hospital after he got drenched in the rains. But he doesn‚Äôt give much serious thought to it. He‚Äôs rather relieved that he was able to reach out to everyone in need.

‚ÄúWherever I am posted, I always have a habit of connecting with the locals, staying in touch and engaging in charity projects. I came here 8-9 months ago, but I udnerstood the geography of the place. We had strict instructions from Superintendent of Police Rahul R Nair to evacuate those in sensitive areas, so we were prepared,‚Äù said Shibu EV over phone from a hospital bed.

‚ÄúWe formed groups on WhatsApp and Facebook with resident associations, ward members, church representatives and young volunteer groups. We kept sending them repeated messages that they should shift to the relief camps. Time was of the essence. We had to get in before the water does, otherwise, we can never pull out those people,‚Äù he added.

The police officer said they first identified the households that had elderly people, pregnant women and small children. They were pulled out first, followed by big and small families, last those whose homes were situated on higher areas.

‚ÄúI can understand their mental agony in leaving their homes and go somewhere. But we have to remember that water floods very fast in areas like Kozhithuruth. If we can‚Äôt get to them at the right time, we may lose them,‚Äù said the police officer.

Jose, the local panchayat member who represents the 8th ward comprising of Kozhithuruth and nearby areas, was active on the phone, answering frantic calls from locals and taking rounds of flood-affected neighbourhoods on his scooter. Wherever he would find people stuck in homes, unable to get out, he would make calls to the police and rescue teams.

‚ÄúWhen we heard the dam shutters will have to be thrown open, we convened a meeting of all political parties, trade bodies and religious groups at the panchayat. Responsibilities were delegated to specific groups. People volunteered in different ways. Police officers in uniform waded through waist-deep water to forcibly bring people to relief camps from their inundated homes. It was like a well-oiled machinery, that‚Äôs why we were able to save all lives,‚Äù said Jose, who‚Äôs now going around collecting signatures and identification papers of those who have been promised allowances from the government.

Jose said he was surprised to witness the outpouring of help that came from different corners in the form of essential supplies to the relief camps. Puthenvelikkara village alone had 11 relief camps set up at different schools. Men and women joined hands in cooking food for the inmates, taking care of pregnant women and the elderly.

Cholera Oral Vaccination 2020

Ministry of Health will next month embark on Cholera vaccination in flood-prone areas following reports of anticipated heavy rains.



Oral Cholera Vaccine is used as part of the Ministry of Health‚Äôs Integrated Cholera prevention and control strategy. The others include the provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and high-quality case management.



Dr Joyce Moriku, the State Minister for Primary Health Care, says that the government has imported additional 1 Million vaccines which will be rolled out in May to complete vaccination of those that had earlier received the first dose last year 2020.

According to Moriku, the flood-prone districts include Kasese, Busia, Namayingo, Obongi, Madi-Okolo, Ntoroko targeting to reach between 800,000 and one million people. These received the first dose and have been considered high-risk areas to flood reports during the rainy season.



During the floods, the districts face threats of an outbreak of cholera and other water-borne diseases. In Kasese district, River Nyamwamba bursts its banks displacing several people and washing away latrines. The residents also deposit human waste in polythene bags and dump it in the flowing water.



Dr Godfrey Bwire, the Assistant Commissioner of Public Health Emergency, urged the public to also follow preventive guidelines like regular hand washing, opening up drainage channels, drinking boiled water and clearing bushes around their homes.

Keith Matthew Emerald, 32, entered his plea in U.S. District Court in Fresno almost exactly a year after prosecutors say he sparked the Rim Fire, which scorched 260,000 acres on public and private land in and near the park. Emerald, who lives near the area burned by the fire, is charged with setting timber afire, leaving a fire unattended, violating campfire restrictions and giving a false statement to a government agency. He is expected to be released from custody after his $60,000 bail is posted. Federal prosecutors say Emerald built a fire in the remote dry brush of Stanislaus National Forest, where temporary campfire restrictions were in effect because of drought, while on a bow-and-arrow hunting trip last August. Embers from the campfire reached parched branches overhead and sparked the devastating wildfire named after the Rim of the World lookout spot nearby. The flames scorched 402 square miles, destroyed nearly 100 structures and cost more than $127 million. ""The Rim Fire was one of the largest in California history and caused tremendous economic and environmental harm,"" said Scott Harris, a U.S. Forest Service special agent in charge of the area where the Rim Fire took place. ""While those harms cannot be undone, today we have brought criminal charges relating to the cause of that fire."" Rescuers airlifted Emerald from the burning forest about an hour after the wildfire began, according to court documents. Emerald initially told investigators that he did not set fire to anything during his trip. Federal prosecutors say that Emerald lit a campfire and then lied about it to investigators. If convicted of all four counts, he faces a maximum sentence of six years in prison and $510,000 in fines. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Oct. 14. Emerald's attorneys were not immediately available for comment.

Temperatures in the Himalayan region are projected to rise up to 2.6 degrees Celsius and also increase in intensity by 2-12 per cent by 2030s. This will result in increased flash floods events leading to large scale landslides and loss of agriculture area affecting food security, stated the report.

As a result of the changing climate, monsoon rainfall in 2018 was the sixth-lowest since 1901, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). It was also the sixth-warmest year since 1901, when recording started.

Further, monsoons in 2019 have also been recorded as the slowest progressing in at least 12 years, IMD data showed. Till July 7, 2019, IMD recorded a rainfall deficit of 21 per cent, while June recorded the second-lowest rainfall in the past seven years after the 42 per cent deficit in 2014.

Moreover, 20 states in the country witnessed deficient rainfall, while three were in ‚Äòlarge deficient‚Äô category from June 1 to July 7 this year.

Deficit rainfall and floods

Despite the scant rainfall, 1.4 million people have been affected by the floods due to heavy rainfall across the North East in the last week. Incessant rainfall in the past 72 hours has cut areas due to flooding.

According to IMD, there remains a rainfall deficit of 14 per cent. On July 6, when Baksa district in Assam was flooding, the deficit in North East was 38 per cent.

The flood situation, according to a release by IMD, may worsen. Heavy to very heavy showers have been predicted across Assam and Meghalaya in the next 48 hours. Another 2 million have been displaced in Bihar due to rising flood waters, media reported.

Other states experiencing floods include Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura. Parts of Maharashtra have been put on high alert, media reported.

Earlier in July, five days of torrential rains led to floods in Mumbai city. From June 20 to June 26, Mumbai had received only 8.4 mm rainfall, a deficit of 95 per cent. But, extreme rainfall in the last week of June caused floods in the city. Similarly in 2018, a deficit in rainfall for an extended period and then intense rainfall caused floods, landslides and flash floods.

Kerala, which experienced floods killing more than 500 people, last year also faced a dormant monsoon before the rains began, which did not stop for almost two weeks.

This has been the worrying trend for the past few years. In 2016, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan faced a drought-like situation when floods occurred in July-August, while Bihar and Assam ‚Äî two states that are facing their worst floods in almost three decades, had deficit rainfall that monsoon.

Global rainfall data for over the last century also shows an alarming trend. The number of rainy days is decreasing while intense rainfall events of 10-15 centimetre per day are increasing. This means that more amount of water is pouring down in lesser time. For example, globally, 50 per cent of annual precipitation (rain, snow and ice) is received in just 11 days.

Widespread extreme rain events over Central India have increased three-fold in the 66-year period between 1950 and 2015, showed a study published in the journal Nature Communications.

A 10-30 per cent increase in rainfall events over the region where more than 150 mm of rain is registered in a day has been occurring despite a general weakening of monsoon circulation, it noted.

Another study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar, had predicted an increase in extreme rainfall events in Southern and Central India and had linked it to global warming due to climate change.

More than 40,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as torrential rain sparked dangerous flash floods, and authorities issued new evacuation orders for residents of Sydney‚Äôs western regions to move to safety.

In some other areas, a massive clean-up operation began as sunny skies returned for the first time in days, and food and other emergency supplies were flown in over swamped roads.

Authorities were trying to contact the family of a Pakistani national whose body was found by emergency services in a car under six meters of water in Sydney‚Äôs northwest.

Police had determined the man was driving a brand new car, on the first day of a new job and unfamiliar with the rural area, New South Wales Police Detective Inspector Chris Laird told media. The reason he could not get out of the vehicle was being investigated.

‚ÄúIt could very well be that the electrics totally failed and he was simply unable to escape from the car which is an absolute tragedy,‚Äù Laird said.

Media reported police found a second body in an upturned utility vehicle in floodwaters in Queensland state.

Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales, the worst-hit state, warned that water levels would keep rising in some areas as major dams overflowed and rivers bulged, with thousands of people were on evacuation watch.

‚ÄúCatchments will continue to experience flows of water not seen in 50 years and in some places 100 years,‚Äù Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.

The Insurance Council of Australia, the main industry body, said about 17,000 damages claims worth about A$254.2 million ($193.32 million) had been lodged by Wednesday morning across New South Wales and Queensland.

Homes have been submerged, livestock swept away and crops inundated.

There have also been many animal rescues, with craft used to move dogs, cattle, and even an emu, away from the flood waters. In the country‚Äôs arid center, water cascaded down the Uluru rock formation, a rare phenomenon described by the national park as ‚Äúunique and extraordinary‚Äù.

RECOVERY BEGINS

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said heavy-load helicopters would transport food to supermarkets where supplies were running short.

‚ÄúThe expanse of water that went right across that region was quite devastating to see,‚Äù Morrison said in parliament after he toured flood-affected areas by helicopter.

Several hundred defense force personnel would be sent to flood-affected areas over the next few days to help in the recovery, said Emergency Management Minister David Littleproud.

‚ÄúTheir job will be out there cleaning up, making sure that we get rid of the debris, having boots on the ground,‚Äù Littleproud said.

Australian Rail Track Corp (ARTC) partially reopened Hunter Valley coal rail lines to Newcastle, the world‚Äôs biggest coal export port, but not before supply concerns lifted thermal coal prices to two year highs near $100 a tonne.

The Hunter Valley rail network serves mines run by BHP Group, Glencore Plc, New Hope Corp, Whitehaven Coal and Yancoal Australia, among others.

The Port of Newcastle, which last year shipped 158 million tonnes of coal, slowed ship movements this week but said on Wednesday it was continuing to operate.

Forecasters said the weather system that brought the rain would shift to the island state of Tasmania on Wednesday, bringing downpours and flooding.

2033,FL-2017-000067-BRA,‚ÄòOut of control‚Äô: Brazil‚Äôs COVID surge sparks regional fears - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/10/out-of-control-brazils-covid-surge-sparks-regional-fears,"Brazil‚Äôs South American neighbours worry a COVID-19 variant will spread quickly and lead to another wave of deaths.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ‚Äì Almost a year ago to the day, the jungle city of Manaus grabbed international headlines after a flood of COVID-19 deaths forced gravediggers to dig mass burials ‚Äì catapulting the city into the centre of Brazil‚Äôs coronavirus outbreak.

Those scenes are now being repeated throughout Brazil, where authorities are working day and night to bury the dead, with experts warning that the country‚Äôs funeral services could be the next to topple.

Since the start of the year, an uncontrollable second wave has pushed Brazil over the 300,000 death mark. As the country continues to hit grim milestones ‚Äì a record 4,247 deaths on Thursday alone ‚Äì the entire South American nation is now the global COVID-19 epicentre, with experts warning that 5,000 Brazilians could lose their lives in a single day in April.

Much of the fear is being directed to the P1 variant, linked to the Brazilian Amazon. If Brazil cannot control its high transmission rate, experts fear the country‚Äôs healthcare tragedy could endanger the world. If the virus is left to circulate freely, it could create the ideal breeding ground for new and even more deadly variants.

Brazil‚Äôs neighbours have sealed off their borders to the country in a desperate attempt to prevent new variants from bleeding into the rest of the continent and harming vaccine efficiency.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very concerned. The staggering amount of deaths in Brazil in just a few months is our biggest worry,‚Äù virologist and researcher Humberto Debat, from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology told Al Jazeera.

Bolsonaro‚Äôs catastrophic response

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is increasingly being blamed for undermining the severity of the virus.

Even in the pandemic‚Äôs darkest hour, the far-right leader continues to ignore calls from health officials for a national lockdown, attacks the use of masks, ignores science, peddles unproven remedies and told Brazilians this week ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no use crying over spilled milk‚Äù, referring to Brazil‚Äôs soaring death toll.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, we have a denialist president who refuses to follow science and encourages the public to follow,‚Äù said Ethel Maciel, a professor at the Federal University of S√£o Paulo.

No social distancing

Experts have said a lack of social distancing measures has created the ideal environment for variants to mutate.

Since June 2020, Brazil‚Äôs infections and deaths marooned at a steady plateau of approximately 1,000 deaths a day, leading many to believe the worst was over. For months, Brazilians commuted on crammed public transport and packed its beaches, bars and nightclubs.

People wait to board a train at Luz station in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, April 6, 2021 [Amanda Perobelli/Reuters] As Brazilians continued to flout containment measures, the P1 variant hatched, believed to have emerged in the Brazilian Amazon at the tail end of 2020. Weeks later, Manaus‚Äô health system had all but collapsed.

According to the Fiocruz research institute, the P1 variant now accounts for more than 80 percent of cases in populous states, Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo. Three months ago, it was 0 percent.

A ticking time bomb

Officials and experts are concerned about the speed with which the P1 variant, which is likely more infectious, is spreading and the damage it could pose globally.

‚ÄúThe virus has become ‚Äòsynchronised‚Äô in the whole country, with intensive care units in several states at over 90 percent capacity,‚Äù said epidemiologist Daniel Villela from the Fiocruz branch in Rio de Janeiro.

As Brazil‚Äôs health system caves in, with intubation drugs and oxygen stocks critically low, Villela also told Al Jazeera that oversaturated hospitals were causing more deaths.

Meanwhile, Brazil‚Äôs painfully slow vaccine rollout, the result of disorganisation and a lack of urgency from Bolsonaro is worrying. To date, fewer than 10 percent of Brazil‚Äôs 212 million people have been vaccinated.

‚ÄúThe only way out is accelerating our vaccine drive and national coordinated COVID protocols,‚Äù explained Villela.

But after Bolsonaro refused to implement a national lockdown on Wednesday, experts fear transmission rates will continue to skyrocket.

Residents wait in line to receive a COVID vaccine at the community Quilombo Quilomba, descendants of African slaves, in Mage, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, April 7, 2021 [Pilar Olivares/Reuters] ‚ÄúThe P1 variant is serious. Brazil could also spin out new, even more dangerous variants. The more people infected with the virus, the more mutations we‚Äôre going to see,‚Äù epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, told Al Jazeera.

Despite promising news on Wednesday of preliminary results from a continuing study finding China‚Äôs Sinovac vaccine to be 50 percent effective against the P1 strain, experts have warned that the speed with which the virus is mutating could spell disaster for current vaccine campaigns.

‚ÄúThe 4,000 Brazilian deaths on Tuesday show that the virus is circulating in great quantities, mutating and evolving quickly. It‚Äôs trying to find a way to escape natural antibodies,‚Äù said Felipe Naveca, a virologist at Fiocruz Amazonas.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nuclear reactor that has set off a chain reaction and is out of control,‚Äù Miguel Nicolelis, a Brazilian doctor and professor at Duke University in the US, told the Reuters news agency this week.

‚ÄúWe desperately need to stop it from spreading in Brazil and other countries with high transmission rates,‚Äù Naveca said.

‚ÄòHow many more lives will we have to lose?‚Äô

Brazil‚Äôs crisis is now being felt well beyond its borders. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) reported that the P1 variant has been found to be driving the second wave in at least 15 nations in the Americas.

Once championed as Latin America‚Äôs COVID poster child, Uruguay is now grappling with an explosive surge in deaths. According to government data, the 121 COVID deaths recorded in April has exceeded last year‚Äôs total COVID deaths.

‚ÄúUruguay is a good example of how things could get bad quickly,‚Äù said the Argentinian virologist Debat, who is monitoring the genome sequences of variants of concern.

A healthcare worker takes a swab sample from a man to be tested for the coronavirus disease in Buenos Aires, Argentina, April 6, 2021 [Agustin Marcarian/Reuters] The P1 variant has also been detected in Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia, Peru and Chile, as well as Canada and the United States.

Experts argue that sealing their borders will have little effect now variants of concern have entered.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late to keep the P1 out. But it‚Äôs also too late to build immunity to the second wave. Only 40 percent of Argentinians over 70 have received their first dose. Still, we‚Äôre doing anything to delay it,‚Äù Debat explained.

Over 11,000 people have been evacuated to safety in central Vietnam which has been hit by severe flooding following prolonged rains.

The entire region has been battered by torrential downpours for the last three days.

Some areas in Quang Tri Province and neighboring Thua Thien-Hue Province have received 980 mm of rain. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

At least five people have been killed, two in Quang Tri and the others in Dak Lak, Gia Lai and Quang Ngai provinces. Seven others were missing as of Thursday night.

In Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, and Da Nang, 37 communes have been cut off as some areas are under one meter of water and traffic has been blocked due to landslides.

In popular tourist town Hue in Thua Thien-Hue, many roads are inundated.

Nguyen Van Khoa, a local official, said around 200 houses are under 30 cm of water and people living in low-lying areas have been forced to move to safety.

Hoi An, a tourist hotspot and UNESCO heritage site, is like a massive lake following prolonged downpours with many streets under 0.5 meter of water.

Nguyen The Hung, the towns vice chairman, said plans are underway to evacuate people living in low-lying areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Thursday ordered provinces from Ha Tinh to Phu Yen to deal with the heavy flooding and take urgent measures including evacuation to ensure peoples safety.

The central region from Ha Tinh to Quang Ngai provinces should expect more heavy rains of 330-400 mm a day until Sunday, the national weather forecasting center has warned.",2020-10-09 07:00:00+00:00,"['thienhue', 'areas', 'vietnam', 'evacuated', '11000', 'ravage', 'quang', 'provinces', 'province', 'central', 'floods', 'mm', 'thua', 'tri', 'ha']",Vietnam,news article,English

Between FY 2011 and FY 2020, USAID‚Äôs Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA) provided humanitarian assistance in response to a range of natural and complex emergencies in the region through the former Office of Food for Peace (USAID/FFP) and Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA). Examples include complex emergencies in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan; drought, food insecurity, floods, and desert locust infestations in the Horn of Africa; and the COVID-19 pandemic across the region.

USAID provided approximately $13.4 billion to respond to disasters in the East Africa and Sudans region between FY 2011 and FY 2020. USAID/BHA assistance included approximately $10.1 billion for emergency food assistance and nutrition support through U.S. in-kind food aid; locally, regionally, and internationally procured food; cash transfers for food; food vouchers; specialized nutrition products; and related activities, such as asset-building assistance, livelihood support, and early-recovery agricultural assistance. USAID/BHA support also included more than $3.3 billion for programs in agriculture; economic recovery and market systems; health; humanitarian coordination, information management, and assessments; humanitarian policy, studies, analysis, or applications; logistics support and relief commodities; multipurpose cash assistance; nutrition; protection; shelter and settlements; and water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In the last decade, USAID responded to crises in six countries in East Africa and Sudans, including to 63 declared disasters. USAID frequently deployed humanitarian teams to the region, including three Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) responding to the complex emergency in South Sudan, drought in Ethiopia, and a regional food security crisis in the Horn of Africa.

303,FL-2021-000025-AUS,The world sees the climate crisis in Australia's floods. Do we? - The Interpreter,https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/world-sees-climate-crisis-australia-s-floods-do-we,"In the late 1980s, while I was a reporter covering one of the mega-cyclones to hit Bangladesh, a government official in Dhaka confided in me that he was fed up with seeing his nation only make the global headlines as a result of the disasters that befell it.

Australia is fast catching up in that regard.

In the past 18 months, the driest continent on the planet has made global news for unprecedented bushfires that left 33 people dead and more than 17 million hectares in ash. This was followed by the great floods of 2020, which left hundreds homeless and drenched the eastern part of the country with more than 700 millimetres of water in a week.

Come March of 2021 and Australia is in the global headlines yet again. The descriptions are as similar as they are familiar.

Worst floods in decades. One-in-a-hundred-year event. Greatest concern. News reporters and politicians appear to have run out of adjectives, recycling the same phrases used in previous disasters. Gone are the days when Australia was famous across the world for stories of cuddly koalas, boxing kangaroos or surfers versus sharks. Australia is now well and truly at the forefront of the climate crisis.

Compounding this challenge is a view of a government out of step with the world to act in response.

It was not always thus. Consider the case of the hole in the ozone layer, when after its discovery in 1985, Australia played an outstanding role in the creation of the Montreal Protocol, which became known as the ‚Äúworld's most successful environmental agreement‚Äù.

Notions of isolation and relative safety have long been a mainstay for global views of Australia. In 2021, it may well be the reverse.

That success only makes for a more striking contrast with Australia‚Äôs contemporary international reputation for the approach it has adopted to climate change, particularly under the Liberal-National Coalition government in power since 2013. People are regularly reminded that Prime Minister Scott Morrison once brandished a lump of coal in the country‚Äôs parliament, that the Coalition dismantled the carbon tax and struggled over a renewable energy target, and has consistently ignored the pleas of business groups, environmental organisations and climate scientists for firm action.

It‚Äôs not that Australia has been without recommendations. The Garnaut Climate Change Review, for example, commissioned in 2007 by then‚ÄìLabor leader Kevin Rudd, argued that it was in Australia‚Äôs national interest to seek an international agreement for holding carbon dioxide equivalent concentrations at 450 parts per million (ppm) or lower, and for Australia to offer in advance to play its full proportionate part in such an agreement. The report also said the cost of action to the Australian economy of tackling climate change was far less than the cost of inaction. But today the Garnaut report is hardly mentioned and has all but disappeared from public discourse.

Instead Australia appears trapped in a turgid political contest where critics are dismissed as ‚Äúwoke inner-city greenies‚Äù and the attempts to discuss the cause of regular crises are deflected as ‚Äúnot the right time‚Äù.

All of this can‚Äôt help but be noted around the world as the country first burned and then drowned. Even former finance minister Mattias Cormann‚Äôs campaign to become chief of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development was dogged by criticism of Australia‚Äôs climate stance, and while this did not prevent him winning the gig, will such questions continue to mount and in future hold Australia back?

The author at the causeway on the road to home (Edmond Roy)

As I write this from home the rain has been steadily falling for the past week. So far, in the small hamlet of Marlee, on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, we have received 820 millimetres of rain. The creeks around our property have inundated paddocks, created rivers out of streams and uprooted 30-metre-tall gum trees. The roads into our area have been wiped out, causeways and bridges destroyed. Landslides block access to many properties, livestock washed downstream and drowned, communication systems are down, electricity and water supplies cut.

This followed heavy rains that were experienced in the city and it√¢??s environs on Thursday.

Residents said the four were swept away by the raging water as they tried to cross a bridge there.

Two bodies have been recovered in Silanga area. Search for the rest is ongoing.

A search and rescue mission was ongoing in the area with hopes of finding them.

Police and rescuers said they fear more deaths would be reported because of the floods that affected various informal settlements in the city.

Nairobi police boss Augustine Nthumbi said teams had been mobilized to help in the search and rescue missions.

√¢??We are on the ground with other teams to ensure residents are safe,√¢?¬ù he said.

He added they are conducting a survey to check the extent of the issue. Property of unknown value was destroyed in the floods that ensued.

Residents of some estates reported flooding in their areas which affected their operations.

Some residents were forced to endure long hours on the road while others were forced to spend the night on the road following heavy rains that continue to pound the capital.

The heavy downpour resulted in heavy traffic gridlock, flooded roads as well as cutting off of sections of roads making the movement of traffic a nightmare.

Motorists and commuters alike have had to suffer the consequences of the heavy rains with others forced to spend the night on the road.

The situation has been worsened by ongoing infrastructural developments going on across the city with the construction of the Nairobi Expressway playing a major role in the mess.

Motorists have been forced to wade through flash floods occasioned by heavy rains, with Kenya Meteorological Department warning the rains will continue throughout the week.

According to the weatherman, the heavy rainfall being experienced over several parts of the country is set to continue this week and likely to intensify to more than 30 mm in 24 hours.However, the heavy downpour is projected to reduce in intensity this week.

754,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Lesotho: Drought Breeds Multi-Faceted Crises for Border Communities - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907160104.html,"The recent El-Nino induced drought has spawned a multi-faceted crisis for Basotho communities in the border areas with South Africa who are often forced to illegally graze their livestock in the neighbouring country.

The practice of seeking pastures in South Africa has opened up the border communities to a whole range of conflicts with their neighbours who have retaliated by either stealing or impounding the livestock and demanding hefty fines of as much as M2500 for the release of each cow.

In addition, some of the impoverished families have forced their young girls into early marriages of convenience in the neighbouring country due to the financial inducements associated with the practice which has been defined by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPA) as a human rights violation.

This came out during a recent media field trip to Mohale's Hoek which was organised by the UNFPA and the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF). The field trip was part of a media training programme on mainstreaming issues of child protection, gender based violence and migration as well as humanitarian emergencies into broader media coverage.

Lesotho is among several countries in the region that experienced poor harvest due to the El-Nino induced drought. UNFPA Communications officer Violet Maraisane said that it is estimated that at least 500 000 Basotho (a quarter of the population) are food insecure and would need assistance.

Some of the socio-economic challenges stemming from the drought include increasing crime, high rates of school dropouts, early child marriages and teenage pregnancies.

Speaking at the field trip, Mohale's Hoek Police Officer Commanding Sephapho's Border Gate, Sub Inspector Francis Pita said due to the declining pastures and the poor harvests of the 2018/19 agricultural season, livestock farmers who opted to graze their animals in neighbouring South Africa had become victims of stock theft and the impounding of their animals.

Sub Inspector Pita said Basotho nationals took advantage of the porous borders to illegally graze their livestock in South Africa. He said this had created a vicious circle where local and South African farmers stole each other's livestock.

""On this (Lesotho) side there is no veld solely because of the drought and the fact that farmers this side do not practice rotational grazing so they end up stealing or grazing their livestock in the fields of SA farmers,"" Sub Inspector Pita said.

""Some Basotho steal the livestock in South Africa and others even steal animal feed to come and feed their own livestock.""

He said such practices caused problems for local farmers whose livestock were impounded as they were forced to pay fines in the region of M2500 for the release of each cow.

""That is a lot of money and because most families do not have it, they forfeit their animals leading to even more poverty. The story does not end there as some Basotho retaliate by going back to steal from the South Africans and this sometimes leads to bloodshed and death.

""The South Africans also cross over to steal livestock. Sometime in March this year in Ha-Moeketsi, 17 cows were stolen from one family and two weeks later the victim died probably due to depression since most people rely on their livestock to feed their families.""

Sub Inspector Pita said due to the frequent droughts, ""so many children have become school dropouts who cross into South Africa and enter into marriages of convenience which backfires as they are burdened with children they cannot care for"".

UNFPA Communications officer Violet Maraisane subsequently told the Lesotho Times that this was much more than just a farmers' conflict as it also created more humanitarian challenges.

Ms Maraisane said they had conducted a drought assessment which showed that at least 500 000 Basotho were food insecure and would need assistance.

""It is on the basis of this that the UN in Lesotho undertook early action to deliver urgent lifesaving multi-sectoral emergency assistance to severely food insecure households and to address the impacts of drought and erratic rainfall affecting the population in Mohale's Hoek, Maseru, Mafeteng, Quthing and Qacha's Nek districts.

""UN agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), UNICEF, UNFPA, World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) jointly with national partners, mobilised funds from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to address priority humanitarian needs in nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, agriculture, food security and health,"" Ms Maraisane said

She said the UN is providing lifesaving multi-sectoral emergency assistance to communities through the CERF-funded project titled, ""Provision of life saving protection, gender based violence and psychosocial support to drought affected populations"".

""IOM and UNICEF focus on informing the community on protection risks around migration and child protection.

""Child marriages are a human rights violation. Despite laws against it, the practice remains widespread. Globally, one in every five girls is married before reaching the age of 18.

""Child marriages threatens girls' lives and health and it limits their future prospects. Girls pressed into child marriages often become pregnant while still adolescents, increasing the risk of complications in pregnancy or childbirth. These complications are the leading cause of death among older adolescent girls,"" Ms Maraisane said.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security's Director General for Veterinary Services, Relebohile Mahloane, said although the government worked hard to assist Basotho it was not possible to come to the aid of those who engaged in illegal activities like grazing their livestock in neighbouring South Africa.

Dr Mahloane said local farmers had dismally failed to preserve their own grazing ranges through their failure to implement sustainable grazing practices and this had caused them to be vulnerable to their South African counterparts who impounded their livestock.

""What they (local farmers) are doing (grazing their livestock in South Africa) is illegal and SA farmers leave them to do such acts so they can take advantage of them,"" Dr Mahloane said.",2019-07-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['drought', 'africa', 'marriages', 'food', 'livestock', 'farmers', 'breeds', 'lesotho', 'multifaceted', 'grazing', 'basotho', 'border', 'south', 'maraisane', 'communities', 'crises']",Ghana,news article,English

Heavy rains have intensified in Kenya over the past three weeks, causing death, displacement, flooding and landslides. At least 40,000 people were rendered homeless after the Nzoia river burst its banks on the weekend of 2 May.

Since the beginning of the country√¢??s √¢??long rains√¢?? season in early March, more than 233,000 people have been affected, including over 116,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society.

Flooding has been reported in more than three quarters of Kenya√¢??s counties (36 out of 47), with landslides reported in the Rift Valley and the central and coastal regions, according to the Government√¢??s National Disaster Operations Centre.

The Kenya Meteorological Department forecasts aboveaverage rainfall throughout May in parts of the Rift Valley, and in the central, western and coastal regions of Kenya, which could result in further flooding.

The heavy rains have increased the risk of health emergencies and provided conditions conducive to the further breeding of desert locusts in Kenya.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Heavy rains in Kenya have intensified over the past three weeks, causing death, displacement, flooding and landslides in multiple locations across the country. Landslides have caused destruction and loss of lives in the Rift Valley and the central and coastal regions, according to the National Disaster Operations Centre (NDOC).

The long rains season, which began in March, has to date affected over 233,000 people across 36 of Kenya√¢??s 47 counties, including more than 116,000 people displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). At least 85,000 people are sheltering in displacement camps in the western (more than 55,800 people), North Rift (nearly 15,000), coastal (almost 7,800) and north-eastern (7,000 people) regions. According to the KRCS, at least 54 per cent of the displaced population are female-headed families, while 11 per cent are children under age 5. Kenya√¢??s Interior Cabinet Secretary, Fred Matiang, confirmed during a press conference on 6 May that at least 194 people have been killed by the floods since March. Damage to infrastructure, including schools, houses, roads and bridges has been reported, and over 8,000 acres of farmland, mainly rice nearly mature, have reportedly been destroyed, according to the Government.

In western Kenya, one of the hardest-hit regions, at least 40,000 people were rendered homeless after the Nzoia river burst its banks on the weekend of 2 May. Meanwhile, the rising level of Lake Victoria is impacting families in Kisumu,

Siaya, Busia, Migori and Nyanza counties. According to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission, the water level in the Lake has risen by more than two metres, a situation last seen when the overflow rose by close to 2.5 metres between 1960 and 1964.

In the north-western region, at least 15 people reportedly died and nearly 4,000 were displaced following a mudslide triggered by heavy rains on 18 April in West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties, according to the KRCS. Multiple homes, a shopping centre and a police post have been damaged. The displaced are sheltered in Sambalat Primary School, where a rescue command centre has been established to coordinate humanitarian assistance. According to humanitarian partners, access to the area remains challenging, as roads have been damaged and heavy rains continue in the area. West Pokot County is prone to landslides and has faced several similar incidents in November 2019.

In Mount Kenya and the Aberdares, heavy rainfall has caused an increase in the volume of the Seven Fork Dam, with flooding reported downstream in areas around Tana River, according to media reports. The Government has urged residents living along Tana River and Garrisa districts to move to higher grounds, as water levels in Kiambere. Kindaruma and Masinga dams are likely to overflow. The Government has also issued a red flood alert to people living in upper Kitui, Murang√¢??a and Elgeyo-Marakwet counties.

The heavy rainfall has increased the risk of disease outbreaks and hampered efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health has reported a cholera outbreak in Marsabit county and parts of north-eastern region. People displaced by floods and landslides are living in temporary camps, where more than 70 per cent of people do not have adequate access to clean water. Congestion, poor sanitation, inadequate food and other essentials√¢??such as medicines, mosquito nets, bedding and clothes√¢??are major concerns, according to KRCS. Displaced people are also vulnerable to pneumonia, bilharzia, diarrhoea and cholera, which are prevalent during flooding.

The Kenya Meteorological Department has warned that more heavy rains are expected in the coming days, especially in the Rift Valley, central, western and coastal areas. These conditions are conducive to the further breeding of desert locusts.",2020-05-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['rift', 'rains', 'regions', 'heavy', 'update', 'displaced', 'reported', 'coastal', 'landslides', 'flash', 'according', 'kenya', '2020', 'floods']",Kenya,news article,English

237,FF-2016-000062-IDN,How a volcanic eruption in Indonesia inspired Frankenstein. - Slate Magazine,https://slate.com/technology/2016/06/how-a-volcanic-eruption-in-indonesia-inspired-frankenstein.html,"Two hundred years ago this June, during a dreadfully cold and wet summer, Mary Shelley began writing Frankenstein. Since then Frankenstein has become iconic, spawning a legion of adaptations and reinterpretations. The Oxford English Dictionary even includes entries for the verb ‚Äúto frankenstein,‚Äù which means to stitch something together in a grotesque fashion, and the prefix ‚Äúfranken-‚Äù to make anything monstrous. The novel is shorthand for the dangers of unfettered scientific progress. But the unforgettable creation scene, depicted in movies with frenzied screams of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alive!‚Äù and arcing electricity, doesn‚Äôt happen until one-third of the way through the novel. If you‚Äôve never read the book, you might expect the story to begin with Dr. Frankenstein recounting his mistakes or heading off to school to study anatomy. Instead, we start with Robert Walton, an Arctic explorer. The Arctic exploration might seem random, but it makes more sense in the light of the environmental crisis unfolding in the Northern Hemisphere when Shelley was drafting the novel.

Mary Shelley was an astute observer of the world; her journals reveal a young woman with a powerful drive to learn, reading a range of political, literary, philosophical, and scientific works. For Frankenstein, she seems to have been inspired by a series of electrical experiments and new microscopic discoveries to imagine whether it would be possible to infuse the spark of life into dead flesh. But her observations were not limited to the world of books‚Äîthey extended to the environment around her to include the dark forests of eastern France, the sublime peaks of the Alps, and the miserable weather of 1816. In her preface to the 1831 edition of Frankenstein, Shelley comments that the summer of 1816 in Geneva, where she was staying, was memorably unpleasant: ‚Äúit proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house.‚Äù This dreary weather wasn‚Äôt a chance occurrence‚Äîit was just one small manifestation of larger environmental changes.

Between April 5 and 11 of 1815, the volcano Tambora erupted in Indonesia, more than 7,500 miles away from Geneva. Tambora‚Äôs eruption is one of the largest in recorded human history, 100 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens‚Äô 1980 explosion. The eruption pumped a massive quantity of sulfur into the atmosphere, radically cooling the Northern Hemisphere by 0.7 degrees Fahrenheit to 1.26 degrees Fahrenheit.* In essence, people living between 1815 and 1816 experienced an extreme, miniature global climate change event.

Advertisement

The constant rain that Mary complains about in her preface caused flooding in Geneva, forcing people out of their houses and onto higher ground. Thanks to Tambora, violent storms rolled over Switzerland and much of the rest of Europe. In June 1816 temperatures in New England began to fluctuate wildly, going from 82 degrees Fahrenheit on June 5, to -30 degrees the next day as reported by the Connecticut Courant (now the Hartford Courant). In Quebec there are reports of frost the week of June 12‚Äì19, followed by a brief return to temperatures as high as 75 degrees (more normal for June), followed again by snow and ice. (These numbers may not be totally accurate, since they were anecdotal reports in 19th century newspapers.)* Accordingly, 1816 has been called ‚ÄúEighteen Hundred and Froze to Death‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Year Without a Summer.‚Äù

In parts of London the weather had a rather mundane impact. La Belle Assembl√©e in July reports, ‚ÄúThe precarious state of the weather, with the departure from town of several fashionists belonging to the higher classes, and the more serious causes of emigration, have rendered the modern toilette less subject to fluctuation than might otherwise been expected.‚Äù Thanks to the unseasonable weather, the trendsetters (the fashionists) left London earlier than usual so the mode of dress (the toilette) was more subdued.

Advertisement

But the radical shift in climate had far more serious effects, too. The Connecticut Courant reports the weather had a macabre fallout on the bird population: ‚ÄúA variety of birds, among which are the hummingbird, the yellow bird, the marten and the beautiful scarlet sparrow have been so benumbed, as to be taken by the hand and great numbers have actually perished by the cold.‚Äù The birds that were ‚Äútaken by the hand‚Äù were likely eaten, not nursed by the fire until they regained their strength. Other stories include birds flocking to towns seeking warmth and respite from the frozen woods, only to be trapped by hungry humans.

Advertisement

One feature occurs again and again in the news reports: a focus on food. Even brief discussions of the weather are reliably accompanied by concerns about the availability of food. The weather was destroying crops, setting people on edge. Reports out of Montreal, again printed in the Connecticut Courant, suggest that the city was on the verge of rioting because ‚Äúthe high price of bread excites general alarm, but it is owing to artificial causes. Wealthy individuals have engrossed the flour that came to Montreal, and now extort the enormous profit of center per cent. ‚Ä¶ The situation of the poor in general throughout the Province is dreadful.‚Äù There were riots in the United Kingdom; in the city of Frome, citizens raging against skyrocketing potato prices were subdued by the cavalry. La Belle Assembl√©e might seem to suggest that London was insulated from the unrest, but even it hints that were ‚Äúmore serious causes of emigration‚Äù from the city as it became home to masses of displaced vagrants and beggars.

One report out of Maine, in the Connecticut Courant, notes, ‚ÄúA famine for man and beast seems to stare us in the face.‚Äù The author goes on to ask, ‚ÄúWhat is to become of us? We hope, notwithstanding, that the God of harvest will not utterly forsake us.‚Äù Famine was widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, stretching as far as China where there are accounts of people eating clay to survive. Conservative estimates put the death toll from Tambora‚Äôs disruption of agriculture at 71,000‚Äîall because the weather was 0.7 to 1.26 degrees cooler than normal. Distressingly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‚Äôs projections for global warming suggest that the earth‚Äôs climate will be roughly 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer on average by about 2025.

The Year Without a Summer is why Robert Walton is important to Frankenstein: Like the newspapers, he‚Äôs concerned about surviving climate chaos. Walton journeys to the Arctic in search of a northern paradise. He says that in the Arctic ‚Äúthe sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour. ‚Ä¶ There snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.‚Äù Frankenstein begins with the search for new, more habitable lands because of environmental anxieties. People did not know that the cooling trend was a temporary result of volcanic activity. Rather, they thought the summer of 1816, with its famine, social unrest, and winter eternal, was the new normal. To survive in this afflicted world, new sources of food and land would be necessary, so Walton heads north hoping to find a balmy Eden. Amusingly, Walton would have found the Arctic much balmier now: The Arctic was already about 5.22 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than average in 2015. That might open up the Arctic to farming but at the same time the Middle East might become an uninhabitable wasteland not to mention other unforeseen changes.

At the end of the novel, Walton, at the urging of his crew, turns his ship around, ending his quest to find the Arctic Eden. Walton and Frankenstein (who is telling Walton his story, after the captain saved him) are both frustrated by the sailors‚Äô cowardice. The crew doesn‚Äôt want to die for glory, honor, and science. Later Frankenstein reconsiders his anger and reflects that he remembered too late: ‚ÄúMy duties towards my fellow-creatures had greater claims to my attention, because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery‚Äù than his need for self-aggrandizement. The novel emphasizes social responsibility in the face of a climate crisis.

Today, archival technologies allow us to understand the human dimension of climate changes throughout history: How have people in different times and places reacted to a dynamic, deadly world? Reading arcane and previously lost documents, like stories chronicling the summer of 1816, gives us the opportunity to understand the complex nature of our world, to remember what we might have forgotten, and to consider how our communities and societies can be more resilient in the face of a changing climate. The future will always be unpredictable, but every day is an opportunity to learn more from the past and put that knowledge to work. A volcano, a novel, and a smattering of newspaper reports can reveal a possible gap in our thinking about climate change today‚Äîthe bedrock importance of food security and the turmoil shortages will cause, because the difference between sustenance and starvation can be a matter of degrees.

High resolution images available with NDTV indicate the clearest ever sequence of events leading up to the glacier burst in Uttarakhand's Chamoli on Sunday, which left 30 dead and over 170 missing.

Before and after images with fairly incredible clarity show the magnitude of the avalanche.

An image from February 6 shows an ice and snow covered ridge line, a part of the Trishala glacier. But after the avalanche, on February 8, an entire chunk of ice is missing.

Similar changes are seen in an area a few kilometres from where the avalanche was triggered. The area was snowed under but after the avalanche, the impact is visible. On the day of the quake, a massive chunk of ice and snow just disappeared.

The river near the Tapovan hydel plant, which was washed away, was a narrow stream of green-coloured water on February 6. On February 8, it became a broad river of brown mud.

A long shot of the entire area highlights the scale of the destruction.

On February 6, the day before the avalanche, the Tapovan hydel plant could be seen. That is where the avalanche would hit a day later. The path of the landslide and dust are clearly visible in the images. On February 8, after the dust clears up, it is all a field of debris.

Experts believe a block of rock, with some ice, dropped almost two kilometres before hitting the valley floor, generating a huge rock and ice avalanche, which raced down the glacier at a high speed. The images indicate that on the way, it generated a vast quantity of dust that was smeared on the valley side.

""Appears to be a complete detachment of a previously glaciated slope,"" posted Scott Watson.

The rock avalanche will have generated a huge amount of heat and will have induced fragmentation, experts say. The ice was likely crushed and melted, which caused the landslide to transition to a flow of debris.

Home Minister Amit Shah, in a statement on the tragedy in parliament, said: ""It is observed from the satellite data (Planet Lab) of 7th February, 2021 in catchment of Rishi Ganga river at the terminus of the glacier at an altitude of 5,600m, a landslide triggered a snow avalanche covering approximately 14 square km area and causing a flash flood in the downstream of Rishi Ganga River.""",2021-02-09 08:00:00+00:00,"['images', 'glacier', 'river', 'satellite', 'avalanches', 'day', 'ice', 'high', 'resolution', 'path', 'destruction', 'click', 'snow', 'uttarakhand', 'avalanche']",India,news article,English

Unmitigated spread in Brazil

Caroline Ash

Despite an extensive network of primary care availability, Brazil has suffered profoundly during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Using daily data from state health offices, Castro et al. analyzed the pattern of spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country from February to October 2020. Clusters of deaths before cases became apparent indicated unmitigated spread. SARS-CoV-2 circulated undetected in Brazil for more than a month as it spread north from S√£ o Paulo. In Manaus, transmission reached unprecedented levels after a momentary respite in mid-2020. Faria et al. tracked the evolution of a new, more aggressive lineage called P.1, which has 17 mutations, including three (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) in the spike protein. After a period of accelerated evolution, this variant emerged in Brazil during November 2020. Coupled with the emergence of P.1, disease spread was accelerated by stark local inequalities and political upheaval, which compromised a prompt federal response.

98,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Marine Corps releases desert tortoise at California base - Marine Corps Times,https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2015/10/04/marine-corps-releases-desert-tortoise-at-california-base/,"MARINE CORPS AIR-GROUND COMBAT CENTER TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. ‚Äî It took barely a minute or two for the young desert tortoise to scramble from the hand of Col. James Harp and into the cool shade of a burrowing hole four feet away.

Freedom at last. The desert tortoise, tagged with a transmitter and stamped with the bureaucratic name of ""2-4,"" was the last of a cohort of 35 desert tortoises released into the wild by the Marine Corps.

The Sept. 30 release was nine years in the making.

""It's pretty significant,"" Harp told the crowd of two-dozen officials, local representatives and journalists gathered for the event.

The tortoise was among 475 housed in a fenced, secured ""head start"" facility the Marine Corps built in 2006 in a concerted effort to recover the threatened species that's seen adult mortality rates of 90 percent in recent decades. Starting in mid-September, biologists released the tortoises leading up to the first public release at Sand Hill, a restricted training area at the 1,100-square-mile desert warfare training base.

Some may wonder why there's so much fuss over a tortoise, but the species shares its home with members of the military. Survival is a battle for the desert tortoise. Military training, along with suburban sprawl, commercial activities, expanding solar and wind farms, cattle farms, and off-road recreation across its Mojave Desert home have all decimated the population.

The military services have agreed to conservation programs like this one to mitigate impacts of expanded ranges and training, as well as to study and help the species. That includes ""head start"" programs to safeguard young tortoises and programs to move the reptiles from military training areas. The Army's ""head start"" facility at Fort Irwin, California, closed shop a few years ago after many of the hundreds of tortoises released and relocated didn't survive the first few months. A similar effort at Edwards Air Force Base, California, also saw disappointing results.

Reknowned desert tortoise expert and UCLA professor emeritus Kenneth A. Nagy holds ""2-4,"" a 9-year-old desert tortoise raised at the Tortoise Research and Captive Rearing Site since its creation in 2006. The tortoise was released into the wild in the Sand Hill area of MCAGCC.

The Marine Corps and the base's Natural Resources and Environmental Affairs division collaborated with tortoise experts and federal agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on ways to give hatchlings and juveniles a fighting chance to grow big enough to ward off predators and survive on their own.

""We are trying to do things a little bit differently,"" Brian Henen, the base biologist said.

The six-acre Tortoise Research and Captive Rearing Site, or TRACRS ( pronounced like the word ""tracers""), is the only one of its kind in the military and one of only two head-start efforts in the U.S. Hatchlings raised at TRACRS have as much as a 96 percent survival rate, double or triple what they would encounter in the wild, Henen said.

""That actually helps support our mission, the mission of training here at [Twentynine Palms] ,"" he said. ""Those go hand-in-hand, they mesh quite closely together with that objective of protecting tortoises but also protecting and sustaining the mission.""

The desert tortoise isn't exactly Marine Corps material. It's slow and laid back. It's not predatory, preferring a vegetarian diet of leaves and flowers. When threatened, it slinks into its hardened shell for protection from predators like hawks, ravens and coyotes. If scared, it might urinate, emptying its bladder of its lifesaving supply of stored water.

Young tortoises, with their softer, thinner shells, are vulnerable to predators like hawks and coyotes looking for a snack . Many of the tortoises released by the Army and Air Force were later found pecked or crushed to death , biologists said. That led to the question: Would more survive if they were a little older?

Col. James Harp, Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center's chief of staff, releases a 9-year-old desert tortoise in the Sand Hill area. It was the last of 35 released from the Corps' Tortoise Research and Captive Rearing Site, a unique ""head start"" facility at the desert combat training center at Twentynine Palms, Calif., created to help recover the endangered species.

At 9 years old, tortoise ""2-4"" is like a teenager ready to tackle the big world on his own. (He might be a she. Biologists don't know yet if it's a male or female.)

The tortoise grew from a clutch of eggs brought to TRACRS in the program's first year . About 50 juvenile tortoises have grown large enough ‚Äî bigger than the size of a softball ‚Äî to be eligible for release, Henen said.

Officials wanted to do the first release in 2014, but California's ongoing drought shriveled up vegetation, said Ken Nagy, a University of California at Los Angeles professor emeritus working with the Marine Corps since TRACRS' inception . Recent rains have helped.

""Our tortoises out here are hydrated. They love to drink rainwater,"" Nagy said, who also worked with Fort Irwin's program. Officials hope to do another release next year.

MCAGCC's most famous tortoise, and desert tortoise ambassador ""Thelma."" Thelma and Louise reside at TRACRS and are often brought to educational events at the training base.

The 198-square-mile expansion here added a separate effort to save the desert tortoise. The Marine Corps will move as many as 1,200 tortoises to safer remote areas starting next year, officials said. Henen said 110 contracted biologists are helping survey and assess sites and find tortoises in a 200-square-kilometer area.

""We have to go out and find all the tortoises and move them from the high-impact areas,"" Lt. Col.

146,Drought Sri Lanka,Rainwater harvesting : Resource guaranteed for the underprivileged - Ceylon Daily News,https://dailynews.lk/2017/03/22/features/111126/rainwater-harvesting-resource-guaranteed-underprivileged,"Today is World Water Day. The Daily News sat down with Executive Director of the Lanka Rain Water Harvesting Forum Dr. Tanuja Ariyananda to discuss what her organization does to combat water scarcity in Sri Lanka. As the world undergoes climate change, seasonal rainfall is becoming more erratic, further challenging scientists and policymakers who wish to ensure water availability for everyone. One such manner of guaranteeing access to water is through rainwater harvesting, whereby rain is captured in large above-ground tanks. Dr. Ariyananda‚Äôs organization has set up thousands of these systems to combat drinking water scarcity for people throughout the island.

Excerpts follow:

Q: Can you tell me about the work you do?

A: We promote the idea of collecting rainwater, or rainwater harvesting, for domestic use, especially in areas where water is scarce. Sri Lanka is a high-rainfall country, so you might wonder why we need to do this, but it is very important. Although we generally have good rainfall, from 900 millimeters to 5,500 millimeters (mm) in the hilly areas, we have some pockets that barely get enough rainwater. But the water in these areas is not collected efficiently in my opinion.

These areas suffer from lack of water from time to time because rainfall is seasonable and variable. Some areas don‚Äôt get rain throughout the year, but get it in two seasons. In countries like Sri Lanka, rainwater harvesting is ideal, and the basic concept is collecting rain and using it during the dry season.

We have set up about 7,000 tank systems ourselves, and we have worked with other organizations, including the government, the Water Board, and other NGOs, to set up about 40,000 of these systems.

Q: Sri Lanka just emerged from a serious drought. Is this an effective system for supplying water during droughts?

A: Very much so. We get more requests to set up tanks during droughts than during the rainy season, but that is too late, since you should collect rainwater when it is still raining. But I think droughts and floods are now a part of daily life.

The seasons have changed to the drought season and the flood season, rather than the monsoon season, so our systems are ideal for both situations. If you collect water during floods, you reduce the flood level as well, because you are collecting and arresting the water. And then during the drought, you use that water that you‚Äôve saved.

Q: Where are you concentrating your efforts in Sri Lanka?

A: We try to help people all over Sri Lanka, but most of our work happens in the dry zone areas in the North, East, and some parts of the South, like Uva Province.

Q: Can you tell me about the systems you use to collect rainwater?



Dr. Tanuja Ariyananda

A: We mostly set up roof water harvesting systems. We have special gutter systems that deliver the water from the roof to the catchment and into ferrocement tanks. We use chicken mesh as a frame and use cement to build around it. It‚Äôs a low-cost system that is generally built above ground. It‚Äôs easy to manage and easy to maintain. That‚Äôs the basic system, but the type of tank does not matter as long as it can be closed. An 8,000-litre tank will cost about Rs. 65,000 to build, including labour.

Q: Is there some kind of filtration mechanism?

A: Yes, we have what is called a first-flush system where we don‚Äôt collect the first rain from the roof because it might contain some debris and dust. We let the first rain itself wash the roof.

Then the clean water goes into the tank. Even before that, just before it enters the tank, there is another filter that takes out any debris that might come in with the water. It‚Äôs a homemade filter made from small pebbles and charcoal, with some cloth or mesh on it as well. Any leaves, debris, or unwanted material also get arrested there.

Also, when we extract water from the tank, we don‚Äôt take it from the bottom. We allow any sediment that might come in to settle at the bottom of the tank, and then we take water from a little above the bottom so that we don‚Äôt get any of the sediment. But people wash out the tanks from time to time and get rid of the debris and sediment.

Q: Are there any problems with this system?

A: The only issue is maintenance. The user maintains the rainwater harvesting system. There is no external person coming in to check on it. You have to maintain it yourself. If you don‚Äôt know how to maintain it or neglect to maintain it, you can have problems. For instance, if you leave the lid open, mosquitoes can go in and breed.

The above ground tanks themselves are very solid. They have lasted for 20 years quite well. Also, plastic tanks last up to 20 years, if not more. We have had some problems with underground tanks, and that is why we don‚Äôt promote these systems too much now. Roots pierce and crack underground tanks.



Resident maintaining the water tank

Q: How are you funded?

A: We have different funders. That‚Äôs always a challenge for us. We always have to look for funding. USAID has been funding us for three years for projects in the North and the Uva Province. We have been funded by the Japan Water Forum, the Korean Water Foundation, and the Canadian Development Agency, among others, in the past. But we don‚Äôt give the whole system for free.

We get some commitment from the beneficiaries themselves. They contribute by building gutters on roofs and providing labour during construction. About 15 percent of the cost is borne by the beneficiaries.

Unfortunately, the system isn‚Äôt being taken up more because of the initial cost. Rainwater is free, but you need to spend some money at the start. It would be great if a bank or the government could provide that initial investment in the form of a loan, perhaps an interest-free loan.

Q: How do you manage implementation? Who goes and builds the tanks?

A: We have a skilled group of masons scattered throughout the island for that purpose. Every time we work in a district, we recruit masons from the area, and we train them ourselves.

Then they do future projects in their respective districts. We have been promoting ferrocement tanks because they give some business to local guys as well.

We have trained more than 400 masons so far. I should also add that we rarely build single tanks. We generally provide many for a village. We select the number of beneficiaries, do an awareness program, then provide the supplies. We can construct about 15 to 16 tanks in a week‚Äôs time.

Q: Are you involved in any awareness campaigns around the island?

A: Yes, awareness is a very important aspect of our work. Although this concept is not new in Sri Lanka, it‚Äôs a traditional concept that has been around for centuries. So we have to remind ourselves that this is a possibility. And of course there are a lot of obstacles.

When people first see the tanks, they are not sure whether they are reliable. So, awareness is really important, and we have to do it from top-down and bottom-up. We meet with government agents, and they invite people from that district for an information session on the tanks. We also work at the household level to raise awareness.

When we visit a village, we don‚Äôt just dish out rainwater harvesting systems for everybody. We tell them what it is first, and ask them to apply for a system. They apply, and we pick who should get one based on our selection criteria. The criteria are based on a household‚Äôs access to water, and anybody who has to go beyond 250 metres to get their drinking water is eligible.

We emphasize helping women-headed households, especially in war-affected areas. We also look to help households that have a lot of children and those that have people with disabilities. Lately, we have targeted people with water-borne diseases, especially those in areas where many suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease.

Q: How have the outcomes been for the beneficiaries?

A: There is initially some reluctance to adapt it in new areas. Everybody wants pipe water supplies, but it isn‚Äôt possible for many places in Sri Lanka. If they can‚Äôt have water pipes, they want wells, but that‚Äôs not always possible.

Even if it was possible, water in the wells is not good for drinking. We have to convince them that this is another option, so we conduct tests with a few people in a village who are willing to have the system, and find out if they want their own systems. We have a huge demand after the tests.

Q: What do most people use harvested rainwater for?

A: They use it for anything you would use water for. But drinking is an especially important one, especially in areas where water is not of high quality. People in areas where there is a lot of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) generally drink rainwater.

But rainwater isn‚Äôt used for bathing and large-scale washing so much. They can use it during the rainy season for these purposes, but there‚Äôs not enough water during the dry season for bathing.

Q: How clean is rainwater?

A: Rainwater is the purest water. There are only a few places where there is acid rain, but this is limited to areas where there are coal power stations. So far, we don‚Äôt have a lot of problems with acid rain here. But in urban areas, where there is a lot of vehicle exhaust, the pH of rain can be a little low, say between 4.5 and 5.

In those areas, I wouldn‚Äôt promote rainwater for drinking, but you don‚Äôt need to harvest water in those areas because most of them have pipe water supplies. But any other uses, like toilet flushing, gardening, washing cars, you can use rainwater for.

In my opinion, it‚Äôs a crime to use pipe water for any of those purposes because, for instance, in gardening, you‚Äôre using chlorinated water, which is bad for plants and the country.

Q: Do you think this is the future of self-sufficient water management in Sri Lanka?

A: I hope so. Even if you have another water supply, whether it‚Äôs a pipe water or well water supply, having a rainwater harvesting system is not a loss. It‚Äôs only a gain, because you can use the water for anything.

NAIROBI, Kenya May 13 √¢?? 237 people have lost their lives due to floods as rains cause havoc across the country, according to official statistics.

The worst affected areas are around Lake Victoria, Lake Naivasha, Tana River, Nzoia River and parts of Central Kenya along tributaries that flow into Tana River from The Aberdares.

√¢??As of this (Wednesday) morning, Kenyans who have lost their lives due to floods are 237,√¢?¬ù said Eugene Wamalwa, the Devolution Cabinet Secretary, √¢??That is a very high number compared to those Kenyans who have lost their lives to COVID-19 who are about 33.√¢?¬ù

He said 161,000 households are also affected or displaced.

√¢??Meaning we have 807,000 Kenyans who are affected by these floods,√¢?¬ù he told a news conference in Nairobi. √¢??With rains going on and our dams filling (up), it means more will be affected. We are urging people in flood-prone areas, mudslide prone areas to move to higher grounds.√¢?¬ù

In recent weeks, security forces have been moving people out by force to higher grounds.

√¢??We are visiting all the affected areas, like in Lake Naivasha people around there have been affected but the worst affected is around Lake Victoria. We are assisting those affected with food and clean water and other basic necessities.√¢?¬ù

Intense monsoon activity is now likely to begin over central India and the western coast as IMD issued an alert to authorities to remain prepared for any emergencies.

The region covering eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, and Sikkim have been receiving very heavy and extremely heavy rain since June 26. According to IMD‚Äôs weekly weather report released on Wednesday, Assam received 104%, Meghalaya 141%, Sikkim 304%, and Bihar received 99% excess rain over the past week from June 24 onwards. The rain has triggered flooding in Assam, landslides in Sikkim, and created a flood-like situation in parts of Bihar.

IMD on Wednesday issued an orange alert for heavy to very heavy rains in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Konkan, Goa, central Maharashtra from Friday to Sunday. Orange alert implies that authorities should be prepared for any related emergencies.

National Weather Forecasting Centre head K Sathi Devi said the intensity of rain has reduced marginally over the northeast and eastern India but rain will continue for a few days. ‚ÄúIntense and widespread rains will start in central India including Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and parts of the west coast like Konkan, Goa and coastal Karnataka.‚Äù

Devi said weather stations in the northeast have been recording extremely heavy rains (over 20 cm) since last week. ‚ÄúThis was a result of orography [topography of mountains] and the moisture laden south-south westerly winds blowing over the region.‚Äù

The monsoon trough shifted to the north around June 26 with a convergence of strong southerly and south-westerly winds from Bay of Bengal over the northeast and eastern India. Now the trough is gradually moving back to its normal position.

IMD bulletin said a cyclonic circulation is lying over south Gujarat and another over eastern Uttar Pradesh and its neighbourhood in lower and mid-tropospheric levels. ‚ÄúUnder its influence, fairly widespread heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely along the west coast, Gujarat and interior Maharashtra during the next 5 days,‚Äù it said.

It added extremely heavy rain is also very likely over Konkan and Goa on Friday and Saturday and over Madhya Maharashtra on Saturday.

R K Jenamani, a senior IMD scientist, said there will be a high convergence of strong moist westerly and south-westerly winds from the Arabian sea very likely along western coast till Sunday and over northwestern plains and central India from Friday. ‚ÄúAll conditions are favourable for intense monsoon activity over the west coast and central India. Monsoon progression and rains have been very good so far.‚Äù

The country over the last month has received 15% excess rains. The monsoon accounts for 70% of India‚Äôs annual rainfall and is critical to the country‚Äôs agricultural sector. At least 700 million people are dependent on agriculture in India for their livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its population.",2020-07-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['west', 'eastern', 'intense', 'rain', 'heavy', 'pradesh', 'rains', 'central', 'coast', 'set', 'india', 'monsoon']",India,news article,English

The statement came on a day floodwaters continued to submerge 12 districts of the state, affecting 5.18 lakh people. Breach of embankments has been seen as one of the prime reasons for people‚Äôs suffering during this flood.

‚ÄúAltogether 5,18,623 people in 691 villages in 26 revenue circles of 12 districts ‚Äî Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Darrang, Barpeta, Nalbari, Chirang, Kokrajhar, Goalpara, Kamrup, Morigaon, Nagaon, and Jorhat ‚Äî have been affected by flood waters,‚Äù the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said in the evening. It added that water levels have shown a receding trend in all districts in the last 24 hours.‚Äù

While the overall flood situation improved in the state, heavy rain in Tinsukia district since Tuesday night brought back the threat of floods in the district‚Äôs low-lying and riverine rural areas and of waterlogging in the urban areas.

‚ÄúBecause of heavy rainfall in the past 24 hours, the Brahmaputra is showing a rising trend at Dholla, the Kundil at Chapakhowa, the Buri Dihing at Margherita, the Doomdooma at Doomdooma and the Tirap at Moulang,‚Äù an official at the Doomdooma subdivisional water resource office said in the evening.

‚ÄúThe Noa-Dehing is near the danger level at Chmoni,‚Äù Sudip Hazarika, a farmer of Sumoni Gaon, said.

The Brahmaputra is also flowing above the danger level at Neematighat in Jorhat and in Dhubri, the Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat and the Jia Bharali at NT Road crossing in Sonitpur.

Residents of Tinsukia town faced severe waterlogging on Wednesday, Digboi, Margherita, Doomdooma, Makum and Chapakhowa towns in the district were also affected.

The Goalpara water resources department is facing a tough time repairing embankments, damaged in over 15 places, as the ground water pours in with every dig of the spade, said assistant executive engineer Asad Hussain. No death due to floods has been reported in the past 24 hours. So far, 86 people have died in the floods.

Assam director-general of police Kuladhar Saikia contributed Rs 75 lakh to the Chief Minister‚Äôs Relief Fund on behalf of Assam police on Wednesday.

268,FF-2016-000062-IDN,The F√™te de la Musique survival guide - CNN Philippines,http://cnnphilippines.com/life/entertainment/music/2016/06/16/fete-de-la-musique-2016.html,"Manila (CNN Philippines Life) ‚Äî Sudden downpours, long MRT lines, and flash floods are all signals that summer is officially winding down ‚Äî and subsequently, this also means that music festival season is almost over.

As a last hurrah for the summer, the Alliance Fran√ßaise de Manila is celebrating its annual F√™te de la Musique in Manila on June 18 and 23. As in the past years, the lineup is almost as act-heavy as big music festivals like Coachella or Lollapalooza. Festivities start at 4 p.m. at the A-Venue open-parking main stage with the electronic musician BP Valenzuela and the experimental hip-hop/soul musician RH Xanders. Reese Lansangan will open the main stage in the Greenbelt 3 park at 4:30 p.m., and over a hundred acts will be performing at various pocket stages scattered around the Makati area. Admission is free to the festival, featuring performances from local and international musicians under genres that range from bedroom beats and Xperimental to grunge and electronica.

F√™te has always been the perfect opportunity to discover new music, which can make it tempting to go to all the stages. Though the venues do seem theoretically close to each other, having to go back and forth to catch your favorite bands could be tiring and pricey. With that in mind, CNN Philippines Life has come up with a solution to help you make the most of this year‚Äôs F√™te: a nifty little guide featuring festival essentials, a list of the stages that are close to each other, and quick tips.

Prep the essentials

Sure, Makati is dotted with 7-Elevens around every corner, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to over-prepare maybe just a little. For F√™te, it would be best to pack a light bag, dress comfortably, and do away with whatever you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll actually end up using for the day. Keep it practical: Bring your phone, a power bank (or even just your charger, because you never know where there could be plugs), tissues or wipes, hand sanitizer, an umbrella, and maybe a change of clothes. You can also opt to bring water and snacks, and even a book or something else to pass the time with in case you find yourself in the middle of a long wait. Bring emergency cash and spare change for commuting.

Make a checklist for artists and stages you want to see, and pay attention to schedules and venues, and how far apart they are. (More on that below.) Research routes for commutes to save cash on cab rides. If you‚Äôre bringing friends ‚Äî definitely advisable for the festival! ‚Äî write down their numbers just in case. A legal ID might also be wise to keep with you, as some places may want to check for them.

Game plan

There are 21 pocket stages situated around the Makati area. The diverse lineup features everyone from Pupil to up-and-coming indie bands like Oh, Flamingo! In the list below, grouped are the stages that are close to each other.

Jazz Stage at Sage Bar, Shangri-La Makati*

Bedroom Beats Stage at The Belle & Dragon*, starts at 4 p.m.

Acoustic Stage at A Space

Hiphop Stage at M Cafe*

Blues-Soul-Funk Stage at H&J Sports Bar and Restaurant*

Blues Rock Stage at Le Cafe Curieux*

Eclectic and Art Stage at Lokal Hostel

Evolution of RnB Stage at Z Hostel

Mod Stage at Alchemy Bistro Bar*

Xperimental/Folk Stage at Pineapple Lab

Reggae Stage at B-Side, The Collective

Punk Stage at Mang Rudy‚Äôs Tuna Grill and Papaitan*

Grunge Stage at Aloha Bar & Grill, The Collective*

World Stage at The Cabin Bar & Bistro*

Electronica Stage at Time

Fusion Stage at Century City Mall (4th Floor)

Rock Stage at Green Sun (The Eye)

Indie stage at Green Sun (Axon)

Food will be sold at the SOMA Bistro

Stages that are outliers are: F*K Stage at Finders Keepers*; House Party Stage at Black Market, which starts at 10 p.m.; and Open Mic & Spoken Word Stage at Acceler8.

*Marked places serve food.

Here‚Äôs a map to illustrate which places are closest to one another.

Make the most of it

F√™te de la Musique is a free event, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can take it for granted. It brings together hundreds of artists from all over the world to celebrate music, even if they‚Äôre not well-known or they seem out of the ordinary, playing music that doesn‚Äôt cater to certain tastes.

There are three rules of thumb, then, to make sure you get the best that the festival has to offer: Go out of your comfort zone, check out at least one new band or type of music that you‚Äôve never heard before, and don‚Äôt just stay in one place. Going back and forth to catch certain acts and sets may be tiring, but you just never know what you‚Äôll miss. Plus, it‚Äôs the weekend ‚Äî for just a few hours, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to pretend that you‚Äôve got all the time in the world.

F√™te de la Musique Philippines will be held on June 18 across Makati City, and on June 23 in Puerto Real Gardens, Intramuros.

700,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Kotoko's Akonnor recommended for Ghana coaching job as Appiah's future hangs in the balance - Goal.com,https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/kotokos-akonnor-recommended-for-ghana-coaching-job-as/1pg3qmj66jltg12x2gnl2o2izb,"Kotoko's Akonnor recommended for Ghana coaching job as Appiah's future hangs in the balance

The former Black Stars skipper has been proposed as a possible replacement for the current national team coach

Ex-Ghana international Joe Addo has backed former Asante Kotoko head coach and current technical director Charles 'CK' Akonnor for the Black Stars' coaching job.

The future of coach James Appiah remains in doubt following the Stars' disappointing showing at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt.

On their 22nd appearance at the continental gathering, Ghana failed to progress past the Round of 16, for the first time since 2006.

‚ÄúIf he [Akonnor] becomes the Black Stars coach he will be great,"" Addo was reported to have said in The Finder.

""He is my friend and I will always push for it. For now, we have to wait until a decision is taken on Appiah or if he decides not to continue anymore.

""Having said that I think C.K has done very well on the local scene. He has played for the national team and captained a foreign team as well.

""He has all the experience but we have a coach now so anything I say will not be appropriate but if there is a change then yes Akonnor will be perfect.‚Äù

Akonnor's future at Kotoko remains bleak following his re-assignment from head coach to technical director.

Reports say the former Ghana international is unhappy by the decision of the Porcupines' management and could be headed for the exit.

The former Dreams FC and Ashanti Gold boss led Kotoko to win the Ghana Special Competition in June after guiding the team to the group stage of the Caf Confederation Cup last season.

Our editors‚Äô weekly take on humanitarian news, trends, and developments from around the globe.

On our radar

Israel-Palestine toll grows as war looms

The intensity of what could turn into a fully-fledged war between Israel and Hamas and its allies in Gaza is ramping up so quickly that much is likely to change by the time you read this. At the time of publication, 119 people had reportedly been killed by Israeli bombs in Gaza, and eight inside Israel by rockets fired from the occupied Palestinian territory that is home to around two million people, who are for the most part unable to leave because of severe restrictions on movement by Israel and Egypt. The death toll is likely to rise, and cities and towns inside Israel that are home to both Jewish and Palestinian Israeli citizens have also seen outbreaks of intercommunal violence. Synagogues were set on fire in the city of Lod, and live TV showed a mob of far-right Israelis in Bat Yam dragging a man they believed to be Arab from his car, beating him bloody. The roots of what‚Äôs happening now clearly go far deeper than the rising tensions over the past few weeks, but we suggest you read this for the recent background on the deadly flare-up.

WHO accused of covering up sex abuse claims

The World Health Organization has been accused of covering up sex abuse claims against its workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the Ebola outbreak between 2018 and 2020. The WHO knew about allegations against one of its senior doctors during the Ebola crisis ‚Äì a doctor with close ties to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus ‚Äì but denied knowledge of the claims, according to The Associated Press, which obtained private emails, legal documents, and recordings of internal meetings. Another doctor allegedly tried to pay off a woman he impregnated. Neither of the men were disciplined, according to the AP. The New Humanitarian and the Thomson Reuters Foundation first broke the story last year about widespread aid worker sex abuse in Congo. This week, we published a second investigation with new claims of aid worker sex abuse during the Ebola outbreak. In total, 44 of the 73 women we interviewed accused men who said they worked for the WHO. Among the new claims: a woman who said she was raped by a WHO worker, and another woman who was allegedly lured into a sex-for-work scheme and died after a botched abortion.

Madagascar drought drives severe hunger

Southern Madagascar is facing its worst drought in 40 years, threatening more than a million people with severe hunger. The region received half of its usual rains during the October planting season and up to 60 percent of the coming harvest is expected to be lost. This is the third consecutive year of drought, and two in every five people are now ‚Äúseverely food insecure‚Äù, with nearly 14,000 people facing ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù levels of starvation ‚Äì the first time such a degree of hunger has been recorded in the country. In the worst-affected district of Amboasary Atsimo, global acute malnutrition is an alarming 27 percent, a rate at which irreversible damage is caused to children. ‚ÄúThe children are starving, some are dying,‚Äù said Amer Daoudi, a senior World Food Programme official. ‚ÄúWe are already witnessing the abandonment of entire villages.‚Äù COVID-19 lockdowns have limited the ability of rural people to find work, and ‚Äì with transport routes and delivery chains interrupted ‚Äì food prices have risen. Needs are expected to deepen, with a prolonged and severe lean season forecast, starting in October.

No end to deadly demonstrations in Colombia

More than three weeks after nationwide protests began in Colombia, the political unrest shows little sign of abating. In Cali, the epicentre of the demonstrations, a power void as the strife took hold of the city has led to armed civilians fighting each other amid gasoline and food shortages. In recent days, ‚Äúhumanitarian corridors‚Äù have been set up to allow in some food supplies and medicine. On 10 May, President Iv√°n Duque travelled to Cali to meet demonstration leaders upset with rising poverty, inequality, and state neglect ‚Äì worsened by the pandemic. But talks ended without any agreement on how to end the deadlock. Marchers have expanded their demands to include healthcare reforms and an end to police brutality. Human rights groups say the police are responsible for most of the 42 protest-related deaths so far. Accusations of excessive force by the Colombian police, more used to fighting armed groups , further undermine its ability to take on the gangs and guerrillas that have expanded their control in much of the countryside five years after a widely praised peace deal.

Afghanistan‚Äôs school killings and a legacy of impunity

In a country tangled in decades of war, the 8 May bomb blasts outside a Kabul school were particularly shocking for who they appeared to target: children. It came a year after an attack on a maternity ward in the same community ‚Äì where gunmen killed at least 24 people, including women in labour ‚Äì provoked similar revulsion and pushed M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res to end its work at the hospital. An interview published by MSF this week underscores how little accountability there is for such atrocities. The Afghan government promised to investigate the May 2020 attack, but even a year later there are no answers. The ‚Äùmost likely hypothesis‚Äù from MSF‚Äôs own inquiry landed on members of a group affiliated with so-called Islamic State, said Dr Isabelle Defourny, MSF‚Äôs operations director. Many Afghans see impunity as the barrier to peace and justice. It‚Äôs why groups like the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission called for ‚Äúreparations and documentation‚Äù, along with a UN-backed inquiry, following this month‚Äôs violence. The MSF interview also shows the dilemmas aid groups confront, with civilian casualties rising and international forces set to withdraw by September. A year after the hospital massacre, MSF hasn‚Äôt resumed its operations there. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt work in an environment where patients and medical staff are targeted, and where we can‚Äôt prevent such a massacre from happening again,‚Äù Defourny said.

Weekend read

The UK government‚Äôs plan to overhaul the country‚Äôs asylum system has drawn the ire of UNHCR. The UN‚Äôs refugee agency and other migration experts say it goes against the 1951 Refugee Convention and global protection ethics. UK Interior Minister Priti Patel says the plan will prioritise asylum seekers who arrive through legal channels while creating barriers for those who arrive irregularly. Rights groups and asylum advocates disagree. To them, the approach cashes in on public fears of a migration crisis to build a restrictive asylum system that would exclude many who need help. A review was needed, given the UK‚Äôs withdrawal from the EU, but the new rules could make migration even riskier than it already is, especially for women and children who don‚Äôt qualify for support. With EU governments refusing to sign bilateral return agreements, migrants who arrive in the UK and don‚Äôt qualify for asylum are in danger of being ‚Äúwarehoused in deeply inappropriate, inhumane facilities‚Äù, one civil society actor told The New Humanitarian. This comes amid rising numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach the UK as EU policies grow more hostile; nearly 8,500 crossed by boat from France in 2020, more than four times the number in 2019.

And finally‚Ä¶

Decolonising research

Foreign researchers in humanitarian settings have too often swooped in and conducted extractive studies without meaningful local involvement, according to a new briefing paper and related webinar. The paper says the academic world should properly regulate so-called ‚ÄúParasitic Swallows'', as such temporary visitors can ‚Äúdo harm, retraumatising participants, and preventing them from evolving their identity‚Äù. Research ‚Äúco-production‚Äù ‚Äì involving the community as well as academics and NGOs in the entire process ‚Äì offers a healthier model, according to a paper published by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.",2021-05-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['cheat', 'severe', 'asylum', 'food', 'sheet', 'groups', 'sex', 'end', 'strikes', 'hunger', 'humanitarian', 'coverup', 'madagascar', 'rising', 'claims', 'israel', 'uk', 'gaza']",Somalia,news article,English
1597,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Collaborative Call to Mitigate Flooding - THISDAY Newspapers,https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/04/26/collaborative-call-to-mitigate-flooding/,"Udora Orizu writes that the widespread destruction and loss of lives caused by flooding in 2020, calls for all hands on deck by all tiers of government to put in place structures and adhere to warnings issued by flood monitoring agencies ahead of the next flooding season

September 12, 2020, around 8:00pm, residents of Alapere area of Lagos State, raised alarm as another flooding tragedy struck. Two yet-to-be-identified children were swept away as people battled flood after a heavy rainfall that lasted for hours and led to destruction of properties.

This is just one of the horrific, heart-wrenching experiences Nigerians go through, following havoc wreaked by floods every year. Yet nothing is done by stakeholders to ameliorate the disaster.

Nigeria with a population of over 200 million people, faces numerous natural disasters, with flooding being the most common. Most states in the country are increasingly suffering from annual flooding during the rainy seasons. However unlike some natural disasters, rainfall flooding can be controlled with proper planning and the provision of necessary infrastructure.

Flooding in Nigeria is usually caused by climate change, river overflowing, dam opening, current poor urban planning practices, poor drainage systems that cant cope and so on. In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the neighboring states.

Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals. The immediate impact of it include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases. These were seen recurring this year, in various states of the federation.

Havoc in Some States

In a report on October last year, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods since September have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across 22 states in Nigeria. Furthermore, around 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people were reported to be displaced.

According to the Red Cross, the overflowing Benue and Niger rivers caused severe floods in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara States from October 6, affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. At least 57 people died, 473 were injured and 22,357 displaced. Flooding was also reported in southern parts of the country, Bayelsa, Anambra, Rivers and Delta States, were affected and fatalities reported.

One of the most devastating impact of floods was seen in Kebbi State. The flood swept away villages and peoples, displacing families and destroyed about 90 per cent of crops, putting the countrys food security at risk. Over 30 lives were lost, hundreds of houses destroyed and thousands of residents displaced by the devastating flood that sacked communities in the state.

The losses incurred by the farmers, particularly rice farmers in Kebbi State were colossal and immeasurable , they run into billions of naira . Thousands of hectares of fadama rice farms in the state were affected by the flood. Rice farms , other agricultural crops, livestock and even communities were not spared by the raging floods.

Chairman of the State Emergency Management Authority (KSEMA), Alhaji Sani Dododo, revealed that five different bridges had been washed away across the state.

The Birnin-Kebbi-Makera-Kangiwa road, an international highway, which runs from the state capital to Niger Republic, is at the risk of caving in at Duku. Some of the minor bridges and culverts along the highway are already caving in, following erosion caused by rising water overflowing the nearby River Rima.

Also, the Bagudo-Tuga-Kaoje route, which leads to Benin Republic border, including the Tuga Bridge, is also submerged, cutting border communities. Dododo, who confirmed the number of deaths recorded so far, said 10 people died in a boat that capsized at Ihiru in Jega Local Government.

Only eight bodies have so far been recovered; a family of six  father, mother and children were wiped away in Arewa council area. We recorded one death in Yauri, among others. The numbers may increase, since we are experiencing rainfall daily. In Bagudo council area is the worst hit by the flooding, as it was learnt that 98 per cent of the villages were affected.

In Iwaro Oka community of Akoko South West Local Government area, Ondo State

a middle-aged man was swept away by flood. Sources said the motorcycle of the farmer, identified as Akede, was seen inside the river very close to a popular filling station, which made people aware that the farmer was missing. Family members were thrown into mourning when all efforts to find him proved abortive. His body was later recovered in a river very close to St Patricks College, Iwaro Oka.

In Lokoja, Kogi State, the road linking Kogi East and Eastern Nigeria to the state capital was flooded for days as canoe and boats were employed to navigate the roads which is meant for cars and other road users.

In Niger State, officials of the state government visited communities submerged by flood to ascertain the extent of damage and to enable government render assistance to victims.

In Kano State, the Kano Emergency Management Agency confirmed four persons killed and over 5,200 houses destroyed due to flooding in Rogo and Danbatta Local Government Areas of the state. He disclosed that two persons lost their lives and 200 houses destroyed in Rogo, while two other persons and over 5,000 houses were destroyed by flood in Danbatta.

Also the South-south and South-east were wreaked by flood havoc. South-south states like Delta had over 150 houses submerged by flood. In South-east, Anambra for instance, over 5,000 persons have been displaced by flood that submerged houses, schools and churches in the Ogbaru Local Government Area. The Chairman of the council, Arinze Awaogu, said about 1,000 of the displaced persons were being catered for at Internally Displaced Persons camps in the area, while many others trapped in their communities needed evacuation.

He said, Over 5,000 families have been displaced, while churches, schools and many residential houses have been submerged by flood, with farm crops destroyed and displaced persons seeking refuge in Onitsha and surrounding communities. At the moment, we are housing over 1,000 IDPs; we have over 5,000 persons who have been displaced; some are taking refuge in the residences of their relatives, who live upland, including Onitsha. We need the Federal Governments assistance in the areas of donation of food items, non-food items, medical supplies, establishment of sick bays and sending enough medical personnel to help in handling the situation; our fear now is that of a possible outbreak of epidemic.

Earlier in the year, heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

In Abuja, four Area Councils, Bwari, Gwagwalada, Abaji and Kwali which are prone to flood were affected by the disaster with Gwagwala being the worst hit in July as eight lives were lost, over 100 houses submerged and properties destroyed. On July 25, after a heavy downpour which lasted for hours, five residents were swept away and several houses and cars destroyed in Gwagwalada, Dawaki, Giri and Zuba where the flood cut the bridge linking Ikwa, Yimi and other villages.

The incidence was confirmed by the Director General of FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Idris Abbas who had said there was a building collapse in Dawaki as a result of the flood. Gwagwalada is flooded from Giri. A family of five were flooded at Giri.

We got one body and still searching for four. We rescued six people and are in the hospital. The flood has damaged a lot of houses and property, especially at Gwagwalada. The residents are still saying some are missing but they cannot give us the identities of such persons who they claim to be missing. People should be careful when it is raining. They should not drive on water. They should not build on flood plain. They must respect the master plan of FCT and ensure that all drainages are clean. What happened in Giri-Gota was because people built on flood plain, he said

Federal Lawmakers Laments

Back in September, the Kebbi State Caucus in the House of Representatives while commiserating with the government and people of the state on the recent flood disaster that ravaged the entire state, said the disaster is a major setback to the federal government effort to boost local rice production as part of measures to end rice importation.

The Chairman, Hon. Muhammad Jega, representing Gwandu/Aliero/Jega federal constituency, lamented that the disaster could not have come at a worse time for the farmers who were looking forward to a bumper harvest this year to reduce the rising cost of food items.

The lawmaker, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari and the state Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, for the prompt response to reduce the hardship caused by the flood, also urged them to as a matter of urgency send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state.

Jega further urged the federal government to commission a study with the aim of providing a lasting solution to the perennial flood disaster in the state.

According to him, The flood is a serious setback towards addressing food security in the country; the government, therefore, needs to address the shortfall of the food supply chain to reduce the hardship and cost of food items in the market, and also address the severe environmental degradation caused by the flood. This may include adequate and early preparation for dry-season farming and reconstruction of major infrastructures affected in the state.

The estimated cost of the disaster is over N10 billion across the state. We call on the federal government as a matter of urgency to send relief materials to alleviate the suffering of the people in the state, as early preparation for dry season farming should commence in earnest with provision of seedlings, fertilizer and other inputs to be made available to the farmers in good time.

Also, a member of the House of Representatives, representing Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency of Delta State, Hon. Ossai Nicholas Ossai, decried the submerging of over 150 houses in Delta State, by devastating floods.

He said that since past two weeks, the Ndokwa East Communities of Delta State have been bedeviled by constant and frightening heavy downpour, being accompanied by excessive flooding and erosion, that is seriously and presently wreaking havoc in the Communities.

According to him, the affected communities are; Ossissa, Onyah, Ase, Ushie, Ibedeni; Asagba, Aballa-Uno, Agballa-Obodo, AgballaOshimili, Uchi, Okpai, Onuaboh, Inyi, Benekuku, Aboh, Onyah, Asaba-Ase, Ibrede, Ashaka, Afor, Abalagda, Umuolu, Igbuku, Obettim, Obodo-Okolafa, Iyadama,0nuogboko, UtagbaOgbe, Utagba-Uno, Ogume, Onitsha-Ukwuani, Akarri, Umuolu, just to mention a few.

He said he was disturbed that schools, farmlands, health centres, places of worship have seriously been affected and over 150 households has been rendered homeless particularly children and women and more is still being affected daily. About 90per cent of the ommunities in the entire Ndokwa East Local Government Area has been submerged,and worse still is the deplorable economic conditions of the peasant farmers in these agrarian communities.

He observed that these communities are often prone to serious environmental disaster as a result of vulnerability of constant coastal flooding and erosion from the River Niger.

The legislator, pleaded with the Federal Governnment, to Direct the Ecological Fund office to conduct an environmental survey with a view to addressing the excessive flooding in these Ndokwa Communities and urge the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to urgently provide relief materials for the Hood victims in accordance with section 6 of NEMA Act.

NIHSA Flood Alerts

In February, the Director General of Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), Clement Nze, alerted the government, stakeholders and all citizens to use this period of dry season to prepare ahead for 2021 flooding.

Nze lamented that Nigeria currently doesnt have enough dams, saying more dams would help to mitigate floods.

He explained that with the increasing global population and the expanding activities of man, flooding would continue to persist, hence the need to control human activities, environmental adjustment and purposefully adopting actions in certain areas that would make adjustment possible.

According to him, Flooding problem is a global environmental issue which is faced by many countries worldwide, particularly in areas close to low lying terrains and river valleys. Over the past years, there have been increasing concerns that human actions and natural catastrophes have been adversely impacting the environment, posing serious ecological and environmental hazards.

Though flood is a natural environmental phenomenon, it can be greatly accelerated by human-induced activities as it is the case worldwide. Some floods may result in major disasters involving structural and erosion damages, disruption of socio-economic activities, loss of lives and properties, displacement of people, destruction of agricultural land and contamination of water and environment in general.

The director general said this is the appropriate time to construct drainages where they are necessary (but not provided), dredge river channels, clear blocked gutters and drainages, and pull down structures that are within the floodplains and flood paths.

There is a reasonable time to do that before the rains set in. According to the 2020 Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public recently by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), February 24 and June 22 are the predicted onset of rainfall in the South-south and Northern states respectively, while the respective predicted cessation dates are December 28th and September 26th. This implies that Nigeria is likely to experience longer period of rainy season in 2020 compared to year 2019, he added.

Again, in September, the agency warned members of the public to expect more floods in the months of September and October.

Nze, gave the warning at a press briefing in Abuja, saying that the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country.

Nze explained that any release of excess water from the dams in countries upstream Rivers Niger and Benue this year would have more negative impacts on Nigeria, which is located downstream of countries in the Niger Basin.

He identified the highly vulnerable states as Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa.

He said that the flood that ravaged Kebbi State just about a week ago left so many damages and noted that the current flooding situation called for vigilance on the part of all the stakeholders.

The director general called the states and local governments as well as multi-national companies and public-spirited individuals to join hands to save the country from the consequences of twin pandemic (COVID-19 and flood) in the year 2020.

Nze warned: The rains are finally here. The volume of river flows on our river is surging and river channels could no longer accommodate significant runoff as floodplains, which traditionally serve the alluvial plains and are rich in agricultural productivity, lost its retention capacity to give way to flooding of adjacent lands.

Farmlands and crop yields are being lost to furry of floodwaters, livestock and ecosystem species are diminishing while hope for livelihood hang in the balance due to monumental economic losses.

As a matter of fact, all the states of the federation have suffered several degrees of flooding since June 2020. The danger is not yet over. Information received from the regional Niger Basin Authority (NBA) by NIHSA, has it that as at 7.30am today September 10, 2020, the River Niger flood level in Niamey, Niger Republic, attained an unprecedented level of 7.02m (702cm). This is a far cry from the value of 6.60m which I reported in my last press briefing of August 25, 2020.

Noting that the Red Alert Warning Zone in Niamey is 6.20m and above, the current flood level sighted in Niamey poses a dangerous threat to the country, Nigeria, which is at the Lower portion of Niger Basin within this month of September and October.

Based on the report of the expected flood coming down from Niamey and the projected contributions by the inland rivers, both Kainji and Jebbo Dams built on River Niger have continued to spill water downstream. The Shiroro Dam on River Koduno, with reservoir level at 381.48m as at 9.00am today, has been maintaining a regulated spilling into the River Niger. The effect of all these is that the communities in the states adjoining River Niger will continue to be highly inundated by River Flooding as is being witnessed in the recent time.

Recently, The DG of NIHSA, briefing the press on March 24, 2021, again advised the three tiers of government and citizens across the country to prepare against impending devastating floods in 2021.

Nze, who gave the advice at a press conference in Abuja, said this was because Nigeria was at the receiving end of disastrous floods among the nine countries of the River Niger Basin.

He said, There is still time for states/LGAs (Local Government Areas) and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

As the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin which covers nine countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote DIvoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season with its attendant flood incidents.

He also advised Nigerians residing at waterways to relocate to safe areas before the peak of the rains, just as warned that Nigerians have about three months to prepare against the disastrous effects of flood.

He explained that the countrys geographical location is downstream of all the countries in the Basin, making it to be at the receiving end of disastrous flood and pollutions from all the countries upstream.

The DG lamented that relevant authorities are frustrating the effort of the Federal Government by neglecting the predictions, as could be seen in the results of last years damages.

Nze while urging the general public to take necessary measures to prevent the ugly flooding menace of the past years, noted that there is still time for stakeholders to take steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.

Expectations from Stakeholders

In the last few months, President Muhammadu Buhari has been sending solidarity messages to some states affected by flood disasters with promises of federal aid. The president authorised needed assistance to 12 states worst affected by the seasonal rains. The states are: Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Edo, Anambra, Delta, Kano, Jigawa, Rivers, Bayelsa and Adamawa.

However, flooding in various state has become a recurring decimal for decades, all tiers of government are expected to put all hands on deck and come up with a permanent solution. Flood is a natural disaster, but lack of preparedness is a man-made disaster.

As Nigeria is months away till the next rainy season, stakeholders have ample time to do the needful and heed to flood warnings by various monitoring agencies in order to avert another impending tragedy.

One of the main strategies as stated by NIHSA is that, the 36 States and the FCT authority should create retention basins for harvesting flood waters downstream of major rivers where there is scarcity of groundwater thereby using the flood waters for possible groundwater recharge and other uses. By so doing, the fresh flood water will not be lost to the sea to become saline water.

The agency is also urging state governments to pull down structures built on flood plains and expand the drainages for easy flow of water as one of the strategies mapped out.

A total of 125 bodies had been recovered as of noon Thursday, most of which are male. The rescue work is underway, but it's difficult to carry out search work at the scene as large equipment couldn't be used for rescue operations there, said a police officer on the ground.

""All of the casualties are local jade scavengers and the rescue operations are being suspended as the situation is quite dangerous,"" the official detailed.

The miners were collecting stones when a ""muddy wave"" caused by heavy rain buried them, the fire service said in a Facebook post.

Caused by monsoon rains, the landslides occurred at a jade mining site in Sate Mu village tract of Hpakant township at 08:00 a.m. local time, according to a release from the Fire Services Department.",2020-07-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['death', 'village', 'myanmar', 'used', 'rescue', 'toll', 'operations', 'department', 'jade', 'according', 'collapse', '166', 'wave', 'local', 'rises', 'work']",India,news article,English

Sharaqy stated during a Zoom meeting with African journalists that Egypt has been trying to reach an agreement between itself, Ethiopia, and Sudan for a full decade now with help from the African Union, and the matter has been brought forth to the United Nations Security Council.

Sharaqy also discussed during the meeting Sudan‚Äôs flood crisis that began in July and left much of the country in complete disaster.

He asserted a list of recommendations to Sudan to confront the catastrophe, at the top of which is the country‚Äôs need for an emergency rapid relief plan to help the country through its annual flood season.

The need for Egyptian-Sudanese cooperation to implement water projects in Sudan also ranked high on the list.

Additionally, Sharaqy recommended organizing urban and agricultural expansion in relation to waterways in Sudan, and avoiding building close to the Nile.

He stressed the need to construct a number of small dams along the Nile and modernize existing ones in accordance with global engineering standards.

Sudan‚Äôs devastating floods began when continuous heavy rainfall caused the Nile River to reach its highest level in over a century.

The country‚Äôs flood crisis has left 102 people dead, dozens injured, and over 100,000 homes destroyed.

Egypt‚Äôs Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources announced in late August that negotiations on the GERD have once again stalled, due to continued disagreements between Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan on legal and technical points.

Egypt, which relies considerably on freshwater from the Nile, has voiced fears that the GERD would negatively impact the country‚Äôs water supply, and has insisted that measures be put in place to protect downstream countries in case of drought during the dam‚Äôs filling process.

Ethiopia, on the other hand, has stressed the importance of the project to bolster its economy, where more than half of the population currently lives without access to electricity.

Sudan is somewhat caught in the middle of the conflicting interests of Egypt and Ethiopia. There is potential for the country to develop further with the GERD‚Äôs operation, but government officials worry that it could also threaten preexisting dams.

A meeting between the water ministers from the three countries on August 28 did not result in a unified draft proposal to be presented to the African Union bureau, headed by South Africa.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

Over 3,700 UNFPA Dignity Kits worth $180,000 would be provided to the elderly in central Vietnam following a series of storms and tropical depressions that hit the region last year.

Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) representative in Vietnam, handed over 3,704 kits containing essential items to Bui Quang Huy, standing secretary of the HCMC Communist Youth Union, to support the elderly in three central Vietnam provinces afflicted by floods last year: Ha Tinh, Quang Tri and Quang Ngai at a Wednesday ceremony.

Dignity Kits are a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, mitigate the risk of gender-based violence, and respond to and protect the dignity of women and girls adversely affected by a crisis. Kits meant for the elderly contain items like hand towels, sweaters, socks, wet tissues, toothbrushes, soap, underwear, blankets, flashlights and whistles.

The handover was made possible via financial contributions from U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), according to a UNFPA press release.

The elderly are among the most vulnerable when natural disasters strike, according to UNFPA. During floods and landslides in central Vietnam last year, health facilities were hard hit, causing routine public health programs to be disrupted, it added. The elderly are at risk since they do not always get the care they need, and their vulnerabilities can become a serious challenge to survival and wellbeing, it stated.

Last year, central Vietnam was struck by a series of storms and tropical depressions, triggering heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Over 200 people were killed and property losses amounted to around VND30 trillion ($1.3 trillion). Hundreds of thousands of homes were either destroyed or damaged, affecting the lives of at least 7.7 million residents.

The Vietnamese government has provided around VND770 billion to the region as emergency relief.

1980,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Valley volunteer heads to Kenya to save 9 giraffes - 12news.com KPNX,https://www.12news.com/article/life/animals/valley-volunteer-heads-to-kenya-to-save-nine-giraffes/75-2c4e7282-5f00-4894-91b2-b3f6b0ed6987,"As flood waters have cut nine Rothchild's Giraffes from their herd and food sources, volunteers and a nonprofit are headed overseas to help.

LITCHFIELD PARK, Ariz. √¢?? A Valley wildlife conservationist is joining the effort to save stranded giraffes in Kenya, as flood waters cut them off from their herd and available food sources.

Kristy Morcom, who works with Wildlife World Zoo, Aquarium and Safari Park in Litchfield Park, will be making the trek overseas to do what she can to help save the giraffes.

Save Giraffes Now, a nonprofit organization, is leading the effort. Nine Rothchild√¢??s giraffes were originally introduced to a peninsula on Lake Baringo, which is their ancestral land.

√¢??By reintroducing them into the peninsula they can be safe from poachers there. It√¢??s easier to protect them on a peninsula,√¢?¬ù said David O√¢??Conner, president of Save Giraffes Now.

√¢??But unfortunately, the lake had other ideas and it rose about 40 or 50 feet, creating the island that they are trapped on now.√¢?¬ù

The question became, how do you get the world√¢??s tallest animal across a body of water? The answer: A gir-raft. That√¢??s what Save Giraffes Now is calling the barge that is moving the giraffes, one-by-one, from the flooded peninsula to a sanctuary in the Eastern Rift valley of Kenya.

But getting the giraffes on the barge became an issue. Some would willingly follow volunteers using Acai seeds as a bribe. Others were a little more stubborn. That√¢??s where Morcom comes in.

√¢??I am just going to be taking direction from David and his team and do whatever I can to support them,√¢?¬ù said Morcom.

√¢??We have to try to train them go to voluntarily on the barge and that√¢??s where people like yourself has so much more experience than I do,√¢?¬ù said O√¢??Connor to Morcom. √¢??It√¢??s a real great partnership.√¢?¬ù

The hopes are that anything Morcom and the folks she works with at Wildlife World Zoo have learned from the Reticulated giraffes, she can use in handling the Rothchild√¢??s in the wild.

√¢??It√¢??s really wonderful when you can take information collected from these animals under human care and apply that to saving their wild counterparts,√¢?¬ù said Morcom.

Over the past 30 years, giraffes around the world have seen their population drop by roughly 40%, according to Save the Giraffes.

While organizing an international effort to save just nine giraffes may not seem like a worthwhile cause to those who are only casually familiar with giraffes, the nine that are stranded make up more than 1% of a population that is quickly and quietly on its way to extinction.

√¢??Everyone knows what a giraffe is, but a lot of people don√¢??t realize the dire need that they√¢??re in because of their number rapidly decreasing,√¢?¬ù explained Morcom.

Saving the nine Rothchilds is just the first step in Save Giraffes Now√¢??s plan. Once all nine are safe, they will be reintroduced to an appropriate habitat on or near their ancestral lands and begin repopulating and increasing the number..",2021-03-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['thats', 'morcom', 'rothchilds', 'park', 'volunteer', 'save', 'peninsula', 'world', 'valley', 'kenya', 'wildlife', 'effort', 'heads', 'giraffes']",Kenya,news article,English
92,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Passion: Your secret weapon for job search success - ScienceCareers.org,https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2015/10/passion-your-secret-weapon-job-search-success,"Think about what lies at the root of your interest in a science career. Why did you get into science in the first place‚Äîyou know, back in your early days? Was it the promise of a big-time salary? Probably not. Science careers have never been touted as a sure-fire way to earn big-time compensation, and salary rarely comes up as a top selection factor for students deciding their future careers. Was it the prestige of an academic appointment at a distinguished university? I doubt it. Perhaps you reflected upon your academic adviser‚Äôs cool job as a professor. That, however, probably wasn‚Äôt at the root of your interest in science; you discovered it later on, as you were being mentored in the lab. I suspect that neither salary nor prestige were likely to have been a driving force behind your initial motivation to be a scientist.

It‚Äôs my guess that, as a young person, you imagined yourself using your abilities in math or science to solve a problem‚Äîperhaps to cure a disease or advance the state of knowledge in an area that interested you. And it was this interest‚Äîthis passion‚Äîthat drove you into science and kept you motivated through the many years it took to advance your education and career to where they are today.

When asked to talk about your science, show the real you.

It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the element of passion when you think about all the things that an employer is looking for. After all, read the job ad and you‚Äôll see six to eight ‚Äúmust have‚Äù skills and qualities that the employer considers essential, but passion won‚Äôt be listed. Even so, it‚Äôs the one factor you won‚Äôt get very far without.

Passion at the heart of career success

Our executive and scientific search practice operates with two parallel business tracks: pharmaceutical sciences and agricultural sciences. You can imagine just by the nature of the work in these two fields how difficult it is to cross boundaries: People with advanced pharma careers don‚Äôt easily move over to the agriculture business, and vice versa. But despite these two tracks being completely separate, two recent rounds of interviews for clients on either side of this divide helped me recognize what a successful Indian plant breeder has in common with an equally first-rate American cell biologist: The passion they have for what they do still drives their career success a decade after leaving the academic lab.

When I asked Rajesh, the plant breeder, the ‚Äúwhat got you into this field‚Äù question, he told me about the role agriculture played in his childhood. ‚ÄúI was raised on a very small farm, by parents who dedicated their lives to each harvest, one that barely put us at a level above subsistence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe were growing pearl millet. It was tough, especially as the ground was difficult, the weather unpredictable, and the crops suffered disease regularly due to drought or insects. The big seed companies had no interest in these poor man‚Äôs crops, but I knew that science could have an impact on our lives by solving these plant problems through breeding and biotechnology.‚Äù I could tell that every one of Rajesh‚Äôs career decisions had been a result of his passion to make lives better at home. And as Chris, our human resources contact at this agricultural research client, says, ‚ÄúThe better candidates all have this passion; it is what lies at the heart of 99% of our successful hires.‚Äù

After my meeting with Rajesh, who impressed me and is now in line to do the same with my client, I met Susan, a cell biologist whose career in science has been driven just as surely by passion as Rajesh‚Äôs was. ‚ÄúI was always fascinated by science,‚Äù she said when I asked her why she went into biology. ‚ÄúI was an avid science fiction reader, and did rather well in early science and math classes. But it wasn‚Äôt until my favorite aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer that I got the bug to make science my life and passion. I knew that someday someone would find a cure, and I wanted so much to be that person. My career goals originate entirely from the way I felt about my aunt.‚Äù

Of course, not everyone‚Äôs interest in science is due to an intensely personal reason, but a successful response to an interviewer‚Äôs question about motivation simply needs to recall the emotions, and the reasoning, behind your decision. What I particularly respect when I ask this question is candor and the interviewee‚Äôs ability to express emotion. No made-up interviewing BS, please!

Tapping into your passion

If I ask an acquaintance how they became a salesperson or a taxi driver, they‚Äôre likely to tell me how it is that they ‚Äúfell‚Äù into their career. But in 30 years of interviewing scientists, no one has ever told me that they ‚Äúfell‚Äù into science. There‚Äôs always a story, something that brings a sparkle to their eyes.

You might not be aware of your own story, though. It could be buried in your subconscious, guiding your science trajectory with an invisible hand. That‚Äôs why, at the beginning of this column, I asked you to think about how it is that you found yourself in science. The answer you come up with will be worth talking about when you interview for jobs.

You won‚Äôt be asked about this in the early discussions; those questions tend to be primarily about the fit, your experience with the techniques you‚Äôd use in that job, or your attitudes about working with others in a team. But as the conversation continues and you become one of the finalists, the hiring manager will want to know more about what makes you tick. A key part of that will be your story of how and why you decided to get into science. That‚Äôs where your work to review the emotion and reasoning behind those early decisions will lend real value to your job search.

Working past burnout

Unfortunately, some people start out with a passion much like Rajesh or Susan and end up, after years of training, feeling like the passion they used to have has been beaten out of them by the process of pursuing a career in science. That‚Äôs understandable, and it happens to more than it should.

If that describes you, you‚Äôre going to need a re-injection of passion, because interviewers can spot burnout from a mile away. I would recommend two approaches. First, reconnect with your strengths. Second, get excited about the potential of learning something new.

My own personal experience has taught me that, when my passion for work runs low, I must go back to my areas of strength. Every job consists of a number of skill areas, and some of these are going to be your ‚Äúsweet spots.‚Äù In my case, there are certain elements of my job that I‚Äôm just really good at, and sometimes I need to remind myself of those and focus on them for a while. You can try this too: Reconnect with those techniques and skills in which you really shine. Feel good about them so that, when you discuss your science, you‚Äôll be able to show some passion as you talk about what you are good at.

The other element to be excited about, besides your present strengths, lies in the opportunity to learn something new, which you will certainly be doing if you move outside of academia. Carefully read all you can about the company you will be interviewing with. In that research, you‚Äôll uncover interesting nuggets about the completely new and tantalizing work you could end up doing. Yes, companies will only hire you if you bring something to the party as well, but every hiring manager loves a person who just seems to be crackling with excitement to dig into something new.

Interviews are filled with moments of opportunity‚Äîand missed opportunities as well. When asked to talk about your science, show the real you. Drop the canned responses, and reveal the passion that got you into your career in the first place.",2015-10-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['early', 'passion', 'secret', 'job', 'youll', 'career', 'search', 'asked', 'science', 'wont', 'success', 'work', 'interest', 'weapon']",Somalia,news article,English

One in four cities around the world lack the money to protect themselves against the ravages of climate breakdown, even though more than 90 per cent are facing serious risks, according to research. Cities are facing problems with flooding, overheating, water shortages, and damage to their infrastructure from extreme weather, which is growing more frequent as the climate changes. A survey of 800 cities, carried out by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), found that last year about 43 per cent of them, representing a combined population of 400 million people, did not have a plan to adapt to the climate crisis. Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. Budgetary restraints were cited as the key reason by about 25 per cent of cities. Many are reliant on national governments for the funding needed to protect their infrastructure and vulnerable populations from these threats.

The survey found that last year, 422 cities had 1,142 projects to adapt to the climate crisis yet to be financed, requiring about $72 billion in investment. The cost of water management projects alone that were yet to be financed was estimated at $22.6 billion. Kyra Appleby, the global director of CDP, said: ‚ÄúAdaptation (to the impacts of climate change) is trickier to finance than emissions action. There are enormous benefits from adaptation and resilience, but they don‚Äôt appear on the balance sheet. Only a fraction of recovery spending (from the coronavirus pandemic) is being put towards climate change, and even less towards adaptation.‚Äù Installing renewable energy generation, such as solar panels, can generate a financial return, and energy efficiency projects begin to save money quite quickly, but the benefits of adapting to the impacts of extreme weather are less obvious and often more diffuse.",2021-05-17 10:10:11+00:00,"['water', 'crisis', 'weather', 'adaptation', 'world', 'climate', 'cent', 'projects', 'survey', 'cities', 'measures', 'cant', 'afford', 'impacts']",Brazil,news article,English

Countries affected include Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti and Tanzania.

‚ÄúIn some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance,‚Äù said Matt Davis, the East Africa regional director of the Catholic Relief Services.

He told Crux the crises affecting East Africa can all be linked back to climate change.

‚ÄúTo help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment,‚Äù Davis said.

What follows are excerpts of his conversation with Crux.

Crux: Widespread flooding has once again hit East Africa. Can you give us a sense of the enormity of the disaster?

Davis: East Africa has been experiencing torrential rains and flooding since July and almost six million people have been impacted. Around 1.5 million people have lost their homes or have been displaced by the floods and many areas are still underwater. People‚Äôs homes, crops, livestock and personal possessions have been washed away, and there has been significant damage to infrastructure.

This is all happening before the start of the short rains, which should peak in November. In some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance. This flooding is putting hardship upon hardship for people in the region, who have also been impacted by COVID-19 and pests like desert locusts.

Catholic Relief Services is on the ground working with local partners and national governments to distribute emergency food and other necessities. Working in partnership, we‚Äôve been providing life-saving assistance to tens of thousands of people across affected areas.

However, there is an urgent need for more funding to ensure that basic needs continue to be met, and to prevent the spread of malaria and other waterborne diseases. Though our response varies country-by-country, we are generally support families with food, water, shelter, basic essentials, sanitation, and providing cash or vouchers which in turn supports the local economy. We also support health systems to address things like malnutrition and other health-related risks. In some areas, families receive seeds, tools and fishing kits so they can have a livelihood and feed themselves.

How do these flood compare to previous flooding in the region?

Even if you just look at the floods over the last four years, the impacts and the number of people affected have grown exponentially. From Ethiopia to South Sudan to Uganda, we‚Äôre seeing communities that year after year are impacted by both floods as well as recurring drought in some places.

Our staff in various countries often comments on how weather patterns have changed, or how rain is erratic. They also say that this is the worst flooding they have seen in decades.

Many environmentalists and other experts are blaming climate change.

The locust swarms, floods, recurring drought and COVID-19 all link back to climate change in some way, and East Africa in particular is feeling the effects.

To help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment. Alternatives to charcoal, a big reason for deforestation, need to be scaled up and promoted more widely. We also have to prioritize to support communities to protect forests and plant trees.

It‚Äôs difficult to protect against some of the risks, but there are measures that can be taken to help people cope with disasters like droughts and floods that have been made worse by climate change.

For example, it‚Äôs important to ensure that people live far enough away from rivers and channels to prevent disasters like flash flooding and landslides while also better managing excess runoff.

In East Africa, we‚Äôre increasing our efforts toward landscape restoration and re-greening while at the same time providing people with a more diverse set of income opportunities and training on how to be better prepared should disaster strike.

As you said, the floods are coming amid the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of locusts swarms. This really is a triple crisis.

The combined impacts of the floods, recurrent drought, conflict, desert locust swarms, COVID-19 and the pandemic-related economic downturn are making it really hard for people to recover. Like here, months-long lockdowns also mean that many people in the region haven‚Äôt been able to work, thus losing their ability to put food on the table.

For governments and humanitarian organizations like CRS, this also creates additional strain on already scarce resources. For example, the teams sent out to manage pests like desert locusts have to take additional precautions because of coronavirus. In some remote areas, people have not even heard of the coronavirus and are not aware of the potential risk. There are a lot of misconceptions, creating more risk for frontline workers.

Early on when COVID-19 emerged as a threat in the region, we adjusted how we interacted with project participants so we could continue to provide critical support while adhering to the necessary safety precautions. So, while we had to adapt quickly, we have also largely managed to continue our emergency responses, like food or cash distributions, for example.

For example, in South Sudan, we haven‚Äôt been able to do food air drops because airstrips have been flooded. And hunger is growing because farmland is flooded, too.

In terms of COVID-19, overall, our donors have been really flexible and supportive, encouraging us to continue to provide critical support in the communities where we work. That said, funding for a large-scale COVID-19 response has not really materialized, so communities have mostly had to make do with what they had, and weather the pandemic as best they can.",2020-10-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'crisis', 'food', 'support', 'east', 'massive', 'covid19', 'hit', 'communities', 'need', 'floods', 'flooding', 'latest', 'difficult']",Uganda,news article,English
747,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Asamoah Gyan‚Äôs Sunderland exit explained by Niall Quinn - Goal.com,https://www.goal.com/en-ng/news/asamoah-gyans-sunderland-exit-explained-by-niall-quinn/sb7v3ne49vun1ku6s0prakjaf,"Asamoah Gyan‚Äôs Sunderland exit explained by Niall Quinn

The former Black Cats chief has lifted the lid on the Ghana superstar‚Äôs Stadium of Light exit

Former Sunderland chief Niall Quinn has lifted the lid on Asamoah Gyan‚Äôs exit from the Stadium of Light back in 2011, shedding new light on an intriguing chapter in the striker‚Äôs career.

The Ghana international was just over a year into a four-year contract with the then-Premier League club when he was approached to move to Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates.

The forward moved to the Middle East‚Äîinitially on loan‚Äîand has never since played in a major European league.

‚ÄúWhatever players say, I‚Äôll tell you what the agents say and I‚Äôll tell you what goes on behind the scenes,‚Äù Quinn told Roker Report.

‚ÄúWith Asamoah, he came to us - via his agent - who said ‚ÄòI have had a huge offer in the Middle East and I must go' to which we told him 'look, we can‚Äôt do that.‚Äô

‚ÄúWe waited a six-month period to see if he would come back into line, we gave him a new contract too - although it did pale in comparison to what was on the table from Al-Ain and also he was being pressured by them to make the move.

‚ÄúWe were hoping he‚Äôd go there for three months and hate it and want to come back,"" added former Sunderland striker Quinn, who spend six years involved in the running of the club.

Despite an encouraging start to life at Sunderland, scoring 11 goals in his first 36 Premier League outings, Gyan never looked back, and subsequently enjoyed success at Al-Ain.

He won three UAE Pro League titles, the President‚Äôs Cup in 2014, and the Arabian Gulf Super Cup in 2012.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt [hate it],‚Äù Quinn continued. ‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is they were probably offering him five times the amount he was on with us, and we were told there was no tax on it, so in theory he was on ten times the amount he was on here.

‚ÄúIf we were right up the top of the league, fighting for a Champions League spot then you have more ability to keep hold of players the way top four clubs do, but we were Sunderland trying really hard to keep everything working.

‚ÄúIf we were to give one of those players the money they were wanting - well, I wasn‚Äôt going to sanction that because it puts the club in a terrible position.

‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt taking in any more income, we had hit the level of what we could spend considering [Former club owner] Ellis Short gave us a lot of money, another level would have blown the club into another level.

‚ÄúIt was the financial facts of life we have to abide by. Asamoah went, Jordan [Henderson] went - those deals alone brought us in ¬£50 million to ¬£60 million.‚Äù

After four seasons with Al-Ain, Gyan moved to the Chinese Super League with Shanghai SIPG, returning briefly to the Gulf with Al Ahli Dubai, before switching to current club Kayserispor in 2017.

To date, he‚Äôs struggled to make an impact in the Super Lig, and also struggled at the Africa Cup of Nations, where he was included in the Black Stars‚Äô squad despite originally retiring from international football ahead of the tournament after having the captaincy removed from him.

Ghana were eliminated in the Round of 16, following defeat by Tunisia, with making just two substitute appearances during the competition.",2019-07-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['super', 'gyans', 'quinn', 'exit', 'league', 'told', 'players', 'light', 'sunderland', 'club', 'niall', 'asamoah', 'cup', 'explained']",Ghana,news article,English

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday telephoned Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and took stock of the flood situation in Assam, assuring all support from the centre to the state in dealing with the situation.

Sonowal apprised Modi of the large-scale devastation the floods have caused on the lives of the people besides the state's economy and informed him about the details of relief, rescue and rehabilitation operations undertaken by the Assam government, said a government release here.

The Chief Minister also told the Prime Minister that the state government has sensitised the administration- both in Barak and Brahmaputra Valleys- and asked the Deputy Commissioners to reach out to the flood-affected people with their men and materials.

Sonowal briefed the PM on the entire gamut of relief and rescue operations that have been pressed into service to help the marooned people, the release said.

He also informed him that he has asked the state ministers and all public representatives, including MLAs, to extend a helping hand to the victims of floods and personally involve themselves in the rescue operations.

To a query of the Prime Minister, Sonowal informed that flood control mechanisms, including 24X7 control rooms, have been pressed into service with state government officials put on duty, manning them round the clock, the release said.

The health department and the Public Health Engineering department have been directed to respond to medicare related issues and provide medicines and clean drinking water, Sonowal informed.

Veterinary and Animal Husbandry department has been asked to take care of the marooned animals and keep adequate fodder stock ready for the stray animals of Kaziranga National Park, other national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, he added.

He also told the Prime Minister about his direction to the authorities of national parks to supply fodder to the animals taking shelter on the high lands.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured all help, support and cooperation from the Centre to help Assam government bailout from the situation and asked the Chief Minister to undertake relief, rescue and rehabilitation measures on a war footing, the release said.

Earlier, on Saturday, the chief minister had briefed Union Home Minister Amit Shah about the flood situation in the state. Shah directed the National Disaster Response Force and other agencies to provide all necessary help to the flood-affected people.

The flood situation in Assam worsened on Sunday with the death toll rising to 11 and affecting nearly 26.5 lakh people.

Barpeta is the worst-hit district with 7.35 lakh people facing the flood fury, followed by Morigaon where 3.50 lakh people are hit. In Dhubri district, 3.38 lakh people are affected, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said.

188,Drought Sri Lanka,Weise joins Kolpak exodus from Proteas - cricket.com.au,https://www.cricket.com.au/news/david-weise-kolpak-south-africa-t20-twenty20-cricket-sri-lanka-squad/2017-01-10,"David Wiese has become the latest South African cricketer to walk away from an international career to sign a Kolpak contract to play English county cricket.

The 31-year-old fast bowler has played 20 T20 matches for South Africa and six one-day internationals but is no longer eligible to play for his country after penning a three year deal with Sussex.

Wiese had been expected to feature in South Africa's T20 squad to play Sri Lanka in a series of matches.

The move follows the shock move by South Africa Test quick Kyle Abbott to walk away from his international career for a Kolpak deal with Hamphsire.

Quick Single: Abbott, Rossouw part with Proteas

One-day specialist Rilee Rossouw followed the same path, and a string of lower-profile South Africans have followed in their footsteps in recent months.

Following Abbott and Rossouw's revelations, Cricket South Africa moved to immediately cancel their contracts.

The contracts are named after a Slovak handball player who won a ruling that gives anyone with a work permit from a country which has an associate trading agreement with the European Union the same rights as an EU worker.

South Africa have named a squad devoid of any of the players who featured in the Test series victory against Sri Lanka ‚Äì a move similar to what Australia is expected to do for their own T20 series with Sri Lanka later this summer.

While South Africa have been weakened by the Kolpak defections and have opted to rest key players, Australia's hand is forced by scheduling issues after the BCCI scheduled the first Test to begin the day after the third and final T20 in Adelaide.

South Africa's T20 team will be now be led by allrounder Farhaan Behardien, and feature five players uncapped at international level, as well as allrounder Andile Phehlukwayo who has played ODIs but is uncapped in T20 internationals.

Star batter AB de Villiers, who has not played since June last year because of an elbow injury, and fast bowler Morne Morkel, recovering from a back injury, are due to play in a domestic one-day game on January 22 and may be considered for the third and final T20 international, in Cape Town on January 25.

778,DR-2011-000121-CHN,"Radical changes in agriculture needed for food, water security - eco-business.com",https://www.eco-business.com/news/radical-changes-in-agriculture-needed-for-food-water-security/,"Experts in water, agriculture and conservation banded together at last week‚Äôs World Water Week in Stockholm to call for a major shift in global policies on agriculture and natural resource management, a change they said was urgently needed for future food and water security.

The call to action came on the back of a study released on during the conference by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Sri-Lanka headquartered International Water Management Institute (IWMI), which found that current agricultural trends are destroying the world‚Äôs natural resources, particularly its water supplies.

The study, An Ecosystem Services Approach to Water and Food Security, recommended urgent action to integrate greener farming methods and the conservation of natural areas to ensure food security and protect water sources.

Farming accounts for 70 to 90 per cent of water use in some areas, noted the authors of the study, who warned that in some of the world‚Äôs largest growing regions, including the ‚Äòbreadbaskets‚Äô of northern China plains, Punjab in India and the Western United States, water was being used faster than sources could be replenished.

‚ÄúAgriculture is both a major cause and victim of ecosystem degradation,‚Äù said IWMI‚Äôs scientific editor Eline Boelee in a statement.

She added that increasing agricultural production in a sustainable way i s a priority for future food security, but that ‚Äúwe need to take a more holistic ‚Äòlandscape‚Äô approach.‚Äù

To achieve a ‚Äòlandscape‚Äô approach, experts from IWMI and UNEP recommended ‚Äòagroecosystems‚Äô, meaning systems whereby planning for food production and other land uses is integrated into a broader plan ‚Äì one that ensures clean water, clean air and biodiversity for the long term.

Implementation will require combining the efforts of the agricultural sector and natural resource managers and advocates - two interest groups which have been traditionally separate and often in conflict, they noted.

Deputy director general for research at IWMI, David Molden, said, ‚ÄúThe various political, research and community alliances now emerging are challenging the notion that we have to choose between food security and ecosystem health by making it clear that you can‚Äôt have one without the other.‚Äù

He noted that recent alliances between agricultural and conservation groups are blurring the lines between sustainable farming and natural resource protection. ‚ÄúFor instance, UNEP has adopted food security as a new strategic concern. And IWMI and its partners in the CGIAR are developing a multi-million dollar research program that will look at water as an integral part of ecosystems to help solve issues of water scarcity, land and environmental degradation,‚Äù he added.

The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is host to IWMI and brings together research groups from around the world to find solutions to agricultural and food security issues.

Experts from UNEP and IWMI agree that agencies and organisations that manage agriculture, water resources, wildlife, forests and other natural resources often operate in isolation, and that much greater cooperation is needed for a sustainable approach to food production.

A separate study from IWMI, Wetlands, Agriculture and Poverty Reduction, found that efforts to preserve wetlands by excluding agriculture can actually increase the rate of destruction of the eco-system. IWMI‚Äôs Matthew McCartney, who co-authored the wetlands report, said, ‚ÄúBlanket prohibitions against cultivation do not always reduce ecosystem destruction and can make things worse.‚Äù

He cited an example of a farming ban on grassy wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa that led to grazing in the wetlands and deforestation upstream of the wetlands, both of which had greater negative environmental impacts than the earlier farming methods.

‚ÄúWhat is needed is a balance: appropriate farming practices that support sustainable food production and protect ecosystems,‚Äù said Mr McCartney.

IWMI‚Äôs Mr Molden said it was essential to change the way modern societies view water and ecosystems and the way people interact with them.

One relationship society will need to understand is the inevitable link between growing enough food to feed communities and having a healthy water supply.

While a person consumes on average 2 to 4 litres of water per day for drinking, producing the food they eat requires 2,000 to 5,000 litres of water. With the world‚Äôs population expected to grow by 2.7 billion people by 2050, pressure on water resources will increase dramatically.

At the same time, the natural systems that store, filter and protect those water resources are increasingly degraded. China‚Äôs official agency reported recently that over the past 50 years, roughly 1,000 of the nation‚Äôs 3,000 natural lakes have disappeared. Other strains on water resources include rising pollution in waterways, plummeting levels in ground aquifers and lowered dam levels due to drought and damaged ecosystems.

‚ÄúManaging water for food and ecosystems will bring great benefits, but there is no escaping the urgency of this situation. We are heading for disaster if we don‚Äôt change our practices from business as usual,‚Äù said Mr Molden.

World Water Week has been hosted annually by the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) since 1991 and brings together experts and decision-makers from around the globe to find solutions to pressing water issues.

The Pakistan Red Cross Society (PRCS), with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is assessing the evolution of the current monsoon rainfalls and its impacts during the next few days.

The situation

Heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan from 6  7 August 2020 with intermissions. This Monsoon rains created floods situation in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu. However, Tehsil Johi of District Dadu is the area which is greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods not only damaged the houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh already declared 80 villages of District Dadu as Calamity Affected Areas. The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad and Jhal Magsi.

PRCS is already working together with the government, Movement partners and other organizations for COVID19 Response. The changing Scenario of i.e. floods/flash floods may increase the risks of COVID-19 spread in the affected communities. It has been reported that due to floods, many communities are forced to live together in small camps. The initial reports suggested that District Dadu of Sindh and District Jhal Magsi, Sibi, Harnai, Naseeabad and Kachi of Baluchistan are the worst-hit areas. However, administration is still in process of damage and need assessment as most of the communication channels are also broken in some affected areas. The floods also destroyed standing crops and greatly affected the livelihood of inhabitants.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Situation Report No.13 as of 13 August 2020, heavy monsoon rainfall has caused flooding and damages in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces over the last few days. The report indicates that as of date 82 people have lost their lives and 28 injuries, while 873 houses are fully damaged while 186 partially damaged.

In Baluchistan, 13 people have died in floods in recent days, with many more reportedly missing. Over 861 homes are fully damaged and 46 partially damaged. Flooding struck in the districts of Khuzdar, Jhal Magsi, Lasbela, Gwadar, Pasni, Kachi and Dera Bugti from 7 August 2020. Severe flooding occurred in the west of the province from 8 August after flood water from Baluchistan made its way downstream along the Nai Gaj river.

Meanwhile in Sindh Province, heavy rainfall from 6 August caused flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sakrand, Tando Jam, Dadu and Thatta. The floods caused 31 death. Hundreds of people were rescued by military personnel. Formal requests by district government through Deputy Commissioners of respective districts including situation of damages possibly with numbers/figures and required support in terms of food and non-food on immediate basis is expected.

The government is responding the situation and Pakistan army is carrying the Search & Rescue and evacuation operation. Some of the steps taken by government are as follows.

 299 persons evacuated using 10 boats in district Dadu district by Armed Forces.

 PDMA Baluchistan Emergency Operational Center and DDMAs control rooms are functional and on high alert.

 Damage assessment by district government in Baluchistan is being conducted.

 Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) is providing relief items to Dadu District Administration including 1,000 boats with motors, 1,000 units of tents, 1,000 sets of kitchen sets, 1,000 units of mosquito nets, 1,000 units of jerry cans and 1,000 units of water coolers.

 Government of Sindh declared 80 Dehs (villages) of Tehsil Johi, Dadu district as Calamity Affected Areas.

 Work on cleaning of 552 big and small nullahs (gravity feed water system) in Karachi started by NDMA.

745,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Antibiotics Are Flooding Earth's Rivers - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/antibiotics-are-flooding-earths-rivers,"In a photograph, steam rises from a pile of garbage that sits by a river. The river is the Odaw, in Ghana, near the country‚Äôs capital city of Accra, and in the photo the Odaw‚Äôs water is black.

‚ÄúThey refer to it as a dead river.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey refer to it as a dead river,‚Äù said Alistair Boxall, who is an environmental chemist at the University of York in the United Kingdom.

The person who took the photo is ecologist Robert Marchant, also of the University of York. Marchant was at the river to take a sample of the water as part of a global campaign, led by Boxall, to study concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the world‚Äôs rivers. Boxall, along with his colleague John Wilkinson, coordinated an international team that sampled rivers like the Odaw.

‚ÄúWe wanted to try and get a better understanding of what the levels of pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, were around the globe,‚Äù Boxall said.

Boxall and Wilkinson sent their collaborators a box that contained sample vials, syringes, filters, and freezer packs. The collaborators sampled 711 river locations in 72 countries and then sent their samples back to Wilkinson and Boxall for analysis.

What Wilkinson and Boxall found is that 470 of those sites contained antibiotics, which come from sources including human excrement and drug manufacturing activity. Many of these antibiotics occur at concentrations above what the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Industry Alliance‚Äîa group of private sector companies that aims to address the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria‚Äîsays is safe. Here ‚Äúsafe‚Äù refers to those levels above which the alliance says bacteria can start to develop antibiotic resistance. According to Boxall, those levels can range anywhere from 20 to 32,000 nanograms per liter of water, depending on the antibiotic.

Doctors use antibiotics to treat a raft of bacteria-caused ailments, from tuberculosis to staph infections. Some bacteria can become antibiotic resistant when exposed to the drugs, which can make treatment next to impossible for doctors. In the United States alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 23,000 people die each year from antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

At Ghana‚Äôs Odaw River, concentrations of antibiotics like metronidazole, used to treat things like skin and mouth infections, exceeded safe levels by a factor of 68. The Odaw, though, is not the worst-off river. More than 110 of the 711 sampled sites have concentrations that exceed safe levels by factors of up to 300. Rivers in Bangladesh, where concentrations hover around 40,000 nanograms per liter, are among the worst of that group.

‚ÄúPeople are using these rivers to clean in, clean their clothes in. They‚Äôre sourcing their water from those sites,‚Äù said Boxall, who presented results from the campaign earlier this month at the Canadian Chemistry Conference and Exhibition in Quebec City. This means that people who use the rivers stand a greater chance of exposing themselves to the resistant bacteria.

The campaign helps address the threat that such bacteria pose by revealing what the prevalence of pharmaceuticals is in rivers around the world‚Äîsomething that should help prioritize which drugs merit the most attention when it comes to cleanup efforts.

Acquiring such data, however, would not have been possible without the global, standardized campaign conducted by Boxall and Wilkinson, according to environmental engineer Viviane Yargeau of McGill University in Canada, who was not involved in the study. ‚ÄúYou know that you‚Äôre comparing apples and apples,‚Äù she said.

536,Drought Sri Lanka,Lanka end three-year drought with first bilateral series win - Ceylon Daily News,https://www.dailynews.lk/2019/05/22/sports/186250/lanka-end-three-year-drought-first-bilateral-series-win,"EDINBURGH, Tuesday ‚Äì Dimuth Karunaratne made a winning debut as ODI captain when Sri Lanka beat Scotland by 35 runs on the Duckworth/Lewis rule to win the second ODI played at the Grange here on Tuesday.

Scotland chasing Sri Lanka‚Äôs total of 322-8 were 132-3 after 27 overs when the rain came down and reduced the contest.

When play resumed Scotland‚Äôs target was reset to 235 off 34 overs and they required a further 103 off 7 overs. It was a tall task and no doubt they failed in their valiant effort.

Paceman Nuwan Pradeep dashed whatever hopes Scotland they had in mind of chasing down the target by snapping up two wickets in the 32nd over including that of top scorer left-hander George Munsey for 61 off 42 balls as Scotland gradually fell away in their brave run chase.

They eventually dismissed for 199 in the final over to hand to Sri Lanka their first bilateral series win since June 2016.

With the first ODI being washed out without a ball bowled Sri Lanka took the two-match series 1-0. The win also broke a losing sequence of eight straight defeats.

Dimuth Karunaratne on his ODI captaincy debut led a top order batting charge as Sri Lanka piled up an impressive 322 for eight wickets after being invited to bat first by Scotland.

Sri Lanka, of course, capitalized largely on poor Scottish catching to post this total.

Making capital of these lapses openers Karunaratne and Avishka Fernando posted a 123-run partnership which laid the base for the final total although lost their way somewhat in the middle order losing five wickets for 54 before a late revival saw Sri Lanka add 99 off their last 10 overs, including 35 off their last 12 balls, to compensate for the earlier stumble.

Karunaratne top scored with 77 off 88 balls and it was one of three half-centuries in the innings for Sri Lanka as his opening partner Avishka Fernando struck his maiden ODI fifty ‚Äì 74 off 78 balls (5 fours, 3 sixes).

Both men were spilled during Brad Wheal‚Äôs opening spell, Karunaratne at first slip by George Munsey on 13 in the seventh over, and Avishka on 22 at mid-off by Alasdair Evans in the ninth.

Karunaratne received a third life in the 21st over as well, on 36, when Calum MacLeod couldn‚Äôt hang on to a sharp chance at midwicket off the bowling of left-arm spinner Mark Watt. It took the intervention of off-spinning all-rounder Michael Leask to break the stand, striking with his first ball after being introduced in the 23rd over to induce a loose flick to Munsey at deep square leg by Avishka for 74.

Karunaratne continued to drive Sri Lanka forward, raising his 50 off 65 balls with a reverse paddle sweep for four off Watt in the 26th. After 33 overs, he was on 77 and constructing another ominous stand with Kusal Mendis, as Sri Lanka looked certain to sprint past 300 with their score on 203 for 1.

But the reintroduction of Wheal in the 34th put the brakes on their innings. Karunaratne fell, skying a pull to substitute fielder Gavin Main at mid-on. The decision to promote Thisara Perera to No. 4 with a terrific platform and a free license to swing big backfired spectacularly, as a cross-batted swipe at a back of a length ball angled across by Wheal resulted in an edge behind for a golden duck.

Tom Sole made it 3 for 6 in the space of 20 balls when Angelo Mathews charged the offspinner and heaved a catch to Leask at long-on to make it 210 for 4. Kusal focused on stabilising the innings through the 40th over before getting back into attack mode, heaving a six over long-on in an 11-run over. He eventually made 66.

Lahiru Thirimanne made 44 off 40 balls and with Suranga Lakmal playing a cameo knock of 12 off 4 balls (1 six, 1 four) Sri Lanka posted a challenging total.",2019-05-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['series', 'avishka', 'total', 'end', 'balls', 'overs', 'threeyear', 'lanka', 'sri', 'odi', 'karunaratne', 'drought', 'bilateral', 'win', 'wickets']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

- Starlink is a company under SpaceX, a space transportations services company, and its offering broadband

- The company will be competing with network providers like MTN Nigeria, Airtel Nigeria, Globacom and 9mobile

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

Lagos State plans to stop being a receiver of processed rice and start processing its own Lake Rice, starting with the Kebbi State government.

1005,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Albania's 'Made in Egypt' Cigarettes Flood North Africa - Balkan Insight,https://balkaninsight.com/2018/12/20/albania-s-made-in-egypt-cigarettes-flood-north-africa-12-19-2018/,"Secrets are hard fought for in the impoverished Albanian town of Librazhd, particularly when jobs are at stake.

But the controversial activities of a cigarette factory on the edge of town with a 50-strong workforce appear to have passed largely unnoticed since it began quietly churning out millions of cigarettes in packs bearing the profile of the last Ptolemaic ruler of Egypt ‚Äì Cleopatra.

Cleopatra is the most popular brand of cigarette in Egypt and one of the world‚Äôs top sellers.

Albanian court documents, leaked British customs reports, contracts and interviews with the factory management reveal that since 2014 around 22 million packs of the cigarettes have been produced annually in the Albania Tabak factory in Librazhd, near the central city of Elbasan, before being shipped to Libya.

According to the owner of the Cleopatra brand ‚Äì Giza-based Eastern Company ‚Äì cigarettes arriving in Libya are frequently smuggled across the desert border into Egypt, where one pack of 20 can fetch almost a dollar on the legal market.

British customs authorities have been tracking the Librazhd output and flagging it as counterfeit. Their warnings prompted a criminal investigation in Albania in 2015 which halted production for a year. The case was then put on hold as prosecutors awaited information from foreign jurisdictions.

Relieved of its immediate legal troubles, the factory signed a new deal in 2017 with the British Virgin Islands-based firm Eques Holding Group to produce up to 175 million pack a year, according to a contract obtained by reporters.

Albanian prosecutors have now revealed that they reopened the case in 2017.

Undeterred, the men behind the operation are looking to expand.

They include figures from the Balkans, the Middle East and Cyprus, some of whom have been tied to earlier smuggling cases, and some whose involvement in this operation has been concealed through offshore structures that reporters from Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, BIRN, and Arab Journalists for Investigative Journalism, ARIJ, have unpicked.

Those benefiting from the booming Cleopatra business also include the wife of a powerful Albanian political figure from the ruling Socialist Party, although she insists she was unaware of the allegations against the operation.

Organised crime and the rule of law are major issues facing Albania as it tries to make progress on the road towards European Union membership, having joined NATO in 2009.

The manager of the factory, Servet Dauti, said the factory operated wholly in line with Albanian law and what happened to the cigarettes after they left Albania was not his concern.

‚ÄúThe moment that the product leaves Albania we have no responsibility or obligation to know what happens with it,‚Äù he said.

Eques Holding Group declined to comment for this story.

Made in Librazhd



The Egyptian Army regularly reports seizures of counterfeit Cleopatra. Here, 4,200 packets were intercepted in December 2016 on the desert border with Libya. Photo: Egyptian Army.

Produced more than a thousand miles from the land of the pharaohs, the allegedly counterfeit packs nevertheless carry the unmistakable profile of Queen Cleopatra, lover of Julius Caesar, and claim in Arabic script to be ‚ÄòMade in Egypt by Eastern Company S.A.E..‚Äô The packs are emblazoned with Egyptian health warnings.

Eastern Company S.A.E. created the Cleopatra brand for President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1960s as an Egyptian take on the smuggled American Kents he liked to smoke. It has been in production ever since, largely for domestic consumption.

Increased taxes on cigarettes from the 2010s onward created a booming black market for the product; lawlessness in neighbouring Libya since the 2011 overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi has turned the country into a smuggler‚Äôs paradise.

These Albanian ‚Äúcounterfeits‚Äù, as they are described by British customs in a May 2015 letter to Egyptian customs and obtained by BIRN/ARIJ, are produced for Eques Holding Group, a British Virgin Island company owned by a 38-year-old Iraqi businessman called Faris Al-Rifai.

Eques Holding Group boasts a licence to use the Cleopatra brand in the European Union and Albania, obtained from another British Virgin Island firm, Worldwide Spirits Supply.

Eastern Company has been unsuccessful in overturning these trademarks as the Egyptian firm has been unable to prove that it has recently been using the brand in those countries.

But trademarks work on a strict geographical basis, and Worldwide‚Äôs do not cover Libya or Egypt, where Eastern Company has registered their brand.

Despite this, a BIRN/ARIJ investigation has uncovered that the Albanian-produced Cleopatra were exported via the Albanian port of Durres to Libya and a firm called Al Zain International Company. Calls to the firm went unanswered.

And an internal report from Eastern Company, obtained by BIRN/ARIJ, describes how Cleopatra cigarettes arriving in Libya from countries such as Vietnam and Montenegro are smuggled across the Sahara into Egypt, where they can be sold alongside authentic Cleopatras, which cost just under $1 each.

Although there is no direct evidence of Albanian-made Cleopatras finding their way to Egypt, officials have reported regular seizures of the brand in the North African country in recent years. Revenues for Eastern Company and the Egyptian government have also been badly hit by smuggled counterfeits.

The Albanian-made cigarettes also purport to be produced by ‚ÄúEastern Company S.A.E‚Äù.

This right was supplied by a company of the same name but based in the British Virgin Islands at the same address as Eques Holding Group. There is no apparent connection to the original Eastern Company headquartered in Giza, home of the Giza pyramids southwest of Cairo, although the firm did not respond to requests for comment.

The letter confirming the production rights was issued a matter of months before Albanian prosecutors opened an investigation into the factory‚Äôs operations, prompted by intelligence from British customs, HMRC.

The criminal investigation into ‚ÄúViolation of Industrial Property Rights‚Äù, ‚ÄúLaundering the Proceeds of Criminal Offence or Criminal Activity‚Äù and ‚ÄúIllegal production of industrial and food items/commodities‚Äù was opened in early 2015.

According to news reports from the time, nine million ‚Äúcounterfeit‚Äù cigarettes were seized in a raid on the factory but the articles failed to note the brand ‚Äì Cleopatra ‚Äì despite being clearly visible from the press photos issued.

Following the raid, the case was suspended while prosecutors awaited responses from various foreign jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands and Egypt.

This allowed Albania Tabak to restart production, despite contact between Albanian customs and the Egyptian ambassador to Tirana, according to an Eastern Company report, and the concerns of British customs and its continued monitoring, according to official letters obtained by BIRN/ARIJ. Britain is one of the biggest markets in Europe for counterfeit and contraband cigarettes.

In correspondence with Egyptian customs in May 2015, not long after the raid, HMRC described how an employee based in Sofia but with regional responsibility for Albania ‚Äúhas recently been successful in closing a cigarette production factory producing counterfeit Cleopatra brand cigarettes.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is HMRC‚Äôs intention to eradicate the counterfeit production of Cleopatra brand cigarettes with the help of The Eastern Company, the legitimate license holder for the brand,‚Äù the letter added.

To date, neither Albania Tabak, Eques Holding Group, Worldwide Spirits nor any employee of those firms has been accused of any crime.

Production restarts and expands

Dauti, the factory manager, said the factory was shut for roughly a year while the investigation was ongoing, after which they were allowed to reopen.

Then, in December 2016, HMRC informed their Egyptian counterparts that eight shipments of Cleopatra cigarettes had been sent to Libya for Eques Holding Group.

In March 2017, it again reported to Egypt that 11.5 million Cleopatra cigarettes were due to be exported to Libya, via Malta.

The latest contract, signed in March 2017 and obtained by reporters, states that Albania

Albania Tabak cigarette factory in Librazhd, near the central city of Elbasan, is one of the town‚Äôs main employers. Photo: BIRN

Tabak will produce up to 3,500 tonnes of cigarettes a year for two years which, at approximately one gram a cigarette, means 3.5 billion cigarettes every 12 months, or 175 million packs. The document places a value of 15 million euros on the order.

In an interview with BIRN/ARIJ, Dauti denied doing anything wrong.

‚ÄúWe perform and proceed with our work in full compliance with Albanian law,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe trademarks are registered in Europe and Albania, hence legally nothing impedes us from producing it. But even if it was not registered in Albania, there is nothing that stops us from producing it according to Albanian legislation as we function as a production company and all the inflow and outflow plans are monitored.‚Äù

Eques Holding Group agreed to pay Albania Tabak 0.014 euro cents a pack, or approximately 300,000 euros a year.

‚ÄúAccording to the contract, we only have to package them and send them to Durres,‚Äù Dauti said.

Dauti said the machinery at the Librazhd factory was outdated and capable of producing just 1.8 million packs a month, or 21.6 million per year.

He and the official owner of Eques Holding Group, Al-Rifai, have set up a new company, Eques Trading Company Shpk, in nearby Elbasan where they have applied to open another factory.

‚ÄúWe have a capacity of three containers a month,‚Äù Dauti said of the current factory. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do more than this even though the contractor asks for a larger quantity. We cannot do more because we don‚Äôt have better equipment at our disposal.‚Äù

Interviewed a second time, Dauti played down the plan to open a new factory, saying they would revisit the idea in six months.

Cleopatra in Vietnam



Before Cleopatra cigarettes starting rolling off the production line of Librazhd, Albania, in 2014, Eques Holding Group and Worldwide Spirits were busy trying to do business on the back of the popular smoking brand in Vietnam.Worldwide Spirits admitted that their European trademark was being used to produce Cleopatra in the South East Asian state in a letter to the EU‚Äôs intellectual property office in September 2013. The trademark had been lodged just three months earlier. Eques‚Äôs request to trademark Cleopatra in Vietnam in 2012 appears to have been eventually turned down in 2015. Eques also attempted, and failed, to have Eastern Company‚Äôs registration annulled in September 2013. Vietnamese authorities ruled in January 2014 that the Egyptian firm‚Äôs trademark had been used in the preceding five years and was therefore still in force. It is unclear whether Eques‚Äôs efforts resulted in cigarettes being manufactured or who was producing Cleopatra with Worldwide Spirit‚Äôs EU trademark, but Cleopatras were being made in Vietnam from 2012 to at least 2015 according to Eastern Company, which alleged in a report that these were aimed at the Egyptian market. In a letter from Vietnam‚Äôs Ministry of Industry and Trade to the Egyptian embassy in Hanoi, dated September 2014, it reported that the ministry was ‚Äúcurrently checking up on the cigarette production of local companies‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf any company is discovered to produce cigarettes trademarked ‚ÄòCleopatra‚Äô it will be requested to stop producing in order to ensure the intellectual property rights on the industrial products of the Egyptian enterprise,‚Äù the letter reads. The ministry did not respond to requests for comment on whether production was halted.

Links to smuggling

Albania Tabak factory has been under the ownership of the Jashari family since December 2010, having been bought by father Ilir for three million euros before passing between his wife and son, Darjo.

Ilir Jashari was convicted of drug trafficking in Italy in June 2010 and handed an initial sentence of more than 15 years, which was later reduced, although he only began serving it upon his arrest in 2014. In 2016 he was transferred to an Albanian prison and was released in 2017, according to a source close to the process.

Contacted by phone, he declined to comment.

Ownership of Worldwide Spirits, meanwhile, is shrouded in secrecy in the British Virgin Islands, and no clues were provided in the information released to BIRN/ARIJ from the tax haven.

But a trawl of trademark applications lodged at the EU‚Äôs intellectual property office revealed that the firm is owned by another company called Middle East Tobacco Co, METCO, based in Cyprus and with a turnover of almost $28 million in 2014, according to company accounts.

According to documents from a 2008 London High Court case between UK cigarette producer Gallaher and a Cypriot firm called Tlias, over 18 months from May 2002, 20,000 cases of Gallaher cigarettes were shipped to Belgium, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Singapore, Slovenia and Tenerife by Tlais‚Äôs main distributor to METCO without any restrictions on their final destination, in breach of Tlais‚Äôs contract..

Cigarettes then sold by METCO ended up being smuggled into the UK and resulted in five people being convicted. The judge said: ‚ÄúI shall assume that Metco had nothing to do with the criminality.‚Äù

An employee of METCO, who declined to identify himself, said they were ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù in receiving or responding to BIRN/ARIJ‚Äôs questions on the Cleopatra trademark.

According to a contract signed between Eques Holding Group and the British Virgin Islands-based ‚Äútrademark‚Äù holder Worldwide Spirit Supply, Eques agreed to pay Worldwide one USD for every 10,000 cigarettes produced. This works out at approximately 44,000 dollars a year.

Another company cashing in on the cigarette boom in Librazhd is the Elbasan customs agency Ujori, which is owned by Xhuljana Sejdini, wife of Elbasan mayor Qazim Sejdini, an ally of Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama.

According to the Albanian prosecutor‚Äôs report, obtained by BIRN/ARIJ, factory manager Dauti told prosecutors that ‚Äúthe whole imp-exp procedure [is] through the customs agency Ujori‚Äù.

Dauti told BIRN/ARIJ that Ujori was given the task because ‚Äúit is the only company that does everything in Elbasan so we signed a contract with it‚Äù.

It is not known how much Ujori has made from the shipment of allegedly counterfeit cigarettes.

Sejdini told BIRN that she was unaware of the investigation into Albania Tabak, explaining that her firm was involved only in the paperwork.

‚ÄúWe do not open any trucks and we do not know what is inside them and there is no reason why we should know that,‚Äù she said.

Librazhd‚Äôs mayor, Kastriot Gura, said he knew little about the activities of the factory in his town, beyond breathing much needed life into the ailing local economy.

‚ÄúI know they produce cigarettes and that they have brought jobs to the town,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey regularly pay their municipal obligations and for us that is all that matters.‚Äù

No, I do not know because I was not interested to know. For us, it is important and what really matters is that they pay tax to the city and have created jobs.

Gura said he was not interested in any allegations of wrongdoing. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the responsibility of other parts of the state.‚Äù

On December 12, shortly prior to publication of this story, Prosecutor Armanda Xhaferri revealed in a written statement to BIRN that her office in Elbasan had reopened the case in 2017 after new documents were received from the British Virgin Islands, but that the case was still waiting on information from Egypt.

‚ÄúUnder these circumstances, our investigations have not been completed yet,‚Äù Xhaferi said.

Responding to questions about why customs allowed a firm under investigation to export goods claiming to be ‚ÄúMade in Egypt‚Äù to Libya, Albania‚Äôs custom said in a statement that Eques Holding Group was operating with an Albanian trademark for ‚ÄúCleopatra‚Äù, although it also conceded that Eastern Company had registered ‚ÄúCleopatra Lux‚Äù as its brand.

It added: ‚ÄúThe case continues to be under investigation by the Prosecution of the District Court in Elbasan while the General Directorate of the Customs awaits the results of the investigation.‚Äù

Malnutrition, COVID-19, and food affordability are emerging as growing worries as Timor-Leste digs out from its worst flooding in decades.

Days of heavy rain triggered severe floods and landslides that swept through parts of the Pacific nation in early April. As relief operations ramp up, aid agencies say cases of diarrhoea are appearing in evacuation centres.

‚ÄúThere is an immediate need to establish a referral system for severe [and] critical cases of malnutrition,‚Äù UN agencies said in a 16 April report.

It took nearly a week for significant donor funding to kick in after the country‚Äôs most severe floods in 40 years. Heavy rains, worsened by a tropical cyclone that also damaged parts of eastern Indonesia and Western Australia, caused a sudden deluge concentrated in the capital, Dili. At least 45 people died.

The government says some 25,000 households are affected, which would add up to about 10 percent of the country‚Äôs population. Some 8,800 people were still in evacuation centres as of 15 April.

‚ÄúThe people who are still staying at the IDP camps right now, they lost pretty much everything,‚Äù said Berta Antonieta Tilman Pereira, a community organiser who helped launch an early response to the floods. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt even have food to eat. They didn‚Äôt have clothes to wear.‚Äù

The disaster overlaps with a surge in coronavirus infections. The government relaxed COVID-19 restrictions after the floods; since the end of March, cases have doubled to more than 1,100.

Food prices are also rising, raising fears that a population already hit by widespread job losses and hunger during the pandemic will face more hardship in the coming months. The UN said the price of rice has jumped by 7 percent in the last two weeks after the floods damaged rice fields and maize crops, and by more than 20 percent in a year.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a concern about what happens next,‚Äù said Peter Goodfellow, country director for the NGO CARE International in Timor-Leste. ‚ÄúWe are concerned about what happens if there were to be another even minor emergency, be it a cholera outbreak or dengue. The resilience isn‚Äôt there. It could quite quickly become a very significant problem.‚Äù

Volunteer response, donor delays

Local volunteer groups were the first to respond as thousands of people headed to evacuation sites in churches or public buildings.

Antonieta was part of a group that set up an online campaign that raised more than $50,000. The funds helped run community kitchens serving hot meals to evacuees. The volunteers also distributed kitchen and hygiene kits.

‚ÄúWe need to be organised,‚Äù Antonieta said. ‚ÄúThe system that we‚Äôre actually supposed to trust and rely on in case of emergency is totally slow and not responding, so the community themselves needs to be organised.‚Äù

The government declared a state of calamity and asked for international help on 8 April ‚Äì at least four days after the disaster escalated. It called its first coordination meeting with humanitarian groups on 9 April, according to UN situation reports.

International funding has also lagged. Australia‚Äôs 11 April aid pledge of about $5.4 million came a week after the disaster.

The government didn‚Äôt clarify what it needed early on, which meant donors ‚Äúwere not able to be clear about what their response was‚Äù, Goodfellow said, though he added that many government employees and facilities were also hit by the floods.

Donors have now promised about $7.5 million in humanitarian funding, according to the UN. ‚ÄúGiven the scale of damage, it is feeling underfunded,‚Äù Goodfellow said.

Climate change

Fundasaun Mahein, a Dili-based civil society group, said the ‚Äúslow governmental response‚Äù is part of longer-term problems that have grown, especially through the pandemic: The disaster ‚Äúexposes further the state‚Äôs lack of capacity to respond to emergencies and meet our people‚Äôs basic needs‚Äù, the group said.

Analysts also say poor urban planning in Dili exacerbated the floods‚Äô impacts. Timor-Leste sees frequent drought and floods, including a disaster that washed away some 200 homes last year. But this month‚Äôs floods have been particularly severe.

Timor-Leste‚Äôs government has budgeted about $1.4 million over three months to respond.

‚ÄúPeople are suffering, families are suffering; they are homeless, without water, without electricity, and everything is flooded with mud,‚Äù said the country‚Äôs prime minister, Jos√© Maria de Vasconcelos, who is also known as Taur Matan Ruak.

As relief operations continue, aid groups warn that Timor-Leste needs to better prepare for weather extremes amid a global climate emergency.

‚ÄúClimate change is clearly exacerbating the intensity and impact of these disasters,‚Äù the NGO Oxfam said in a statement.

‚ÄúI wish they were more prepared,‚Äù Antonieta said. ‚ÄúThe decision-makers, the government, need to be prepared for any crisis that‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

764,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Public storm in Dalian - chinadialogue,https://chinadialogue.net/en/pollution/4511-public-storm-in-dalian/,"As Typhoon Meihua battered China‚Äôs east coast in early August, it also whipped up a public storm: a dyke protecting China‚Äôs largest manufacturer of paraxylene (PX) ‚Äì a chemical used to make polyester products ‚Äì was washed away, bringing the plant‚Äôs existence to the attention of the local population and triggering public safety fears. Over 10,000 residents of the north-eastern city of Dalian gathered in front of the municipal government building to express opposition to the project, demanding the plant be moved and the full details made public.

Following the uproar, Dalian authorities ordered the managers of the Fujia Dahua facility immediately to halt production and relocate their plant: the public campaign had concluded with the government bowing to public opinion ‚Äì on the surface, a triumph. But the whole case highlights how, in the absence of strong rule of law, China‚Äôs environmental management has taken the road of what I call ‚Äúinteraction without rules‚Äù. This brings its own set of problems.

On environmental issues, ‚Äúinteraction without rules‚Äù normally goes through three stages: first, local interest groups and local governments push ahead with a polluting project in violation of environmental regulations. Second, local people spontaneously organise mass protests against the project in question, an activity supported by neither law nor policy. And third, in response to the threat to social stability created by the protests, local government halts the project ‚Äì again, breaching laws. At every stage, the existing rules are lightly cast aside by all participants.

Take the Dalian case as an example: available material shows that construction of the PX project violated regulations. This major polluter is located just 20 kilometres from the city centre ‚Äì closer than is permitted by government standards. And the plant started production before the environmental authorities had even authorised trial operations. These serious breaches of process should themselves have led to severe sanctions, but thanks to local government support, the project quietly went ahead, out of public sight.

During the protests that followed, exaggerated claims about the dangers of PX spread like wildfire, while online videos show the demonstrations were more unruly than those against a waste incinerator in Panyu, Guangdong, two years ago, for example.

Then, in the third stage, the Dalian authorities ruled that the facility must move ‚Äì again without following due legal process or properly attributing responsibility, and leaving the taxpayers to foot the astronomical costs of relocation. As with the original decision to build the plant, the local government‚Äôs resolution to move it was not the result of due legal and administrative procedures, and there was no effective public participation or supervision.

We have seen many such cases in China in recent years. BASF‚Äôs Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) plant ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest ‚Äì near the sensitive Three Gorges reservoir; PetroChina‚Äôs ethylene plant in Pengzhou, Sichuan; another paraxylene factory in Xiamen, in the east coast province of Fujian: all of these were heavy chemical projects with serious pollution risks, all were initiated without public or environmental oversight ‚Äì and all resulted in public opposition.

When local governments use unconventional methods to build polluting projects, the public are forced to resort to unconventional means to protect their own interests. This kind of social interaction makes the management of environmental issues an even knottier task.

First of all, where local interest groups ignore existing regulations, they challenge the rule of law. These cases tend to involve local, state-owned enterprises or private businesses building polluting projects in breach of regulations with the tacit consent of the local government. This points to serious erosion of the authority of environmental law and environmental-protection officials. This erosion is often linked with corruption, which destroys trust between people and government, and can lead to social discontent and crisis. The disregard of the rules not only makes environmental issues more complex, but also affects government legitimacy and social stability.

Secondly, where there is ‚Äúinteraction without rules‚Äù, local interest groups become even more brazen in their pursuit of economic benefit, leading to greater environmental problems. Currently, an alliance between local interest groups and local government is forming localised ‚Äúgrowth machines‚Äù. These interest groups care only about their own development plans and group interests, and have control of the local economy. They are often driven to break free of the restrictions of state law and policy ‚Äì and sacrificing the environmental rights of ordinary citizens is not even an issue. The Dalian PX project was quietly started beyond the reaches of public supervision. This kind of furtive action demonstrates that local government and interest groups are acting deliberately and in full knowledge of the threat to public health posed by their projects.

Third, many members of the public, seeing that environmental management processes have been ignored during the construction of a polluting project, are forced to move beyond normal modes of political expression in order to protect their interests. The protests in Dalian can be considered a kind of mass action ‚Äì a gathering of a large number of people in a particular place, without organisation, in response to a particular stimulus or influence. For the Chinese people and government ‚Äì neither of which is familiar with the rules of mass action ‚Äì the growth in these types of protests points to social instability as well as rising costs of social management. One possibility is that ""interaction without rules"" between local government, local interest groups and the public will increase unpredictable social acts, and in those circumstances there is no way for proper environmental management to proceed.

But there is another possible outcome. If, during this process, local interest groups, government and people can reach a consensus on improving the social system, a foundation for comprehensive environmental management can be established. Positive interaction could solve the issue of environmental management at its roots.

The evolution of the Taiwanese environmental protection movement provides a successful example. During the 1960s, years of drought and salinisation led to a shortage of water for industrial development in the Gaoping River basin. Local government set to work on long term water-resource development, but plans to create a reservoir at Meinong triggered large-scale public opposition in the Gaoxiong region, and for a period relations between the people and government were tense. After the formation of the Gaoping Protection Green Alliance, however, proposals for better management of rivers and ecological restoration ‚Äì rather than just construction of a reservoir ‚Äì were put forward, and the government followed the advice.

Between 1961 and 2004, the movement went through five stages of development: formation of an agenda, confrontation, dialogue and communication, participation and cooperation and, lastly, propagation of best practices. Long-term methods for managing local water resources were established. The Gaoping campaign is now a model for joint environmental management by government and people.

We can spot similar positive elements in China‚Äôs environmental movement. Despite the gulf of understanding between the people and the government, the protests in Dalian still followed the rules of peaceful, non-violent protest. During the demonstrations, there were constant, spontaneous calls for order to be maintained, and reminders to participants not to act or speak too radically, so that interaction would be allowed to continue. Similar scenes were witnessed during the march against Xiamen PX in late 2007 and protests against a waste-incinerator in Guangzhou in 2009. Just how important public opinion is to local governments such as those in Dalian and Xiamen is reflected in how they handled the situation. Overall, in most public environmental campaigns, the public is better at respecting and acting in accordance with the law than local government.

Public campaigns are one way for the middle classes to appeal for social reform. In Taiwan, many campaigns sprung up at the same time ‚Äì in the 1980s, movements emerged against crime, pornography and nuclear power, as well as in support of environmental protection and consumer rights. These campaigns do not aim to overthrow the existing system, but to reform one part of society. Meanwhile on the mainland, factors including economic and educational development; public ideological awareness; government tolerance; and the appearance of new social action networks and organisers mean that public campaigns are also on the rise ‚Äì including environmental movements.

We can expect these campaigns to be a long-term trend that develops in parallel with the growth of the middle classes. Experience from environmental campaigns in places such as Taiwan shows it is the public who push forward the environmental agenda, but ultimately the spark for positive interaction and system reform needs to come from the government.

1729,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"NDMA told to liaise with Sindh, KP over flood damage assessment - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1578458,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan has directed National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) chairman Lt Gen Mohammad Afzal to coordinate with the governments of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to assess the damage caused by recent floods and heavy rains in the provinces in order to help the federal and provincial authorities devise a strategy for compensation of the losses.

The directives were issued by the prime minister while presiding over a meeting of the National Coordination Committee on Floods here on Monday, according to an announcement by the PM Office.

Besides the NDMA chief, the meeting was attended by federal Minister for Information Shibli Faraz, Communications Minister Murad Saeed, Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda, the director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the chairmen of the National Highways Authority and Federal Flood Commission (FFC).

The provincial chief secretaries also participated in the meeting through a video link. The chief secretaries informed the prime minister about the damages caused by recent floods and rains in their respective provinces.

The NDMA chairman briefed the prime minister on the situation in various parts of the country after the recent spells of monsoon and the damages caused by these heavy rains. He also apprised the prime minister about the relief activities being carried out by the NDMA in different parts of the country affected due to rains.

Meeting reviews relief activities being carried out in rain-affected areas

The officials of the PMD and Flood Commission informed the prime minister that most parts of the country, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, had received more rains than the past. The meeting participants were informed that almost all the rivers were having medium flow of water.

The prime minister was told that there were strong chances that the ongoing monsoon season would come to an end by the middle of this month and the chances of more flood-like situation were very low.

The meetings participants were also apprised about the relief operation being carried out by the countrys armed forces.

Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister stressed the need for more coordination among all the federal and provincial departments concerned to face the challenge they were facing due to climate changes.

PM Khan was also informed that all dams in the country were full of water and the situation of water availability was satisfactory.

The countrys major reservoirs had already reached their full capacity last month following the countrywide rainfalls and both Tarbela and Mangla dams had attained their maximum conservation levels.

The FFC attributes the filling of dams to effective management of inflows and outflows of the reservoirs, especially by Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).

It has advised the dams operating authorities, including the Flood Monitoring Cell of Mangla, Irsa (Indus River System Authority) and the PMD, to take utmost care and exercise extra vigilance of the reservoirs operation.

The combined live storage of major reservoirs  Tarbela, Mangla and Chashma  was reported at 13.425 million acre feet (MAF) on Aug 28, which accounted for 98.61 per cent of the 13.614 MAF maximum storage capacity, a record water availability during last 10 years.

According to Wapda, water available in Tarbela and Mangla dams was 2.173 MAF more when compared to last 10 years average. The average water availability in the two dams during the last 10 years on the day was recorded at 11.163 MAF.

This better hydrological situation will aptly fulfil the requirement of water for the countrys agriculture in the days to come. More water availability in the reservoirs will also result in more hydel generation in the coming days.

The heavy rainfall spell occurred over the past few days in various parts of Sindh, especially Karachi, had caused severe urban flooding in the provincial capital.

The prime minister had visited Karachi last week and in the presence of Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah unveiled a package of Rs1.1 trillion at Governor House to resolve Karachis lingering and chronic issues, including provision of clean drinking water, cleaning of drains and sewage and solid waste disposal within three years.

Later, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari stated that the Sindh government would contribute Rs800 billion to the Rs1.1tr package for Karachi, saying that they welcome the Rs300 billion funding from the federal government for Karachis infrastructure development.

On Sunday, however, federal Minister for Planning and Special Initiatives Asad Umar of PTI told a press conference that the federal government would bear 62 per cent of the total amount of Rs1,100 billion announced by the prime minister.

813,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Hurricane Katia Spotted from Space - Space.com,https://www.space.com/12816-hurricane-katia-space-photos.html,"Katia was a tropical storm gathering energy over the Atlantic Ocean when one of the Expedition 28 crew took this photo on Aug. 31, 2011, from aboard the International Space Station. Two Russian spacecraft -- a Progress and a Soyuz --can be seen parked at the orbital outpost on the left side of the frame.

Hurricane Katia can't seem to decide what it wants to be ‚Äî after becoming a hurricane on Wednesday night (Aug. 31) it then dropped back down to tropical storm strength, but has since climbed back up to Category 1 hurricane status.

The Expedition 28 crew aboard the International Space Station took this photo of Katia when it was still a burgeoning tropical storm earlier in the week as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean. [Astronaut's space photo of Katia]

Astronauts aboard the orbiting laboratory caught several glimpses of Hurricane Irene from space and remarked on its awesome size.

Katia has winds of 75 mph (120 kph), just above the threshold for hurricane status. The storm is expected to strengthen in the next 48 hours and could become a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength) by the middle of next week.

Katia is still far out at sea -- some 705 miles (1,135 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands -- so it is too early to tell yet whether it will pose a threat the U.S. East Coast, which is still recovering from the damage wrought by Irene.

When the GOES-13 satellite passed over Katia (right, center) on Aug. 30, 2011, just after daylight reached it in the Atlantic, it revealed a well-developed storm. The bright vertical line on the Earth shows daylight to the east of the line, and imagery is visible. (Image credit: NASA/NOAA GOES Project )

Another space snapshot from the GOES 13 satellite revealed a stunning view of Katia and much of the Earth in a stunning view from orbit. That image was also taken while Katia was a tropical storm. [See the amazing GOES 13 view of Katia]

Hurricane Katia is the second hurricane to form during the 2011 hurricane season, which has been predicted to spawn an above-average 14 to 19 named storms (which include tropical storms and hurricanes), seven to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season will see 11 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes.

August through October are the peak months of the Atlantic hurricane season.

Forecasters and Gulf Coast residents are also keeping an eye on Tropical Depression 13, which is poised to dump up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain in some areas along the drought-plagued southern states.

1462,FL-2021-000021-IND,Glacier burst ripples: UP likely to escape flash flood fury in downstream Ganga - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-rivers-unlikely-to-bear-the-bruntof-uttarakhand-flash-flood-experts/articleshow/80740433.cms,"Mud and slash are seen in the Dhauliganga River after a portion of Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Tapovan area of the northern state of Uttarakhand. (AP)

LUCKNOW: The glacier burst in Reni village of Chamoli in Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand on Sunday is unlikely to have any adverse impact on river water levels in Uttar Pradesh.

According to experts from the Geological Survey of India, Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences and other scientific institutes in the city, the effect of the outbreak will fizzle out by the time it reaches the plains, therefore, water levels of river Ganga in Allahabad, Varanasi, Kanpur and other UP cities are not expected to go above danger mark.

Glaciologist and former deputy director general & head of northern region, Geological Survey of India, Siddharth Swaroop said, ‚ÄúPrima facie, it appears that the glacier burst in Rishi Ganga catchment eventually resulted in reservoir collapse and consequential flash floods.‚Äù

He said Rishi Ganga was a tributary of river Dhauliganga, which has its confluence with river Alaknanda, near Joshimath.

‚ÄúDownstream of its confluence with Bhagirathi river at Devprayag, it is called Ganga which flows through major UP cities like Kanpur, Allahabad and Varanasi. Check on the flow of Bhagirathi river and other adequate measures undertaken by SDRF and NDRF teams, the river with reduced flow and velocity is not expected to rise above danger mark in UP,‚Äù he added.

Director (Glaciology division) of the Geological Survey of India, Rakesh Mishra, said the water flow would lose force by the time it reaches the plains.

As per the inventory prepared by GSI on glacial lakes in Uttarakhand, at least 71 lakes of different size and types are there in the upper reaches of Rishiganga and Dhauliganga valley. GSI needs to find out the focal point of the flash flood, Mishra added.

‚ÄúIt is not clear if the flood is a typical Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) or some temporary damming due to a landslide and avalanche that might have blocked the mainstream to form a temporary lake which bursted. Once the water level recedes, a team of experts will assess the damage as well as the factor that triggered the disaster,‚Äù he said.

Former scientist at Remote Sensing Application Centre (RSAC), AK Tangri, who has been carrying out research in the field for last three decades, said: ‚ÄúThe impact is likely to be observed in upper reaches and may even increase the water level to some extent at Rishikesh and Haridwar but would not leave much impact in Uttar Pradesh.‚Äù

Similar views were expressed by glacier expert and senior scientists at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences, Anupam Sharma.

‚ÄúThe Ganga meanders as it enters the plains due to which the velocity of water goes down. Since there is no rain, there is no likelihood of any adverse impact in the state,‚Äù environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta said.

736,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana Institute of Surveyors to Get Rid of Quacks - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907230445.html,"Kumasi ‚Äî The Ghana Institute of Surveyors is to embark on an exercise to get rid of quack surveyors duping the unsuspecting public.

According to the President of the Institute, Maame Ama Edumadze Acquah, the exercise would be effective as they look forward to the passage of a bill to regulate their profession.

She was interacting with the Ghanaian Times during the Institute's 50th anniversary celebration in Kumasi on Friday.

She said the passage of the Survey Council Act in Parliament would regulate the activities of surveyors in the country, lamenting that some unscrupulous people who had no certification were engaging in deceitful conduct.

The president noted that the passage of the law would align them with international standards, and called on surveyors to acquire leadership skills to help influence decision making for institutional change.

It was time, she said, surveyors took strategic decisions for the development of the country and citizenry, so that the number of people who would be living in urban areas would not suffer.

She said, ""This process will bring about structural development, possibly in the urban centres, so when surveyors equip themselves early to adjust to the change, which will definitely happen; it will be timely for all.""

Maame Ama Edumadze observed that when measures were put in place on time to save the lands, roads, transport and other land administration processes in the country, the poor, vulnerable and rich would be saved accordingly.

On the anniversary, the president explained that it was the key objective of the institution like surveyors to position the profession by articulating the professionals' role as effective leaders to promote and implement infrastructure to the best of standards.

The anniversary which was on the theme: 'Surveying Practice in Ghana, Celebrating the Past, Redefining the Future', brought together land professionals to discuss and increase participants' influence of becoming more familiar with the process of leading change.

For his part, the Chairman of the Institute, Kofi Cobbold, stressed the need for surveyors to embrace technology as a potential instrument in their profession.

He said the introduction of the digital information system had created an opportunity for the surveyors to use technology for planning and effective management of resources.

Mr Cobbold said technology was pervasive in all aspects of life, with land surveying also stepping up the pace of technology use.

He added that, land surveying had been an important factor in human civilisation since ancient history, as many kinds of surveying equipment had been used in the past to help land surveyors measure various parameters of land areas.",2019-07-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['institute', 'technology', 'president', 'rid', 'process', 'surveying', 'quacks', 'effective', 'surveyors', 'passage', 'ghana', 'land']",Ghana,news article,English
