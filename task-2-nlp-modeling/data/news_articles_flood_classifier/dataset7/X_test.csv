1266,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Karachi: flood management and governance - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2259093/karachi-flood-management-and-governance,"A new debate has erupted over managing floods in Karachi and the directions of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to clear waste from the drains of Karachi due to heavy rainfall. Acrimonious discussions with a blame game against each other were witnessed on TV talk shows between the representatives of the PTI government, the PPP government in Sindh as well as the MQM.

The PPP sees sinister design behind the move to undermine the authority and image of the Sindh government, portraying it as an example of poor governance. Their contention was that Lahore had also been inundated with floods but neither hue and cry was created nor was FWO sent there. Their argument had been that whatever and wherever something goes wrong, the federal government finds the Sindh government as a punching bag to divert peoples attention from their own failures. Be it the sugar crisis, wheat shortage, fuel shortage, rising food inflation or the postings and transfers, the federal government tries to pass the buck to the Sindh government.

The general public is watching all the melodrama with anguish and anxiety. The intervention of the federal government would have gone unnoticed, had it not been with a political motive, belittling the Sindh government. The federal government and provinces do not work in tight compartments, rather they supplement each other within the contours of the Constitution and law. But, when the Governor of Sindh  instead of acting as a representative of the federal government and constitutional head of the province bound to act on the advice of the Chief Executive of the province  starts issuing statements to browbeat the Chief Minister, then it certainly develops irritation and is not taken in a normal course.

No doubt, Karachi, being a metropolitan city has its own problems, but similar problems also exist in all cities of Pakistan. Karachi being the biggest city and economic hub attracts migrants from all over the country and has expanded in all directions without proper town planning. Therefor the problems of Karachi are of a greater magnitude.

Within the ambit of the Constitution it is the responsibility of the Government of Sindh and the local government to provide civic amenities to their citizens, which of course include waste management, desilting and clearance of drains. Rainfall in Karachi causing floods is not a rare phenomenon, it happens with recurrence. This nature of problem may be described as a calamity, hence falling within the purview of the NDMA. In this context, preparedness is one of the essentials of disaster management followed by prevention, mitigation of sufferings and community awareness. But, unfortunately governments have been found negligent in their preparation to deal with such crises.

Disaster management or crisis management has a direct co-relation with governance. Governance is all about delivery within time and action of all tiers of government in unison to add synergy to their efforts. In such a situation KMC, DHA, Cantonments, Port Qasim Authority, Irrigation Department and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) with a lead role of the provincial government should have set a strategy to deal with such an eventuality.

The Sindh government could have easily managed excavators, dumpers or other machinery available on rent in the market. Roughly the rent of an excavator is not more than Rs500,000 per week. If the funds were not available with the respective departments, the Chief Minister should have set aside the funds from his own discretionary grant or re-appropriated in order to escape criticism.

While the Sindh government has its own share of blame, the NDMA has its own role to play. The authority has its own National Disaster and Risk Management plan. According to the Act and plan, the PDMA and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) are the coordinating units. Therefore, NDMA has to work through those bodies. In such a scenario, NDMA should have shifted all the resources to PDMA and FWO should have also been at the disposal of the provincial government to avoid political point scoring.

Although with a knee-jerk reaction to the malaise symptomatic treatment has been meted out, the main cause has not been removed. This problem has erupted due to massive encroachments in the nullahs, drains, riverbed, poor designing and construction of roads and bridges. This again is a reflection of poor governance. Rule of law is the foundation of governance. We have all kinds of laws but implementation is missing, hence this mess. As the saying goes, nip the evil in the bud but the departments assigned to do the task close their eyes to the initial violation and with the passage of time the problem grows such magnitude that all wonder what to do.

Karachi being a port city is now considered to be a city of all. The population of the city is growing at a fast pace, so are the problems. Governments, particularly city governments in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, have been managing well. Why not we? A deeper study of their governance reveals the underlying factor: adherence to the rule of law. It is high time for all stakeholders, including the federal government, to implement the law and remove all encroachments done in violation of the law and set aside funds ahead of the monsoon rains. This is the only way out and a permanent solution. This applies to all cities of Pakistan, including the federal capital.

Violent rain has killed scores of people and forced thousands from their homes this year in Brazil's most populous states, a disaster experts blame on climate upheaval but also rampant urbanization.

Flash floods, landslides and other havoc wrought by torrential rain have killed at least 29 people in recent days in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Another 25 are missing.

That comes after more than 50 people were killed by heavy rain that devastated the state of Minas Gerais in January.

The same scenes of destruction have played out in all three southeastern states, together home to more than 83 million people: poor neighborhoods wiped out by tidal waves of brown mud; houses and cars swept away by flash floods; residents evacuated by boat and helicopter as their streets turn to gushing rivers.

More than three million people live in high-risk zones in Brazil's southeast, which has been hit by record rain this year—in some places, a month's worth in a matter of hours.

As dozens of rescue workers dug through the debris of wrecked houses for his missing mother, stepfather and sister-in-law, one of those affected, 24-year-old Yago de Sousa Nunes, voiced frustration that the authorities did not do more to protect the at-risk population.

""The city government knew this was a high-risk zone, they knew how much rain was going to fall this week, but they didn't do anything to evacuate people,"" he said alongside the ruins of the Barreira de Joao Guarda neighborhood, in the coastal city of Guaruja, Sao Paulo.

Extreme weather

Is climate change to blame?

Experts say more studies are needed to be sure.

But there is no doubt the region is experiencing ""an increase in extreme weather events,"" said Andrea Ramos of the National Meteorological Institute.

This year, the rainy season in southeastern Brazil has been marked by extremes, said Marcelo Seluchi of the Natural Disaster Monitoring and Alert Center (Cemaden): very dry in the first half of the summer, then very wet from mid-January on.

""The planet is heating up, that's beyond doubt. It's more humid than 50 or 100 years ago, which means the same weather systems have more potential to create rain,"" he said.

That has combined with the rampant expansion of urban areas to increase people's vulnerability to floods.

Brazil's biggest cities have seen decades of nearly unchecked growth, as poor migrants arrive and settle wherever they can, often building unstable shantytowns on hillsides or the extreme city outskirts.

""Population growth and the growth of cities means we're replacing vegetation with cement, and that's where a long-standing problem in Brazil comes into play: lots of building on high-risk areas,"" Seluchi told AFP.

More than half the population of the southeast region's state capitals—Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Vitoria—lives in at-risk zones. And 80 percent of those people are ""highly vulnerable: they live in very precarious houses, with high population density and a high percentage of children and the elderly,"" he said.

Housing problem

Rio de Janeiro's Mayor Marcelo Crivella, a far-right evangelical Christian bishop, caused outrage amid the floods when he blamed residents for the destruction.

""People like to live close (to flood-prone rivers and gulleys) because they spend less on sewage pipes for their pee and poop,"" he said.

Unaffordable housing costs have forced the urban poor into areas unfit for settlements, said Henrique Evers, an urban development expert at the World Resources Institute.

""Planning housing for vulnerable populations near urban services is one of the best ways to deal with this challenge,"" he said.

856,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Demonizing and Dehumanizing Iran – LobeLog - LobeLog,https://lobelog.com/demonizing-and-dehumanizing-iran/,"by Shireen Hunter

Commenting on the devastating and widespread floods that have engulfed 26 of Iran’s 31 provinces, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo essentially blamed this huge natural disaster on the Iranian government’s mismanagement. He has a valid point. By undoing all earlier reforms, Iran’s revolutionary government allowed predatory forces to take over national and private lands and to build whatever they wanted, wherever they wanted, including in dry river beds. In a hurry to get rich, the new clerical and revolutionary elites and their offspring ignored all environmental safety measures.

Thus, throughout the last four decades there was no adequate maintenance of riverbeds, including regular cleaning and proper management of water resources. Then came a dam-building mania without sufficient study of environmental consequences. Refusal to use foreign experts on the pretext of self-sufficiency contributed to serious engineering shortcomings. The IRGC construction arm built most of these dams, which was a highly lucrative endeavor. The best example is the Gatwand dam in Khuzestan Province, which is now devastated by floods. Other mistakes have included building railroads in flood plains and paving over dry riverbeds.

Meanwhile, foreign military adventures took funds away from needed domestic water-management projects. The leadership’s foreign policy mistakes—especially fighting against so-called imperialism, or as the Supreme Leader recently said, battling evil—dried up international commerce and investment and stopped the flow of technology, even before the harshest of American sanctions were imposed.

Iran’s mistakes, however, do not excuse the heartlessness of the Trump administration’s policy of doing all it can to prevent aid to Iran’s flood victims. The American sanctions policy regarding Iran is like a medieval siege aimed at starving the enemy by exhausting its food resources until it surrenders.

Iran’s Islamic government began the process of mutual alienation that has produced the lack of U.S. compassion. Those who staged the 1979-81 hostage crisis bear a great responsibility in generating current American hostility. They are also responsible for the revolution’s radical turn that has caused tremendous damage to Iran and the Iranian people. Also, without the hostage crisis, Iraq’s Saddam Hussein could not have gotten away with invading Iran. Another factor was Ayatollah Khomeini’s decision to make the fight against America the cornerstone of the revolutionary regime in revenge for what he saw as American support for the shah.

Since the late 1980s, however, it has largely been the United States that has refused the path of reconciliation unless Iran completely surrenders. In the process, it has undermined moderate forces in Iran. Its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which undercut those Iranians who argued that a different relationship with the United States could be possible, is only the latest example of this approach.

After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, America and some of its regional allies have found in Iran a convenient enemy figure and scapegoat for their own policy mistakes. Thus, using the Iran scarecrow, they sold billions of dollars’ worth of arms to Arabs. They’ve tried to bring about Arab-Israeli reconciliation, not as a genuine effort to resolve the Palestinian problem but rather to reinforce common enmity toward Iran. Lately, the apocalyptic outlook of some key U.S. political figures has further consolidated Iran’s enemy image.

As part of this strategy, there has been a systematic efforts in the United States for the past 30 years to demonize not only the Islamic regime but Iran and its people. Even Iran’s pre-Islamic history has not been immune to this demonization. Some years ago, a well-known Iran analyst said that Iran was responsible for the very creation of evil, not just its recognition or identification. Hollywood movies have mined the history of Greco-Persian relations, portraying Iranians as savages, conveniently forgetting how Alexander burned Persepolis and killed or exiled its inhabitants.

For centuries, much of the West has defined itself against Iran, beginning with ancient Greece. Yet Greek thought and aesthetics were influenced by Iran; Persepolis was the inspiration for the Pantheon. Iran was one of the few places in the known ancient world that Rome did not conquer. Thus, Iran has always represented an intellectual rival and not merely a military challenge to the West. Europe’s post-Christian secular identity, built on this Greco-Roman heritage, consolidated this old view of Iran in modern European minds and thus also in America’s.

Over the centuries, Iran and its indigenous culture have been much diminished. But there is still a spark underneath the ashes of a once glorious civilization, which periodically seeks a renaissance. But often it has succumbed to its own and its leaders’ weaknesses as well as the policies of other powers. In the last 250 years, this has meant colonial or neo-imperialist powers.

Given this history, current U.S. attitudes toward victims of the recent flooding is no surprise. What is important is whether Iran, as a fundamentalist Islamic state or something else, is doomed to eternal enmity with the United States or whether the two countries can find common ground. As long as the current team is in Washington and hardliners continue to sacrifice Iran’s national interest in pursuit of some unattainable Islamist utopia, there is no room for optimism.",2019-04-09 20:11:57+00:00,"['islamic', 'american', 'history', 'policy', 'iran', 'demonizing', 'dehumanizing', 'states', 'revolutionary', 'mistakes', 'irans', 'united']",Iran,news article,English
978,FL-2020-000038-EGY,A River that Belongs to None: The Nile River Dispute - The Colgate Maroon-News,https://thecolgatemaroonnews.com/25209/commentary/a-river-that-belongs-to-none-the-nile-river-dispute/,"The Nile River, for all of its recent history, has been a crucial geographic feature in Africa’s landscape. The fertile lands around the Nile have provided livable and farmable land to its inhabitants. In modern times, the Nile has been a hotly contested resource. Since Egypt completed the Aswan Dam in 1970, the first modern dam of the Nile, Egyptians have depended on it for water, flood control and electricity. Several dams have been built since then, but the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), begun in 2011 and now near completion, has generated turmoil among several powerful African nations and their allies. While the GERD is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa, its situation along the Blue Nile is currently one of the most contentious political and economic situations in Africa. The question of sustainability is at the core of this current crisis.

Ethiopia and Egypt have butted heads ever since construction began; from the Egyptian point of view, the dam is a detriment to the country’s potential. Egypt claims the dam will cut off water supplies to the south; any amount of water loss is problematic, as the Nile provides Egypt 90% of its water. Since the only farmable land in Egypt lies within a couple of miles of the river, Egypt doesn’t produce enough food to feed its whole population; as a result, Egypt is an import-reliant economy. The Egyptian government doesn’t want to make their food insufficiency worse by conceding water rights to Ethiopia. However, with construction almost complete, Egypt’s focus has turned to the filling of the dam. The two countries mainly disagree over how long the new reservoir would take to fill up.

For Ethiopia, the country’s economic ambitions hinge on the completion and success of the dam. The dam will be the country’s largest-ever public works project in its history and will help solve Ethiopia’s energy shortage (60% of Ethiopians have no electricity). While Egypt has conceded that the completion of the dam is inevitable, there is still incredible tension. Negotiations have come to a halt, as Ethiopia and Egypt disagree upon the filling time. While Egypt wants Ethiopia to gradually fill up the dam over twelve years, Ethiopia hopes to fill it in six. Because of the lack of negotiating progress, the United States recently withdrew $130 million of aid to Ethiopia. A lot is at stake for both Ethiopia and Egypt. On one hand, Ethiopia is shouldering most of the cost of the dam and would like to get a return on their investment as soon as possible. On the other, the dam could exacerbate Egypt’s already significant water insecurity.

Tensions have risen so high that the Ethiopian government has banned flights over the dam for security reasons. With Ethiopia taking such strong safety precautions, it’s probable the government foresees future non-diplomatic measures being taken by Egypt if negotiations don’t progress. Ethiopia has also just announced they have achieved one year of filling, and that the dam will start generating electricity in the next twelve months.

Climate change and sustainability are at the heart of this debate. Sudan is experiencing its worst floods in recent history, crippling an emerging country that has struggled with violence, disease and political turmoil. The Nile River Delta, where 40-50 million Egyptians live, could be partially underwater soon if sea levels rise. Additionally, the area is becoming less fertile as a result of sediments caught in the Aswan Dam; another huge dam will only worsen the problem. Saltwater intrusion also is lowering farmer’s outputs already, and the problem will only get worse. The flooding every year is devastating; however, the drought that an impending climate crisis will bring will be more devastating.

The issue of Nile water availability is a microcosm of the region’s slowly manifesting confrontation with climate change. Finding agreement on the dam’s filling has been difficult because the lifeblood of several African countries depends on the outcome. Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia can find a suitable agreement for all parties on the filling of the dam, but only if each country makes concessions. With Egypt historically being in control of the Nile, it’s going to be difficult to give up the regional hegemony they’ve enjoyed over the Nile’s water. The Nile is a shared resource, and the countries it runs through must find a fair agreement to make sure it stays that way. Finding an agreement soon is crucial. Ethiopia has already filled the dam with a year’s worth of water and will fill it up as fast as possible if negotiations remain stalled. Once they find a solution, the countries can move on together to face the biggest threat to the region’s health and existence: climate change.",2020-10-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['belongs', 'egypt', 'water', 'ethiopia', 'agreement', 'soon', 'nile', 'dispute', 'countries', 'dam', 'river', 'filling']",Egypt,news article,English
1141,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Kenya: Mumias Sends 800 Workers Home Over Shortage of Molasses - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202104150680.html,"Mumias Sugar Company sent home more than 800 workers on Wednesday after the limping miller stopped operations due to lack of raw materials.

The financially crippled firm was producing ethanol after milling of sugar stalled over two years ago. It was doing close to 150,000 litres in two shifts, boosted by the high demand for alcohol needed in the production of hand sanitiser.

The receiver manager appointed by the Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Ponangipalli Venkata Ramana, told staff a shortage of molasses had forced them to close shop indefinitely.

The miller had been relying on raw materials from private factories in the region, such as Butali Sugar Mills, Nzoia Sugar Company and the Busia Sugar Factory.

The shortage is reportedly linked to traders who have been selling molasses to firms in Uganda, where they fetch up to Sh20,000 per tonne compared to Sh10,000 locally.

Other reports attributed the shutdown to challenges involving the management of the revenue generated from the sale of over a million litres of ethanol over the past 19 months.

""We usually ensure that we have a minimum of 3,000 tonnes of molasses before we start ethanol production,"" said an employee.

""We have been away for close to a month. We have been asked to stay away but there has been no communication on whether we will keep our jobs or not.""

The miller has been struggling with debts, ageing equipment and cane shortage despite a Sh3.6 billion government bailout.

Mumias' loans stood at Sh12.5 billion as of June 2018. It owed Ecobank Kenya Sh2 billion, French development finance institution Proparco Sh1.9 billion and Commercial Bank of Africa Sh401 million.

Other creditors are the Treasury (Sh3.1 billion) and Kenya Sugar Board (Sh1.6 billion). Mumias was also operating on bank overdrafts worth Sh2.7 billion from various lenders.

A fortnight ago, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya inspected the factory with a team from KCB and a 'potential investor'.

""My instructions were to take him (investor) around the factory so that he does due diligence and make a decision,"" said Mumias lawyer, Patrick Mutuli.

According to the Sugar Task Force report, which was presented to President Kenyatta in February last year, the miller is indebted to the tune of Sh20 billion.

The government promised to act on all the recommendations but there has been a delay in the implementation of the report.

The county government plans to advance loans to farmers to ensure adequate raw material is available for delivery to the miller when operations resume.

Private millers have in the past been competing for cane, leading to conflicts and shortage of raw material.",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,[],Kenya,news article,English
743,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Mozambique: Urgent Humanitarian Priorities - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-urgent-humanitarian-priorities,"KEY MESSAGES

Across Mozambique 2.5 million people are in urgent need of assistance following multiple and consecutive shocks—including drought, cyclones, floods and insecurity. Within this context, the revised Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) targets the priority life-saving and life-sustaining needs of the 2 million hardest-hit people.

Humanitarian partners have massively scaled-up operations in Mozambique in 2019, thanks to nearly US$300 million generously contributed by donors. At least 1.9 million people have received food assistance, more than 704,000 children have been screened for acute malnutrition and 406,000 people have received critical emergency livelihoods support. More than 765,000 households have received kits that support their access to clean water and sanitation, including dignity kits for women and girls, and 115,000 households have received shelter assistance. More than 464,000 children impacted by the disasters have been reached with education services, and 386,000 women and girls have been reached with programmes aimed at reducing gender-based violence and supporting survivors.

Critical gaps remain, however, and additional funding is urgently required as the country approaches the peak of the lean season and the annual cyclone period. Funding is needed to enable partners to rapidly scale up in hard-to-reach, at-risk and insecure areas, most notably in Sofala, Manica and Cabo Delgado provinces. The road to recovery and reconstruction has been long, and more than half a million people are still living in destroyed or damaged homes or makeshift shelters nine months after Cyclone Idai and eight months after Kenneth. Another nearly 92,500 people remain displaced across 71 resettlement sites in the central and northern regions of the country, in dire need of food, water, education, shelter/NFIs, WASH, health and protection services. From January to March (the peak of the lean season), severely food insecure people will face their greatest needs since the cyclones, while at least 65,000 people are estimated to have been affected and/or displaced by insecurity in Cabo Delgado. For the first time in many years, pellagra (a vitamin B-3 deficiency) has been reported in the country, with over 3,500 cases identified to date.

Mozambique, on average, is hit by 1.5 cyclones each year, and the 2019/2020 season is expected to bring at least one major storm. Humanitarians were able to respond to Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019 in large part due to strategically pre-positioned stocks. However, emergency stocks in Mozambique have been exhausted due to the exceptional scale of the humanitarian response in 2019. Just over $597,100 is required immediately to replenish these supplies. Without this, humanitarians will be unable to respond rapidly and at scale should a major storm arrive in 2020.

Humanitarians have rigorously reviewed their programmes and funding and, out of the $405.3 million still required under the HRP, are prioritizing the mobilization of $119.3 million that is absolutely critical to save lives and alleviate suffering between now and May 2020. If this funding is not urgently received, hundreds of thousands of people in desperate need across the country will be unable to access life-saving and life-sustaining assistance.",2019-12-20 08:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'humanitarian', 'required', 'cyclones', 'received', 'funding', 'assistance', 'million', 'urgent', 'country', 'season', 'scale', 'priorities', 'need']",Mozambique,news article,English

Addressing parliament on Monday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that “Australia is being tested once again”.

“The east coast of Australia, predominantly New South Wales but also in southeast Queensland, has experienced an extraordinary deluge over recent days,” he said.

Rains are expected for at least the next 24 and 48 hours, Mr Morrison said. “Some parts of New South Wales are experiencing the worst flooding in 50 years, from Penrith to the north of Port Macquarie,” he said.

Jane Golding, an official at the bureau of meteorology, warned that heavy rains will hit large parts of the east coast from Monday “due to the combination of a tropical low over northern Western Australia and a coastal trough off New South Wales”.

Rains also caused dams and rivers to overflow around Sydney and southeast Queensland. Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water source, spilled over on Saturday, adding to swollen rivers.

Widespread destruction has been reported in the affected areas as floods damaged roads, swept away houses and disrupted power supply.

New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian said 38 regions have been declared disaster zones. “I don’t know any time in a state history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic,” she said.

Emergency services have received more than 8,000 calls for help since the rains began on Thursday and have rescued hundreds of people from floodwaters.

New South Wales State Emergency Service commander Michael Ward said several affected people don’t know what to do. “We have a number of concerns for welfare, so we’re working through those. What obviously happens is that everyone relies on the mobile phone. And when they haven’t had power for two days, they stop working,” he told ABC News.

The extreme weather conditions have also affected Australia’s drive to vaccinate its population against Covid-19.

Grain and bean futures jumped in overnight trading on concerns about adverse global weather.

Little to no rain is expected in at least the next couple of weeks for Brazil’s safrinha corn crop, according to several weather forecasters.

WXRisk said over the weekend that no rain fell anywhere in Brazil Friday or Saturday and that the weather in the South American country is “fairly hot” for this time of year.

The forecaster sees no significant rainfall in Brazil for at least the next couple of weeks.

Consultancy Safras & Mercado on Friday lowered its projection for Brazil’s total corn output to 104.1 million metric tons due to the dry weather, an 8% decline from its previous outlook.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture last month forecast Brazilian corn production at 109 million metric tons, up from 102 million tons the previous year.

Demand also has been strong in recent days as an unnamed country bought 101,600 metric tons of corn, the USDA said on April 27.

A day earlier, the agency reported sales of 120,000 metric tons of soybeans to an unknown country.

Corn futures for July delivery jumped 14 1/4¢ to $6.87 ½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade.

Wheat futures for July delivery rose 6 1/4¢ to $7.41 a bushel, while Kansas City futures added 8 1/4¢ to $7.11 ¾ a bushel.

Soybean futures for July delivery surged 9 1/2¢ to $15.43 ¾ a bushel. Soymeal fell $2.80 to $423.30 a short ton, and soy oil gained 1.79¢ to 64.18¢ a pound.

2. Speculators Increase Their Bullish Bets in Soybeans and Wheat

**

Money manager increased their net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, in soybeans and wheat last week while reducing their bullish bets on corn futures, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Speculators in the seven days that ended on April 27 raised their net longs in soybeans to 168,851 futures contracts, the CFTC said in a report.

That’s up from 160,094 contracts a week earlier and the highest level since the week that ended on Dec. 29, the agency said.

Investors also raised their bullish bets on hard-red winter wheat to a net-30,111 futures contracts last week, up from 18,608 contracts the previous week. That’s the largest such position since March 16.

For soft-red winter futures, investors turned bullish and held a net-long position of 7,210 contracts, the CFTC said. That’s a shift from a net-short position, or bets on lower prices, of 3,697 contracts a week earlier.

Net longs in corn, meanwhile, declined to 362,238 futures contracts last week, down from 380,083 contracts seven days earlier.

That’s the smallest bullish position since the week that ended on March 16, the government said in its report.

Adverse weather in South America and the U.S. has hedge-fund managers and other large investors worried about production while global demand for agricultural commodities has been robust.

The weekly Commitment of Traders report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows trader positions in futures markets.

The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

3. Flood Warnings Issued in Nebraska While Storms Possible in the Southern Plains

Flood warnings and advisories are in effect in parts of eastern Nebraska and Kansas as more rain falls in the region, according to the National Weather Service.

“Due to narrow corridors of heavy rain in excess of 2 inches that fell Sunday evening into early this morning, either a flood warning or flood advisory remain in effect this morning for” parts of several Nebraska counties, the NWS said in a report early this morning.

A frost advisory also has been issued for late tonight through Tuesday morning.

In the southern Plains, where hard-red winter wheat is growing, thunderstorms are possible today and tonight, though severe weather isn’t expected.

Storms are forecast in eastern portions of the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, the NWS said.

In northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin, meanwhile, there’s a “significant thunderstorm risk” today and tonight as damaging wind gusts of up to 60 miles an hour and large hail are forecast.

“While not the primary hazard, a brief tornado cannot be ruled out,” the agency said. “The severe threat may diminish with eastward extent into northwest Indiana.”",2021-05-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['traders', 'corn', 'bullish', 'position', 'weather', 'contracts', 'bets', 'things', 'futures', 'week', 'today', 'big', '2021', 'tons']",Brazil,news article,English

A court in the tiny island of Feydhoo last week sentenced the 15-year-old to 100 lashes after she admitted to having consensual sex, a court official said.

The official said details of the consensual sex emerged when police investigated her complaint against her stepfather and another man of sexually abusing her.

Government spokesman Masood Imad said the government considered her a victim of sexual abuse and wants the sentence revoked.

“The government fully understands she is a victim. Since this is an Islamic affair we don’t want to unilaterally say things,” Mr. Imad said.

The practice of flogging for sex outside marriage has been widely condemned and it is often the woman who is singled out for punishment.

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay in 2011 urged Maldives to end the “degrading” practice.

“This practice constitutes one of the most inhumane and degrading forms of violence against women, and should have no place in the legal framework of a democratic country,” she said speaking at the Maldives Parliament.

On the night of October 11, Le Trung Lam, a resident of the central town, braved the floods to go and pick up some migrant students who had been marooned in their inundated home for days. He took them to his company on Ngu Binh Street, An Tay Ward, where 30 people were already sheltering.

They cook in the kitchen and eat three meals a day, and also have blankets, mattresses and electricity.

Three days earlier, many students from other places now studying in Hue, had no idea where to shelter as the floodwaters rose relentlessly and inundated their homes. Then Lam's message arrived out of the blue.

He said: ""The company's headquarters, a five-floor building, is situated on Ngu Binh Mountain, and so the water has not reached it yet. Its two top floors have 10 rooms each that can accommodate 20-30 people.""

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential downpours in central Vietnam for a week now have killed 29 as of Tuesday morning. Among the deaths, six are from Thua Thien-Hue Province, home to Hue.

Lam, 33, decided to turn his company into a shelter on October 8 as the waters reached some major roads and were expected to rise further. Driving around the town to check on the flood situation and how people were coping, he passed by the studio apartment where he himself had lived 15 years ago as a migrant student from central Nghe An Province. He too had suffered during flooding.

Fearing for students who were possibly cut off, he posted an announcement that he was willing to shelter people.

In the last few days he has received hundreds of calls from people seeking help. Since the neighborhood still has access to electricity and the market remains open, Lam's employees have been able to buy food and cook meals.

Lam said he would take care of the students until the floods receded.

If the water level keeps rising, he plans to also use the main hall which can hold 500 people.

Le Thi Anh Ngoc, 19, from the central Quang Binh Province, said she walked on flooded streets for more than an hour to reach Lam's place on the morning of October 11.

""I arrived in Hue four days ago. I did not know who would help us before I learned about Lam.""

Six kilometers away from the company, on Tung Thien Vuong Street, Ngo Thi Kim Loan is busy making 500 banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich, with the help of a few others to send to people stranded on Hen Dune and Han Mac Tu Street.

Loan, who regularly does charity, always has instant noodles at home. Three days ago, seeing the rising water levels, she gave away 100 boxes of them to households in her neighborhood facing difficulties.

On October 12 she cooked 40 kilograms of rice for people living in areas where power has been turned off due to the floods.

The owner of a noodles restaurant also posted on her Facebook page that families with children or old people could command shelter at her home.

In the evening, when Loan sent 300 banh mi to households on Hen, Le Quoc Phong, Loan's neighbor, 40, was eating dinner under an oil lamp. The island in the middle of the Huong River was cut off by the rising waters.

Phong volunteered to help distribute food to those in need. Finishing his meal, he quickly got on a boat to take the banh mi to people before dinner time was over.

Distributing food and offering accommodation are Hue peoples way of supporting people affected by the floods.

Dozens of families living in higher places said they are ready to take in people whose houses are flooded and provide instant noodles to those who need them.

Free food distribution centers have been set up in downtown areas in the last few days, but are accessible only to people living nearby because of the situation.

People are also helping their fellows facing a threat of losing their livelihoods.

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguy?n Thi H?p celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews)  The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nh Vu?t Lu C?ng ?ng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaol (Paul) Nguy?n Thi H?p, the bishop of H Tinh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tin Nghia, a community in Lin Ha parish, Ha Ninh district.

The Ngu?n N?y River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of H Tinh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguy?n Thi H?p, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tin Nghia, an initiative backed by the Qung Tin municipality and the Peoples Committee of Ba ?n.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tin Xun residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguy?n Thi H?p who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.",2021-03-31 07:00:00+00:00,"['tinh', 'h?p', 'centre', 'build', 'bishop', 'thi', 'h', 'catholics', 'flood', 'work', 'nguy?n', 'local', 'community', 'paul', 'house', 'tin', 'victims']",Vietnam,news article,English
480,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Why did these lions eat 35 men? Bad teeth - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/why-did-these-lions-eat-35-men-bad-teeth,"Why did these lions eat 35 men? Bad teeth

In 1898, two male African lions killed 35 people in the Tsavo region of Kenya. Their 9-month reign of terror ended when Colonel John Patterson of the British Army shot them dead. Scientists have long debated why the lions began eating people. Now, two researchers have a new answer: They blame tooth decay for the big cats’ taste for human flesh. The finding might also explain why other lions sometimes turn into human eaters.

Lions normally consume a diverse variety of animals, including buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe, zebra, and antelope. Humans figure into their diets only rarely. In the 3 months before their deaths, however, the Tsavo human eaters got nearly 30% of their food from people, according to one recent study. Did the lions focus on humans because they were desperate? Many scientists think so. Apparently suffering from starvation—likely because drought or disease had ravaged their usual prey—they turned to another toothsome delicacy.

But other researchers have turned up conflicting evidence. Larisa DeSantis, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, wanted a look at the lion’s preserved teeth after reading a frightful passage from Patterson’s 1907 account, The Man-Eaters of Tsavo: “I have a very vivid recollection of one particular night when the brutes seized a man from the railway camp and brought him close to my camp to devour. I could plainly hear them crunching the bones, and the sound … rang in my ears for days afterwards.” If the lions were that hungry, DeSantis reasoned, they must have also scavenged carcasses, a process that involves heavy bone crunching and wears down the teeth in predictable patterns.

To find out, she and a colleague analyzed the lions’ jaws and teeth, as well as those of a third human eater from Zambia—all stored at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. They used a technique that can determine whether an animal is eating mostly flesh, bones, or some combination of the two. They then compared the patterns on the human eaters’ teeth with those of 53 wild lion specimens from across Africa, two from India, and five captive lions. Next, the scientists examined the patterns on the teeth of cheetahs, which dine solely on flesh, and hyenas, which typically consume entire carcasses—including the bones.

The Tsavo lions’ teeth did not look like those of hyenas, DeSantis says. Instead, the wear patterns were “strikingly similar” to those of the zoo lions, which eat soft foods such as beef and horsemeat. She thinks Patterson was actually hearing the sounds of hyenas that dreadful night.

Other research points out why the lions’ dining preference shifted. One lion—the one that ate the most flesh—was known from a previous study to suffer from dental disease. A painful abscess at the root of one of his canines would have made normal hunting—grabbing and suffocating large prey—impossible, DeSantis says. His partner also had dental and jaw injuries, but these were less serious. The Zambian human eater, which did not consume bone, was also suffering from severe damage to its jaws. Together, this means that dental injuries and disease likely led these lions to softer foods, the researchers write today in Scientific Reports .

“[This] provides first-hand information straight from the lions’ teeth that there is little evidence to support bone eating by the Tsavo lions,” says Jack Tseng, a vertebrate paleontologist at the State University of New York in Buffalo who was not involved in the study. “Any human bone consumption at the time was much more likely the work of the usual suspects—hyenas—than meat-specializing felines.”

But the scientists emphasize that bad teeth alone do not make lions into human eaters. “[They] probably targeted humans because they were easy and had soft flesh,” says DeSantis, noting that the cats didn’t consume entire carcasses. They were also doing what lions do best: hunting opportunistically from a menu that has, since the emergence of early humans, occasionally included people.",2017-04-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['scientists', 'bone', 'desantis', 'teeth', 'eat', 'men', 'consume', 'flesh', 'bad', 'lions', 'humans', 'human', '35', 'tsavo']",Ghana,news article,English

50,DR-2014-000109-CHN,UPDATED: Keeping Filler Ingredients Out of Your Cup of Coffee - Newswise,https://www.newswise.com/articles/keeping-filler-ingredients-out-of-your-cup-of-coffee,"Clarification: The research discussed in this press release focused only on ground, roasted coffee available in Brazil. The use of commercial coffee from Brazil allowed the researchers to develop and perfect chromatographic methodologies for detecting several filler ingredients common to tested coffee. The resulting methodologies will allow for testing of coffee from any market. Until such testing is done, the results of this research cannot be extrapolated to the U.S. or any other country. The National Coffee Association, USA has issued a statement regarding its efforts to ensure that coffee is not adulterated.

EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE: Monday, Aug. 11, 2014, 5 a.m. Eastern time Note to journalists: Please report that this research will be presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society.

Newswise — SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 11, 2014 — Coffee drinkers beware: Surprise ingredients that are neither sweet nor flavorful may be hiding in your coffee, and growing coffee shortages may increase the chance of having these fillers in your cup of joe in the future. The good news is that a highly accurate test is in the works to quickly find coffee containing unwanted fillers before the beverage reaches stores and restaurants.

These extra ingredients, though not harmful, make ground coffee go farther and increase profits for producers, according to researchers. Their report will be part of the 248th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world’s largest scientific society. The meeting features nearly 12,000 reports and is being held here through Thursday.

A test to detect counterfeit coffees is becoming more important in light of growing shortages in regions, such as Brazil, where droughts and plant diseases have dramatically cut back coffee supplies. “With a lower supply of coffee in the market, prices rise, and that favors fraud because of the economic gain,” says research team leader Suzana Lucy Nixdorf, Ph.D.

In 2012, a study from the U.K.’s Royal Botanic Gardens and the Environment stated that 70 percent of the world’s coffee supply might disappear by 2080 because of conditions caused by climate change. But shortages due to more immediate issues already are occurring. The coffee-rich country of Brazil typically produces 55 million bags of coffee each year. But according to some reports, the projected amount for 2014 will likely only reach 45 million bags after this January’s extensive drought. That’s about 42 billion fewer cups of coffee for this year.

Now, however, Nixdorf and her team at State University of Londrina in Brazil have developed a way to nip coffee counterfeiting in the bud.

“With our test, it is now possible to know with 95 percent accuracy if coffee is pure or has been tampered with, either with corn, barley, wheat, soybeans, rice, beans, acai seed, brown sugar or starch syrup,” she says. The problem, she explains, is that “after roasting and grinding the raw material, it becomes impossible to see any difference between grains of lower cost incorporated into the coffee, especially because of the dark color and oily texture of coffee.”

In new research, the team is now analyzing several fillers that are considered impurities rather than adulterants. These impurities can even be parts of the coffee plants, introduced at harvest, that are not really supposed to be in the final product. Wood, twigs, sticks, parchment, husks, whole coffee berries or even clumps of earth that are almost the same color as coffee have been found. Identifying them is essential because if there is a large amount of impurities, they were probably added purposefully — not by accident, as some producers claim, says Nixdorf.

Currently, tests to detect these unwanted additives require scientists to check the coffee, and those tests are subjective –– not quantitative, she says. With these tests, the scientists look at the coffee under a microscope or identify various additives by simply tasting the coffee. In contrast, the new test uses liquid chromatography and statistical tools. This gives her team a much closer look at the ingredients in an unbiased way, according to Nixdorf. Chromatography is a powerful analytical technique that is very sensitive and highly selective.

Because much of the coffee is composed of carbohydrates, researchers could develop a “characteristic fingerprint” when using chromatography that separates out the real coffee compounds, says Nixdorf. The added, unwanted grain fillers generate different levels of sugars than the natural ingredients, so they are easy to identify, she explains.

Nixdorf acknowledges funding from the Government of Brazil’s Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos and Fundação Araucária- Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico do Paraná Productivity Scholarship.

Title Strategy to detect adulterations in ground roasted coffee: An association of carbohydrates content and profiles with chemometric tools

Abstract Coffee is one of the most popular drinks, consumed for its refreshing, stimulating taste and health benefits; and ranked as second-traded worldwide commodity. Its high-price combined with certain ground roasted coffee characteristics, like brown color, particle size and oily texture, attracts fraudulent adulteration, allowing cheapest admixture of roasted and grinded fillers. As a matter of economic order, husks, sticks, corn, cocoa seeds, barley, wheat middling, chicory, soybean, triticale and acai seeds are commonly added. Since simple visual inspection enables to differentiate genuine ground roasted coffee from adulterated one; microscopy is conventionally applied. However, this technique is limited to semi-quantitative assays, requiring trained and skilled analysts. So, it remains great challenge to develop a non-subjective method, selective for distinct markers and quantitative reproducible for industrial quality control. Beside, carbohydrates as major grains macronutrient stand as tracer by its profile and content to assess coffee authenticity. Despite efforts from studies, food matrices complexity and variability still requires strategies to uncover adulteration. Thus, this approach uses HPLC analyses associated with chemometric tools on new analytical resources for detection of ground roasted coffee adulterations. A validated high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection method was investigated to determine total carbohydrates content profiles of pure roasted coffee beans and adulterants. The influence of each matrix was evaluated employing a simplex-centroid design for experiments with mixtures, relating mixing ratio with each monosaccharide by its response surfaces. Proposed models were effective in recognition and prediction of mixtures concentration, thereby allowing distinction of genuine coffee by principal component analysis. Predominantly, pure roasted coffee presented higher levels of galactose and mannose. Profile of diverse roasted grains as sources of fraud will be shown. All results correspond to polysaccharides from pure raw grains, confirming this approach as a feasible analytical tool for detect adulteration of ground roasted coffee.",2014-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['filler', 'research', 'fillers', 'ground', 'keeping', 'updated', 'ingredients', 'cup', 'team', 'coffee', 'roasted', 'test', 'society', 'brazil']",China,news article,English
12,DR-2014-000109-CHN,California lawmakers considering historic shift in groundwater policy - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-water-20140810-story.html,"As California continues to endure a calamitous lack of water from the sky, the state could, for the first time, start to regulate water drawn from the ground.

Groundwater regulation has been politically poisonous since the state’s founding. But lawmakers and Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration are hoping to capitalize on the current parched conditions, and cautious cooperation from once-resistant interest groups, to pass a plan for a groundwater management system by the end of the month.

“This falls under the category of: Never let a crisis go to waste,” said Assemblyman Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento), an author of the legislation.

The drought has propelled water policy to the top of the Legislature’s agenda in the final month of its session. Brown and lawmakers are also negotiating revisions to a water bond measure scheduled for the November ballot. They’re at odds over how much borrowing voters should be asked to approve to pay for such projects as storage and groundwater cleanup.

Meanwhile, the drought’s effects have been buffered somewhat by groundwater reserves.

A study released last month by UC Davis found the state’s economy has taken a $2.2-billion hit this year because of the drought — costs that would have been much higher except for increased pumping of groundwater. Researchers said increased reliance on underground reserves made up for as much as 75% of the water lost from surface sources.

There are no statewide rules on how much water can be taken from the ground. Since the Gold Rush days, groundwater has been considered a property right; landowners are entitled to what’s beneath them.

As the availability of water from lakes and rivers has become more inconsistent because of drought or environmental regulation, groundwater extraction has increased. That has caused more water to be removed from some underground basins, especially in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, than is being replaced.

“What we’re doing with groundwater is an equivalent to deficit spending,” said Lester Snow, director of the nonprofit group California Water Foundation and a former state secretary for natural resources. “Something bad is going to happen” in the long run, he said.

Some water districts have started managing underground sources on their own; others have become regulated after long and costly court battles. But some key basins remain unregulated, and there are substantial gaps in information about the state’s groundwater supply.

The Department of Water Resources estimates the state’s wells number from 1 million to 2 million — a significant variance.

“That shows you how out of whack the system is,” said Jay Ziegler, director of policy of the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group.

The legislative proposal contained in two identical bills would direct local agencies to create plans by 2020 for managing their groundwater. The plans could be customized to fit local needs, and the state could step in to enforce them if local agencies aren’t up to the task.

“We do recognize that local management is by far preferable,” said state Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), an author of one of the bills.

The governor’s office has helped draft the proposal, buoying its prospects. If the legislation passes, it would mark a monumental shift for California, the only Western state that does not regulate groundwater.

“California hasn’t attempted to change water law this dramatically in 100 years,” said Dave Puglia, a senior vice president of Western Growers Assn., an agricultural industry group.

Past efforts to enact statewide groundwater management have fizzled. Resistance remains, particularly among agricultural interests that are still deeply suspicious of state interference. That has become more pronounced as farmers have increasingly relied on groundwater for their crops.

Among other concerns, the agriculture interests, which hold substantial sway in the Capitol, fear that a new regulatory system could affect property values.

“If the legislation enacted creates even a perception of a loss of access to the groundwater that was accessible before, my land value goes down,” Puglia said.

The farming group wants limitations on when and how forcefully the state could intervene to enact local plans.

It is significant that farm groups are even negotiating, the legislation’s supporters say. And other key interests have changed their stance on state involvement.

“Ten years ago, we were for local control [of groundwater resources] no matter what,” said Tim Quinn, executive director of the Assn. of California Water Districts. “Now, we’re for local control — so long as the locals are managing responsibly.”

That may sound mystical but the stone quarrying, blasting of mountains and digging of tunnels in the base of the fragile mountain system for the two back-to-back under-construction dams on Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga rivers, despite warning by experts and ecologists, had played havoc with the local ecology.

And, climate change, held responsible for faster glacial melting, could have aggravated the situation. A 2019 report by Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development said that 36% of the volume of glaciers in Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region will be gone by the end of 2100 if the world manages to keep the temperature rise within 1.5 degrees Celsius as mandated by Paris Climate Agreement. Though the disaster region may not strictly fall in the HKH, its findings confirm what has been said in various studies on faster melting of glaciers feeding the perennial Ganga from the upper reaches of Uttarakhand and China.

The data from the Indian Space Research Organisation’s resource centre on Himalayan glaciers reveals that melting of the glaciers in Central Himalayan catchment area, where Chamoli falls, has increased in the first 20 years of this century. A research based on the study of 650 glaciers spanning 2,000 kms and published in journal, Science Advances, in June 2019 showed that glacial melting has doubled since 2000 as compared to 1975-2000. The faster melting of hundreds of Ganga glaciers would impact livelihood of close to 600 million people living in the Ganga river basin from Uttarakhand to Bangladesh, and India’s economy.

Glacial melting and bursts are well-documented but little attention has been paid to the damage caused to the local ecology and loss of forest cover in the upper reaches of Central Himalayas for building hydel dams and construction of wider roads (read Char Dham road project) keeping environmental norms at bay. Villagers of Raini in Chamoli, now the epicentre of the Sunday disaster, had petitioned the Uttarkhand high court in May 2019 against illegal stone quarrying on Rishi Ganga river bed, blasting of mountains and improper muck disposal by contractors engaged in construction of Rishi Ganga hydel project. The district magistrate of Chamoli , asked by the high court to submit a report, found some of the allegations true.

The fragile upper reaches of Uttarakhand, source for several small riverine systems feeding Ganga, already has 16 dams and another 13 are under construction. The state government has proposed another 54 dams to harness hydel energy potential of these rivers. On Dhauli Ganga river, 8 back-to-back new hydel projects are proposed in addition to National Thermal Power Corporation’s Tapovan project, which was badly damaged in Sunday’s flash floods. Geologists say that such heavy drilling of a young and under-studied mountain systems such as Himalayas and loss of massive green cover for these dams were causing an irreparable damage.

What should be an eye-opener for those pursuing the death of Himalayan ecology in the name of development is that rarely, anywhere in the world, two big disasters in a region have taken place in less than a decade. A similar flash flood caused by glacial lake burst ravaged the Kedarnath shrine at the peak of the pilgrimage season in June 2013, killing close to 3,000 people and leaving thousands missing. The death toll in Chamoli disaster is expected to be around 180.

There is enough data to suggest that severe flash floods due to glacial melt in Uttarkhand have increased post-2000 and if the present Himalayan destruction continues, it would rise further and would be more fierce. If we don’t stop this ecological catastrophe, the nature will strike back again, as it did in Kedarnath and Chamoli, and next time, it could be worse. So, saving Himalayas is the only option India has.",2021-02-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['glaciers', 'change', 'disaster', 'chamoli', 'ganga', 'himalayan', 'glacial', 'hydel', 'melting', 'upper', 'dams', 'climate', 'uttarakhand', 'humaninduced']",India,news article,English

Pupils in the Rwenzori Sub-region, whose classroom blocks and school buildings were swept off by floods in Kasese and Bundibugyo districts, can now smile again after they got new classroom blocks, pit-latrines and other facilities.

The pupils had lost any hope of resuming classes after the reopening of schools by the government.

At Bikone Primary School in Kasese District in May last year, all the classroom blocks were washed away by floods after River Mubuku burst its banks, leaving more than 500 learners stranded with nowhere to study from.

The floods from River Thaku also swept away classrooms at Kisabu Primary School also in Kasese District, leaving more than 300 pupils helpless.

Others affected by floods include Budenge and Bughonga primary schools in Bundibugyo District.

In Ntoroko District, floods from rising water levels of Lake Albert submerged all the classrooms at Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu primary schools.

The new classroom blocks and other facilities were built by Save the Children, a non-governmental organisation.

The head teacher of Bikone Primary School, Mr Shem Tabura, said during lockdown in May last year, all classrooms and school records were destroyed by floods as River Mubuku burst its banks.

“We are now happy because we had lost hope for the future of our pupils as all the classroom blocks were swept away by floods. We did not have any records as text books, PLE result slips from 1989 to 2019, among others were destroyed. We are happy to see that our pupils have resumed school,” he said.

Mr Josephat Muhindo, the head teacher of Kisabu Primary School, said three classroom blocks were swept away by floods.

He said the school currently has 380 learners and have been struggling to accommodate more students.

“Our community members and other stakeholders raised about Shs12 million, which we used to buy land elsewhere to relocate the school because we were advised that where the school was located is not good, but now we have got four new classrooms and pupils are studying comfortably,” Mr Muhindo said.

He said last year in July, officials from the Office of Prime Minister promised to build seven classrooms but up to now they have not received any communication.

Mr Colenelius Masereke, a parent in Ibanda-Kyanya town council, said when floods swept away the school they lost hope about the future of their children to go back to school.

“Some people in the community died in floods and good enough it was lockdown. We did not lose any students. We are happy to see that we got new classrooms for our pupils. We shall wait for the government to make additional infrastructure,” he said.

Mr Muhindo Bagonza Libbum, the project manager of Enabling teacher approach at Save the Children, said with Shs291.4 million, they built four classrooms each at Kisabu and Bikone in Kasese District while in Bundibugyo District, they built latrines at Budenge and Bughonga primary schools.

He said they have also given the affected schools Wash facilities and SOPs, motorcycles, digital cameras, among others.

Floods

Kasese and Bundibugyo districts are prone to floods. In May 2020, rivers Mubuku and Nyamwaba burst their banks, causing floods which displaced many people and destroyed several property.

In Ntoroko District, floods displaced more than 10,000 people in Kanara Sub-county and up to now those displaced remain stranded.

The Sri Lankan government on May 18, 2009 killed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE) chief Velupillai Prabhakaran in the coastal village of in Mullaittivu, bringing to an end the bloody armed conflict fought mainly in the north and east of the island nation.

At least 100,000 people were killed in the over three-decade-long conflict. Thousands of people, including security personnel, are still reported to be missing after the war.

Hundreds of people gathered in parts of Northern Sri Lanka to remember the victims of the war, the Colombo Gazette reported.

The government will commemorate the war heroes during the Victory Day celebrations on Sunday, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement.

It asked the public to light a ""Lamp of Peace"" in the memory of those who laid down their lives for the country.

""The commemoration of the completion of a decade of peace since eradicating terrorism that plagued Sri Lanka for three long decades by the valiant War Heroes, falls on 2019.05.19,"" it said in the statement.

""To coincide with the ""Dasavarshikabhisheka"" commemoration, it is requested from the general public to light a 'Lamp of Peace' at all places of worship, state and private sector organizations, homes, police stations and tri-forces establishments island-wide on 2019.05.19 at 1900hrs,"" it said.

However, human rights organisations blamed the government of failing to provide justice to the victims even after a decade after the war, the Colombo Gazette reported.

The Amnesty International called on the government to end impunity and put accountability for crimes under international law and human rights violations and abuses at the heart of its transitional justice process.

It is worrying to see the recurrence of hostility and violence against ethnic and religious minorities in Sri Lanka. While the government has committed itself to a process of reconciliation, the wounds of the past will only heal if there is justice, truth and reparation, Biraj Patnaik, South Asia Director at Amnesty International, said.

The Human Rights Watch said that the end of the war provided the country with an opportunity not only to rebuild shattered lives and society, but also to restore respect for rights and the rule of law.

Yet successive Sri Lankan administrations have frittered away this opportunity, failing to investigate atrocities by both sides, hold those responsible for the worst crimes accountable, or provide truth and reparations to the victims, Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said.

The government gained victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) which had been fighting for a separate state for nearly three decades.

RAINI: It was a tranquil winter morning in Raini village until the residents were jolted at around 10 AM on Sunday by a loud sound and the sight of huge torrents of water and sludge in the Rishi Ganga river hurtling towards them.

""Before we could make out what was happening, the raging muddy waters of Rishi Ganga had devastated the landscape,"" says 50-year-old Dharam Singh, a resident of the village.

The scenes brought back to the people horrifying memories of the 2013 Kedarnath deluge that killed thousands.

Three residents of the village including a 75-year-old woman identified as Amrita Devi who had gone out to work in her field close to the bridge on Rishi Ganga are missing since the avalanche struck after the Nanda Devi glacier burst.

Others missing include Yashpal Singh of Valli Raini who had gone to the fields to graze his livestock and disappeared along with them.

Ranjit Singh, 25, of the village who worked in the Rishi Ganga hydel project is also missing after the avalanche.

The avalanche destroyed the project commissioned in 2020.

Some ancient temples built about 20 metres above the confluence of Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga rivers have also been swept away by the violent avalanche.

Umeli Devi, 34, who had come from Nepal to work in the Rishi Ganga hydel project said ten of her colleagues had been swept away in the avalanche.

She said male members of her family who worked as labourers in the power project are all missing.

Dharam Singh of Raini said as the deluge came gurgling loudly it sent a chill down the spine of people living in the area who find it hard to forget the 2013 tragedy.

The forest area of Nanda Devi National Park has also suffered great devastation due to the avalanche, he said.

715,Drought Sri Lanka,Within Our Grasp: A World Free of Poverty - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/speech/2013/04/02/world-bank-group-president-jim-yong-kims-speech-at-georgetown-university,"Within Our Grasp: A World Free of Poverty

Thank you. It’s always a pleasure to visit a great academic institution, one engaged in preparing the leaders of the future.

I’m here today to talk to you about the future, about the opportunity to create a world free from the stain of poverty and economic exclusion.

My message to you is that such a world is within our reach. But if we are to succeed, we have to make some hard decisions and change the way we work together.

To understand the historic opportunity in front of us, and what we must do to transform history, let me begin with some observations on the global development landscape today and the outlook for the medium term.

The Global Development Landscape

Let me start by noting that the crisis which has gripped the global economy over the last four and a half years does not yet show clear signs of abatement. So many green shoots have sprouted and withered in the last year or two that we should be cautious in assessing the future. As recent events in Cyprus demonstrate, it is too early to declare victory. At the same time there is growing evidence that we are on the right track, although there are sure to be some bumps in the road ahead.

Market conditions in Europe have improved since the turbulence of last spring and summer. Thanks to the commitment by European leaders to contain financial volatility, many risk indicators are back at levels last seen in early 2010 – before concerns about Euro Area fiscal sustainability emerged. While European policymakers deserve credit for these improvements, it's important for us to recognize that the injection of liquidity only buys us time; it does not solve the problem. Many more difficult decisions pertaining to fiscal and banking policies remain.

In the real economy, there are some weak signals that recovery is underway. In high-income countries, headwinds from fiscal consolidation continue to drag on growth, but we may have turned a corner. Here in the US, both the housing market and labor market are improving – over one million jobs have been added to the American economy in the last six months – though we must note that there remains a lingering uncertainty over the deadlock in fiscal policy. In Europe, GDP is projected to shrink by 0.2 percent this year, and some of the difficulties will continue to persist until late 2014 and early 2015.

When we look at the economic picture ahead for developing countries, the prospects are brighter. The economies of the developing world are expected to expand by 5.5 percent this year, and we forecast growth will further accelerate to 5.7 percent and 5.8 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Dynamic and competitive firms are opening and expanding all over the developing world, from small startups to multinational corporations.

I was recently in Chengdu, China, where I met an entrepreneur named Zhang Yan. A few years back, she had big dreams to build a business but lacked access to finance. She was able to secure a $10,000 loan through a local bank’s initiative to finance female entrepreneurs -- a program supported by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank Group’s private sector lending arm. Zhang used her loan to open a car repair shop, and today, she runs a thriving business that employs more than 150 people. I just received an email from her over the weekend. She plans to open a third repair shop, and will continue to promote social responsibility by hiring and training women who have previously not had access to good jobs. Her story mirrors the experiences of millions of ambitious individuals across the globe. When they are given the chance to succeed in business, they seize it. In turn, they create jobs and opportunities for their neighbors.

This private sector growth is reaping impressive development gains, especially when coupled with more effective pro-poor interventions on the part of governments, international donors, and civil society. Today extreme poverty is in retreat. In 1990, 43 percent of the developing world lived on less than $1.25 a day. In 2010 – 20 years later -- we estimate that the global poverty rate dropped to 21 percent. The first Millennium Development Goal, to halve extreme poverty, was achieved five years ahead of time.

And the advances in the social sector are perhaps even more remarkable. In the last decade, eight million AIDS patients have received antiretroviral therapy. The annual number of malaria deaths has dropped by 75 percent. The total number of out-of-school children has fallen by over 40 percent.

Looking ahead, we believe the conditions are in place for continued strong performance in developing countries. Yet we can’t take high growth rates for granted. Maintaining growth of 6 percent, let alone the 7 or 8 percent many economies achieved during the pre-crisis boom period, will require sustained reform efforts. For example, countries must continue to improve the quality of education, governance, and the business climate; modernize their infrastructure; ensure energy and food security; and enhance financial intermediation.

Moreover, new risks are emerging. In particular, we are concerned that unless the world takes bold action now, a disastrously warming planet threatens to reverse much of the progress we have experienced.

Climate change is not just an environmental challenge. It is a fundamental threat to economic development and the fight against poverty.

According to a recent World Bank report, if we don’t act now to curb dangerous emissions, by the end of this century the average global temperature will increase by 4 degrees Celsius, or more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit.

In a “4-degree world,” sea levels would rise by as much as 1.5 meters, putting more than 360 million city dwellers at risk. Drought-affected areas would increase from 15 percent of global cropland today to around 44 percent, with sub-Saharan Africa especially hard hit. Extreme weather events would occur with devastating frequency, with untold costs in lives and dollars. And it is the poor, those least responsible for climate change and least able to afford adaptation, who would suffer the most.

A second crucial challenge for the medium term is the problem of inequality. Often, the mention of inequality causes embarrassed silence. We have to break the taboo of silence on this difficult but critically important issue. Even if rapid economic expansion in the developing world continues, this doesn’t mean that everyone will automatically benefit from the development process. Assuring that growth is inclusive is both a moral imperative and a crucial condition for sustained economic development.

We know that despite the dramatic successes of the last decade, there are still around 1.3 billion people living in extreme poverty, 870 million who go hungry every day, and 6.9 million children under five dying every year.

So, what conclusions can we draw from this overview of today’s global development landscape? I believe there are two key implications for the work of the World Bank Group.

Accelerating the End of Extreme Poverty

The first is that now is the time to commit to ending extreme poverty. We are at an auspicious moment in history, when the successes of past decades and an increasingly favorable economic outlook combine to give developing countries a chance -- for the first time ever -- to end extreme poverty within a generation. Our duty now must be to ensure that these favorable circumstances are matched with clarity of purpose and resolute action to realize this historic opportunity.

We know the end of poverty will not come easily. In the years ahead, as we push toward this goal, the job will become tougher and tougher, because those remaining in poverty will be the hardest to reach.

Some live in densely populated areas in emerging economies, such as the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which I visited last month and which accounts for 8 percent of the people in the world living in extreme poverty. People in Uttar Pradesh need so much, including improved infrastructure, stronger education systems that prepare students for the work force, and greater inclusion of women and other vulnerable groups in labor markets.

Others who remain trapped in poverty live in countries caught in cycles of conflict and fragility. A substantial and growing share of poor people live in fragile or conflict-affected states, where both the need for and the obstacles to development tend to be the greatest. Fragile states must be front and center in any agenda to end extreme poverty.

Development in fragile states is difficult, but with creative approaches real progress is possible, as I saw in Afghanistan three weeks ago. For example, we’re helping train Afghan volunteers to use GPS-enabled smart phones with built-in cameras to monitor irrigation projects in their communities, increasing their sense of ownership. Their photos and reports are now transmitted daily to our main offices in Kabul. The cameras also have a function that James Bond would appreciate: a delete-all-data button, including photos and reports, in case the workers are questioned at a checkpoint. In Afghanistan, despite enduring security challenges and an environment plagued by corruption, many companies today are exploring investment opportunities in mining, energy, and transportation. The international airport is full of commercial aircraft – a striking change from a decade ago. And 27 percent of the country’s members of parliament are women – an even sharper break with the past.

The donor community’s experience in Afghanistan illustrates the high risks of operating in fragile states. But increasingly we’re seeing how coordinated efforts from the international community and local governments can produce transformative results. We’re accumulating lessons on how to achieve security, political stability, and economic development. Next month, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and I will visit the Great Lakes region of eastern Africa together as we cooperate to put these lessons more widely into practice. I want to be clear – I have worked in fragile and conflict-affected states for most of my adult life and continuing to strengthen the World Bank Group’s work in these countries will be one of my very top priorities.

Boosting Shared Prosperity

In addition to accelerating the end of extreme poverty, I believe the second development lesson for our times is that fighting extreme poverty alone is not enough. We must collectively work to help all vulnerable people everywhere lift themselves well above the poverty line. At the World Bank Group this focus on equity is central to our mission of boosting shared prosperity.

What I’ve heard time and again over the past nine months is that forward-looking policymakers around the world are concerned about inequality and exclusion.

They want to create economic opportunities for their vulnerable citizens, and bring growth to the homes of the poor and the relatively disadvantaged, whether they live on $1 a day, $2 a day, or $10 a day. They want to help those who have only recently escaped extreme poverty secure the resources they need to join the middle class. And they want to ensure that the gains they’ve achieved over the past decades are sustainable – socially, fiscally, and environmentally.

In Tunisia last January, I met with civil society leaders who were at the forefront of the movement which launched the Arab Spring. Their message was clear: If prosperity is not widely shared, if it is not built on a development process which involves all members of society, especially women and young people, then tensions may again rise to the breaking point.

I also strongly believe that prosperity must be shared not only among individuals, communities, and nations, but also across generations. If we do not act to curb climate change immediately, we will leave our children and grandchildren with an unrecognizable planet.

The World Bank Group is now working on a revamped strategy to significantly strengthen our climate change interventions and help catalyze urgent action among global partners on the scale required. We are exploring a number of bold ideas, including new mechanisms to support and connect carbon markets; politically feasible plans to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies; increased investments in climate-smart agriculture; and innovative partnerships to build clean cities. We are reviewing our work in every sector to ensure that all our projects reflect the pressing need to tackle climate change. A “4-degree world” can still be avoided if we develop a plan and take concerted action that is equal to the challenge we face. To date, I believe our efforts to combat climate change have been too narrowly focused, small scale and uncoordinated. We can do better.

Two Goals to Guide the World Bank Group

Let me now talk more specifically about how the World Bank Group is mobilizing to seize the opportunity to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.

We’re introducing two goals to guide our strategy. These are not goals which the World Bank Group itself will achieve. They are goals which our partners – our 188 member countries – will achieve, with the support of the entire global development community.

The first goal is to end extreme poverty by 2030. With the end of extreme poverty within our grasp, we want to set an aggressive timeline to focus our efforts and maintain a sense of urgency.

The date of 2030 is highly ambitious. If anyone doubts it, consider that the first Millennium Development Goal was to halve absolute poverty over a period of 25 years. To reach the 2030 goal, we must halve global poverty once, then halve it again, and then nearly halve it a third time—all in less than one generation. If countries can achieve this, then absolute poverty will be brought below 3 percent. Our economists set the goal line here, because below 3 percent the nature of the poverty challenge will change fundamentally in most parts of the world. The focus will shift from broad structural measures to tackling sporadic poverty among specific vulnerable groups.

Our team believes three factors will be necessary to achieve this extraordinary result.

First, to reach our goal will require an acceleration of the growth rates observed over the past 15 years, and in particular sustained high growth in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, it will require efforts to enhance inclusiveness and curb inequality, and ensure that growth translates into poverty reduction, most importantly through job creation. And third, it will require that potential shocks – such as climatic disasters or new food, fuel, or financial crises – be averted or mitigated.

Reaching these goals will require additional resources. This year the World Bank Group is discussing with our partners the replenishment of the International Development Association, or IDA, our fund for the 81 poorest countries. With IDA’s help, hundreds of millions of people have escaped extreme poverty. Securing a strong IDA replenishment is one of my highest priorities.

Meeting this 2030 goal will require extraordinary effort. But is there anyone, anywhere, who doubts that the reward will be worth it? Is there anyone who has lived on less than $1.25 a day who would not join me here today in telling you that it is time to end extreme poverty? Is there anyone who has seen the shantytowns of Johannesburg or Addis Ababa or Dhaka or Lima who would not commit to help build a better life for all who live there? Is there anyone here today who would not want to erase this stain from our collective conscience?

But we know that ending extreme poverty is not enough. We must also work to boost the incomes of the poorest 40 percent of the population in each country.

Focusing on the bottom 40 percent captures the twin elements of shared prosperity: the imperative of economic growth matched with a strong concern for equity. It demands that we worry not just about whether developing economies are expanding, but look directly at whether the welfare of the poorest segment of society is improving. It is an important objective for all countries.

Though our efforts are especially focused on the countries with the fewest resources, our work is not just in poor countries. Our work is in any country where there are poor people.

This is hard work, but it can be done. I was just in Brazil, where I saw how carefully crafted public policies can dramatically reduce income inequality. Brazil has expanded access to education and implemented a conditional cash transfer program that raises incomes among the very poor. Other countries can adapt these and other proven strategies to tackle inequality in their own contexts. Success can spread.

The World Bank Group will be there to help countries end poverty and boost shared prosperity in at least four ways.

First, we will use these goals to help us choose among competing priorities, as we identify the projects where we can have the most impact. These goals will significantly inform our Country Partnership Strategies, the detailed policy documents which define our objectives for each of our partner countries.

For example, next week we will send to our Board a new Country Partnership Strategy for India, the first such strategy designed with these two goals in mind. India’s contribution to ending global poverty could be staggering. In the last five years, roughly 50 million people have been lifted out of poverty in India. But in the next generation, we estimate that with a concerted push an additional 300 million people in India could escape extreme poverty.

Second, we will closely monitor and observe progress toward these goals of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity, and will report annually on what has been achieved and where gaps remain.

Third, we will use our convening and advocacy power to continually remind policymakers and the international community what it will take to realize these goals.

Recently, a number of courageous politicians have committed to ending poverty in their countries, including Dilma Rousseff in Brazil and Joyce Banda in Malawi. Similarly, US President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron endorsed the vision of ending extreme poverty globally. These bold calls demand action. The World Bank Group will be a relentless advocate and a loyal partner in encouraging policymakers to follow through on their promises to the poor.

And fourth, we will work with our partners to share knowledge on solutions to end poverty and promote shared prosperity.

To reach their development goals, countries will need sound policies and adequate financing. But they will also need to improve delivery: how they implement policies on the ground to get results.

Increasingly, countries are looking to the World Bank Group for support in tackling delivery challenges. They tell us they have record numbers of children in school, but tests show that far too many can’t read or write by the fifth grade. They tell us plans for new sanitation plants, or new roads, or new bridges have been approved, but years later they still are not completed. These are delivery failures, and for many countries, they’re the greatest obstacle to development progress.

That’s why we are working with countries and partners to build what we are calling a science of delivery for development. As it matures, this new field will provide frontline development practitioners with knowledge, tools, and support networks. It will connect them to peers around the world who can help them problem-solve in real time. One recent example: Engineers modernizing power grids in the Republic of Georgia received advice from colleagues in Chile who had solved similar challenges.

By systematically enabling these connections, the science of delivery will multiply the impact of expert problem-solvers inside and outside the World Bank Group: These are the people who are on the front lines figuring out ways to bring solar power to a half-million Mongolian nomads; or helping Costa Rican villagers rebuild after an earthquake; or crafting a finance package that can bring a struggling railroad line in East Africa back to life.

In advancing the emerging field of delivery science, we will help our partners learn from one another and maximize the impact of every dollar spent to end poverty and promote shared prosperity.

Conclusion: What Kind of World Will We Leave to our Children?

In closing, let me note that this Friday marks 1,000 days until the end of 2015, the deadline for achieving all eight Millennium Development Goals. Progress on the MDGs has been impressive, but it remains uneven across populations and countries. We must use these next 1,000 days to move with much greater urgency to improve the lives of children and their families.

While we ramp up, we must also focus on what comes next, and how we can maintain an unrelenting focus for the years ahead. With our partners, the World Bank Group is engaged in framing a bold post-2015 agenda. In fact, this weekend I will be in Madrid meeting with the leaders of all the United Nations agencies under the leadership of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. We will focus specifically on how we can work together as a multilateral system to accelerate progress in the last 1000 days.

But we all know that the challenges in front of us are enormous and progress is never inevitable . I am reminded of this when I think back to a moment during the African-American civil rights movement exactly 50 years ago this month.

In April 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King was arrested in Birmingham, Alabama, for leading a wave of mass protests designed to force local authorities to speed up desegregation reforms. Many moderate white religious leaders, people who considered themselves allies of the civil rights struggle, disapproved of what they called King’s “extremist” tactics. The day of Dr. King’s arrest, a group of moderate clergymen published a letter in the Birmingham News in which they argued that all thoughtful people knew African-Americans would eventually gain their rights, but that King had acted in ways that were “unwise and untimely” in trying to force change before the time was ripe.

In his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” Dr. King responded that the attitude of the white moderates reflected a “tragic misconception” that time would “inevitably” bring progress. King wrote, and I quote: “Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men [and women].” End quote.

Injustice will not vanish “inevitably.” Injustice, said Dr. King, must be “rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action” spurred by “the urgency of the moment.”

As we set goals for our organization, goals for our collective effort to better serve the poor and vulnerable, we should reflect on Dr. King’s example.

We set goals precisely because nothing is inevitable. We set goals to challenge external obstacles—but also to defy our own inertia. We set goals to keep ourselves alert to the “urgency of the moment,” to push constantly beyond our own limits. We set goals to keep ourselves from falling into either fatalism or complacency—both deadly enemies of the poor.

We set goals so that, every day, every hour, we can ensure that our actions are aligned with our deepest values—those we can affirm without shame before the judgment of history.

If we act today, if we work relentlessly toward these goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, we have the opportunity to create a world for our children which is defined not by stark inequities but by soaring opportunities. A sustainable world where all households have access to clean energy. A world where everyone has enough to eat. A world where no one dies from preventable diseases.

A world free of poverty.

It is the world we all want for ourselves, for our children, our grandchildren, and all future generations.

As Dr. King said, ""the time is always ripe to do right."" The opportunity is squarely in front of us. We can and we must seize the arc of history and bend it toward justice.

NERIAMANGALAM/THATTEKADU: The people in the hilly regions of Ernakulam are panic-stricken over possible flooding in the Periyar River due to the opening of Idukki dam on Thursday. Thanks to the opening of all shutters at Bhoothathankettu dam, water is flowing down the hilly regions of the district.

“Some of the areas in Neriamangalam were flooded due to the overnight landslide. However, the water level has gone down in the afternoon,” Joseph Cherian, who is residing close to Periyar River near Neriamangalam bridge - the starting point of Ernakulam district- told Express.

“But people are afraid there will be a flood if more shutters of Cheruthoni dam are opened.” People are worried over the water level in the catchment areas of Boothathankettu dam. “Usually, when the shutters of the Boothathankettu are opened, the water recedes in the catchment areas. But this time, the water level is increasing. If more shutters of the Idukki dam are opened, the water level will further rise,” a Revenue Department officer at Inchathotty said.

Police officials are deployed at numerous places close to Periyar dam to prevent drowning in case people venture into the water. Kothamangalam MLA Antony John said all the precautionary measures have been taken.",2018-08-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['opening', 'kerala', 'tenterhooks', 'water', 'periyar', 'opened', 'regions', 'dam', 'floods', 'hilly', 'ernakulam', 'areas', 'shutters', 'level', 'river']",India,news article,English

â?¢ More than 160,000 people, including nearly 18,000 who are displaced countrywide, have been affected by floods or landslides since the onset of the short rains in October, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS).

â?¢ At least 120 people have reportedly died, including 72 people who lost their lives after a landslide buried their houses in West Pokot County in north-western Kenya, according to the Government.

â?¢ Infrastructure of undetermined value, including roads and bridges, have been damaged, hampering effective humanitarian response efforts in affected areas

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Most parts of the country continue to experience above average rainfall since the onset of the 2019 short rains (October â?? December). While the rainsâ?? driven by the strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)â??might result in improved pasture conditions in arid and semi-arid lands, especially Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, and Wajir counties, as well as recharge of surface water pans and dams, including in Masinga, Kiambere and Turkwell dams, there are also reports of overspread damage, loss of lives and livelihoods due to heavy storms. Flash and riverine floods have affected at least 31 of the 47 Kenyaâ??s counties, including in Central, Coastal, Eastern, Northern, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western regions, and urban areas in Nairobi and Mombasa, according to the Governmentâ??s National Disaster Operation Centre (NDOC). Landslides and mudslides have been reported in Meru, Murangâ??a, Taita Taveta and West Pokot counties, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). Overall, more than 160,000 people, including nearly 18,000 who are displaced countrywide, have been affected by floods or landslides since the onset of the short rains in October, according to KRCS.

On 22 November, landslides and mudslides in parts of West Pokot County resulted in the death of at least 72 people and displacement of more than 10,000 people, according to the County authorities. Farms, food stores and livestock were swept away, and two bridges along the Kitale-Lodwar road (Ortum) and along Sigor road (Chepera) were cut-off, leaving dozens of commuters stranded and disrupting communication networks in the area. Search and rescue efforts are still ongoing in the area and the numbers of affected population could increase in the coming days. According to the County authorities, priority needs in the area include food and shelter, medical attention, water treatment chemicals and critical non-food items.

In Wajir County, floods arising from rainfall in the Ethiopian Highlands cut off all the roads leading to Bute and Gurar in Wajir North sub-county and washed away a bridge in Buna Town, impacting supplies and response in the area. Communication to Moyale and Bute was reportedly disrupted and at least 5,000 people near Buna market were displaced to higher grounds.

In Garissa and Tana River counties, heavy rains on 22 and 23 November led to massive flooding in the area, exacerbated by the bursting of Tana River. On 24 November, KRCS response teams rescued 15 people who had been marooned at Hadama location in Tana North Sub-county in Tana River County. Preliminary assessments from Tana River and Garissa indicate that 624 families have been displaced. In the Central region, at least 550 people were reportedly displaced in Tigania, in Meru County.

Sections of roads and bridges have been cut-off, paralyzing transport and humanitarian access in Embu, Garissa, Isiolo, Kwale, Lamu, Machakos, Makueni, Mandera, Marsabit, Meru, Mombasa, Samburu, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Trans Nzoia, Turkana and Samburu counties. The Gurdis and Botula dams in Banisain Mandera County broke their walls or banks and require urgent repairs.

In Turkana, flash floods destroyed boreholes, calling for the installation of improved drainage system and relocation of people in affected residential areas to safer grounds. Public toilets and latrines have reported collapsed or are flooded in many areas, increasing the risks of disease outbreaks. Schools are closed in Trans Nzoia and Machakos counties, where several classrooms were flooded.

According to the Kenya Meteorological Department, heavy rains are expected to continue across the country over the next few weeks, mainly due to the positive IOD measurements. Flood alerts have been issued especially for Coastal, Northern and Western regions of the country, with the risk of landslides and mudslides expected in parts of the Central Highlands and parts of the Rift Valley, including West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet and Nandi counties.

Kenya was already facing increase hunger prior to the floods, with 3.1 million people projected to be in crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity since October, according to the latest report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).",2019-11-27 08:00:00+00:00,"['2019', '27', 'update', 'affected', 'river', 'counties', 'county', 'landslides', 'including', 'flash', 'according', 'kenya', 'rains', 'floods', 'tana']",Kenya,news article,English

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

When a northern cold spell entered the intertropical convergence zone over central Vietnam, it caused abnormally heavy rains and flooding in the region.

The amount of rain that fell from October 6 to 13 was two to six times higher than normal.

Ha Tinh Province received 150-400 mm during this period, Quang Binh got 400-500 mm, Quang Tri got 800-1,500 mm, Thua Thien Hue got 1,300-2,000 mm, Da Nang City got 1,100 mm, Quang Nam got 900-1,200 mm, and Quang Ngai got 600-800 mm.

Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

The entire central region suffered from severe flooding for days, more than 135,000 houses were submerged under 0.3-4 meters of water, and nearly 46,000 people had to be evacuated.

At least 36 people have died due to flooding and 12 are missing.

Nguyen Van Huong, head of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecastings Climate Forecast Office, said intertropical convergence zone stretches from the Bay of Bengal and across the center of Vietnam to the Philippines.

In these areas clouds and thunderstorms often develop, and when winds from the east meet them, there is an increase in moisture content, which means more thunderstorms, he said.

When the zone has favorable conditions such as the convergence of strong winds that moved over warm seawater, a tropical depression forms and then grows into a storm in the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea, he said.

Since October 6 two storms and a tropical depression have formed in this area.

On Sunday Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.

A day later Storm Nangka formed and hit the coast between the northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa Provinces on Wednesday.

""Storms and tropical depression already cause heavy rains. For instance, Storm Linfa caused rainfall of 500-700 mm,"" Huong said.

On Thursday morning another tropical depression formed over the sea and is heading straight for the central region also with a lot of moisture.

According to the center, more rains are expected in the region until Tuesday or later.

A cold spell coming down from the north and meeting winds from the east also caused heavy rains, Huong said.

The center said the root cause of all these phenomena was La Nina, which appeared in July and is expected to last until early next year. During this period, more storms would form over the East Sea and the rains would last longer than usual, it added.

Four to six more storms and tropical depressions are expected to brew this year with at least two making landfall over the central coast.

La Nina is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years as a result of variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It occurs as strong winds blow warm water on the ocean's surface from South America across the Pacific Ocean toward Indonesia.

That will come when the adrenaline fades, the military packs up, the waters recede and they're left with the damage.

Hundreds of people in Ottawa and Gatineau, Que., faced a hard choice after the devastating floods in 2017: stay on the floodplain and rebuild the homes they loved, or pick up and move elsewhere.

Many chose to remain, to use their insurance, disaster recovery aid and/or help from family and friends, and start construction.

For some, that work was still ongoing or had only just finished when the waters rose again this year, two springs later, shattering records kept by the organization that has monitored the Ottawa River basin for more than a century.

See the Ottawa-Gatineau flooding from above CBC News Ottawa 1:44 CBC News captured aerial footage of the recent flooding in Gatineau, Que., and Clarence-Rockland, Ont. 1:44

Many of those records had just been broken in 2017.

David Proulx in Gatineau's Masson-Angers sector is part of one of the hundreds of families hit twice by floodwaters in the National Capital Region. They decided to renovate after what happened in 2017, and finished the majority of that work only a month and a half ago.

Then, the water rose to about half a metre on the main floor of their home.

""It's discouraging because you went through it [before]. You did all the renos, you worked for it, and then you ask yourself, 'Why did I go through all that, why did I work so hard for all this if this happened?'"" the father of two asked the CBC's Hannah Thibedeau on April 30.

""We are tired, physically and mentally, and I think that's the worst feeling right now, is knowing that you still lost the house after all that.""

But the idea of leaving now — even after this second flood and grim warnings about climate change and an increasing number of environmental disasters — just doesn't appeal to him.

""I guess we start all over again,"" he said. ""...We have to. I have a family, and family is first, you know? And this is their place.""

Renaud Arnaud says the hardest part of the flooding in 2017 was deciding to demolish his family's new house once floodwaters receded and costs to repair the property ran too high. (Hallie Cotnam/CBC)

Renaud Arnaud's family made the opposite call in 2017, accepting a provincial government buyout and demolishing the home they'd bought only four months before the flooding hit Gatineau's Lac-Beauchamp sector, taking the heavy loss on the new mortgage.

Now, they live in a fourth-floor apartment, far above any flooding danger.

Standing Thursday on the land where his former house once stood, Arnaud repeatedly broke down. When the waters receded two years ago the family initially thought they could stay, but as the costs grew and grew, they decided to leave.

""Beyond the financial loss, which is significant, it's your home. It's the neighbourhood where we planned to raise our kid, and everything that you dreamed of is gone. You close a chapter of your life, and then you have to move on. So we moved on,"" Arnaud said.

""And I think it was the wise decision. When I see the water back again, we probably made the right decision by moving on.""

In his family's experience, the worst part of the whole ordeal was having to decide what to do once the water had receded.

""The flood is something, but it is the aftermath that, in our experience, was the most challenging.""

Final tally to come

It will be weeks before the cities of Ottawa and Gatineau have recorded all the damage, and residents and governments have tallied their bills. Water levels are expected to remain high for the next two weeks at least, and could even rise again if there's a significant amount of rain, the Ottawa River Regulation Planning Board said Friday.

In Ottawa, 155 homes had been evacuated and more than 1.6 million sandbags had been distributed as of Friday.

In Gatineau, 111 homes had been evacuated, 923 damaged and more than 885,000 sandbags had been distributed as of Friday.

After the 2017 flooding, the province of Ontario approved 108 applications for assistance under the Disaster Recovery Assistance Ontario program in defined parts of Ottawa, Clarence-Rockland, Alfred and Plantagenet and Champlain.

In total, the program has provided about $3,469,000 in those areas for people who couldn't receive other forms of help, such as insurance.

In nearby Renfrew County, 89 of 114 applications were approved and about $1,725,000 has been doled out.

So far this year, the program has been activated for Renfrew County, including Pembroke, Ont., and a section of Bolton, Ont. It's expected that more areas will be added.

207,FF-2016-000062-IDN,New Taiwan President Travels to Consolidate Diplomatic Ties - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/new-taiwan-president-travels-consolidate-diplomatic-ties,"TAIPEI - Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen set off Friday for two friendly nations in Latin America, her first overseas trip after a month in office, to lock in ties that could be disrupted by China. She'll also meet officials from a wider group of countries including the United States.

Tsai left Friday for a nine-day trip to Panama and Paraguay at the invitation of both hosts. In Panama she will attend the inauguration ceremony of the Panama Canal expansion project, an event Sunday due to draw heads of state and dignitaries from about 70 countries.

The president faces the risk that China will pull away some of 22 states that Taiwan has diplomatic relations with, including Panama or Paraguay, as her government’s relations with Beijing grow increasingly strained. Taiwan looks to those nations as a voice in the United Nations and for signs of Taiwan’s legal legitimacy.

China and Taiwan bought off each other’s allies in poor parts of the world until former president Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008 and opened talks with Beijing. Tsai, however, disputes Beijing’s “one China” condition for dialogue, so they have not talked since she came aboard May 20. The condition requires that both sides see each other as part of a single country.

China has seen proudly self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory since the civil war of the 1940s, rather than as its own country.

Tsai’s appearance at the Panama Canal ceremony may give her a rare chance to meet U.S. officials who seldom mix with Taiwan leaders, says Alexander Huang, strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan. China has diplomatic relations with the U.S. and opposes Washington's official contact with Taiwan, despite staunch informal ties between the two.

“There might be a chance to talk to the secretary of state or the wife of (Vice President) Joe Biden,” Huang says. “It gives an excuse for foreign leaders or dignitaries to shake hands with President Tsai. If she’s not taking this trip and then if something unexpected happens, then people will blame her for not going.”

The president’s trip also includes two transit stopovers in the United States, a sign that Washington believes she won’t damage already fragile U.S.-China ties. U.S. officials cut off her party’s previous president, anti-China firebrand Chen Shui-bian, from transit stops in the continental United States.

Tsai's visits in Latin America also will cement ties with Panama and Paraguay, Taiwan foreign ministry officials say. Like many of that nations that Taipei has diplomatic relations with, it gives them both development aid. Competition for the most aid pitted China against Taiwan over diplomatic allies before 2008. China, with growing economic and diplomatic power, has ties with more than 170 nations.

Tsai is due to meet Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela to discuss proposals to send Taiwan technical staff to help the Panama in agriculture, education and technology. She also is expected to tour a container terminal run by Evergreen Marine, a Taiwan company and the world’s fourth largest shipping line.

In Paraguay, she is scheduled to meet with President Horacio Cartes and speak to the Paraguayan legislature. She also is scheduled to review the progress of joint cooperation projects.

“We hope this first trip as president Tsai can show sincerity in strengthening our relations with diplomatic allies,” foreign ministry Deputy Minister Javier Hou told reporters.",2016-06-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['taiwan', 'tsai', 'panama', 'ties', 'consolidate', 'president', 'china', 'diplomatic', 'trip', 'relations', 'united', 'travels']",India,news article,English

Description of the disaster

On September 2nd, 2019, the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) issued a seasonal weather forecast for October â?? November â?? December (OND) 2019 short rains season which indicated a high probability for enhanced rainfall over the Western, North-western and Central parts of Kenya, while the Eastern sector had a high probability for normal rainfall. A much earlier onset was observed than had been predicted, particularly in the Northern, Eastern, Coastal, Central and Western parts of the country which started experiencing heavy rains from early October as opposed to 2nd to 3rd weeks or October as had been predicted. As per the weather predictions, the areas have seen highly enhanced rainfall since the start of October 2019. The heaviest rains with the highest intensity were received on 16/17 October with Mombasa, Matunga and Marine meteorological stations recording 100mm of rainfall as seen in Figure 1 below:

The KMD have since shared further information and explanation to the heavy and early onset of the rainfall. Scientific evidence has shown that Kenyaâ??s OND seasonal rainfall is highly influenced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). A positive IOD and El Nino result in enhanced rainfall in Kenya while a negative IOD and La Nina result in depressed rainfall. The heavy rains have been attributed to a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) index of .15Â°C (as of 12th October 2019).

This is the highest ever recorded in a season with neutral ENSO and a positive IOD. It is notably higher than was observed in 1961 (.0Â°C) which resulted in much higher rainfall and widespread flooding over much of the Country.

Figure 2 shows the rainfall observed in the OND season of 1961 (blue bars) as compared to the long-term mean (Orange bars) which shows the effect of the positive IOD and subsequently results in high possibility of heavy rains over the coming months than in 1961.

Based on the state of the Ocean and the early onset KMD has been issuing heavy rainfall advisories with the most recent being issued on the 23rd of October, 20191. The advisory indicated that heavy rainfall was expected over North East, South East, the Coastal Regions of Kenya, Western and Central regions including Nairobi Area. The 10-day dekad forecasts from the IGAD Climate Prediction & Application Center projected heavy rains for the period 21 to 31 October 2019. Additionally, with the enhanced rainfall expected in November and December, the frequency of heavy rain days is expected to increase over most parts of the Country Moyale, in Marsabit county as well as Turkana, Wajir and Mandera counties received very heavy rainfall and have remained cut off from access by humanitarian actors including the KRCS for two (2) weeks with a number of roads remaining impassable following collapse of bridges and roads cut off. This inaccessibility has affected community access to food from the markets which could negatively impact their food security status. There is also a risk of outbreak of diseases due to contamination of water sources and vector-breeding.

In parts of the Rift valley, West Kenya and Central highlands, heavy rains have also been experienced with varying levels of impacts including landslides and mud slides as reported by Kenya Red Cross branch staff and volunteers. In Elgeyo Marakwet County, a family of 4 lost their lives after their house was swept by a landslide in Turung village, Marakwet East. In Murangâ??a County, two landslides were reported which resulted in damage to houses and farms, but no injuries or deaths were reported.

Based on data from Kenya Red Cross staff and volunteers a total of 14,083HHs (approx. 84,367 people) have been affected, 21 deaths reported with 2 others injured. The number of displaced households is currently estimated at 6,000HHs. In addition, 531 acres of farmland have been destroyed and 21,675 livestock have been washed away. Assessments are continuously ongoing with a possibility of a significant increase in the number of affected populations.

The most affected counties are; Marsabit, Wajir, Mandera, Turkana, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kitui, Meru, Kajiado, Kwale, Nandi, Mombasa, Murangâ??a and Busia. It is important to note that flood prone counties in Kenya are those in western parts of Kenya as well as the coastal region. It is projected that as the rainfall intensifies counties in these regions will experience flooding and population displacements.",2019-10-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['iod', 'n', 'rainfall', 'positive', 'heavy', 'parts', 'dref', 'action', 'enhanced', 'counties', 'emergency', 'plan', 'kenya', 'mdrke045', 'rains', 'floods', 'western']",Kenya,news article,English

ABUJA, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Death toll has risen to 18 due to the floods caused by persistent rainfall in central Nigeria, said a local official on Wednesday.

Confirming the figure to reporters, Ibrahim Inga, head of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency in Nigeria's central region, said eight more deaths were recorded recently.

On October 16, Inga had earlier confirmed 10 deaths recorded over the past two months as the floods wreaked havoc in the state.

So far, 41,959 people have been displaced due to the disaster, the official said.

The floods, as a result of a localized high-intensity rainfall accompanied by torrential winds since August, also triggered massive run-off activities in streams and rivers in the state.

""The combined effect of the micro-climate trend and severe rainfall regime upstream of rivers Niger and Kaduna increased inflow in the basin, which resulted in the spillage of the water from the three hydropower dams,"" Inga told reporters.

He said 2,714 houses have been destroyed so far by the disaster. The flood swept through 20 local government areas, with 152 communities submerged.

The floods also badly damaged, roads, bridges, culverts and other buildings, the official said.

Inga said the excess waters had inundated several hectares of farmlands and displaced some dwellers in hinterland communities.

The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, which is responsible for issuing flood alerts here, had since early August issued an alert over possible flooding due to the high intensity of rainfall across the country.

The hydrological body said the flooding incidents are due to high rainfall intensity of long duration, rainstorms, blockage of drainage systems and poor urban planning resulting from the erection of structures within the floodplains and waterways.

This year, Nigeria's 36 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja, would witness different levels of flooding, the hydrological body predicted.",2019-10-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['official', 'death', 'roundup', 'nigerias', 'recorded', 'xinhua', 'rises', 'nigeria', 'rainfall', 'flood', 'central', 'hydrological', 'disaster', 'inga', 'flooding', '18', 'floods', 'toll', 'rivers']",Nigeria,news article,English

Damage to NTPC project may delay its commissioning, says Minister

The Uttarakhand glacier burst has caused an estimated loss of ₹1,500 crore at the NTPC's 480 mw Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project and has put a question mark on its scheduled commissioning in 2023, Union Power Minister R K Singh said on Monday.

The minister visited Tapovan on Monday to assess the extent of damage at the project site, a day after the glacier burst in Chamoli district.

""The project was scheduled to be commissioned in 2023. But there is a question mark now on how long it will take to desilt it as lakhs of tonnes of silt is lying at the project site,"" Mr. Singh told reporters in Tapovan.

""As of now it is difficult to say when we will be able to resume work at the site and when the project will be commissioned,"" he said.

To a question, he said estimated losses caused to the project are worth around ₹1,500 crore.

However, the Union Minister ruled out any possibility of the project being scrapped.

Why did a part of the Nanda Devi glacier burst?

It's not yet known what caused part of the Nanda Devi glacier to snap off Sunday morning, sending floodwater surging downstream toward power plants and villages.

Seismic activity and a buildup of water pressure can cause glaciers to burst, but one particular concern is climate change. High temperatures coupled with less snowfall can accelerate melting, which causes water to rise to potentially dangerous levels.

“Most mountain glaciers around the world were much larger in the past and have been melting and shrinking dramatically due to climate change and global warming,” said Sarah Das, an associate scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. - AP

2019 study warned Himalayan glaciers melting at alarming speed

A study published in the journal Science Advances in June 2019 had warned that Himalayan glaciers have been melting twice as fast since the start of this century due to climate change.

The study, spanning 40 years of satellite observations across India, China, Nepal and Bhutan, indicated that climate change is eating the Himalayas’ glaciers, the researchers said.

It showed that glaciers have been losing the equivalent of more than a vertical foot and half of ice each year since 2000 — double the amount of melting that took place from 1975 to 2000.

Experts point to climate change impact

A deluge that resulted from a glacial melt on Nanda Devi flooded the Rishiganga river in Uttarakhand and washed away at least two hydroelectric power projects — the13.2 MW Rishiganga hydroelectric power project and the Tapovan project on the Dhauliganga river, a tributary of the Alakananda.

There were also concerns that the excess water would further travel downstream to the river Alaknanda and threaten villages as well as hydro projects on the river.

However the India Meteorological Department has said that no rains are forecast. Officials of the Central Water Commission meanwhile said the flooding from the glacial burst has been contained.

Tapovan hydel project entirely washed away, says ITBP Officer

Venudhar Nayak, Commanding Officer of the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) who led the rescue operation at the tunnel of the NTPC’s Tapovan hydel project, where 12 workers were rescued after a seven-hour operation on Sunday, said the project was completely washed away, and the few houses that remain undamaged on the site were covered in slush upto 20 feet deep.

Over hundred persons are missing after the flash flood, caused by the splintering of a glacier, washed away two hydel power projects — the Rishiganga small hydro project and National Thermal Power Corporation’s (NTPC) Tapovan project on the banks of the Dhauliganga river in north Uttarakhand.

Mr. Nayak, whose team of 250 personnel were the first to reach the Tapovan project said it took them seven hours to unblock the tunnel where 12 persons were struck.",2021-02-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['rescue', 'glacier', 'commissioning', 'disaster', 'ntpc', 'persons', 'project', 'missing', 'power', 'delay', 'singh', 'burst', 'tunnel', 'uttarakhand', 'rk', 'damage', 'tapovan']",India,news article,English

The flood victims from 18 fishing landing sites totaling up to 1,800 have been hosted at the public schools since April while others are sleeping in churches.

""We are unsettled as district leaders because we must have a relocation plan for families that are currently hosted at the public schools because they will open for candidate classes on October 15 as planned by government,"" Mr Sam Kigula, the Nakasongola District chairperson, said in an interview last Saturday.

""We have received relief items, including the food and some tarpaulins, two times since the month of May but our worry now is about families that are staying at the different public schools,"" he added.

Mr Kigula revealed that they had hoped that the flood victims would be resettled on Kyalubanga Central Forest Reserve land as directed by President Museveni but the process is very slow.

Ms Margaret Komuhangi, the district Woman Member of Parliament, named some of the schools hosting the flood victims as Katuba Primary School, Busone Primary School and Kimaga Primary school.

""As leaders in Nakasongola, our plans are for a permanent relocation of the flood victims but the fact that some of the families now occupy school premises, which candidates are going to use, is a big concern,"" Ms Komuhangi told Daily Monitor.

""The children cannot share the same space with the displaced families because of the Covid-19 guidelines, including many other social problems that make such schools not fit for the candidate classes,"" she added.

Nabiswera Sub-county chairperson David Sserubombwe said many parents in his area are wondering how their children in candidate classes will attend schools currently hosting the displaced families.

""We have about 40 households that have camped at Katuba Primary School since April. We are yet to get information from the relevant government departments on how the children will mix up with the families whose members move out to look for the basics, including food, and return to the school,"" Mr Sserubombwe explained.

But Local Government minister Raphael Magyezi in an interview explained that government has a relocation plan where different districts that have displaced flood victims were tasked to identify some free public land for their permanent relocation.

""Let me find out from my commissioner the current status for Nakasongola District. I will brief you by Monday [today],"" Mr Magyezi said.

Meanwhile, a section of other people displaced by rising water levels in

Lake Victoria have started returning to their homes despite concerns about their safety.

Between March and June, thousands of people occupying the lake shores and some islands were displaced after water submerged various landing sites in various districts near Lake Victoria. Since then, the victims have been temporarily housed in makeshift houses on the mainland.

Government had directed local leaders in the affected districts to look for public land where flood victims can permanently be resettled. However, before government implements the planned resettlement, some victims have started returning to their homes, claiming the program has delayed.

Masaka District alone has close to 20,000 flood victims who were displaced from the landing sites of Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku , Malembo and Kachanga in March. ""Government should allow us return to the landing sites because it has no clear programme for us,"" Mr Samuel Ssemwanga, a fisherman at Lambu Landing Site, said.

According to Mr Willy Lugoloobi, the Kalangala District chairperson, the district has not received any assistance from government to resettle the displaced people.

""Good enough the water levels are now going down, and those who want to go back can start moving, but they should keep away from the protected buffer zones,"" Mr Lugoloobi said.

Mr Andrew Musana, a councilor representing Walukuba and Masese in Jinja South Division, said the fishermen who have started returning risk losing their lives.

""As local leaders, we wrote letters to government to help resettle those people but we have not got a response yet. It will be risky for those people to return to those islands and government should swiftly work out a clear resettlement plan for them,"" he said.

By John Marsham and colleagues

A year of exceptional rainfall, floods and locust outbreaks is decreasing the resilience of vulnerable populations in East Africa just at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The combination of these disasters is not random, as the floods, lake level and locusts can all been linked to climate change.

Covid-19 is a zoonotic virus, which means it has been transmitted from animals to humans. The illegal global trade in wild animals (notably Pangolins, which are largely exported to China) has been directly damaging East Africa’s ecology for years and, even if not yet proven to be the case for Covid-19, such trade increases the chance of zoonotic pandemics.

Water levels of Lake Victoria have just reached the highest point ever in the 120 year record, displacing thousands and flooding infrastructure.

Other floods in the region have displaced tens of thousands of people and killed hundreds. The locust outbreak is the worst in 70 years and may, according to the UN, grow 400-fold by June.

Combined, these increase vulnerability and reduce the ability of the population to engage in social distancing and to practise basic hygiene just as the Covid-19 crisis hits East Africa.

The Lake Victoria basin is home to around 40 million people. The lake is the largest tropical lake in the world and its outflow is a major hydropower source.

The lake has major cities of around 5 million people on its shores, including Kampala, the capital of Uganda.

Lake Victoria is unusual in that it receives most of its water directly from rainfall, not from rivers, and loses most by evaporation, rather than through its outflow: the lake level has varied by around 3m over the last 120 years.

The rise in Lake Victoria levels is one of the fastest on record. East Africa has experienced major flooding since October 2019.

The exceptional 2019 rainfall was caused by warm waters in the western Indian Ocean (called a positive “Indian Ocean Dipole”, which also contributed to the Australian fires). Together with effects of tropical cyclones and westerlies between October and December this led to the Lake Victoria basin experiencing 150 to 200% of its usual rainfall.

January and February 2020 also had above average rain, possibly related to persistent warm water in the western Indian Ocean. Climate change is expected to have increased the probability of these events and so the rapid lake level rise. March to May 2020 have seen further heavy rainfall, pushing up lake levels to the near record-breaking level.

Although we do expect climate change to favour such rapid rises in lake level, it is too early to say for certain whether we expect climate change to give higher or lower lake levels overall in the long term.

It is clear though that water management plans must plan for changes due to climate change, such as the recent rapid rise.

The fact that Lake Victoria spans three nations, and is a source of the White Nile that then supplies water to South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt, means that plans for Lake Victoria have international implications, so agreements and plans should be made well in advance, to allow adequate time to address the complex issues this will raise.

Climate change will continue to intensify rainfall and flood management must adapt.

The event illustrates how ‘natural disasters’, sometimes enhanced by climate change, are often interconnected. The exceptional rain of 2019/2020 has led to flooding directly from the rainfall, as well as from rivers and the lake, and has been linked to disease outbreaks.

The weather has affected crop growth and food prices, and has contributed to the locust outbreak. People in the region are suffering impacts of these events and Covid-19 simultaneously, or in quick succession, reducing their ability to cope, and acute food insecurity is growing.

Projected impacts of climate change on populations and ecosystems, and plans to increase resilience, must account for such systematic sequences of inter-connected events, as well as random sequencing of unrelated disasters.

The work reported on in this story is part of two projects: (1) FCFA’s HyCRISTAL project (funded by DFID and NERC) which is working to both improve climate information for East Africa, and use this to inform long-term decision making in the region, (2) HyTpp (funded by DFID, through the Corridors for Growth Trust Fund administered by the World Bank), which is analysing possible Lake Victoria water levels under climate change.

561,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana and Ivory Coast lift threat to suspend cocoa supplies - eNCA,https://www.enca.com/business/ghana-and-ivory-coast-lift-threat-suspend-cocoa-supplies,"ABIDJAN - Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's two largest cocoa producers, have ended a threat to stop selling their production in what was a push for higher prices.

In what they called a ""historic"" move, the two West African neighbours on June 12 vowed to suspend the sale of their 2020/2021 production to buyers unwilling to meet a minimum price of $2,600 per tonne, a move that shook the cocoa market.

The two African nations -- which together account for 60% of the world's production -- are campaigning to end a situation where cocoa producers make only $6 billion in a global chocolate market worth around $100-billion.

""The two countries decided to lift the suspension of sales of the 2020/2021 crop from today July 16,"" the chief of Ivory Coast's coffee and cocoa council, Yves Kone-Brahima, and Joseph Boahen Aidoo, chief executive of the Ghana Cocoa Board, said in a joint statement Tuesday.

At a meeting in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Adidjan on July 3, the two countries introduced a so-called Living Income Differential of $400 per tonne.

The differential would kick in for export contracts for the 2020/2021 crop if market prices fell below $2,600 a tonne.

A World Bank report released last week said Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer, earns just a fraction of the crop's potential value, and that 55%of cocoa producers live on about 757 CFA francs ($1,3 / 1,15 euros) a day, which is below the poverty line.

Cocoa accounts for 40% of the nation's exports but the country only earns about 8% of total profits in the cocoa-chocolate sector.

Almost 80% of the sector's profits are concentrated in the processing of chocolate paste and in the distribution of finished products to consumers, ""two phases in which Ivory Coast does not yet play a major role"", the report said.",2019-07-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['nations', 'lift', 'profits', 'coast', 'worlds', '20202021', 'cocoa', 'report', 'producers', 'supplies', 'threat', 'suspend', 'production', 'ghana', 'ivory']",Ghana,news article,English

Based on her enthusiasm, you'd have thought the tiny, two-room storefront for the elementary-school students had the grandeur of Google's headquarters. But, as I recall, it had few windows, and she was fighting to get local dog owners to pick up after their pets on the loose gravel outside the building - the barren spot where the trash cans were kept but also where the kids liked to make up games and run out their wiggles.

That was back in 2015, when I visited the OurBridge program in Charlotte, North Carolina, which Ganzó runs as executive director. I learned on my visit about the astounding diversity and expanding population of U.S.-born Hispanics, immigrants and refugees in the American South.

Charlotte continues to expand and serve as a gateway for new Americans. This has meant major changes for OurBridge and for Ganzó's newcomers.

""We've grown! In the last couple of years, we tripled the number of kids to about 200 and expanded to middle school-aged kids.

""We partnered with an elder care organization and are renting it for one dollar a year! We can take the kids to cook, on hikes; they have soccer fields and have planted a garden.""

It sounds like an oasis for children who are often scarred by the effects of war, deprivation and unspeakable trauma - whether it be from crossing our southern border or arriving here from Syria, Burma, Bhutan or the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Truly, it's a sanctuary. And I don't mean the new facility - I'm sure it is beautiful, but when I visited, I witnessed gold-standard student-centered engagement. Kids working with each other to build block towers, teachers modeling self-advocacy and problem-solving, older students helping younger ones with homework, groups practicing English and filling in the blanks with their shared language of hand gestures and smiles.

My visit to OurBridge sprung to mind when I heard Ken Cuccinelli, the White House acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, make a mockery of the Statue of Liberty's famous Emma Lazarus-penned inscription. He suggested: ""Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.""

What he didn't say was that almost all poor, undereducated immigrants can pull themselves up by their bootstraps - they just need a loving, helping hand.

""We make our families feel cared for, not just by teaching their kids English, but by advocating for them in the community,"" said Ganzó, herself an immigrant from Buenos Aires, Argentina. ""Last year when we had ICE agents knocking on doors, I had a parent calling me from the closet, scared because they were outside her house. We went to our elected officials to ask that the city not cooperate. Unfortunately, the mayor didn't sign on to do that, like many other major cities, but it gives our families peace of mind that someone is fighting for them.""

Ganzó said that both parents and students come to understand and eventually love the U.S., not because they're offered English as a second language classes or after-school care, but because they feel connected to their new home when their own homelands are honored.

""We know we don't want our families to 'assimilate' - that word is misused because it means that one culture supersedes the other. What we want to achieve is acculturation, where you learn and become part of a culture without losing your identity or where you come from,"" Ganzó said. ""We take the kids to their markets where they see their flags. We'll go to the Nepali store, the Asian market, the Latino food market, the African store -- then we ask them to help us buy the food for their recipes, and it makes the kids so proud that they know something that we don't know.""

People who seek to keep others out of this country don't realize that people who make the treacherous and heartbreaking journey to this country do so because they want to get on their own two feet. They don't want a handout, but their success here does rely on being met with a welcoming hand.

595,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,African youth pledge to combat Climate change - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/african-youth-pledge-to-combat-climate-change/,"Climate change has been the one of the greatest challenges facing Africa today, specially the Sahel.

It is obvious that, the fight against climate change requires strong involvement of African youth, international and regional cooperation.

It is in this regard, for two days, on 7and 8 July, 150 youth leaders from across Sub-saharan Africa and Niger itself gathered during the African Union Summit in Niamey and pledged to take all necessary measures to fight against the negative impact of climate change initially in the Sahel and ultimately across Africa.

Organized by the African Renaissance and Diaspora Network (ARDN) jointly with the Ministry of Environment of Niger, with the technical and financial support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Fund for Populations Activities (UNFPA), the Universal Peace Federation International (UPF), the event pulled together youth leaders who are members of the Youth Leaders Network of the United Nations for the SDGs (ROJALNU-ODD).

The Young African Leaders Summit on Climate Change is a platform for dialogue on thematic issues at the center of the global climate debate, bringing together promising young Africans on climate change issues.

It also created opportunities for the preparation and financing of a project on the implementation of the initiative “A Greener Africa, Youth and Climate Change» with a focus on regreening the Sahel, youth employment, the fight against ecological migration, the increased role of local authorities and the private sector.

The Niamey meeting was officially opened by the Minister of the Environment, Urban Sanitation and Sustainable Development Almoustapha Garba.

Apart from the 150-youth mentioned above, participants included members of the ARDN Board of Directors, the Ambassador of the United States Mr. Eric Whitaker, representatives of UNDP and other UN Agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector and the academic world.

According to Mr. Garba, responding to the challenges of climate change requires strong involvement of African youth, international and regional cooperation.

” Indeed, the most visible manifestations of the adverse effects of climate change and variability on our biophysical and social environment are, among others, droughts, the degradation of our natural resources, the accentuation of the phenomenon of migration, terrorism.

Judging the effects of these changes therefore requires a full commitment of countries to finance adaptation measures to reduce pollutant emissions, “Garba said.

Responding to the expectations of the participants, Dr Djibril Diallo, President and CEO of ARDN, welcomed the strong presence of young people, the involvement of the Ministry of the Environment and other collaborators for the success of the Niamey meeting.

In this perspective, he also met each representative of ROJALNU to better accompany them once in their respective countries.

“One of our priority actions at ARDN is to engage the leadership and enthusiasm of the youth as entry point towards popularizing the Sustainable Development Goals in Africa and its diaspora.

The 33rd Summit of Heads of State of the African Union provided an excellent opportunity to spread our message to give the opportunity to the young people who are the future of Africa, “said Dr Djibril.

ROJALNU Secretary General Alioune Gueye thanked the Minister of the Environment, ARDN and the organizing committee for allowing the young people to participate in the event.

During the work, the young people exchanged and shared good practices around three themes highlighting the role of young people, women, mayors and local communities, private initiative in the fight against climate change.

“We are very happy to participate in this meeting and to be able to exchange with our fathers to take together concrete actions in the fight against climate change in Africa.

As members of the human family, we pledge to take due account of the actions we take on a daily basis to minimize, prevent and combat climate change and its negative effects, Alioune Gueye added.

The Niamey Youth Leadership gathering ended with the adoption of the Niamey Declaration which contains deliverables that the youth can work upon on their return to their countries

of origin.

It will also be presented to the annual event of the African Renaissance and Diaspora Network on 25 September in New York.",2019-07-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'pledge', 'niamey', 'youth', 'fight', 'african', 'change', 'young', 'environment', 'climate', 'ardn', 'combat']",Ghana,news article,English

SAO PAULO, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people died Thursday in floods and landslides sparked by heavy rains in Presidente Getulio, a town in southern Brazil's Santa Catarina state, bordering Argentina, state officials said.

""The situation in Presidente Getulio is critical due to the floods: houses, vehicles, everything destroyed, people with water up to their shoulders,"" the head of the town's fire department, Alex Lima, said.

Civil defense rescue teams were also searching for 12 missing persons in affected neighborhoods, officials said in a statement.

A heavy storm early Thursday battered several towns, some close to Florianopolis, the state capital and one of the most important tourist destinations in Brazil.

Landslides blocked access to Presidente Getulio, home to 14,000 inhabitants, for a few hours.

Due to the possibility of new storms, it is important the population remains alert and heeds the instructions of civil defense authorities, Santa Catarina Governor Carlos Moises said.

The County Government of Mandera, Kenya.

Already navigating the coronavirus pandemic and the worst invasion of desert locusts for more than 25 years, parts of East Africa are now being devastated by flooding. Heavy rains over the last month have led to overflowing rivers and lakes and mudslides, with Kenya particularly impacted. Almost 200 people have lost their lives and according to the Kenyan Red Cross, while hundreds of thousands have been internally displaced since the rainy season began in March. Authorities and international organizations on the ground face an uphill battle against spiraling food insecurity, which had already been exacerbated by the locust outbreak, while at the same time working to curtail the spread of Covid-19, which remains the main focus of government resources.

Consecutive climate shocks

The latest floods have followed a series of intermittent droughts and flooding. Oxfam's Director of Humanitarian Systems in Kenya, Matthew Cousins, told CNBC that these weather events and the locust outbreak are the latest in ""a decade of back-to-back crises"" linked to climate change. ""It's a bit of a triple whammy really with Covid, locusts, floods, and it's happening more and more often which is our primary concern,"" Cousins told CNBC via telephone from Nairobi. ""Cycles between the droughts are getting a lot shorter, which impairs recovery time for herds for the poorest families to get their lives back. These areas are particularly vulnerable anyway, you've got underlying absolute poverty of anywhere up to 90% in some of the northern counties,"" he explained. Jemimah Khamadi Wekhomba, Kenya's health and nutrition coordinator for Action Against Hunger, said NGOs and authorities on the ground have barely had time to respond to one crisis before another hits.

Residents in Mandera County, Kenya, assess the damage from the latest round of flooding which has devastated the region. The County Government of Mandera, Kenya.

""These communities' roads were cut off, their infrastructure was destroyed, communication was destroyed, the health facilities submerged, schools submerged,"" she told CNBC. Wekhomba added that thousands of displaced people had been forced to move into the houses of friends or relatives, or into makeshift camps in vacant schools, which presents new challenges to social distancing in the age of Covid-19. ""The issue is there is not enough funding in terms of a response because the needs keep on increasing over and over again. There is a need for funding which the government cannot support by itself,"" she said, adding that the international community has a role to play. The International Monetary Fund last week announced a $739 million disbursement to Kenya under its Rapid Credit Facility, aimed at tackling the coronavirus pandemic. So far, just 887 cases have been confirmed in the country, but policymakers are wary of the impact the virus could have if allowed to take root in densely populated informal settlements. Wekhomba said policymakers and the affected communities were both ""overwhelmed"" by the scale and concurrence of the crises. She suggested that beyond the immediate response, funding will be required for a further three to five years to return affected communities to stability and better equip them to weather future shocks.

""People are talking about the effects of climate change, but we are here. We are already facing the effects of climate change,"" she told CNBC. ""There is a need to support these communities in terms of knowing how to handle their shocks and bounce back to their normal lives."" At a press conference last week, Eugene Wamalwa, the Kenyan cabinet Secretary for Devolution, appealed to Kenyans living in areas susceptible to floods and landslides to relocate to safer ground, with the situation expected to worsen in the coming weeks as rains persist until June. Wamalwa noted that the last time Lake Victoria reached current levels was in the 1950s, while Lake Naivasha has reached levels not seen since 1961. Along with ravaging crops and communities directly, the rains also favor the locusts' reproduction, with a second wave anticipated around June, coinciding with harvest season and further adding to the mounting humanitarian crisis.

Return of the locusts

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 20 million people are in severe acute food insecurity in East Africa. A single Desert Locust swarm, which can contain up to 150 million insects per square kilometer, is capable of eating as much food in a day as 35,000 people. It is thought to be the most destructive migratory pest in the world. The FAO's Desert Locust appeal, launched in January, has now requested $153 million in external funding and currently covers 10 countries â?? Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania and Yemen.

If left unchecked, the FAO estimates that the locusts could multiply 400 times by the end of June. Oxfam is coordinating with local partner organizations on the ground in affected areas across northern and eastern Kenya, who are working to track the swarms and deploy aerial and ground pesticide operations. ""I don't think they will be able to get on top of this swarm, so we will be looking at a third wave a little bit later on, and then after that, the locusts will naturally migrate with the winds back up north and then out over the Arabian sea to parts of the Middle East, or more likely Iran,"" Oxfam's Cousins said. He added that communities have ""very little room for maneuver"" in terms of food security should the next wave coincide with harvest season in June. ""With Covid and the floods hampering transport connections, the pesticides have been slow coming in, because they're normally brought in by flight and now they have to be brought in by sea,"" Cousins explained. The greatest concern, Cousins said, is the impact of the climate crisis on long term food security, particularly for children, in some of the poorest communities and harshest regions of the country.

354,DR-2021-000054-SOM,How mothers have helped in rebuilding Somalia - Garowe Online,https://www.garoweonline.com/en/featured/how-mothers-have-helped-in-rebuilding-somalia,"How mothers have helped in rebuilding Somalia

MOGADISHU, Somalia - For the last three decades, Somalia has been in shambles due to inter-clan conflicts, political wrangles, and, or Al-Shabaab threat, something which makes life difficult or even challenging for all players in the war-torn country.

During such conflicts, women and children are the most affected, with a number of them facing displacement, rape, and even death, thus making them captives of such eventualities. Thousands have been displaced, raped, or even killed in Somalia.

With these challenges including the economic downturn, Somalia women have yet, strived to build the country under these challenging circumstances, not forgetting the COVID-19 pandemic, which has even made life unbearable across the world.

On Sunday, Mothers Day was celebrated across the world, to mark what many mothers go through during good and bad times. The UNFPA Somalia seized the opportunity to salute all mothers for their extraordinary contribution to the nation, including this difficult COVID-19 season.

""Even under normal conditions, mothers face expectations that often defy science and reality. But now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, mothers are under increasing economic pressures. They are struggling with access to health care, social support, and growing unpaid care responsibilities,"" the global body said.

""This Mother's day, we celebrate the extraordinary strength, resilience, and unconditional love that defines motherhood. We salute mothers around the world for shouldering the burden of the pandemic,"" it further noted.

Most of the international organizations in the country feel safe working with women, who are victims of prevailing circumstances, thus the urge and zeal to protect them from real or imaginary enemies.

In tribute to mothers, the organization added: ""Mothers around the world are doing the impossible every day, but they shouldn't be expected to. Support our efforts to bring better healthcare to the most vulnerable mothers.""

Within Mogadishu, the Somali capital, there is a monument in the Hawo Tako area which was first erected 29 years ago. The monument gives women in the country hope and a sense of belonging, showcasing their enormous contributions to the country.

The United Nations has often saluted Somali mothers for their significant contributions towards peacebuilding, reconciliation, and the promotion of gender equality in their country. Despite being victims of the war, mothers have been on the frontline in pushing for peace and stability in the country.

UNICEF noted that with women, the life-saving of children becomes easy at the time the country is struggling with internal conflicts, wars, and other challenges such as floods and drought. They, it adds, ""are our biggest champions in these circumstances"".

Former European Union Ambassador to Somalia, Ms. Veronique Lorenzo, has previously rooted for more women appointments in the Somali cabinet, a move she argues will both provide a platform for peace and stability besides helping in gender mainstreaming.

“In Somalia, they (women), are a major powerhouse and they are prominent in their different roles. But very often these achievements are not recognized,” Ms. Lorenzo once said.

“They are drivers of reconciliation. They are at the center of peace. They are at the center of the state and peacebuilding. But despite their increased economic role, they have remained largely excluded from decision-making structures.”

“We as international actors want to support you,” added the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) for Somalia, Mr. Michael Keating.

“If you carry on doing what you have done in the last one year, victory will be yours,” Keating told a gathering of women leaders, government officials, and the Somali public, who converged in Mogadishu to mark the day.

The humanitarian crisis facing Somalia as a result of biting drought was a concern of several speakers.

Ms. Batula Ahmed Gaballe, the deputy Chairperson of the Goodwill Ambassadors, a women’s lobby group that advocated for greater participation of women in politics, expressed concern about the debilitating drought.

“I call upon all of us to help in alleviating the suffering of our children and mothers, who are dying of hunger, while some of us eat three meals a day,” she pleaded.

1254,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Minar-i-Pakistan lawns flooded with water - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1594825,"White Star

LAHORE: The government on Tuesday flooded the Minar-i-Pakistan lawns, the venue of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)s Dec 13 public meeting, which the opposition termed a failed effort to sabotage its power show.

In a related move, the Buzdar administration also rushed to enforce smart lockdown in 45 areas of Lahore, including those close to the rallys venue. The opposition also smells a rat in this move, saying the PTI government is taking every step to stop the opposition from holding the rally here but it will fail.

The government is also taking other measures  registering cases against those taking part in the PDM corner meetings and rallies and warning the caterers to extend their services to the PDM for its rallies  ahead of its (PDM) Dec 13 power show.

The government has not yet given permission to the PDM to hold a rally at Minar-i-Pakistan citing Covid-19 measures.

Ahead of PDMs Multan rally on Nov 30, the government had adopted similar tactics but the opposition had held the rally on the road.

Learning about the governments tactics, the PML-N leaders rushed to Minar-i-Pakistan and shut hosepipes.

The PTI government released water at Minar-i-Pakistan in the early hours of Tuesday. When we learnt about it we rushed there and stopped further watering (by the administration), PML-N lawmaker from Mohni Road Bilal Yasin told reporters at the venue.

He said Imran Khan had got so upset over Maryam Nawazs rallies in the city on Monday that an order was placed to flood the Minar-i-Pakistan on Tuesday.

I ask Imran Khan to at least respect his office of the prime minister, he said.

Commenting upon release of water at PDMs rally venue, Maryam Nawaz said in a tweet: This action reflects the fear of Taabedar Khan (obedient Khan) that his government is being sent packing. The Lahore rally will be held and the government be sent home too.

Special Assistant to CM Punjab for Information Firdous Ashiq Awan clarified that only three to four kanals of Minar-e-Pakistan were watered.

The way life of plants is connected with water, similarly Rajkumari (Maryam)s life is connected with lies, she said in a tweet.

During the last three days the Lahore police registered over 20 FIRs booking over 2,000 PML-N workers and leaders for committing Covid-19 SOPs violation and road block.

PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb, Talal Chaudhry, MNA Malik Riaz and MNA Shizra Mansab are among the PML-N leaders booked.

Maryam Nawaz told reporters at Jati Umra that the FIRs had been registered against over 3,000 PML-N workers which showed how much unnerved the government had been.

The PML-N also held a convention here to mobilise workers for the Dec 13 rally.

Speaking on the occasion, Khwaja Asif said 130 MNAs of the opposition would resign and they could not be stopped from doing so.

It is a sin to sit in the assemblies which cannot stop corruption and price hike, he said and added the PTI had realised that these assemblies could not run any more.

Talking to reporters Marriyum Auranzeb said: Fascist and incompetent Imran Khan is obsessed with persecuting the PML-N leadership, especially Shehbaz Sharif, while the entire nation suffers at the hands of his disastrous rule.

She said the level of this selected prime minister was that he was threatening the vendors of chairs and tents with FIRs.

Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan told Dawn that the government was taking legal action against the PDM for violating Covid-19 SOPs. We cannot allow the opposition to violate the law, she said and added if caterers or others provided services to the opposition for holding an assembly of more than 300 people they would also be booked under the law.

Pandemic Feeding Many Drivers of Conflict, Instability Says Secretary-General

Despite having suffered some of the COVID-19 pandemic’s worst socioeconomic impacts — including inflated debt burdens, job losses and worsening conflicts — Africa has to date received just 2 per cent of vaccine doses produced globally, the Security Council heard today, as it convened a high-level virtual debate on addressing the root causes of conflict in the continent’s post-COVID-19 recovery process.

Through a presidential statement (document S/PRST/2021/10) — issued at the meeting’s outset by Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, which holds the 15-member Council’s rotating Presidency in May — delegates expressed their concern over those developments. They reiterated the need to enable equitable access to quality, safe, efficacious and affordable COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, medicines and vaccines to all, including the most vulnerable.

Urging greater national, regional and international cooperation and solidarity — with the United Nations playing a coordinating role — they called for support to strengthen health-care systems and invited the accelerated donation of safe, effective vaccine doses to African countries in need, particularly through the COVAX Facility of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator. In addition, the Council acknowledged ongoing discussions on waiving intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and on easing global trade to support the provision of vaccines to everyone in need.

Members also heard briefings by several senior officials close to the topic. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, recalling his appeal early in the pandemic for a global ceasefire to enable countries to focus on combating the virus as their common enemy, said that, while the call was embraced by some armed groups and Governments — including in Africa — clashes nevertheless continued. Extremist groups in Western and Central Africa and Mozambique have continued and even increased their heinous attacks on civilians, creating additional challenges for societies and Governments. The recent attacks in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, and the increasing insecurity caused by the Allied Democratic Forces group in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, are tragic reminders of that serious threat.

In response, he outlined the accelerated efforts of his Special Representatives and Envoys to advance peace negotiations across Africa amid the pandemic, adding that the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission has worked closely with the African Union and regional economic communities to help leaders build back better. The Peacebuilding Fund has also adjusted its work in response to COVID-19, supporting national crisis‑management efforts, social cohesion and dialogue, and working to counter hate speech and disinformation.

“Many communities and countries on the African continent already face a complex peace and security environment,” he said, citing risk factors such as long-standing inequality, poverty, food insecurity, environmental degradation, urbanization and demographic pressures. Climate disruption is a further crisis multiplier, displacing communities and leaving people susceptible to recruitment by criminal gangs, violent extremists and armed groups. Some countries find themselves in a vicious cycle where conflict breeds poverty and fragility, in turn decreasing the resilience of societies and the prospects for peace.

As the world faces the possibility of an uneven recovery from COVID-19, he said it is clear that the crisis is feeding many drivers of conflict and instability. The severe economic fallout is aggravating tensions, and has already pushed an additional estimated 114 million people into extreme poverty. Economic growth on the African continent has slowed, remittances are drying up and debt is mounting. Meanwhile, in the name of fighting the crisis, some Governments have restricted democratic processes and civic space, and divisive rhetoric, hate speech and harmful misinformation are further eroding public trust. The pandemic has also had a disproportionate impact on young people — especially in Africa, the youngest continent — and on women.

Urging Member States to ensure those groups are meaningfully included in the shaping of post-pandemic recovery plans, he said recovery from the pandemic offers an opportunity to address the root causes of conflict, prioritize prevention and implement both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. While praising the Africa Taskforce created to ensure a unified approach to fighting the pandemic, he went on to sound alarm that of the 1.4 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine administered to date, only 24 million — less than 2 per cent — have reached Africa. “Equitable and sustainable vaccine roll-out worldwide is the quickest path towards a fast, and fair recovery,” he stressed, calling for the sharing of doses, the removal of export restrictions, ramping up local production and fully funding the COVAX Facility. “This pandemic has shown that we are only as strong as our weakest link and will only achieve recovery in solidarity,” he said.

Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), also briefed Council members, describing Africa as a continent of unparallel promise. It is home to nearly one third of global mineral reserves and nearly two thirds of the world’s arable land, as well as a young and dynamic workforce. It also holds the potential to deliver 40 per cent of the world’s solar energy. However, much of that immense promise remains untapped, blocked by obstacles linked to peace, security and development. “Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals […] will require overcoming complex legacy issues and the challenges that compound them,” he said, citing political instability, weak governance, inequality and now also COVID-19 and the climate emergency — “two of the greatest challenges of this generation”.

Noting that African countries account for a small fraction of the world’s reported COVID-19 cases and deaths relative to its population, he said those numbers nevertheless mask the crippling financial, social and political effects of the virus on the continent. Some 40 million Africans have already been pushed back into extreme poverty. As the technical lead of the United Nations socioeconomic response to the pandemic, UNDP is focused on saving lives and livelihoods. Its analysis shows that an “SDG [Sustainable Development Goals] push” now — combining bold policies and investments in governance, social protection, digitalization and the green economy — could lift millions of Africans out of poverty by 2030. A push towards vaccine equity is also needed, as less than 1 per cent of the population of most African countries are currently vaccinated.

Meanwhile, he said, the ratio of external debt to gross domestic product (GDP) in Africa has risen to an alarming 65 per cent, and COVID-19 is constraining fiscal space and making it more difficult for Governments to make strategic investments. This week’s conference on debt relief in Sudan, convened by France, is a good example of how world leaders can come together to countries by relieving the debt burden and unleashing development resources. As finance will be crucial to the recovery, UNDP contributed to the drafting of over 40 country-led socioeconomic response plans in Africa, generating new public policy insights at a time of unprecedented complexity. UNDP is also supporting 26 African countries to create Integrated National Financing Frameworks, ensuring that financing for the COVID-19 recovery is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

“For Africa, a sustainable recovery must be powered by sustainable energy,” he continued. Three quarters of the nearly 800 million people with no access to electricity live in sub-Saharan Africa, while, because of the pandemic, 100 million more Africans can no longer afford sustainable energy options. Calling for urgent action to achieve the goal of clean, affordable energy for all by 2030 — and net-zero emissions by 2050 — he went on to draw links between those targets and good governance. From its many projects and studies on the ground, he said UNDP has learned that “when you want to address the root causes of conflict, investing in development works”.

Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, noted a rising trajectory in the number of COVID-19 infections and fatalities across Africa. Stressing that the pandemic will continue to have a profound impact on the continent’s economic and social development, he said the biggest challenge Africans face today is that of vaccine access. It is folly to think the world secure from the COVID-19 crisis while Africa lacks protection against the virus and its variants, he said, adding that slow economic growth, reduced international trade, increased external debt and rising inflation have further deteriorated the socioeconomic situation in many African nations. Twenty countries currently face the risk of collapse due to debt burden alone. In that context, he called for new thinking and initiatives to address the crisis, emphasizing that economic recovery must focus on fiscal stimulus and debt exclusion rather than austerity.

He went on to point out that global travel bans and national lockdowns have disrupted local economies and affected both formal and informal sectors, causing job losses, inflation and a lowered standard of living in many African countries. The pandemic has also had devastating consequences for African small and medium‑sized enterprises and public hospitals. Massive job loss has stripped many parents of the means to send their children to school, while strains on health‑care systems endanger the lives of citizens suffering from other chronic diseases. Among other things, he stressed the need for urgent coordination on vaccine distribution and debt relief that accounts for the countries’ unique circumstances. Concluding, he urged the international community to not lose its pre-pandemic momentum in recognizing the nexus among peace, security and development, as expressed in the 2030 Agenda.

In the ensuing debate, Council members stressed the primary importance of ensuring equitable, affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all and highlighted the necessity of a strong partnership between the United Nations and regional organizations, particularly the African Union. Pointing out that African challenges can only be truly solved by African leadership, many stressed that the continent cannot — and should not have to — tackles these issues alone, calling for increased international support of African-led initiatives. Others linked the continent’s colonial past to its present problems, urging States to lift economic sanctions imposed on African countries to promote socioeconomic recovery in the wake of COVID-19.

Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, which holds the Presidency of the Council for May, delivered remarks in his national capacity. Stressing that no country in the world can respond to the current pandemic crisis alone — and no country should be left alone to do so — he described Africa as a critical part of the global response. The international community should accelerate its provision of medical supplies and make vaccines affordable and accessible, including through technology transfer, capacity‑building and the provision of excess doses. In the area of peace and security, he spotlighted the crucial partnership between the United Nations and the African Union, calling for more support as the latter works to fight terrorism, achieve sustainable development and prevent the root causes of conflict. States which currently have economic sanctions imposed on African nations, including on Zimbabwe and Sudan, should urgently lift them. Development partners should think creatively to help Africa build its capacity and boost self‑sustained innovation, he said, voicing support for the African Continental Free Trade Area and for initiatives aimed at reversing historic injustices in global governance. In that regard, he noted that African countries now account for more than a quarter of the United Nations membership. The Organization will not be able to hold its moral ground until it finally gives Africa the equal voice it deserves. “This is what true multilateralism is about,” he stressed, outlining China’s strong and long‑standing support for the continent, including its recent decision to cancel the debt of 15 African countries amid the pandemic.

Othman Jerandi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia, pointing out the disastrous health impacts of the pandemic to date — 3.4 million deaths and more than 160 million infections, only expected to increase — said that the coming phase will be even more difficult as the pandemic’s socioeconomic and security consequences may continue for several years to come, worsening conflicts and making addressing the same more complicated. He urged an equitable global response to pandemic recovery — so that disparities between States do not deepen — calling for the international community to address debt sustainability and liquidity issues, to alleviate the debt burden for developing and least developed countries and to ensure equitable global vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines have brought with them renewed hope for recovery and a return to development and normalcy, but least developed countries are lagging — while 10 States in the world retain 75 per cent of these vaccines, less than 2 per cent of all Africans have received any dose thereof. He called on the Security Council to adopt a more comprehensive concept of peace and security that accounts for existing vulnerabilities and the impact of the coronavirus.

Jean-Yves Le Drian, Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, underscoring that public health, the planet and security “are common goods that we can only defend together”, said that his country’s first priority is guaranteeing universal, equitable access to vaccines for the people of Africa, who deserve more than announcements and “vaccine cronyism”. France was the first country to provide the COVAX mechanism with financial support and vaccine doses — because of this, Mauritania has benefitted from 100,000 doses already, and four other countries in Africa will receive doses by the end of May. Noting that any discussion centred on equitable vaccine access necessarily includes a discussion of intellectual property, he supported an immediate lifting of impediments to the export of vaccine components. France’s second priority is to support African peace and security initiatives; for example, a political and civil leap is necessary in the Sahel to provide basic services in vulnerable areas as a complement to military action in the region. He added that the international community must support Africa on the path to sustainable development, as the current crisis has only exacerbated poverty and food insecurity on the continent.

Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Minister for External Affairs of India, said the deep solidarity between his country and Africa is expressed through the India‑Africa Forum Summit, “Group of 77” developing countries and China, Non-Aligned Movement, and most evidently, at the United Nations itself. “It is a matter of continuing regret for us that the voice of Africa is not given its proper due in its most pivotal institution,” he said, expressing support for the Common African Position, as stated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. As Africa’s capabilities in facing COVID-19 are “still in the making”, the world must stand by the continent. India has supplied medicines, vaccines and health equipment, and post‑pandemic, its approach, as articulated in the 2018 Kampala Principles, outlines support without conditionalities and in line with African expectations. Pointing to India’s peacekeeping presence in South Sudan, Somalia, Abeyi, Western Sahara and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he endorsed the call to support Africa’s counter-terrorism operations with sustained funding. Bilaterally, India has partnered in the establishment of defence institutions in Nigeria, Ethiopia and the United Republic of Tanzania.

Bui Thanh Son, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam, said centuries of slavery and colonialism have dragged the great continent of Africa into poverty, strife and underdevelopment. Now, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely worsened Africa’s socioeconomic prospects, exacerbated ongoing conflicts and undermined efforts to address their root causes of these conflicts. While Africa’s challenges can only be solved by African leadership, the continent cannot — and must not — do it alone. International support and assistance are essential, including to putting in place the peace, stability and security that are prerequisites for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19. It is critical to fully implement Council resolutions 2532 (2020) and 2565 (2020), particularly their calls for a global ceasefire and a durable, extensive and humanitarian pause. Much more also needs to be done to reduce poverty and inequality, address underdevelopment and rectify social injustice. In that vein, he called for close partnerships between the United Nations and African regional and subregional organizations in Africa, particularly the African Union, and the ongoing engagement of the Security Council.

Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence of Ireland, said peace and security in Africa is a key focus of his country’s international development programme. Citing COVID-19’s uneven impact, he declared: “Our efforts to respond in a collective and coherent manner have been insufficient.” The pandemic must be addressed everywhere at the same time, he said, saying Ireland is providing €100 million to global public health in 2021 — including bilateral support to the COVAX Facility — and is part of the European Union’s broader €860 million contribution. Calling for a focus on conflict settings and the related challenge of climate change, he cited the multiple and repeated shocks of drought and flooding currently affecting the Horn of Africa. He voiced support for the African Union’s efforts to advance socioeconomic development, including through the new African Continental Free Trade Area, calling on all parties to live up to their international legal obligations. That includes in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, which has seen many people killed, injured or displaced in recent months. Among other things, he went on to call for the promotion and protection of human rights for all; redoubled efforts to achieve gender equality; good governance; and for the rule of law to be meaningfully integrated into COVID-19 recovery strategies.

Eva-Maria Liimets, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Estonia, underlined the need to work collectively to overcome the pandemic and address the root causes of conflict. For the recovery to be meaningful, partners must ensure unhindered humanitarian access to conflict areas. Reiterating Estonia’s support for the Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire, she said it is now crucial for the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines and other immunization programmes. Estonia will never stop underscoring the importance of good governance, accountability, compliance with international humanitarian law, the protection of human rights and respect for the rule of law — all of which play an important role in the conflicts in Africa. To help the continent build back better, its partners must work to get COVID-19 under control faster. The European Union is leading in that regard, having already contributed over €2.47 billion to the global COVAX Facility. Europe also remains the leading exporter of vaccines worldwide, exporting almost as many doses as it provides to its own citizens. Estonia supports Africa in that regard, and also recently adopted its first-ever comprehensive strategy for Africa (2020-2030) which focuses, among other things, on digital transformation, e-governance, innovation and a green transition.

Mutahi Kagwe, Cabinet Secretary for Health of Kenya, said Africa’s security challenges have grown more difficult to manage, due to the emergence of new threats from climate change, migration, terrorism and violent extremism, among others. African States must strengthen their capacities and institutions to respond to pandemics and invest in human security. “A greater focus on the people is needed to ensure that Africa has enough skilled workforce,” he stressed. Africa has special needs, and thus, must be integrated differently in the world economy with a focus on value addition and manufacturing. The causes of conflict relate to poverty and unequal resource distribution, making job creation for young Africans a priority, along with greater State capacity to reach and administer ungoverned spaces, build cohesion among diverse peoples and embrace inclusion in all spheres. He called for boosting the COVAX Facility and enabling easy access to it by all African countries; debt relief and restructuring; investment in national and regional transport and energy infrastructure; and climate change adaptation programmes. He similarly called for greater cooperation between the Council and the African Union to prevent, manage and resolve conflicts, adequate resourcing through assessed contributions of all such peacekeeping missions, including the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), and a unified voice in tackling terrorism.

Dag-Inge Ulstein, Minister for International Development of Norway, stressed that COVID-19 is compounding the impact of conflict and climate change in Africa, widening the poverty gap and undermining development gains. Pandemic response, meanwhile, has been used as a pretext to limit civil liberties and human rights. “This is not the way to build trust,” he said. The pandemic must be met with leadership, partnership and a willingness to address the causes of conflict, as demonstrated by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Mali. Attempts to limit the spread of the virus are hampered when State authorities are absent or too weak to play their role, making it “extremely challenging” to roll out vaccines. He called for a long-term, dynamic, fair and inclusive approach to addressing the causes of violence. Stressing that the African Union’s normative work on democracy, good governance, human rights and rule of law is essential, he encouraged the bloc to take further steps to resolve the conflict in Tigray, Ethiopia, noting that national and local voices must be brought to the table — and heard — especially those of women. Indeed, post‑pandemic recovery cannot wait. He called on States to start planning now — addressing the causes of conflict — through partnerships and preventive diplomacy.

The representative of the United States said it is not only challenges, but also opportunities, that connect human beings across the globe at this critical moment. Noting that the decisive actions taken by many African leaders to prevent the spread of COVID-19 saved countless lives, she outlined the United States’ long‑term partnerships and investments across the continent, which among other things have greatly reduced child and maternal deaths and prevented the spread of HIV. On 17 May, President Joseph R. Biden announced that 80 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine will be donated “where they are needed most” outside the United States, with no strings attached. Turning to the serious impacts of climate change in Africa, which is a source of conflict and insecurity in countless communities, she said economic recovery will be a key piece of the continent’s post-COVID-19 recovery. In that regard, she called for engagement by the international community that supports more equitable growth and more transparent, market-based development strategies. The United States supports the initiative of the G20 and the Paris Club to provide debt suspension to some countries, as well as plans by IMF to provide special drawing rights. Underlining her country’s long‑standing belief that democracy is the most powerful way to prevent conflict, she outlined its support for electoral processes and good governance, emphasizing: “If people have a voice and a vote, they are less likely to turn to violence.”

The representative of Mexico, noting the numerous challenges to achieving sustainable peace across Africa, urged the international community to focus on improving institutional strength and the rule of law, on ending the illicit traffic of small arms and light weapons and on addressing the exploitation of the continent’s natural resources. Further, it is necessary to promote the active participation of all members of society — particularly girls and young women — in all stages of post-pandemic recovery to ensure that process is effective and inclusive. Citing World Bank data that the pandemic has pushed some 40 million people in Africa into abject poverty, he called on the Security Council to guarantee all countries on the continent access to COVID-19 vaccines, as political tensions and conflicts might worsen if vaccinations continue at the current, slow rate.

The representative of Niger, noting that African issues represent more than half of the items on the Council’s agenda and account for 70 per cent of peacekeeping interventions, cited a range of challenges that have plagued the continent since colonial times. Today, climate change and the pandemic are compounding those challenges, but also provide an opportunity to finally address Africa’s many intersecting crises. In that context, he called for a lifting of patent rules and intellectual property rights; relaxation of global trade rules; and efforts to make technology and know-how accessible to all. Describing COVID‑19 as a “widow-maker”, he said development and poverty‑reduction efforts must address the needs of widows and orphans, thereby preventing their radicalization by armed groups and reducing social unrest. At a time when many developed countries have already vaccinated huge swaths of their population, he emphasized that Africa’s population remains vaccinated at a rate of less than 1 per cent. Countries on the continent have also suffered severely from the pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts, and require substantial debt relief, special drawing rights and other support to reviving their economies. Such measures should also be applied as the continent addresses the “silent pandemic” of climate change, he added, while echoing the call to urgently overhaul the global governance structures that have long rendered African countries onlookers as others make decisions about their destiny.

James Duddridge, Minister for Africa at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office of the United Kingdom, noting that the challenges of recovering from the pandemic are numerous and interconnected, called for a comprehensive approach across the pillars of human rights, peace and security and development. The United Kingdom has worked with its partners towards equitable access to COVID‑19 vaccines around the world, and under its presidency, the Group of Seven (G7) doubled its contributions to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) ACT‑Accelerator and the COVAX Facility. Citing the risks posed by conflict, he said “vaccination ceasefires” are crucial. Turning to the post-pandemic recovery, he urged Member States to consider ways to ensure that everyone, particularly women, girls and young and marginalized people, have the chance to fulfil their potential. In that regard, he called for increased access to health care, education, poverty reduction and efforts to end preventable deaths. As climate change also continues to magnify challenges, especially in Africa, the United Kingdom has pledged more than $15 billion in international climate finance over the next five years and will continue to support sustainable development and peace processes across the continent.

The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines said that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, security risks in Africa have become accentuated, social contracts have faltered, public trust has diminished and ethnic, intercommunal and political divisions have deepened. Stressing that “lasting solutions can never be imposed”, she said the surest pathway to peace and security in Africa is through home-grown solutions. The expertise of local and regional actors — grounded within the unique context of Africa — must be leveraged through enhanced partnerships among the United Nations, African Union and subregional organizations that span the continent. She called on developed countries to honour their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, to provide greater debt-relief and long-term capacity-building assistance in line with national priorities and to withdraw prejudicial constraints — including unilateral coercive measures — imposed on African countries in favour of inclusive, people-centred and climate-informed solutions delivered in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals.

The representative of the Russian Federation pointed out that the relevance of today’s debate is evidenced by the fact that the Council devotes upwards of 70 per cent of its discussions to crises in African countries that face threats like terrorism, organized crime, arms and drug trafficking and exploitation of natural resources. While the Council often hears of the relationship between development and security, the “theoretical interdependence of various processes” should be left to the academic community; United Nations entities should instead focus their efforts on practical solutions to existing problems within the scope of their mandates. She said that, in many ways, the root causes of conflict in Africa are the consequences of the continent’s colonial past, and colonialism is taking on new forms — in addition to unfair trade policies and restricted market access, there is active interference in the internal affairs of States. If such interference does not achieve the intended result, then the “sword of Damocles” of unilateral coercive measures hangs overhead, inhibiting swift economic recovery and preventing true independence. She said that, despite this, it is encouraging that African countries, guided by the principle of “African solutions to African problems” are forging an independent path to recovery.

An artist’s impression of Zhongguo Zun in the CBD. The building, which will house offices of CITIC Group, will be the tallest in Beijing when it is fi nished, standing 510 meters. WU LU / FOR CHINA DAILY

BEIJING - Developers working on a new skyscraper, which once built will be the capital's tallest building, say they will break ground on the project on Sept 19.

CITIC Group, which won the rights to the land in the Central Business District with a bid of 3.6 billion yuan ($563 million) last December, plans to build a 510-meter-high office tower with 104 floors above ground and four basement levels.

""The final design hasn't been decided yet, as the group is waiting for the municipal government's approval, but the building will be higher than 500 meters,"" an insider at CITIC Real Estate who refused to be named said on Monday.

The new skyscraper is called Zhongguo Zun, which means China Goblet, as the inspiration for the design came from an ancient ritual vessel. Construction will be completed in five to seven years, the insider said.

The land where the building will stand is in the north of the CBD, which houses many international companies. The capital's tallest building now is Tower 3 of China World Trade Center, which is 330 meters tall and is also in the CBD.

""It is going to become a new landmark for the city,"" said an official in charge of the CBD who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

The skyscraper is expected to serve as an office building for CITIC Group. ""The company will occupy the whole building, and even then the space will not be enough,"" added the CBD official. ""Also, the company can't rent any of that office space for 10 years, as stipulated in the contract it signed with the municipal government.""

Wu Chengtao, editor of Skyscraper Magazine, said: ""The building, to some degree, demonstrates the city's image and economic strength, and will attract more investment. Besides, the competition among cities, both at home and abroad, has become more and more fierce, triggering many cities to pursue more super high-rise buildings.""

He said at least three skyscrapers above 600 meters were under construction in Shanghai, Wuhan and Shenzhen. The number of buildings higher than 500 meters is much larger, ""and I can't remember them all"", he added.

""Considering its economic strength and influence as the Chinese capital, Beijing could build one higher than 700 meters,"" said Wu. ""However, the tallest building will be about 510 meters, which shows the city is pursuing stable development.""

The design of the new skyscraper adopts many elements from traditional culture, such as the Kongming (Floating Paper) Lamp. ""The building will remind people of the ancient Chinese city, representing Beijing's image perfectly,"" said Wu.

However, the high-rise will bring about some problems, experts say.

""Having a large amount of people concentrated in a limited place will put huge pressure on transport and the environment,"" said Yan Jinming, a professor of land management at Remin University of China. ""Plus, the requirements for foundations, equipment to prevent disasters and fires are more strict, thus the cost is much higher.""

Wu agreed and said that since the CITIC Group is involved in broad business, lots of related enterprises will move closer for convenience, causing a hike in rental prices.

""However, as more jobs will be created, on a whole, the advantages brought by the new skyscraper will outweigh the disadvantages,"" he added.

1328,FL-2017-000155-VNM,"Hunt for missing rescue team in flood-hit Vietnam, more rain forecast - Phys.org",https://phys.org/news/2020-10-team-flood-hit-vietnam.html,"More rain was forecast for the coming days

A search operation has been launched for a missing rescue team as severe flooding and landslides battered central Vietnam, authorities said on Wednesday, as the country braced for further heavy rain.

Close to a million people have been impacted by heavy downpours and rising waters since mid last week, with more than 200,000 homes flooded, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Thirty-six people are now dead, Vietnam's disaster management authority said, while rescue workers have launched a search for around 30 people missing at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue province following landslides.

The missing include a team of soldiers and officials who had tried to find plant workers who disappeared days ago.

Images on state media showed helicopters and hundreds of soldiers struggling to access the site through thick mud and fallen trees.

Elsewhere across the central region, villages and rice fields were submerged, with relief workers resorting to makeshift boats and canoes to deliver food and bottled water to those stuck in flooded homes.

North central Vietnam was also hit by severe weather on Wednesday as Storm Nangka made landfall.

Forecasters said it could bring further rain in the coming days, while warning another storm was expected to form and make impact this weekend.

The IFRC said it had ""grave fears"" that the deadly floods would worsen as more rain was dumped on hard hit communities.

""These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods,"" said IFRC's Hung Ha Nguyen.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and is often affected by more than a dozen storms each year, regularly bringing flooding and landslides.

More then 130 people were reported dead or missing due to natural disasters in the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.

845,FL-2018-000134-IND,The Daily Fix: Kerala needs more than a Band-aid to survive annual monsoon miseries - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/889908/the-daily-fix-kerala-needs-more-than-a-band-aid-to-survive-annual-monsoon-miseries,"The Big Story: Monsoon log

Over the last few days, torrential south-west monsoon rains have left a trail of destruction across Kerala. Since Wednesday, as many as 22 people have died and four have gone missing in rain-related incidents. The gates of 22 major reservoirs, including the giant Idukki reservoir that can store up to a height of 2,403 feet, have been opened after water levels threatened to breach the maximum storage capacity.

Floods have drowned hundreds of villages and towns, while landslides have destroyed roads, houses and farms. Personnel from the National Disaster Response Force, Army and Navy are being deployed for rescue operations. The bleak situation may continue for a couple of days as the meteorological department on Thursday issued a red alert to at least five districts for August 10 to August 13. A red alert is issued if heavy rainfall of between 12 cm to 20 cm is expected within a 24-hour period in a particular area. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday described the situation as “grave”.

According to the data from the Indian Meteorological Department, Kerala received 1,739.4 mm rainfall from June 1 to August 8 against the normal of 1,508.2 mm – 15% more than the normal rainfall till Wednesday. All Kerala’s 14 districts, barring Kasargod and Thrissur, received excess rain.While such downpour has been a major cause for the destruction, it is not the only one.

The majority of the human casualties have been caused by landslides. Of the 22 deaths reported on Wednesday, 20 people were crushed to death when boulders from cliffs fell on their homes. Unregulated construction in the guise of development has contributed significantly to the situation. The chance of landslides increases when human intervention such as constructing high rises, stone quarrying and building roads become rampant. The use of explosives to blast through rocks in quarries is another factor. A recent study conducted by scientists TV Sajeev and CJ Alex of the Kerala Forest Research Institute found that there were 5,924 big, medium and small quarries in Kerala.

The state has also witnessed unprecedented flooding thanks to the indiscriminate reclamation of lakes and paddy fields. This had blocked many waterways, preventing water from draining freely into the sea. In the third week of July, flooding drove 170,000 people in Kuttanad in Alappuzha district to government-run relief camps. A report by renowned scientist MS Swaminathan had blamed the floods on unplanned road laying across the region, with no regard to the direction of water flow. The government contributed to an environmental disaster recently when it brought a legislation that made it easier to reclaim land for infrastructure projects that “benefit the public” – a sweeping term open to cynical misinterpretation. Environmentalists claimed the legislation would devastate paddy fields and wetlands.

The monsoon has compounded the miseries of people who live on the sea shore as giant waves battered their villages and homes. The disappearance of beaches is a huge cause of concern in a state where the coast is mainly protected by sea walls, groynes and breakwaters. However, experts have warned that these man-made structures actually exacerbate beach erosion and do not provide a long-term solution for the problem.

Governments always act when disasters strike. But what residents need is long-term plans to reduce quarrying, land reclamation and stopping the construction of man-made structures along the coast to prevent future monsoon miseries.

“India’s graft system was not as orderly as it used to be in Malaysia or South Korea,” writes James Crabtree in the Hindustan Times. “But for a few years in the mid-2000s it just about worked, until the wheels fell.” “Scrapping of the special laws would close the last opening for reconciliation in Kashmir and therefore in South Asia,” writes Naeem Akhtar in the Indian Express. “Handing out a final defeat to people of the state at the hands of their own country would come in a situation where even status quo could mean victory for them.” “All nationwide surveys under the government of India, including the Census, the National Family Health Survey and evaluation reports by the drinking water and sanitation ministry, either made no distinction between the use of toilets and their construction, or did not include usage as a metric,” writes Pritha Chaterjee in the Print.

Yingluck Shinawatra, Thailand’s prime minister, has insisted that she has a firm grip on policy as defends herself against critics who claim she remains in the shadow of her elder brother, Thaksin, the exiled former leader.

“People didn’t know me the first day when I stepped from the business environment into politics,” Yingluck told the Financial Times. “I was new to politics, but I was not new to the business side. After some time, I think I have proved I can handle and overcome all surprises.”

Since her election in August 2011, Yingluck, 45, has survived a legal challenge to her government, an economic downturn and Thailand’s worst flooding in half a century.

The army has stayed in its barracks despite fears of yet another coup, and the revered king, 84, has fought off illness, postponing what could become a constitutional crisis over royal succession.

“More than one year has passed. We understand how we need to improve each policy and how we would like to move Thailand forward,” she said in an interview in the ornate reception room of Government House in Bangkok.

Yingluck, who will meet Prime Minister David Cameron in Britain next week, recently named a new cabinet that bears more of her own imprint.

Critics point to the elevation of some Thaksin loyalists after the recent expiry of a five-year court ban on their political activities. But her promotion and retention of favored ministers outside the Thaksin camp, including finance minister Kittirat Na-ranong, showed growing assertiveness, according to Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor at Chulalongkorn University.

“Yingluck has increasingly come into her own,” he said. “She listens to Thaksin, but he controls [the ruling] Pheu Thai party more than she does. It’s like he is chairman of the board and she is CEO.”

Thitinan said Yingluck could become a “bridge builder” between pro-Thaksin “red shirt” supporters and “yellow-shirted” monarchists. So far, the opposing camps have avoided a repeat of their bloody clashes in 2010 but tensions remain.

The opposition Democrat party has criticized what it describes as Yingluck’s populist policies, including a minimum wage and a generous rice subsidy scheme. The most recent national Abac poll shows that 53 percent of voters would reelect Yingluck’s party against 36 percent for the Democrats.

Yingluck said her new cabinet — dubbed Yingluck 3 because she has already reshuffled ministers once — would be forward-looking and would disprove notions that she is just a front for her brother, who was ousted in a 2006 coup.

“Be fair to me and let me prove I can run the country,” Yingluck said.

Thaksin, who speaks frequently of his desire to return to Thailand, continues to undermine his sister’s authority by suggesting he runs the government from his self-imposed exile. He hopes to overturn a two-year jail sentence on corruption-related charges that he claims were politically motivated.

This week, Thaksin abruptly canceled a planned gathering of his “red shirt” supporters in a Burmese town on the Thai border, citing security concerns.

Thitinan said the former prime minister had “done Thailand a favor” by staying away. Many fear his return could plunge the country back into the political violence that for years pitted his “red shirt” supporters against “yellow shirt” royalists.

“So far he has been willing to stay in exile and run Thailand virtually by remote control,” he said.

Yingluck for now appears to have abandoned attempts to secure her brother a pardon, which would clear the path for his return. While she praised her brother’s “many good policies,” she stressed that she was running the country.

“We have new policies . . . he hasn’t the chance [now] to run the country,” she said.

She said she had gone some way toward closing the red-yellow divide. She made light of a no-confidence motion later this month, saying it was a positive sign that political battles were now being fought in parliament rather than on the streets.

Yingluck’s premiership has been shaken by last year’s floods, which killed more than 500 people and badly damaged Thailand’s manufacturing base, especially car and computer production. Her government, though criticized for its handling of the floods, took extraordinary measures to help companies, particularly the Japanese manufacturers that dominate Thai industry.

Far from leaving Thailand, as the government had feared, Japanese companies appear to be increasing investments, due to the strong yen and, in some cases, to relocate production from China amid a growing anti-Japan backlash over a maritime dispute. This month, Nissan became the latest to expand its Thai production base, announcing a new $380 million car plant near Bangkok.

Yingluck’s much-criticized handling of the flood-related crisis was among her only regrets, she said. “We lost about three months solving the problem of flooding. I wish I could gain this time back, because we have many things to do.”",2012-11-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['thailands', 'shes', 'insists', 'prime', 'brothers', 'minister', 'yingluck', 'supporters', 'puppet', 'run', 'thailand', 'exiled', 'thaksin', 'thai', 'shirt']",India,news article,English
1326,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Vietnamese pick up the pieces after 2020s relentless storms - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/31/vietnam-storms,"Climate change increases the risk to hard-hit central provinces, but few want to leave the only home they know.

Hue, Vietnam  Before floodwater inundated half their living room one night during the storm season this year, the Trans put their most valuable possessions  their TV and refrigerator  in the attic and told their two daughters to take refuge there.

Tran Nhu Hong, 23, and her 18-year-old sister, who do not know how to swim, survived the storms  the worst her generation had ever experienced and the worst her parents had seen in decades.

A neighbour was not so fortunate. The 19-year-old student was swept away in the floods after the vehicle she was travelling in was tipped over by the force of the water  on the same route the two young women usually take.

Shortly after the water retreated, I went on that route and the vehicle was still there and had not yet been pulled out (of the mud), Hong said. I dont dare to go on that route late at night any more.

Across central Vietnam, cascading floods from October onward inundated the living and the dead, as record rainfall submerged towns and cemeteries. Authorities said earlier this month that the typhoons, which they referred to as abnormal, cost the Southeast Asian country 30 trillion dong ($1.3bn) in damage and killed at least 192 people  a death toll more than five times higher than the 35 COVID-19 deaths Vietnam recorded this year.

A woman drives along a flooded road beside submerged rice fields [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] In general, it is well-established that rainfall from typhoons is increasing due to climate change, both from observations and from models, said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead climate scientist at the Red Cross Climate Center and World Weather Attribution, whose team is conducting a study on the role of climate change in the recent floods and typhoons in central Vietnam.

Crops destroyed

With 70 percent of the population living in coastal areas and low-lying deltas, Vietnam is highly exposed to riverine and coastal flooding and is also one of the worlds most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.

There is even more damage after the floods, Hong said, driving by rice fields made inlets because of the storms and floods in her hometown in Thua Thien Hue Province.

When the water retreated, it took crops with it, leaving behind scarred earth. Many farming families in central Vietnam count on rice, various other crops and cattle for income, especially as the Lunar New Year celebration, known as Tet, nears.

Tet is usually when Vietnamese shop for new clothes, gifts and appliances to welcome a new, fulfilling beginning; but with their homes and means of living ravaged by violent storms, severe floods and devastating landslides, Tet, which will take place in February, is likely to be tinged with sadness.

Hongs parents are still recovering from the wounds and infections they got from wading through hip-high flood water for extended periods, and have yet to find jobs as construction workers due to the double burden of COVID-19 and the recent natural disasters.

Ichiro Sato, senior associate with the Climate Program and Sustainable Finance Center at US-based think tank World Resources Institute, says central Vietnam was battling extreme weather events long before climate change started to take effect.

If governments have not been well-prepared even for the conventional risk of weather-related disasters that existed before climate change  and I am afraid that is the case for Central Vietnam  then there are so many things they have to work on before worrying about the additional risk of climate change, Sato said, adding that unregulated urbanisation and economic growth may increase vulnerability to weather-related disasters in places like Vietnam.

The country typically endures between five and six storms and about three tropical depressions a year, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, but in 2020 a total of at least 14 ravaged the country. Seven consecutive tropical storms and cyclones hit the central region between October and mid-November.

Children at risk

According to the UN, an estimated 7.7 million people in nine provinces, including 2.5 million children, were affected  with hundreds of thousands of houses flooded, damaged or destroyed.

There is no doubt that children are those most affected by natural disasters, Rana Flowers, UNICEF representative in Vietnam, told Al Jazeera, adding that families ability to secure nutritious food for their children had already suffered as a result of the pandemic.

An estimated 375,000 people were sent to evacuation centres during the storms and floods, including about 90,000 children, according to Flowers.

Many of the evacuation sites were overcrowded, did not have access to sufficient water and sanitation and healthcare, and lacked appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children, Flowers said, adding that the situation severely affected the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children.

A study brief published in August by the US-based Society for Research in Child Development showed that children may suffer longer-term physical and psychological deficits than adults, including difficulty sleeping or concentrating and losing interest in their usual activities  chronic mental health symptoms have been observed among children as long as four years after a disaster.

A woman carries food through the submerged streets of Hue in central Vietnam [File: Manan Vatsyana/AFP] In the long run, to be sustainable, the Vietnamese government should invest more to strengthen mental health services for children and their families, looking at the nationwide system and also building the workforce, Flowers said.

Deforestation, which affects the ability of the land to retain water, also contributed to the flooding and a series of severe landslides during the stormy season, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said at a legislative National Assembly meeting last month.

Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam lost 657,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of primary forest  23 percent of its total tree-cover loss according to data from international monitoring service Global Forest Watch. About 50 percent of all tree-cover loss between 2001 and 2019 took place in 11 of the countrys 63 provinces  eight of them in central Vietnam, it said.

The devastating landslides and flooding have prompted concerns about deforestation caused by the construction of hydropower plants in forests.

As of 2018, there were 385 dams in operation, with an additional 143 under construction, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Earlier this month, the minister acknowledged the increased evidence of the loss of watershed forests and vegetation, as well as a loss of soil adhesion, as a result of the developments.

The government has also announced sustainable and long-term missions to cope with storms in central Vietnam, including upgrading climate-change adaptation scenarios and relocating people in areas at risk of landslide and flooding.

No place like home

For those who have been living in the area for generations, like the parents of 21-year-old university student Le Thi Thuyen, leaving their storm-battered homes seems unfathomable.

We can be accustomed to annual storms but whenever they come, we are still worried, said Thuyen, a native of Quang Binh, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the central region.

Thuyen, who left for Ho Chi Minh City to study and is currently an intern at a non-governmental organisation in Vietnams biggest city, called her parents and siblings back home every day when the storms were pounding their commune, flooding and isolating homes in low-lying areas.

Tears welled up in her eyes when she thought of her 12-year-old brother who does not know how to swim.

Cemeteries were inundated as floodwaters rose in central Vietnam [Sen Nguyen/Al Jazeera] I read news about kids who got swept away by the flood and I was really worried about my brother, the 21-year-old said.

Thuyens parents, who make a living from agriculture and working on other peoples farms, have already been struggling this year because of the pandemic  and the storm season has created more problems, destroying their crops, and fish. It also meant weeks when there were no jobs to be found.

Tet this year wont be as fulfilling as others for us, Thuyen said.

983,FL-2020-000038-EGY,"North Korea lifts lockdown in city, rejects flood, virus aid - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent",https://egyptindependent.com/north-korea-lifts-lockdown-in-city-rejects-flood-virus-aid/,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lifted a lockdown in a major city near the border with South Korea where thousands had been quarantined for weeks over coronavirus worries, state media said Friday.

But Kim, during a key ruling party meeting on Thursday, also insisted the North will keep its borders shut and rejected any outside help as the country carries out an aggressive anti-virus campaign and rebuilds thousands of houses, roads and bridges damaged by heavy rain and floods in recent weeks.

Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency also said Kim replaced Kim Jae Ryong as premier following an evaluation of the Cabinet’s economic performance and appointed Kim Tok Hun as his successor.

Entering the last year of an ambitious five-year national development plan, Kim Jong Un in December declared a “frontal breakthrough” against international sanctions while urging his nation to stay resilient in a struggle for economic self-reliance.

But experts say the COVID-19 crisis likely thwarted some of Kim’s major economic goals by forcing the country into a lockdown that shut the border with China — the North’s major ally and economic lifeline — and potentially hampered his ability to mobilize people for labor.

During Thursday’s meeting, Kim said it was clear after three weeks of isolation measures and “scientific verification” that the virus situation in Kaesong was stable and expressed gratitude to residents for cooperating with the lockdown, KCNA reported.

Kim said his country now faces a dual challenge of fending off COVID-19 amid a worsening global pandemic and repairing damage from torrential rain that lashed the country in past weeks.

KCNA said 39,296 hectares (97,100 acres) of crops were ruined nationwide and 16,680 homes and 630 public buildings destroyed or flooded. It said many roads, bridges and railway sections were damaged and a dam of an unspecified power station gave way. There was no mention of any information related to injuries or deaths.

Kim expressed sympathy with people who were at temporary facilities after losing their houses to floods and called for swift recovery efforts so that none is “homeless” by the time the country celebrates the 75th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s founding on Oct. 10.

“The situation, in which the spread of the worldwide malignant virus has become worse, requires us not to allow any outside aid for the flood damage but shut the border tighter and carry out strict anti-epidemic work,” KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying.

Kim’s public rejection of international aid for flood recovery and his decision to release Kaesong from quarantine are negative indicators for inter-Korean cooperation as South Korea had hoped to restart diplomatic engagement by providing support in these areas, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.

Cho Hey-sil, spokesperson of Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said the South remains willing to provide humanitarian assistance to the North.

North Korea in past months has severed virtually all cooperation with the South amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang, which faltered over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief and disarmament steps.

The North in June blew up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, following months of frustration over Seoul’s unwillingness to defy US-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program and restart joint economic projects that would help the North’s broken economy.

“The North Korean economy, while touting self-reliance, is increasingly dependent on China and will struggle to balance sanctions-busting efforts and COVID-19 prevention,” Easley said. “The job of North Korea’s new premier will be to show the country has recovered from recent flooding and has upgraded public health facilities” by the October party anniversary, he said.

In late July, Kim ordered a total lockdown of Kaesong and had the nation shift into a “maximum emergency system” after the North reported it found a person with COVID-19 symptoms.

The North’s state media said the suspected case was a North Korean who had earlier fled to the South before slipping back into Kaesong. But South Korean health authorities say the 24-year-old hadn’t tested positive in South Korea and never had contact with any known virus carrier.

North Korea later said the person’s test results were inconclusive and still maintains it is virus-free, a status widely doubted by outsiders. Some experts said the North was likely trying to shift the blame over a possible spread of the virus to South Korea.

In an email to The Associated Press last week, Dr. Edwin Salvador, the World Health Organization’s representative to North Korea, said the North has told the UN agency it quarantined 64 first contacts of the suspected Kaesong case and 3,571 secondary contacts in state-run facilities for 40 days.

Since the end of December, North Korea has quarantined and released 25,905 people, 382 of them foreigners, Salvador said.

942,FL-2019-000179-CAN,How brokers can stop a flooded basement - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/how-brokers-can-stop-a-flooded-basement-1004162024/,"A recent study suggests brokers have a golden opportunity to talk to homeowners one-on-one about how to protect homes from basement floods.

With the right information and often for less than $500, homeowners can protect themselves from the increasing risks of basement floods, according to a report from the University of Waterloo. The study suggests homeowners are looking to people they trust — such as brokers — to provide the right information.

“Our project tested the effectiveness of various outreach approaches to motivate residents to address basement flood risk,” said Cheryl Evans, director of the Home Flood Protection Program (HFPP) at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation. “Sending out flyers and posting tips on social media helps to raise awareness, but that is not enough. Residents trust advice from flood-impacted neighbours, insurance providers and even informed staff at hardware stores…

“One-on-one conversations with people they trust make all the difference for many people.”

What information can brokers provide to their clients about basement flooding?

The HFPP studied results from home flood risk assessments completed by flood risk assessors at more than 500 homes in southern Ontario and Saskatchewan in 2017 and 2018. Based on the study, the report reveals the Top 10 ways for homeowners to protect themselves against basement flooding; several of the items cost less than $500 and can be done over the weekend.

Home assessments in Ontario found a number of common issues inside the home, including:

no backup sump pump, or backup power to run the sump pump in case of emergency (85%)

basement furniture and electronics at risk of water damage (71%)

lack of maintenance of backwater valves (53%)

failure to maintain sump pumps (40%)

Outside the home, the assessments revealed:

window wells lower than 10 to 15 cm above grade (82%)

downspouts that deposit water less than two meters from the foundation (78%)

poor grading that directs water towards the foundation (69%)

cracks or gaps in the basement windows (63%)

Homeowners in the study cited cost as the Number 1 reason why they did not complete the repairs or installations necessary to prevent basement floods. But the price tag paled in comparison to the average price to repair a flooded basement — $43,000 in 2018.

Sixty percent of study participants reported completing actions that cost under $500 and could be done by a “handy” homeowner generally within a day. Examples included: storing valuables in waterproof containers or removing them from the basement; cleaning out eavestroughs; installing window well covers; and extending downspouts and sump pump discharge pipes to a minimum of two metres away from the foundation.

Forty percent of participants completed actions that were more complex, costly and often required the support of qualified contractors. The cost of completing these actions ranged widely from $500 to over $10,000. Some of these actions included installing a backwater valve, backup sump pump or backup battery; re-lining or replacing a sewer lateral; installing a sewer lateral cleanout; replacing basement windows; replacing eaves troughs; replacing a driveway; and installing window wells.",2019-04-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['pump', 'homeowners', 'brokers', 'risk', 'sump', '500', 'basement', 'flooded', 'installing', 'replacing', 'flood', 'study', 'stop']",Canada,news article,English

462,Drought Sri Lanka,Live cattle exports face government crackdown after Sri Lanka shipping deaths - RNZ,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/country/391964/live-cattle-exports-face-government-crackdown-after-sri-lanka-shipping-deaths,"Exports of live farm animals might decline even further when a government review wraps up in about a month.

Photo: 123RF

That review is likely to prohibit exports of live cattle as a default position.

Exemptions would be granted if applicants could prove that conditions for the animals were good both on board their transit ship and at the country of their destination.

Sales of other stock besides cattle are not affected at this stage but could be brought in later.

Trade in live animals is declining anyway.

PGG Wrightson, a company that previously dealt in live cattle, is however shrugging off any risk of serious losses from a government crackdown.

The government review started after hundreds of New Zealand and Australian cattle died after they arrived in Sri Lanka.

The shipments were organised by an Australian company.

Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said several options were being considered but a conditional ban on live cattle export was one that he favoured.

His comments followed a progress report presented to Cabinet this week.

""The continued export of cattle may be a risk to New Zealand's brand,"" Mr O'Connor said.

""The time has come to rethink this area and consider whether it's something that fits within our values as a country.

""When animals leave New Zealand we set conditions that are considered world-class by veterinarians.

""There have been incidents over the last few years that highlight the fact that once animals leave New Zealand we have very limited ability to ensure their wellbeing when they reach their destination.""

These comments follow a series of controversies about live exports from Australia.

Here in New Zealand, the value of the business has been on the decline.

2016 : 40,506 cattle exported, valued at $84.3m

: 40,506 cattle exported, valued at $84.3m 2017 : 27,306 cattle; $63.7m

: 27,306 cattle; $63.7m 2018: 17,319 cattle; $30.1m

In response to the announcement, Federated Farmers said it supported having a review of the trade, but conditions for animals on ships were better than was sometimes portrayed.

It cited one case where live sheep were sent to help Mexico recover from a drought, that benefited both countries.

PGG Wrightson said it used to do live shipments but had not done any for a while because the market for these shipments had dropped.

The minister said the policy would apply to cattle at this stage, but that might not be the end of it.

""The vast majority of the value of [shipped] animals is horses that go around the world.

""We [also] have exports of day-old chicks, as well as goats and others.

""Cattle are where we have had difficulty in ensuring the welfare of animals when they reach their destination, but there may be other incidents where we need to have a closer look at other animals species.""",2019-06-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['face', 'exports', 'zealand', 'shipping', 'shipments', 'live', 'sri', 'lanka', 'cattle', 'review', 'valued', 'conditions', 'crackdown', 'animals', 'deaths', 'wrightson']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
496,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Glass Half Empty: The Future of Water Access is Exceedingly Grim - BRINK,https://www.brinknews.com/glass-half-empty-the-future-of-water-access-is-exceedingly-grim/,"Photo: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images

Water scarcity will become a pressing societal and geopolitical issue in the near future, owing to the popular perception that access to water is a human right. The economic reality—rather controversially—stands in stark contrast to that utopian ideal.

At a recent Brookings Institution conference titled Tackling the “Water Problem”: Challenges facing U.S. regulation, sustainability, and global geopolitics, a panel of experts addressed the topic of water security in the context of geopolitics. Their predictions for the future painted a devastating picture of widespread water scarcity, with the brunt of the impact falling on women, the poor and other marginalized groups of people.

Betsy Otto, the global director of the World Resources Institute’s Water Program, opened the panel using statistics to lay out the global scope of the problem. “By 2025, 1.8 billion people are going to be living in areas where they have absolute water scarcity,” Otto said. “As much as 40 percent of the world’s population … by 2035 could be living in seriously water-stressed areas.” The crisis, she added, would only be exacerbated by climate change and the onslaught of longer and more extreme storms and droughts. “We are in the throes of a quiet but growing crisis in much of the world that we are really sort of just ignoring,” Otto said.

However, while Otto addressed projections dating forward to 2025 and 2035, Kumud Acharya, an engineer who leads the Ecological Engineering group at the Desert Research Institute, emphasized that many low- to middle-income countries already struggle with water scarcity and have been forced to reckon with the problem for many years.

“I was born and raised in Nepal, and I’ve seen 60, 70 percent of people in the country I was born, they still don’t have clean drinking water supply,” Acharya said. “In remote areas of Nepal, people actually have to walk miles to get a bucketful of water, still. And it’s really done by women.”

The Economic Value of Water

However, the panel’s discussion of water scarcity was derailed by a more ethical and philosophical question: If water is a human right, is there such a thing as “illegal water,” or “water theft?”

The question was raised by Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at Brookings’ Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence and the author of a new Brookings report titled Water Theft and Water Smuggling: Growing Problem or Tempest in a Teapot? In her report, Felbab-Brown defined “two broad schools of thought,” standing in opposition to each other on this topic: The first, she wrote, “defines water as a basic human right, and often opposes the pricing of water, particularly increases in prices.” The second “sees water as a commodity to which value needs to be assigned … to maintain its sustainability and efficient use.”

“We need to be more realistic about the fact that water does need money. If you pay for it, it will cost less.”

Based on the findings of her report, Felbab-Brown asserted that water theft is indeed possible. She argued that despite the reality of inequities in water distribution, illegal water sourcing ultimately hurts everyone: Theft increases scarcity across the system, subjects the marginalized to legal repercussion and increases in policing, and strains existing water utilities by withholding funds for regular maintenance and upkeep.

Chris Gasson, publisher of Global Water Intelligence, agreed with Felbab-Brown’s conclusions, and offered his analysis of the overarching economic problems with water theft.

“The total amount of what you might call the unnecessary cost of water—that is, the time wasted, the health costs, the coping costs—that more or less adds up to the same amount of money that you would have to spend if you were going to give everyone 24/7 potable water plus a sewer connection with waste water treatment,” Gasson said. “We do need to get a hell of a lot more realistic about the fact that water does need money. If you pay for it, it will cost less.”

Glass Half Empty

Felbab-Brown cautioned that it was increasingly easy to envision a future in which water scarcity might be used as a cudgel in political conflicts. She cited India and Pakistan as key examples: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already threatened to deny Pakistan water in response to tensions over terrorism between the two states.

“We have really not seen instances yet on cross-border water smuggling,” Felbab-Brown said. “But I think one of the aspects of the future will in fact be the emergence of cross-border water smuggling and that will not only present a difficult human rights, legal policing challenge, but also perhaps extra dimensions of conflict.”

Even barring the question of political and violent conflict, the panelists agreed that urbanization was a huge burden on water supplies. “Cities are growing and being developed without sustainable water planning,” Acharya said. “Obviously, we need to deal with climate change, but [urbanization] is a more pressing issue for me right now.”

Gasson proposed an economic solution. “Dubai was building [desalination] plants every two years, or every one year until 2008,” he said. “And then in 2009, they decided that they were going to—for the first time ever—charge Dubai citizens for water, and they actually charged a fairly decent amount. And immediately, overnight, water demand in Dubai fell by 15 percent.”

“It can all be done,” Gasson said, with a chuckle. But given the weight of the question, it’s not clear that the audience nor his fellow panelists felt similarly humored by his assessment.",2017-04-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'glass', 'exceedingly', 'right', 'need', 'global', 'question', 'access', 'human', 'future', 'problem', 'half', 'otto', 'grim', 'scarcity']",Ghana,news article,English

But most Egyptians view his rule as a time of painful belt-tightening, with soaring inflation, a currency crash and cuts to subsidies that have made fuel, electricity and water more expensive.

Now there is a ray of hope emerging a hundred miles offshore.

It comes in the form of a windfall natural gas discovery with the potential to lift Egypt’s limping economy, build a new commercial alliance with Israel and, maybe, even revive the country’s diminished regional clout.

Egypt’s gas push is part of a tectonic shift in energy and geopolitics. Natural gas, long a poor cousin to oil, is gaining importance and becoming a tool for countries to leverage power and prestige. Advances in the shipping of liquefied gas have made it a global fuel and strengthened the hand of countries that until recently were not major energy exporters, including the United States and now Egypt.

The flood of new gas has been bad news for traditional exporters, particularly Russia, which has had to slash gas prices to maintain sales to Europe. Many European countries have long sought to reduce their dependence on Russia and are eager to establish new suppliers even if that means doing business with autocratic states like Egypt and Qatar, a longstanding gas supplier embroiled in a bitter diplomatic feud with its Persian Gulf neighbors.",2019-03-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['fuel', 'egypt', 'russia', 'field', 'influence', 'offshore', 'growth', 'natural', 'exporters', 'countries', 'long', 'energy', 'looks', 'states', 'gas']",Egypt,news article,English

Kyrgyzstan: Building advocacy strategies...and team spirit!

In Central Asia, a place not known by many, a fantastic meeting was organised by HelpAge International. This was the first time HelpAge had hosted a meeting with its network partners and offices that work in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) and included participants from Ukraine all the way to Tajikistan.

The meeting took place at Lake Issyk-Kul, the tenth largest lake in the world. The location was perfect for what we wanted to achieve, which was to focus, share and bond. Some of us took the bonding to another level and courageously jumped in the lake which could not have been warmer than 7 degrees Celsius!

As we approached the lake from the capital Bishkek, I could not stop wondering how the beauty of the country and its people is overshadowed by the side effects of what the Soviet era has left behind.

Stronger advocacy

We spent four days learning about each other's work and building stronger advocacy and project plans. We also did a lot of team work and learned about our various needs and interests. We came out of it energised, enthusiastic and most importantly, we became friends.

With Aisuluu, the EECA Regional Communications Officer, I hosted a one day session on advocacy. We learned a great deal about the challenges of doing advocacy work in a post-Soviet region. We were impressed to hear about our partners' achievements, for example the Resource Centre for Elderly in Kyrgyzstan. Since 2002, they have been pushing forward the adoption of a law for older people. Through political turmoil, frequent changes in government and a revolution, their persistence has led to concrete success.

Our partners' key achievements

In Ukraine, our partner TLU has worked to ensure older people are safe from abuse on public transport. They developed yellow cards and distributed them to bus drivers who were rude to them. And in Armenia, Mission Armenia has built a great relationship with the government which has resulted in a massive 20% of their funding coming from them.

In the next three years, we will grow and focus our advocacy work on improving older people's access to health services, increased social protection and stopping discrimination and violence against older people.

We spent the rest of the time reflecting on our internal strengths and planning our three year approach to advocacy. Our discussions and debates got quite heated, but by the end of the day, we reach common objectives. We agreed that the EECA network has strong experience in the field of ageing and, over the course of 30 years, we have established ourselves as ageing experts. This is also recognised by governments, donors and institutions.

Hopefully this meeting has helped us to improve our understanding and will boost communications and allow for more cooperation.

222,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Low reinsurance retentions to help Australian insurers as flood claims rise - Artemis.bm,https://www.artemis.bm/news/low-reinsurance-retentions-to-help-australian-insurers-as-flood-claims-rise/,"Australia’s flooding catastrophe event continues and has spread, with the Insurance Council warning that its estimate of losses has already reached A$254 million as of early today, while its designation of the catastrophe event has expanded to include South East Queensland.



As of early today, the number of claims filed and recorded by the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) had passed 17,000.

Yesterday, the ICA highlighted the billion dollar loss potential of the flooding and related storms.

15% of the claims filed so far are from the Queensland area, hence the expansion of the designated catastrophe event to include parts of that state.

Previously, the ICA had declared a flood catastrophe event for large parts of New South Wales.

The main concerns continue to be around western Sydney, but with flood waters spreading the expectation is that claims will rise and perhaps significantly, as it remains early days for filing given the ongoing event.

The ICA has estimated an initial insurance and potentially reinsurance market loss of A$254.2 million, which is based on the average cost of claims from previous similar events, not the actual cost of claims filed.

IAG, which is Australia’s largest general insurer, said that as of this morning local time it had received 5,811 claims for damage to homes, properties, and vehicles.

That’s up significantly from the 2,100 claims IAG had reported as of Sunday.

The expectation continues that this will prove to be the latest reinsurance event after a catastrophe in Australia.

S&P Global Ratings highlighted that while the Australian flooding will drive an influx of claims for the country’s property and casualty (P&C) insurers, it is not expected to hurt their credit quality.

Supporting their credit quality is reinsurance capital and the major Australian P&C carriers have ample in-force for this kind of event.

“While the ultimate losses for individual insurers will vary–depending on their exposure to the hardest hit areas, the declared number of events, and the structure of their reinsurance arrangements–we expect these to be manageable,” S&P explained.

Adding, “We expect it will take weeks for many claims to be lodged. Nevertheless, we believe that Australia’s P/C insurers are well-placed to assess and meet claims that arise with reinsurance protection shielding the larger insurers from outsized losses.

“The three largest primary insurers have relatively low retentions, in the A$150 million to A$250 million range, before catastrophe reinsurance kicks in.”

Those low catastrophe retentions may prove vital for some insurers with these floods, enabling them to claim on occurrence towers.

There is also a chance of further aggregate tower deductible erosion and perhaps some aggregate reinsurance recoveries, depending on how high claims rise.

The Copernicus Emergency Management Service has published some very useful flood inundation maps, which you can access here.

Floodwaters continue to rise in some areas and the peak may still be a day away as waters surge down rivers. But rainfall levels have tapered off a little, suggesting the worst from this specific catastrophe event may soon be behind the affected region.

Learning in the Nyanza region has been disrupted and transport paralysed in some areas as heavy rains left schools flooded and some roads cut off after bridges collapsed.

Many learners are unable to access their schools while the few who have been reporting have been sent back home.

Transport services were paralysed in parts of Siaya, Migori and Homa Bay counties after key bridges were washed away by floods following a heavy downpour.

St Paul Nyamasao Primary, Ogenya Primary in Nyando, and St Marks Nyabera and Kasagam schools in Kisumu East are some of those that have been affected.

St Paul Nyamasao Primary School head teacher Hosea Nunda told the Nation the backflow from Lake Victoria started filling the school compound on Tuesday afternoon.

""We had to send the children back home though the teachers are still in the staff rooms,"" said Mr Nunda. He added that by Tuesday, 150 learners out of 450 had not reported to school.

According to Kakola-Ombaka location assistant chief Jacob Ongudi, many families have been displaced.

""About 1,800 families have been forced to move and seek shelter in churches around,"" he said.

By Sunday, Nyando residents had started moving to higher grounds. The most affected areas are Kasiwidhi South, Kaloo South, Kanyipola South and Kasambula Kosawa.

Mr Ongudi appealed to the county government and well-wishers to step in and provide relief food, medical aid and non-food items for the flood victims.

In Migori, pupils in Angugo, Kabuto and Nyora primary schools in Nyatike sub-county failed to report as schools reopened for third term due to the floods

The ongoing heavy downpour has seen over 800 families left homeless for close to a month weeks after Kuja river broke its banks, flooding several villages . Compounded by the backflow from Lake Victoria, Angugo, Nyora, Modi and Lwanda villages are inhabitable.

Transport services were cut off between Kanyamkago in Migori County and Kanyikela in Homa Bay County after a bridge that connects the two areas collapsed. The Oria-Riat bridge on Kuja river collapsed on Wednesday morning. No casualties were reported.

Migori County Commissioner Boaz Cherutich said a team comprising the Red Cross, education officials and local administration had been dispatched to assess the situation.

""We are planning to relocate the pupils to neighbouring schools,"" he said.

In Siaya, the Dhogoye Bridge connecting Bondo Usenge and Osieko was washed away by floods. The Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) sent out a travel advisory following the increased rainfall.

Workers prepare a wind turbine for shipment at the Gamesa factory in Tianjin. The company said it will invest in two new plants in China. Provided to China Daily

Beijing - Gamesa Corp Tecnologica SA, a leading Spanish wind turbine manufacturer, plans to invest 90 million euros ($128 million) by 2012 in China, the world's largest wind power country, said Jose Antonio Miranda, the newly appointed chairman of Gamesa China.

That figure includes investments in two new plants in Jilin province and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region this year.

China is planning to greatly expand its offshore wind power capacity to 5 gigawatt (gW) by 2015, and wind turbine manufacturers are preparing to capture the demand.

Gamesa is set to launch its first offshore prototype, the 5 megawatt (mW) G11x model, in the US next year. Meanwhile, it is developing the larger, 6 or 7 mW G14x wind turbine, which is expected to be operational in two or three years.

The new chairman hopes the G11x will be installed in China in two years.

But the Chinese manufacturer Sinovel Wind Co Ltd has already made a 6 mW wind turbine and is looking into following through with 10 mW turbines.

Though China represents more than 20 percent of its revenue globally, Gamesa's market share has been declining since 2005, when it commanded one-third of the market.

The wind power sector is seeing a trend of focusing on quality, while in the past it was growth, Miranda said.

""People have started to think about the quality of the machines and the real value of high quality products after the incidents in Gansu province,"" he said.

Four major incidents happened this year in Jiuquan, Gansu province, one of the country's major wind power bases, in which equipment failures led to 2,978 turbines being disconnected from the grid, raising concerns about the Chinese wind turbines.

The energy cost of running an offshore turbine will be huge in 20 years and low quality machinery that will eventually damage the investment return is a poor idea, Miranda said.

By the end of 2010, China's overall wind power capacity amounted to 44.73gW, up 73.3 percent from the previous year. From 2006 through 2009, the growth rate of the country's installed wind-energy capacity averaged 113 percent.

""We are seeing consolidation in the onshore market and hopefully we will gain even more market share in the process, "" Miranda said.

Growth in the onshore wind power sector will slow due to tightening financing, and a switch of focus to quality, he said.

Seeing itself as more than just a wind turbine maker, Gamesa is also looking at the wind farm business and has more than 2,900 mW of capacity in the pipeline to be developed in China.

1242,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Unravelling the urban flood - Pakistan - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1577689,"Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation.

Every year, natural disasters claim around 90,000 lives and affect more than 150 million around the world. Among these, floods pose the most intense threat to lives and livelihoods, bludgeoning communities large and small, and inundating large swathes of land across borders. Between 1998 and 2017, floods affected nearly a third of the global population, or 2 billion people worldwide. Beyond the obvious impact on infrastructure and utilities, flooding is a harbinger of a multitude of long-term effects, including economic losses, loss of means of livelihood, ecological changes, and public health challenges.

Floods are the most damaging natural hazard in Pakistan with 26 major events having ravaged the country since 1950. The 2010 super flood alone affected 20 million people, and caused direct and indirect losses worth nearly $10 billion. Since then a major flood event occurred at least once each year, affecting millions more. In the past five years or so, urban flooding has gained a strong foothold in Pakistan, becoming almost synonymous with the monsoon season. It is becoming increasingly evident that current policy, planning, and implementation mechanisms for urban flood management are not effective within the context of climate change.

Emerging Climate Challenges

A growing body of research supported by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has established close linkages between climate change and disaster risk. Whilst climate change cannot be attributed directly to any one major disaster  for example, the urban flooding in Karachi  it does point to an alteration of the global atmosphere. These alterations, caused by human activities such as deforestation, increased use of fossil fuels, and other commercial and industrial practices, coupled with the likelihood of more extreme weather events in the future, are likely to increase the frequency and scale of disasters.

Also read: Early downpour exposes Karachis drainage flaws

The Global Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch analyses global extreme weather events and socio-economic impact. The 2019 CRI ranked Pakistan as the 8th most affected country when it comes to extreme weather events. The report went on to add that countries like.Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year. The same report placed India at the 14th spot in terms of impact of extreme weather events.

Between 80-90% of all documented natural disasters in the past decades have, on average, been a result of floods, heat waves, droughts, and storms.

Floods, in particular, are increasing in frequency and intensity, and extreme variations in precipitation are expected to contribute to flooding in areas that have historically remained immune.

A study by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Unescap) evaluated the high risk of floods and droughts during the monsoon season. The report pointed out that over eight million people would be exposed to flood risk in Pakistan this year alone.

High risk areas for floods in South Asia

The South Asian monsoon, characterised by concentrated rainfall between June and September, is the lifeline of the agricultural sector in the region, irrigating as much as 55% of cultivated land. Over the past few years, however, researchers have noticed wide temporal and spatial variations in monsoon rainfall. Erratic monsoon patterns have seen a shift of rainfall not only in geographical terms, but also onset and withdrawal. This has resulted in devastating floods throughout the region, claiming scores of lives.

Last week, at least 40 lives were lost as a result of urban flooding in Karachi. Massive cracks in the citys administrative and operational infrastructure surfaced with every conceivable flood hazard  from cars being swept away by rainwater to collapsing houses to electrocution and even landsliding  becoming a harsh reality. Whilst this does not undermine incidences of riverine and flash flooding throughout the rest of Pakistan, it does indicate that a new, rapid phenomenon in densely populated areas is taking shape: that of urban flooding.

Urban floods are a consequence of meteorological factors, such as intense precipitation, and human actions, such as land use change, occupation of flood plains, alteration of natural water courses, and inadequate drainage and sanitation infrastructure. As soon as precipitation exceeds the capacity of an urban areas drainage system which includes sewers, gutters, open channels, natural and manmade pathways to a receiving water body  urban flooding occurs. In the weeks leading up to perhaps what will historically be remembered as Pakistans biggest urban flood, it became abundantly clear that existing drainage channels were already operating below capacity. A combination of factors, including informal settlements driven by urbanisation, and poor solid waste management directly contributed to this loss of capacity.

More on this | What causes urban flooding? Hint: Its not just rain

Stripping away land cover and vegetation in the name of development to make way for buildings, roads, and bridges not only alters natural water flow channels; it also greatly diminishes water absorption and storage capacity of the soil. As a result, when precipitation runoff flows rapidly across the surface, in short, intense, high-volume bursts rather than sinking into the soil. Not only does this overload a citys drainage system, but considerably more rainwater ends up in sewers and directly flows off into water bodies, instead of recharging ground water sources. The obstruction of drainage systems, ditches, and other pathways by solid waste and refuse can block channels, causing the water to back up and spread laterally into commercial and residential areas. Many communities did not know that until they found water coursing through their houses, streets, and commercial buildings. Thus, a confluence of disorganised implementation of urban infrastructure such as bridges and embankments obstructing runoff, reduced drainage channel availability due to backfilling, deposition of sediments and refuse in canals and waterways, and archaic drainage and sanitation infrastructure, contributed to the devastation in Karachi.

Policymaking for urban flood management

A recent study in the United States on flood policy noted severe shortcomings in the ability to project the vulnerability of urban areas to flooding. Given high levels of uncertainty, policy-making for flood planning & response may be even more difficult and fraught than it already is. Vulnerability of urban systems increases as population density increases, and the effects are multiplied when flooding damages electrical, transportation, communication and other support systems.

Whilst the direct impact of urban flooding  such as inundation of streets and residences, losses and damages to property and vehicles, and destruction of infrastructure  are easily visible, it is the indirect impact that leaves longer lasting effects. For example, the public health threat as a result of untreated sewage or chemical runoff from industrial areas mixing with water sources; the loss of livelihoods for certain periods of time; and the inability to travel to work. Those on the lower end of the socio-economic scale will have a lower capacity to respond and recover, placing ever greater demands on existing social and community service mechanisms.

Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation. The losses in terms of property, productivity, livelihood, and quality of life demand a socioeconomic approach to flood risk management, one that focuses not just on rescue and relief, but also the rehabilitation of communities to the same or a better state that they were in before disaster struck. Future policies should thus address:

 The challenges posed by climate change

 The major economic, environmental, financial, political and social issues likely to impact urban development and urban flood management

 Ancillary payoffs (such as environmental, economic, or social) of pursuing adaptive strategies

Infrastructure management practices for urban flooding

Flooding is the most hazardous consequence of intense precipitation, and even small increases in precipitation can have inordinately large effects on the drainage system. Research based on actual events and simulations indicates that a 20 per cent increase in precipitation in a single event leads to a 365 per cent increase in flood volume and the number of at-risk buildings increases by 120 per cent.

Drainage and flood control infrastructure is largely designed based on 25-, 50- or 100-year flood frequencies, and historic trends. However, as is becoming increasingly evident, past history may no longer be a reliable guide to future events, especially in the context of urban flooding. Drainage systems, developed and built over decades, are only as good as the weakest connecting link. Decisions made during the scoping and early design stages, when urban sprawl and population were both limited, can have significant impact on outcomes few years down the road. Changes and modifications made at later stages are not always possible or cost effective, which makes both under-sizing and over-sizing of the infrastructure equally problematic: extensive damage in the first case; and excessive expenditures in the second.

Read further: What's it like to suffer from climate change in Pakistan?

Furthermore, focusing on technical and engineering issues in tackling flooding has become somewhat of a national trend, which discounts the influence of social characteristics and circumstances. This bias can actually encourage development in areas where hazard risk may surpass technological solutions. Similarly, efforts to manage urban floods by focusing on the flow and its transit elsewhere, akin to following the Out of Sight, Out of Mind approach, dont solve the problem but merely shift it  usually to low income areas.

Uncontrolled development of informal settlements

In recent years, Pakistan, like many developing nations has witnessed massive in-migration (movement of people within the country). The 2019 Migration Snapshot published by the UNs International Organisation for Migration (IOM) notes that nearly 13% of the Pakistani population comprises of internal migrants. Internal migration in Pakistan is usually undertaken by low skilled workers who move from the rural districts to urban areas due to marriage, family ties, and economic opportunities. A number of socioeconomic factors are at play here, but what is key is the emergence of new settlements in and around cities. These areas, characterized by population highly concentrated in a (relatively) small area runs well ahead of the planning and construction of infrastructure to cope with it.

It would be remiss not to point out that the deleterious effects of degraded environmental conditions have the most (though not exclusive) impact on low income settlements, including katchi abadis or shanties. Built atop slopes, drainage channels, and waterways subject to flash floods, these dwellings are put together with substandard materials in areas with poor or overloaded water and waste disposal systems. Residents of these settlements may fill natural drainage channels with dwellings or waste materials, preventing normal rainwater flow and causing the water to spread out into the residential area. Pathways and (unpaved) streets are usually impervious, affording no means for absorption of precipitation, but rather providing a free passage of precipitation and flood water into homes, buildings, and commercial establishments. As these settlements are not planned or subject to land use restrictions or whatever building codes that may or may not exist, the effects of a severe natural disaster can be greatly magnified.

Conclusion

Climate change will impact future city growth, planning and development. By 2030, at least 61% of the worlds population will be living in cities. In developing nations, cities will become home to nearly four billion residents, or a whopping 80 per cent of the global urban population. Consequently, what was once dispersed rural poverty will now be concentrated in urban informal and squatter settlements. It is not really possible to control or totally eliminate floods, and policy planners and practitioners should concentrate instead on enhancing the resilience of the population to flood risks through a combination of engineering techniques coupled with and social, economic and administrative measures. In so doing, they must work within the framework of Integrated Flood Management so as to meet the larger issues of effectiveness, socioeconomic equity, and long-term positive outcomes. This can be achieved, in part by:

 Integrating land and water management;

 Ensuring a participatory community-level approach;

 Adopting integrated hazard management approaches;

 Adopting a combination of economic, legislative, policy-based, and sociological measures to move from traditional flood control towards flood management;

 Synchronisation with the national development agenda, including measures such as the Ehsaas programme, the Green Pakistan initiative, setting up effective local governments and other poverty alleviation and social uplifting schemes;

 It must also accommodate integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) practices

The aforementioned steps can be proactively implemented in incremental stages with ad hoc tactical adjustments made as events and situations unfold. The uncertainty inherent in climate change projections means that risk-centred approaches and risk-based analysis (including cost-benefit analysis) are no longer as useful or robust as they have been. The past may no longer be a reliable guide to the future when it comes to urban flood management. The combination of climate change, increasing urbanisation, demands for housing and industrial land (often in the floodplain), economic development and rising expectations cannot be discounted in urban flood management. Rather than focusing on any one of these issues, it will be necessary to combine them  and their many stakeholders  into a comprehensive planning process for increasing adaptation and enhancing community resilience.",2020-08-31 07:00:00+00:00,"['management', 'water', 'precipitation', 'flooding', 'unravelling', 'flood', 'urban', 'floods', 'impact', 'drainage', 'areas']",Pakistan,news article,English
1453,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Major floods increased in temperate climates but decreased elsewhere - Phys.org,https://phys.org/news/2021-03-major-temperate-climates-decreased.html,"Credit: CC0 Public Domain

Severe river floods are escalating in temperate climates and putting at risk populations, livelihoods and property, according to evidence published today in Geophysical Research Letters by an Oxford-led international team.

The first global examination of recent changes in the size, frequency, and probability of extreme river floods using historical river records, the paper shows that dangers of extreme river flooding demand close monitoring of rivers for decades to come, to understand and account for the potential impact of such changes.

Dr. Louise Slater, the main author and Oxford expert in flood risks, warns, ""Our work shows the magnitude and frequency of floods are changing substantially in different climates of the globe. Flood maps need to be regularly updated to keep up with these changes and protect people and their livelihoods.""

She maintains, ""These changes cannot be ignored. We need to keep monitoring our rivers because long-term records are necessary to understand and communicate how major floods are changing relative to the past.""'

Using historic recorded magnitudes of river flow, the team found that overall, floods have mostly decreased at the global scale. In arid, tropical, polar, and cold climate zones, 20-year floods decreased between −33% and −12% on average since the 1970s. This was most visible in regions such as north eastern Brazil, eastern Europe, parts of western US and parts of northern China.

The team suggests these decreases may be caused by a range of factors such as flood control measures, climate changes and decreasing soil moisture, where drier antecedent conditions offset flood magnitudes (due to increasing temperatures, decreasing rainfall, or groundwater depletion).

By contrast, the size of 20-year river floods increased by 22% on average since the 1970s in temperate climate zones such as Atlantic-facing Europe, south eastern Brazil, and south eastern China. According to the team, it is likely some of these increases result from climate change and variability, but no direct link was drawn within the research paper.

In temperate countries, it is not just the size of major river floods that is increasing. The paper shows that major floods have also been occurring more frequently, which is why it is essential to maintain up-to-date flood risk mapping.

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) in Vietnam and local peoples generosity. Luu Thi Phuong , 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children, she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDPs 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam, she said.However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last years floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life, he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households, said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing. At least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or collapsed./.",2021-05-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'receive', 'storms', 'nam', 'quang', 'residents', 'undp', 'nams', 'central', 'support', 'house', 'houses', 'safe']",Vietnam,news article,English
814,FL-2016-000114-EGY,GERD to collapse within years: int'l dam expert - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/gerd-to-collapse-within-years-intl-dam-expert/,"Ex-head of the Water Resources Research Center and international dam expert Ahmed Al-Shennawi has predicted the collapse of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) after a few years of its operation.

In statements to Al-Masry Al-Youm (AMAY) on Wednesday, Shennawi explained his prediction, saying, “The dam was built on active earth cracks, meaning the area is prone to constant earthquakes; one of those will definitely lead to the collapse of the entire building.”

“Parts of GERD have already collapsed twice in the past, once in 2016 and the other in August this year. This proves that the dam is short-lived and will collapse when an imminent earthquake strikes,” he added.

As for the extent of the Ethiopian government’s knowledge of these threats, Shennawi told AMAY that “Tal Aviv Company, which is responsible for generating electricity (from the dam), know this well, since they operate with a short-term, as well as a long-term, strategy.”

He added, “The floods that hit Sudan a few months ago, killing at least a thousand people, were caused by the partial collapse of the GERD due to being hit by an earthquake, which lead to the breaking of several of the dam’s gates and the water rushing out to Sudan, which is only 15 kilometers away.” Therefore, he concluded that these “floods” were not floods at all, “but water sliding from Ethiopia after the partial collapse of the new dam,” he concluded.

As to the extent of the Egyptian government’s knowledge of the dangers and likelihood of the dam’s collapse, Shennawi said he was not sure; however, he added, “There are strong indicators pointing to a divide inside the Ethiopian government itself, which is not being announced to the public to avoid public wrath.”

“The danger of GERD lies in the fact that it is 145 meters tall and holds a great amount of water, so if a collapse happens, the losses will be disastrous. Dams in general are supposed to be much shorter. That is why every time they have tried to fill more than 70 meters of the dam, a collapse happened,” Shennawi explained.

He concluded that the Egyptian government should sue Ethiopia internationally, “because the dam will collapse, exposing Egypt and Sudan to disasters that cannot be predicted,” adding that “Egypt should complain that it did not know that the dam was built on active earth cracks, which in itself is a huge disaster.”

Since the beginning of its construction in 2011, GERD has been a point of contention between Egypt and Ethiopia. Egypt, which currently has the lion’s share of the Nile water, believes Ethiopia’s pegged largest national project will affect its Nile water share, while Ethiopia insists it will not.

Since then, diplomatic talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have taken place on both presidential and ministerial levels. However, most diplomatic talks have not been fruitful.

Tensions mounted when the director of GERD was found dead in his car in July. This was followed by a different tone adopted by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who said that GERD “may never see the light of day” if delays with its execution continue.",2018-11-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['floods', 'egypt', 'water', 'ethiopia', 'collapse', 'sudan', 'ethiopian', 'intl', 'dam', 'shennawi', 'expert', 'gerd']",Egypt,news article,English
1137,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Farmajo in Kinshasa to attend Kenya-Somalia talks - Horn Observer,https://hornobserver.com/articles/822/Farmajo-in-Kinshasa-to-attend-Kenya-Somalia-talks,"



Reliable sources privy to the plan said DRC president, Felix Tshisekedi invited both Uhuru Kenya of Kenya and Farmajo to attend meeting in Kinshasa town. Talks will be brokered by Felix who is serving as the chairperson of African Union (AU).





Uhuru is expected to arrive in Kinshasa in the forthcoming hours.





The relations between Somalia and Kenya hit bottom after the horn of Africa nation withdrew its diplomats from Kenya and expelled Kenyan diplomats from Mogadishu.







Somalia accused Kenya of frequent violation of Mogadishu's sovereignty, a claim dismissed by Kenyan authorities.





The decision by Somalia influenced by Kenya’s invitation to Somaliland president Muse Bihi Abdi who arrived in Nairobi last December and inked cooperation agreement with President Uhuru. However, the Somali government insists that Somaliland is part of its territory.





Both Somalia and Kenya are also contesting ownership of a triangular territory measuring 100,000km2 in the Indian Ocean boundary.





Somalia went to International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2014 following what it termed as failure to settle the matter with her neighbour, Kenya bilaterally.





The court had concluded the hearing of the maritime border dispute between Somalia and Kenya and is expected to release its verdict.





The verdict of the court is final and not subject to appeal.

KINSHASA (HORN OBSERVER) - Somalia's isolated president Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo has travelled to Kinshasa, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to hold talks with Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta over their diplomatic ties severed.",2021-04-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['attend', 'kinshasa', 'kenya', 'court', 'kenyan', 'president', 'somaliland', 'kenyas', 'farmajo', 'talks', 'uhuru', 'somalia', 'kenyasomalia']",Kenya,news article,English
